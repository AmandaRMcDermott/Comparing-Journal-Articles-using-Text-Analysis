"1","Two common usages of interdependence pervade the literature: “sensitivity interdependence” reflects the mutual effects of a relationship, and “vulnerability interdependence” is the opportunity cost of disrupting it (Baldwin 1980, 486–97; Keohane and Nye 1977, 11–19).         "
"2","A review of the literature on international interdependence is beyond the scope of this study.1 This literature has made important contributions to our understanding of world politics. Yet, it is marred by several problems.         "
"3","                        "
"4"," Interdependence as trade relations. Most studies equate interdependence with trade relations. Conceptual discussions pay lip service to other forms of interdependence (e.g., Baldwin 1980, 481–83; Keohane and Nye 1977, 9–10, 11–13); few empirical studies conceptualize and estimate other forms of interdependence. Yet, the nature and implications of changes in the international system require studying different forms of exchange relations.                  "
"5"," Disintegrated interdependence. International interdependence may be multidimensional: economic interdependence may be reinforced or offset by strategic or institutional ties. Unfortunately, there exists little research conceptualizing integrated interdependence in world politics.2"
"6"," Interdependence as dyadic relations. Major theories hypothesize about the effects of interdependence at various levels of analysis. Political theorists (e.g., Rousseau, Adam Smith, Comte, Kant) speculated about the effects of systemic interdependence on world peace. Realist conceptions about the effects of strategic interdependence are framed in systemic terms. Yet most empirical investigations center on the dyadic effects of interdependence on conflict. We do not know whether relations between interdependence and conflict are generalizable from the dyadic to other levels of analysis.                  "
"7"," First‐order interdependence. Most studies of interdependence and conflict focus on direct ties. However, interdependence may reflect both direct and indirect relations. A system is interdependent if a change in state A that is tied to state B, which is tied to state C, causes a noticeable change in C, even though A and C do not have a direct relationship. Focusing only on direct ties ignores an enormously important feature of interdependence.                  "
"8","To overcome these problems, we need a general framework that (a) conceptualizes and measures interdependence across different relationships and across different levels of analysis, (b) captures both direct and indirect relations, and (c) allows for a multidimensional and integrative assessment of the effects of interdependence on conflict and cooperation. Before discussing this framework, I explore the linkages between dependence, interdependence, and international conflict in different paradigms of world politics."
"9","Ideas about interdependence and conflict date back to Machiavelli and Rousseau. Liberal hypotheses on these matters can be traced back to Adam Smith, Comte, and Kant. Neo‐Marxists focus on the economic and political implications of structural dependence.3"
"10","At the outset it must be stated that the relationship between interdependence and conflict may be recursive: interdependence may affect conflict, but conflict may have an effect on interdependence across different relationships and at different levels. This study explores only the effect of interdependence on conflict because that has been the focus in the literature over the last two decades and due to the mixed empirical results on this matter. Subsequent research will explore possible recursive effects.4"
"11","Alliances represent arguably the single most important expression of interdependence in political realism. Realists view alliances as a necessary evil, a means of safeguarding one's security that comes at a price of reduced autonomy (Mearsheimer 1994/5, 13; Morrow 1991; Walt 1987). Machiavelli argues that “a prince must beware never to associate himself with someone more powerful than himself so as to attack [offend] others, except when necessity presses … For when you win, you are left his prisoner, and princes should avoid as much as they can being at the discretion of others” ([1541] 1985, 90; italics added).            "
"12","For Rousseau, strategic interdependence implies that even “the most frail man has more force for his own preservation than the most robust State has for its” ([1754] 2005, 68). Interdependence is the source of security dilemmas (Hoffmann 1965, 62–63; Knutsen 1994, 250–53), and thus a key cause of conflict. World peace can exist only under “the ideal world of small, self‐sufficient, self‐centered states governed by the general will” (Hoffmann 1965, 80), that is, only in a world composed of self‐contained units avoiding contact with each other.            "
"13","Neorealists (e.g., Mearsheimer 2001; Waltz 1979) concur. In an anarchic world where contact is unavoidable, the greater the level of strategic interdependence, the more likely is the potential of conflict to be converted into an actual reality of conflict.            "
"14","What does this logic imply for the behavior of individual states? Strategic interdependence of a state is typically a function of its alliance commitments. Alliances increase security through the pooling of resources. But they render members' choices contingent on their allies' choices or the actions of the allies' enemies (Maoz 2000, 113; Morrow 2000, 65; Snyder 1997).            "
"15","Two seemingly contradictory mechanisms suggest that strategic interdependence has a positive effect on war (Christensen and Snyder 1990). Buck‐passing—failure of states to deter an aggressor in the hope that their alliance members would do so—tends to encourage aggression. Chain ganging induces escalation because states are drawn into conflict by their allies. Empirical studies support this argument (Colaresi and Thompson 2005; Siverson and King 1979).            "
"16","Realists argue that strategic interdependence increases the likelihood of conflict at both the monadic and systemic levels of analysis. Yet they also suggest that strategic interdependence reduces the likelihood of dyadic conflict. States form alliances because they have common enemies (Farber and Gowa 1995, 1997; Maoz et al. 2006, 2007; Mearsheimer 1994/5, 13). This reduces pressure for conflict between allies. Empirical findings on this proposition are mixed.5"
"17","Realists dismiss liberal notions about the trade‐peace linkages. As long as strategic interests demand, states would clash with each other even at the price of disrupting trade. England and France traded with Germany, yet this did not prevent them from fighting two world wars. Nor did Japanese trade dependence on the United States deter it from attacking it.6"
"18","The liberal paradigm regards both strategic and economic interdependence as a good thing. Although Keohane and Nye discuss arms races as an example of “bad interdependence” (1977, 8–9), this is done in passing. Most liberal theorizing on interdependence and conflict is focused on economic ties. However, liberal institutionalist ideas allow inferences about the effects of strategic interdependence on conflict and cooperation.            "
"19","Strategic interdependence is more than a common capability pool. Alliances are institutions that reduce uncertainty and manage distributional issues (Keohane and Martin 1995). Strategically interdependent states are unlikely to engage in conflict due to their increased security and ability to deter aggression (Kegley and Raymond 1982). Finally, as strategic interdependence in the international system increases, the incentives for conflict decline.7"
"20","Liberal scholars tie economic interdependence to rational positivism and peace. “[T]he international operation of the industrial spirit is as remarkable as any part of its actions … Whatever may have been the original effect of the military spirit in extending human association, it not only had then completely exhausted, but it could never have been comparable to the industrial spirit in admitting the total assimilation of the human race” (Comte [1854] 2000, 181–82).            "
"21","The effect of economic interdependence on peace extends from the state to the system. States are reluctant to initiate conflict against enemies with whom they do not have direct trade ties because the uncertainty and instability associated with conflict may cause their trading partners to look for other markets, thus adding an indirect cost to the direct cost of conflict (Crescenzi 2005; Gasiorowski 1986; Gasiorowski and Polacheck 1982; Polacheck 1980, 1997; Russett and Oneal 2001). Global interdependence increases coordination, cooperation, transparency, and trust, thereby reducing global levels of conflict.            "
"22"," Table 1 summarizes the hypotheses of these paradigms. The realist paradigm posits a complex cross‐level relationship between interdependence and conflict. Strategic interdependence is expected to reduce the likelihood of dyadic conflict, yet it challenges third parties, thereby raising the likelihood of conflict between dyad members and third parties (Maoz 2000). Increased strategic interdependence in the system is associated with high polarization, and thus with interbloc conflict. Economic interdependence has little effect on international conflict across levels of analysis (Barbieri 2002, 37–38).            "
"23","The liberal paradigm expects both strategic and economic interdependence to reduce the frequency of monadic, dyadic, and systemic conflict. Thus, integrated interdependence—a combination of strategic and economic ties—is also expected to dampen down conflict. Realists, on the other hand, do not expect such integrative interdependence to have a significant effect on conflict behavior."
"24","This discussion suggests that the relationship between interdependence and conflict is more nuanced than we have been led to believe. I now turn to a network analytic conceptualization of dependence and interdependence."
"25","The generalized approach to interdependence relies on Social Network Analysis (SNA). A network is a set of nodes (people, institutions, states) and a rule that defines whether and how any two nodes are tied to each other (Wasserman and Faust 1997, 20; Watts 2003, 27). This rule may be a statement such as “lives next to,”“is a friend of,” or—in an IR context—“is allied with,”“trades with,” etc. Ties may be binary (yes/no), ordinal (level of alliance commitment), or ratio‐level (proportion of GDP exported); symmetric (i.e., ties between i and j equal those between j and i) or asymmetric.         "
"26","Conceptually, an actor i is dependent on another actor j when a change in j causes a meaningful change in i, and if i incurs some cost once the tie with j is broken. Accordingly, interdependence implies reciprocal dependence—a change in j affects changes in i and a change in i affects changes in j, and both actors bear some cost for disrupting this relationship. These are fundamentally dyadic definitions, but they can be extended to other levels of analysis.         "
"27"," Dyadic Dependence has two dimensions: scope and extent. The extent of dependence reflects the magnitude of change in an actor caused by a unit change in another actor, and the opportunity cost of disrupting this relationship. Scope reflects the number of dimensions of dependence relations between actors. If two states trade with each other, are allied, and are members of the UN Security Council, then military, political, or economic changes in one state affect the security, status, and well‐being of the other. If states only trade with each other but do not share alliance ties, then changes in military policy of one will not directly affect the other. Given a single direct relationship ρ, the dependence of state i on state j is defined as:            "
"28","Interdependence can be measured across a number of relationships (e.g., commodities, alliances, IGO memberships). Define the set of relationships as ℜ=[ρ1, ρ2, … , ρm]. The single relationship measure of dependence can now be generalized as:            "
"29","Extending this conception to a system of n units, define a square matrix Sρ of order n as a network in which sij denotes the presence or magnitude of relationship (ρ) between units i and j. Matrix Bρ and vector OCρ reflect, respectively, the sensitivity and opportunity cost parameters. We obtain matrix D1ρ as an elementwise (°) product of the three matrices such that,            "
"30","Thus, d1ij|ρ denotes the dependence of i on j in terms of relationship ρ(d1ij|ρ≠ d1ji|ρ). Across a set of relationships ℜ, the matrix operation of integrated dependence is given by:            "
"31","We can now measure the dyadic dependence balance as:             "
"32","The dyadic dependence balance reflects the difference between the dependence of j on i as a proportion of the total dyadic dependence and the degree of the focal actor's self‐reliance. This particular measure differentiates between dyads that are highly dependent on each other relative to their self‐reliance and those that have ties with each other but level of reliance on each other is low given their level of self‐reliance. Note that this measure does not, however, differentiate between low balances due to relative independence (i.e., low but equal values of dij and dji) and low balances that are due to high interdependence but equal dependence (i.e., high but equal values of dij and dji). This reflects a common problem of balance‐related measures (and applies to trade balances as well). I now discuss indirect interdependence.         "
"33"," Indirect Interdependence. Suppose state i imports tanks from state j and state j imports steel from state q for its tank factories. If q's steel exports to state j fall, j can sell fewer tanks to state i. Likewise, suppose state i has only one ally, j who has low capabilities. Thus, i's strategic dependence is relatively low. Yet j is allied with powerful state q. An attack on i may result in the joining of both j and q. Thus, i has an indirect strategic dependence on q due to the latter's alliance with j."
"34","To illustrate this distinction between direct and indirect interdependence, consider a trade network T and an alliance network A (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).         "
"35","                 Direct and Indirect Dependence in Two Hypothetical Networks                      "
"36","Circles represent states; arrows reflect directional dependence, and numbers measure the extent of dependence. In the trade network, some relationships are reciprocal (A and B depend on each other's trade, albeit at different levels), and some are unidirectional (D and F depend on E but not vice versa). Alliance ties are reciprocal, though the extent of strategic dependence of one state on another is not the same for both states.         "
"37","Now, consider the difference between direct and indirect dependence. State B's direct trade dependence on A is 0.4 and A's trade dependence on B is 0.1. B's alliance dependence on A is 0.3 and A's alliance dependence on B is 0.2. While A does not have a direct trade relationship with C, C exerts an indirect influence on A because it exports to B who then, in turn, exports to A. This is second‐order dependence between A and C. Likewise, in the alliance network, A and C are indirectly interdependent even though they do not have a direct alliance, because they have a common ally, B. Indirect interdependencies are discounted by the extent of “indirectness.” The trade dependence of A on C is the product of the dependence of B on C and of A on B, that is, d2AC|T=d1BC|T×d1AB|T= 0.7 × 0.1 = 0.07. Likewise, A's alliance dependence on C is d2AC|T=d1BC|A×d1AB|T= 0.7 × 0.1 = 0.07."
"38","Define a rth order dependence matrix as Dr=∏rD1 . Thus, D2=D1×D1 reflects the second‐order dependence of actors in the system (d2ij reflects the dependence of i on j due to the dependence of i on k and k's dependence on j), D3=D1×D1×D1, and so forth.10 Direct and indirect dependence are measured via the reachability matrix R, which we label  (for dependence):            "
"39","The entries in this matrix  reflect the total dependence of unit i on unit j based on both direct relations between these units and their indirect relations due to their ties to other units in the network. This matrix serves as the foundation for calculating dependence and interdependence at the monadic, dyadic, and systemic levels of analysis. At the dyadic level we use the same dyadic measures of dependence and interdependence discussed above (equations (3–6), dropping the superscript). We now proceed to the monadic level of analysis.         "
"40"," Monadic Dependence. There are two measures of monadic dependence: ondependence and outdependence. Ondependence reflects the extent and scope of a state's dependence on other actors in the system. Outdependence reflects the extent to which other actors in the system depend on a given state. As is customary in Social Networks Analysis, measures are standardized as a ratio of the actual value to a maximum possible value. Define the maximum level of dyadic dependence between any two units as k. If a single unit were dependent on all other units in the system, the maximum level of direct dependence for a system of n units would be k (n− 1). Given the definition of the reachability matrix , the maximum level of dependence assuming a certain order of indirectness, m (m =2 , … , n− 1) is given by the geometric series:            "
"41","Accordingly, on and out dependence are defined as the actual level of (direct and indirect) dependence divided by this maximum. This is given by:             "
"42","The monadic dependence balance, similar to dyadic dependence balance, reflects the difference between the dependence of other actors on the focal actor and the dependence of the focal actor on others. It is defined as dbi= (outdi− ondi)/(outdi+ ondi+ dii). This index has similar properties to the dyadic dependence balance discussed above.         "
"43"," Monadic Interdependence. A typical example of this concept in the trade literature is trade openness—trade divided by GDP (Gartzke and Li 2003a; Heston, Summers, and Aten 2002). Barbieri (2002, 58–59), Crescenzi (2005, 121–22), and Oneal and Russett (2005) used trade openness as a proxy of trade interdependence. I employ a variation of this measure to tap a more general measure of monadic interdependence beyond the trade context. Monadic interdependence is the share of a state's resources that is due to its relations with others. Specifically,            "
"44","This index is preferable to the dependence balance as a measure of monadic interdependence. States are fully autonomous only when their assets on the variable in question depend solely on internal resources. The maximal value of intdi approaches one when a state's resources are a small fraction of its out and on dependence.         "
"45"," Systemic Interdependence. Systemic interdependence is the ripple effect that a change in any actor engenders in the system as a whole. Operationally, it is expressed as a ratio of actual systemic interdependence to the maximally possible interdependence in the system.         "
"46","Maximum interdependence in a system with n units—given a maximum rate of dependence k between any pair of units—is obtained when any two units have a direct tie of level k. Thus, maximum direct interdependence in a system with n units is n2k. To reflect both direct and m‐order indirect relations between units in such a system we calculate the m‐order dependence/reachability matrix as:            "
"47","The measurement framework developed herein has some interesting properties."
"48","                        "
"49"," It is both specific and integrative. It allows measurement of dependence and interdependence on a single relationship or across several relationships.                  "
"50","It incorporates both direct and indirect interdependence."
"51","It is comprehensive. It allows measurement across levels of analysis with the same data."
"52","It combines sensitivity and vulnerability interdependence. This resolves most of the conceptual problems discussed in the second section."
"53","It allows measurement of different types of monadic dependence (e.g., on and out dependence) and differentiates dependencies in the same dyad (i.e., dij|k≠dji|k).                  "
"54","The transformation of interdependence from one level of analysis to another is not a simple linear aggregation of units' characteristics. Systemic interdependence reflects a ratio between the actual interdependencies of dyads (including indirect self‐dependence) and some theoretically derived maximum."
"55","There are also some problems with the current index."
"56","                        "
"57"," Complexity. These measures require complex data on the nature and direction of relations between states (e.g., opportunity cost and sensitivity parameters). Even for a single relationship—such as trade—the complexity of data management operations is enormous.                  "
"58"," Multiple operationalizations. There is no single best operational procedure to estimate opportunity costs and sensitivity across relationships. I demonstrate this below.                  "
"59"," Missing data problems. For monadic and systemic measures of interdependence, data need to be complete. This imposes considerable complications on measurement. At the dyadic level, however, we can restrict our analysis to valid data only.                  "

"70"," Units of Analysis. The monadic unit of analysis is the nation‐year. The dyadic units of analysis are the directed dyad‐year (MID initiation) and the nondirected dyad‐year (MID and war occurrence). The systemic unit of analysis is a system‐year.            "
"71"," Measurement of Dependent Variables:               International Conflict. At the monadic level NATMIDt is set to one if a state was involved in at least one dyadic MID at year t and zero otherwise. NATWARt is set to one if the state was involved in at least one war.12 NATINIT equals one if the focal state initiated at least one MID at year t. At the dyadic level MIDijt receives a score of one if state i initiated a MID against state j at year t, and zero otherwise (MIDijt≠ MIDjit). For nondirected dyads, DYDMIDt, DYDWARt are set to one if states i and j engaged in at least one MID (War) at year t. ESCALAT is defined as zero for each MID that did not escalate to war, and 1 for a MID that escalated to war. At the systemic level, SYSMID/SYSWAR is the number of dyadic MIDs/Wars at a given year. DURATION is the number of MID days in the international system per year.            "
"72"," Independent Variables. A hypothetical example of strategic interdependence demonstrates the measurement process of interdependence across levels of analysis. Assume a system of six states, some of which have formal alliances of various types with each other. Each alliance type has a reliability score—the probability that a state would aid its ally in the event of a violent conflict with a third party—as follows:13"
"73","Any two states can have several alliance types simultaneously, hence the commitment score is the sum of actual alliance commitments as a proportion of the total possible sum of alliance commitments that states can have. This is given by:                "
"74"," Table 2 provides an example of the alliance matrix (A) of the six‐state international system. Each entry in matrix 2.1 reflects the extent of commitment of state i toward state j (aij= aji∀i, j ∈A). Diagonal entries reflect self‐dependence. The extent to which a state depends on its ally is a function of the ally's contribution to the common pool of capabilities formed by the alliance treaty. A state that brings a great deal of capability to the common pool adds significantly to its allies' security, thus engendering high dependence. This is the sensitivity parameter βji|A. The capabilities of these six states are given by matrix C (Table 2.2).            "
"75","Following the definitions of dependence and interdependence in the previous section, sensitivity dependence is a function of both the capabilities that the other state brings to the common pool and of the strength of alliance commitments. This is given by Matrix D1sa=C×A, (Table 2.3). Each cell d1ij|sa reflects the extent to which state i depends on j given j's commitment level and its capabilities. Note that while matrix A is symmetric, matrix D1sa is not. This is so because the dependence of state i on j', given each state's sensitivity parameter, is not the same as the dependence of j on i."
"76","The opportunity cost of an alliance depends on how much security each state would lose if a given alliance were terminated. To do that, we define the Strategic Reference Group (SRG) of a given state. The SRG is a refinement of the Politically Relevant International Environment (PRIE) concept, which includes all directly or indirectly contiguous states, all regional powers in its region, and all major powers with global reach capacity (Maoz 1996, 139). The SRG of a given state is a subset of the state's PRIE that consists of:            "
"77","                              "
"78","All members of the PRIE with whom the focal state had a MID over the past five‐year period (i.e., past enemies in the state's PRIE)."
"79","All strategic rivals of the state that do not meet the previous condition.14"
"80","All allies of the states in 1 and 2 (the allies of one's enemies; Maoz et al. 2007).                     "
"81","Thus, the SRG consists of states that may have the opportunity and will to threaten or attack the focal state (Siverson and Starr 1991).15 In order to define the opportunity cost for a state i, we sum the capabilities of all states in its SRG. This measures the magnitude of the security challenge that a state faces at a given time. The opportunity cost for that state is defined as:               "
"82","Thus, the opportunity cost of an alliance partner is a complement of the ratio of the state's capability to the capability of its SRG; the lower this ratio, the less secure is the state, and thus the higher the opportunity cost of an alliance. States whose capabilities exceed the capabilities of their SRG do not need allies to balance against their enemies and the allies of their enemies, bearing no opportunity cost for the breakup of alliances."
"83","In the SRG network (Table 2.4) entry srgij= 1 means that state j is in the SRG of state i (srgij= srgji by definition). The opportunity cost matrix OC (matrix 2.5) is the product of the SRG matrix and the capability matrix (SRG×C), with ocij denoting the capabilities of column state j that is in the SRG of row state i. The next‐to‐right‐hand column is the summed capabilities of the SRG of each row state. The rightmost column is the opportunity cost of alliances for each row state (oci= 1 −capi/ΣSRGi). With the exception of state d (whose capabilities are exactly equal to the capabilities of its SRG), all states have some level of strategic opportunity cost, meaning that they cannot balance the capabilities of their SRG without pooling capabilities with other states.            "
"84","We convert the rightmost column of the OC matrix into a column vector and multiply it elementwise by the first‐order sensitivity dependence matrix (Table 2.3). The result is the first‐order strategic dependence matrix, D1A 2.6, in which entry d1ij|A reflects the strategic dependence of state i on state j, given i's sensitivity changes in state j, as well as i's opportunity cost of disrupting the alliance. The rightmost column and the bottom row represent the first‐order ondependence and outdependence scores, respectively.            "
"85","Matrix 2.7 reflects the final—direct and indirect—dependency scores. Its entries are just slightly larger than those of Matrix 2.6, meaning that indirect dependence is not substantially higher than direct dependence. But this is not the general case. Note, however, that while a and e are not directly dependent (row a and column e in Matrix 2.6), they do have some level of indirect dependence due to their alliance with state b. Looking only at direct dependencies may yield biased inferences about strategic dependence.            "
"86","Matrix 2.7 displays levels of dependence and interdependence in the system. Diagonal elements measure self‐dependence of each state. This is equal to the state's capabilities. These are not discounted by sensitivity (because each unit change in state i has a unit effect on itself), nor are they discounted by opportunity cost. The rightmost column and the bottom row of Table 2.7 reflect ondependence and outdependence scores, respectively. Finally, systemic interdependence (sysin) is given by the bottom‐right cell.            "
"87"," Table 2.8 displays the dependence balance and the monadic interdependence score of these six states. Note that states b, c, and f have a negative dependence balance, meaning that they depend on other states more than others depend on them. State f is the most interdependent because the total commitments it has from other states or its commitments to other states relative to its capabilities are the highest among this group.            "
"88","Matrices 2.7 and 2.8 offer a cross‐level image of strategic interdependence. The entries of DA are dyadic dependence scores (dij|A, dji|A), the marginal rows and columns provide the outdependence and ondependence scores (outdi, ondi), respectively. Finally, the level of strategic interdependence in the international system (sysin) is given by the bottom‐right cell of Matrix 2.7. Table 2.8 completes the monadic dependence and interdependence scores.            "
"89"," Trade Dependence/Interdependence. The heated debate about the best measures of economic dependence and interdependence (e.g., Barbieri 2002, 53–62; Barbieri and Peters 2003; Crescenzi 2005, 119–23; Gartzke and Li 2003a, 2003b; Oneal 2003; Russet and Oneal 2001, 138–45) results in significant empirical and conceptual disarray. Mansfield and Pollins note that “[c]alls for better measures of interdependence are hardly new… .But relatively little has been done to heed such calls and the need for better measures of interdependence is pressing if we are to resolve debates over the relationship between interdependence and conflict” (2001, 15–16). The social networks framework offers a significant contribution in this respect, whether we use trade data, monetary flow data (Gartzke, Lee, and Bohemer 2001), foreign direct investment (Souva and Prins 2006), or preferential trade agreements (Mansfield and Pevehouse 2000, 2003).            "
"90","The measure of trade dependence is based on equation (1) above where ℜ[ρ1, ρ2, … , ρk] is a set of commodities, βji|ρ is the proportion of i's imports from state j on commodity ρk, and oci|ρ is the complement of the elasticity of demand for commodity ρk (Crescenzi 2005, 119–20). The trade matrix  reflects the weighted (by opportunity cost and sensitivity) aggregate of all commodities exported by state i to state j. While mathematically straightforward, this operation is extremely complex because the generation of trade elasticity by commodity is inordinately tedious.16 Therefore, I focus on sensitivity interdependence. I define trade dependence as:               "
"91","As a robustness check, I use the import elasticity data from Kee, Nicita, and Olarreaga (2008), who estimate import demand elasticities for over 7,000 goods across 117 states. Unfortunately, these estimates do not vary over time, as they are based on average prices over the entire temporal span (1982–2000). I use their sample to measure dyadic trade dependence as:               "
"92"," Treatment of Missing Data. Since the measurement of monadic and systemic interdependence requires completely filled matrices, missing data represent a problem. With the alliance and capability data used to generate strategic interdependence indices, the problem of missing data is negligible. There are no missing values in the alliance dataset, and the capability dataset contains less than 1.7% missing data. The trade datasets present a significant problem, however. The Oneal‐Russett trade dataset contains roughly 16% missing data. The Barbieri, Keshk, and Pollins (BKP) dataset contains nearly 49% missing data. I used three methods to deal with missing data. First, I assigned missing data a score of zero, under the assumption that trade levels between states with missing data are negligible. Second, I used the Honaker and King (2007) multiple imputation method for time‐series cross‐section data, and the AMELIA software (Honaker, King, and Blackwell 2006) to replace missing data for the BKP dataset. Third, I replicated the dyadic analyses using valid data only for the BKP trade data. Results reported herein are based on the first method and the Oneal‐Russet dataset. The replication website (http://psfaculty.ucdavis.edu/zmaoz/datasets.htm) contains results with data obtained via the two other methods of treating missing values.            "
"93"," Number of States in the SRG. This defines the extent of strategic challenges to the focal state's security and is expected to exert a significant impact on the state's propensity for conflict. At the dyadic level I use the smallest number of SRG members in the dyad (Maoz 2007).            "
"94"," Capability Concentration Index (Maoz 2006) is used in the systemic analyses.            "
"95"," Regime Score. REGIME = (DEMOC‐AUTOC)× CONCEN (Maoz and Russett 1993), where DEMOC and AUTOC are the POLITY IV democracy and autocracy scores, respectively, and CONCEN is the power concentration score. At the dyadic level I use the lowest regime score of dyad members (MINREG). For the systemic level I use a variable entitled DEMCLQ, as defined by Maoz (2006). This measure is based on the network breakup of the international system into strategic reference cliques—each clique is a subset of states that are in each other's SRG. The proportion of democratic states in each clique is computed and averaged over all politically relevant cliques in the system at a given year.            "
"96"," Capability Ratio. This is the capability ratio of the strongest to weakest member of the dyad.            "
"97"," Contiguity. This is a binary measure (for contiguity) with one indicating that states are contiguous.            "
"98"," Estimation Methods. At the monadic and dyadic levels I use a set of simple logit models with cubic splines and years of peace (Beck, Katz, and Tucker 1998). For the systemic level I use an autoregressive Poisson model.            "
"99"," Table 3 displays the results of national conflict behavior.18 Both strategic and economic interdependence consistently dampen the propensity for MID initiation, MID, and war involvement. Integrated interdependence also has a dampening effect on conflict behavior. These results hold for the entire period as well as for the post‐WWII era. Also, the results for the economic interdependence index which employs the opportunity cost (elasticity) measure are consistent with the results that do not incorporate this index, suggesting that economic interdependence has a robust dampening effect on national conflict behavior.19 We now turn to the dyadic analysis.         "
"100","The results of Table 4 are less robust. Strategic interdependence in a dyad does not have a significant impact on the probability of MID initiation or MID outbreak, but it does reduce the probability of war or the probability of MID escalation. Economic interdependence consistently reduces the probability of dyadic conflict regardless of the dependent variable used. This is also true for the elasticity‐based measures of economic interdependence. Integrative interdependence also has a robust dampening effect on the probability of dyadic conflict.         "
"101","The systemic analyses are given in Table 5. Both strategic interdependence and economic interdependence significantly reduce the frequency of conflict in the system. These results are fairly robust across dependent variables and temporal breakdowns. The negative impact of economic interdependence on systemic conflict corroborates the results of Maoz (2006). However, the negative impact of strategic interdependence on systemic conflict stands in contradiction to Maoz's findings of a positive effect of strategic interdependence on conflict. This is possibly due to the difference in the measure of systemic interdependence. Integrated interdependence tends to consistently reduce the frequency of conflict, as the liberal model suggests.         "
"102","Taken as a whole, these results consistently support the liberal paradigm. At the same time, these results largely contradict the hypotheses of the realist paradigm (Table 1). The dampening impact of economic interdependence on conflict at the monadic, dyadic, and systemic level is robust and significant. This is so regardless of the data used to measure economic interdependence, and regardless of the method used to treat missing data. The impact of strategic interdependence on national, dyadic, or systemic patterns of conflict is less robust. However, when strategic interdependence is related to conflict, this relationship is consistent with the expectations of the liberal paradigm and inconsistent with the expectations of the realist paradigm. This impression is bolstered by the negative effect of integrative interdependence on conflict. The robust and consistently negative impact of economic interdependence on conflict across levels of analysis also raises questions about the realist dismissal of these effects. One may, of course, challenge the hypotheses I deduced from the realist paradigm with respect to the effect of strategic interdependence on national and systemic conflict. At any rate, this is a first attempt to systematically examine these relationships and require some theoretical reflection on their meaning within both realist and liberal conceptions of world politics.         "
"103","The analytical framework of this study opens a wider window into the relationship between interdependence and conflict than the extant literature on the subject has to offer. It is one of the few attempts to derive a set of hypotheses from leading paradigms of world politics regarding the relationship between strategic interdependence and conflict. It is also a pioneering effort to examine a more integrative concept of interdependence that incorporates strategic and economic dimensions into a single set of measures. Finally, it offers a cross level of analysis perspective on interdependence and conflict. The empirical analyses seem to support the expectations of the liberal paradigm, while raising questions about the empirical validity of the realist paradigm's explanations concerning the effects of both strategic and economic interdependence on international conflict."
"104","The current study opens up as many questions as those it attempts to answer. First, the current framework allows us to study the impact of dependence—uneven levels of interdependence—on conflict. Second, it raises questions about possible endogenous or simultaneous relationships between interdependence and conflict. Third, other dimensions of interdependence that feature prominently in the realist‐liberal debate—such as institutional interdependence—have yet to be investigated and their relationship to international conflict has to be explored. Taken together these questions seem to suggest that the present study is but a first step on a road toward a more detailed and complex inquiry of the relationships between different types of international dependence or interdependence and different forms of interstate interactions."
"105","Yet, as far as first steps go, the framework developed herein demonstrates the advantages of social networks analysis for the study of international politics. Clearly much more work is necessary here, but the present study offers a great deal of potentially useful tools, substantive ideas, and empirical results about an important and central aspect of evolving world politics."
