"1","There are two distinct public policies, x and y. A polity is partitioned into n (odd) electoral districts. In each district, there is a voter who represents the majority preference of the electorate over x and y. Let N = {1 , … , n} denote the set of voters or of districts.         "
"2","Each voter i's preference over the public policies is represented by a function ui: {x, y}→{0, 1}. I assume that voters in a majority of districts prefer x to y.

"3","In each district, there are two politicians: an incumbent representative (or legislator) and a challenger. Each politician's policy preference is characterized by her type θ∈Θ=[−1, 1]. Define a function U: {x, y}×Θ→Θ so that, for all θ∈Θ,            "
"4","I consider a two‐period Bayesian game in which the sequence of moves is as follows. (1) In the beginning of the first period, each incumbent's type is selected from Θ by a (cumulative) probability distribution F on Θ with a continuous density f. The n random draws are independent, and the selected type of each politician is revealed only to herself. The distribution is common knowledge. It is assumed that f is symmetric: for all θ∈Θ, f(θ) =f(−θ).4 (2) The (incumbent) representatives of all districts simultaneously vote between x and y in the legislature. An action of the representative of district i is denoted by ai∈{x, y}. Let a = (a1, … , an) denote a record of roll calls in the first period. The alternative that receives a majority of votes in the legislature becomes the chosen policy in the first period, denoted by z1. That is, z1=x if ; and z1=y otherwise. All players observe the roll‐call record a.5 (3) In the beginning of the second period, each challenger's type is randomly drawn and revealed only to herself. (4) A general election is held, where each voter decides either to reelect the incumbent or to elect the challenger. Formally, voter i chooses a ballot bi∈{0, 1}. If bi= 1, then the representative of i in the second period will be the incumbent; otherwise, it will be the challenger. All ballots are cast simultaneously. (5) Finally, there is another legislative session in which all elected legislators simultaneously vote between x and y. The alternative that receives a majority of votes becomes the outcome in the second period, denoted by z2.         "
"5","Voters only care about policy outcomes and do not care about their own representatives' roll‐call choices per se.6 Thus, voter i's payoff at any terminal node with policy outcomes (z1, z2) is            "
"6","At each terminal node and for each politician, we can identify a vector of payoff‐relevant information (θ, I, (z1, z2)), where θ∈Θ is the politician's type and I∈{0, 1} is an indicator of whether she is elected (1) in the election or not (0). The payoff of a politician from (θ, I, (z1, z2)) is            "
"7","Since the game involves multistage and incomplete information, a standard solution concept is perfect Bayesian equilibrium. I refine the concept in several ways to rule out implausible equilibria that may arise because of unreasonable beliefs at off‐paths or the absence of pivotal players in the voting stages. In the remainder of this section, I concentrate on explaining the main idea of my equilibrium concept. The formal definition in full detail is provided in the appendix. For convenience, I call the solution concept “equilibrium” without any qualifier.         "
"8","I first consider the legislative voting stage in the second period. Since the game ends with this stage, sincere voting will be optimal. I thus assume that if a politician's type θ is greater than or equal to zero, then she will vote for x; otherwise, she will vote for y. This strategy is the unique weakly dominant strategy with the additional assumption that indifferent legislators vote for x.7 Because this optimal strategy is transparent, I do not use mathematical notation to denote the legislators' strategies in the second period.         "
"9","I will now define strategies of the game formally. For each i∈N, let ℓi denote a legislative strategy for the incumbent ofi. It describes which alternative the incumbent representative of i would vote for in the first period depending on her type. In other words, it is a measurable mapping ℓi: Θ→{x, y}. Let ℓ= (ℓ1, … , ℓn) be a profile of legislative strategies. A voting strategy for voter i describes whether the voter elects an incumbent or a challenger as the representative of district i in the second period. The voting decision depends on the record of roll calls he observed in the first period. The set of all possible records of roll calls is denoted by A = {x, y}n. Then a voting strategy for i is a function vi: A→{0, 1}. Let v = (v1 , … , vn) be a profile of voting strategies.         "
"10","Since the types of the incumbents are unknown to other players, we have to specify players' beliefs on them for each observation of a record of roll calls. Generally, they are probability distributions on the type space Θ. However, the only information relevant to payoffs is the probability that each politician will vote for x or y in the second period. Let μi: A→[0, 1] be a (common) belief on the incumbent of district i, where, for each a∈A, μi(a) denotes the probability that she would vote for x if reelected, conditional on the record of roll call being a. Note that μi(a) is the probability that the type of incumbent i is greater than or equal to zero, i.e., the probability that the incumbent prefers x to y. Let μ= (μ1 , … , μn) be a profile of beliefs. Finally, let s = (ℓ, v, μ) denote a profile of (pure) strategies (and beliefs) of the game.         "
"11","Let us consider how rational voters will vote in the election stage. At the time when voters decide their choices, the outcome in the first period has already been determined. The goal of a voter then is to maximize the probability of his preferred policy being the outcome in the second period. Since a voter can choose only his own representative, what he can do to achieve the goal is to maximize the probability that his representative will vote for his preferred policy. Since every politician votes sincerely in the second period, the voter must find out which candidate, the incumbent or the challenger, is more likely to share policy preference with him. Note that he has no information about the challenger other than the prior distribution. Thus, he believes that the challenger will vote for the two policies with equal likelihood. On the other hand, the voter observes how the incumbent voted in the first period and uses this information to infer the incumbent's type. Then, if the voter believes the incumbent is more likely than not to share his (ordinal) policy preference, he will reelect her. When he believes the opposite, he will elect the challenger. As is standard, I assume voters use Bayes' rule to update their beliefs about the incumbents whenever possible. For the off‐path beliefs, I apply the refinement concepts of sequential equilibrium (Kreps and Wilson 1982) and a weakening of universal divinity (Banks and Sobel 1987).         "
"12","I now discuss the legislative voting stage in the first period. Given a profile of strategies s, for each i∈N, each θ∈Θ, and each z∈{x, y}, let Wi(z | s, θ) denote the expected payoff for the incumbent of i with type θ from voting for z∈{x, y}. We require that every type of the incumbent in every district maximizes her own expected payoff given the other players' strategies. Thus, in equilibrium, it must be the case that for every i∈N, every θ∈Θ, and every z∈{x, y},            "
"13","The first inquiry of the analysis is about existence of equilibria. In so doing, I go further than general existence and aim to show existence of equilibria with certain interesting characteristics."
"14","Previous formal studies on electoral accountability such as Banks and Duggan (2006), Banks and Sundaram (1998), Barro (1973), Duggan (2000), Ferejohn (1986), and Fearon (1999) prove that retrospective voting strategies based on a utility standard are supported in equilibrium in various models with a single representative. That is, in equilibria of their models, voters reelect the incumbent when and only when the outcome in the past gives them utility at least as high as a fixed value. This voting strategy is particularly compelling because voters do not have to gather any information beyond their own welfare. Intuitively, however, such a strategy may not be very reasonable when the outcome is determined collectively by many representatives, each of whom represents a different group of voters. First, while a voter can punish or reward only his own representative, the representative is not solely responsible for the past outcome. Second, although a voter wishes to have a good outcome in the future, he can only choose a part of the policymaking body.            "
"15","For this reason, I propose an alternative type of retrospective voting: each voter votes for his representative if and only if she voted for the voter's preferred policy in the first period. Let a*i denote voter i's favorite policy; that is, i∈Nx implies a*i=x and i∈Ny implies a*i=y. I formally define the proposed voting strategy by the following.            "
"16","Definition 1  The following profile of voting strategies v*is called the simple retrospective voting rule: for all i∈N, v*i(a) = 1 if and only if ai=a*i.               "
"17","In the simple retrospective voting rule, each voter conditions his voting decision only on the past behavior of his own representative. The legislative votes of the other legislators (and thus the policy outcome also) are ignored. This is simple because each voter only has to remember what his representative did. It is a type of retrospective voting in the sense that each voter punishes a badly behaved incumbent.8"
"18","The simple retrospective voting rule is one particular voting strategy profile. Recall that we do not assume that voters care about their legislators' position taking, independent of the policy outcome. Thus, we do not impose the simple retrospective voting rule. Rather we investigate whether the voting strategy is optimal for voters motivated solely by the outcome. For the simple retrospective voting rule to be supported in equilibrium, it must be consistent with voters' prospectively rational expectations. Loosely speaking, bad behavior in the past must be correlated with the expectation of bad behavior in the future. In the model, actions of politicians in the second period sincerely reflect their policy preferences. Thus, for the simple retrospective voting rule to be optimal, it is necessary that actions of incumbents in the first period are positively correlated with their preferences. One case with such positive correlation is that each legislator's action chosen in the first period reflects her preference monotonically in a sense. We say a legislative strategy ℓi is monotonic if, for all θ, θ′∈Θ,  ℓi(θ) =x and θ < θ′ imply ℓi(θ′) =x. Recall that a legislator's type θ equals the difference between her utilities from the two alternatives. Monotonicity then means that a legislator, who would vote for x with a given preference over the two policies, should vote for x if she liked x more (or disliked x less).               "
"19","Monotonicity of a legislator's strategy implies that she plays a cutpoint strategy. That is, if ℓi is monotonic, then there is a cutpoint θ*i∈Θ such that θ > θ*i implies ℓi(θ) =x and θ < θ*i implies ℓi(θ) =y. Thus, if all legislative strategies are monotonic, we specify the legislative strategies by n cutpoints. I go further from this to inquire the existence of equilibria with an additional compelling feature: the cutpoints of legislative strategies are constant across districts up to the same constituents' preferences. I formally define simple strategy profile by the following.               "
"20","Definition 2  A profile of strategies s = (ℓ, v, μ) is said to be simple if it satisfies the following.               "
"21","                                    "
"22"," There exist θ*x, θ*y∈Θ such that, for all z∈{x, y} and all i∈Nz,                           "
"23"," v                           is the simple retrospective voting rule, i.e., v = v*.                        "
"24","Thus, in simple equilibria, if they exist, each legislator's ex post roll‐call decision appears to depend only on her preference and her electorate's preference, which can provide a useful prediction of legislative behavior. My first result establishes existence of simple equilibria generally.               "
"25","Proposition 1  There exists a simple equilibrium.                "
"26","Notice that, in equilibrium, each legislator's roll‐call choice must be optimal with respect to her expectation about the other legislators' votes. It cannot be known a priori that the strategic interaction among legislators reaches a stable point at which all legislators with a shared constituency preference ex ante adopt the same strategy. Proposition 1 shows that, in fact, it is generally the case. Thus, a legislator who strategically responds to other legislators' strategies can appear as if she independently interacts with her constituency.               "
"27","Due to its simplicity, a simple equilibrium is a good candidate for a focal point among the possibly many equilibria of the game. In a simple equilibrium, a legislator divides the other legislators into two groups depending on their reelection incentives and assigns the same expectations to legislators within each group. This belief is supported by an easy principle: “every legislator with the same characteristics (her own preference and her electorate's preference) will do the same thing.” In nonsimple equilibria, she may need to have a distinct expectation for each legislator's roll‐call choice. Moreover, she must believe that the others are also able to construct such complicated expectations. If there is a large number of legislators, this contrast will be stark."
"28","If a simple equilibrium is a focal point, predictions about roll‐call voting behavior of legislators are also simple from the perspective of researchers. Roll calls in a legislature can be predicted by preferences of legislators and public opinions of their electoral districts without worrying much about the effects of strategic interaction between legislators. In other words, the hypotheses seemingly driven from a decision‐theoretic framework may be theoretically grounded even under a strategic situation; for example, a legislator is more likely to vote for a policy as she likes it more and as a majority of her districts likes it more."
"29","Next, I examine to what extent the properties of simple equilibria carry over to the set of all equilibria in the game. The next proposition establishes monotonicity of equilibrium legislative strategies generally.               "
"30","Proposition 2  For every equilibrium s = (ℓ, v, μ),  ℓi is monotonic for all i∈N.               "
"31","The result shows that, in all equilibria of the game, legislative strategies are cutpoint strategies, although the cutpoints in equilibrium may vary across different representatives. One important consequence of Proposition 2 is that, in equilibrium, legislative voting of every representative in the first period is at least nonnegatively correlated to her policy preference. As such, the record of legislative votes in the first period provides useful information to voters in a natural way: a voter can infer that a type of legislator who would vote for his favorite alternative in the first period is more probable to share the policy preference with him than one who would not. Thus, legislative voting in the first period plays a role as a signal that contains information truthful to some extent. Such positive transmission of information is possible because voting for a disliked policy may be costly for each legislator. In other words, if there is a positive chance for a legislator to be pivotal in legislative voting, by voting for her disliked policy, she may end up with the policy outcome that is bad for herself. Note that the probability of a representative being pivotal in legislative voting is determined by the other representatives' strategies, and so it does not depend on her type. Thus, given the probability of being pivotal and given the electorate's strategy, a higher type always has a stronger incentive to vote for x than a lower type.9"
"32","As such, Proposition 2 is useful in pinning down equilibrium voting strategies. Since each incumbent's voting behavior is nonnegatively correlated with her type (and hence with her future behavior) in every equilibrium, one can intuitively conjecture that the simple retrospective voting rule is always an optimal voting strategy in every equilibrium. My next result shows this intuition is correct."
"33","Proposition 3  Assume s = (ℓ, v, μ) is an equilibrium. Then the following is true: (1) s′= (ℓ, v*, μ) is an equilibrium; (2) moreover, if vi≠v*i, then βsi(a*i) = 1.               "
"34","The meaning of Proposition 3 is as follows. First, whenever there is an equilibrium with a voting strategy profile other than the simple retrospective voting rule, there is another equilibrium in which the legislative strategies and the beliefs are the same as the previous one, but the voting strategy profile is the simple retrospective voting rule. This means that a legislative strategy for a representative can be adopted in equilibrium only if it is optimal when she expects her electorate would play the simple retrospective rule. We thus lose nothing in terms of predictions on legislative behavior and policy outcomes by focusing only on the simple retrospective voting rule. Secondly, if there is an equilibrium in which a voter adopts a voting strategy other than the simple retrospective voting rule, the representative of the voter votes for the voter's preferred policy with probability one in the first period. This, together with the first, implies that a voter may adopt a voting strategy different from the simple retrospective rule in equilibrium only if he could perfectly control his representative through the simple retrospective voting rule. Thus, voters have little incentive to play voting strategies other than the simple retrospective voting rule. In this sense, the simple retrospective voting strategy is a virtually unique equilibrium voting strategy.10"
"35","Another important implication of the result is that, in every equilibrium, whenever a representative votes against the electorate's preference on the equilibrium path, she is ousted from the office. Moreover, whenever a voter sanctions his incumbent on the equilibrium path, he strictly prefers the challenger to the incumbent. Note that sanctioning an incumbent happens in equilibrium only when some types of the incumbent vote against the electorate. Suppose a voter, say i, who prefers x to y observes that his representative voted for y in the first period. Since ℓi is monotonic, the voter, observing such voting behavior, rules out the case that her type is some “good” type. Thus, his posterior belief that the incumbent shares his preference decreases, i.e., it would be less than one‐half. So, he strictly prefers rejecting the incumbent to reelecting her. Therefore, as the classical idea of electoral accountability claims, voters, in fact, stop their representatives from abusing the public power when they oust the representatives out of office.               "
"36","Proposition 3 makes a strong positive prediction about voting behavior in elections under a single‐member district system: when campaign promises are not credible and voters are informed about the past behavior of legislators, prospectively rational voters will condition their voting decisions on their own representatives' legislative votes in salient issues."
"37","Thus far I have characterized the set of equilibria, making useful predictions about legislators' roll‐call behavior and voters' voting behavior. Now I turn to my focus on normative aspects of equilibria. There are two main questions. First, does each representative act for her constituents? Second, do legislative policy choices represent the majority interest of the whole society?"
"38","To examine representation through electoral accountability, I focus on the result of legislative roll calls in the first period. I first inquire whether each representative's behavior represents her constituents' interest, i.e., the majority preference in her district. Given a profile of strategies s = (ℓ, v, μ), for each z∈{x, y}, let βsi(z) denote the (ex ante) probability that the incumbent of i would vote for policy z in the first period. That is, . I define the following concepts that concern representation with respect to legislators' behavior.            "
"39","Definition 3  A profile of strategies s is said to be representative if, for every Moreover, it is said to be perfectly representative if, for every i∈N, βsi(a*i) = 1.               "
"40","That is, a representative profile of strategies is one in which each representative ex ante is more likely than not to vote for her electorate's preferred policy. Since every politician is ex ante equally likely to prefer x to y or to prefer y to x, this is an appropriate formalization of each representative's “acting for” the majority interest of her constituents. Similarly, a perfectly representative strategy profile is the one in which all representatives vote according to their constituents' preferences with probability one.               "
"41","One can easily conclude that every equilibrium of the game is representative from my characterization result. Proposition 3 implies that every legislative strategy in equilibrium must be a best response to the simple retrospective voting rule. Thus, for the purpose of further characterizing equilibrium legislative strategies, we can assume each voter adopts the simple retrospective voting rule with no loss of generality. Then, each representative would guarantee reelection if she votes for her electorate's favored policy, and she would lose the office for sure otherwise. Since reelection is valuable, this expectation would shape her legislative strategy. Specifically, some types of the representative whose (ordinal) policy preferences differ from the electorate but whose utility differences between the two policies are not too great would vote according to the electorate's preference, i.e., against their own policy preferences. Of course, every type of the representative who shares her policy preference with the electorate would vote for the electorate's preferred policy. As a result, in any district, say i, the ex ante probability of the incumbent's voting for the voter's preferred policy a*i is greater than one‐half. Hence, we have the following result.               "
"42","Proposition 4  Every equilibrium is representative.                "
"43","It is instructive to explain the trade‐off of each incumbent in detail. A central difference between the equilibria of our model and those in the models with a single representative lies in that politicians must consider the probability of being pivotal in the legislature. Consider a representative who prefers x to y (θ > 0) but knows her voter prefers y to x. The incentive to vote for x in the first period is to have a better policy outcome for herself. However, in the case that the representative is not pivotal, her vote in the legislature does not alter the policy outcome. Therefore, the benefit of voting against her electorate is the difference between utility of x and utility of y, which is her type, discounted by the probability of her being pivotal in the first period. The benefit of voting for y, the electorate's favored policy, is, of course, staying in office once again. In addition to the obvious benefit of δρ, reelection is valuable because she may use her voting right to swing the policy outcome in the second period in the case that she is pivotal. Let ϕ1i(s) and ϕ2i(s) denote the probability of the legislator of i being pivotal in the first period and in the second period, respectively. The incumbent of i with type θ > 0  then would vote for y if                  "
"44","Proposition 4 tells us that every representative at least partially represents the majority of her district. As long as our concern is about the connection between each representative's behavior and the majority interest of her constituency, we arrive at a somewhat uplifting conclusion: a single‐member district electoral system, to some extent, achieves representation through electoral accountability. In other words, representatives who are exposed to voters' judgment in periodic elections better represent the corresponding citizens in expectation than ones who are arbitrarily selected.               "
"45","It should be noted that the ex ante probabilities of a representative's voting according to the electorate's preference in the first period and in the second period have a reverse relationship. The reason is the following. Effective control of politicians means that bad types of politicians mimic good types. Thus, as the retrospective control is more effective, the quality of information contained in the roll‐call record is lessened. As such, more bad types can be elected in the second period.11 However, there are good reasons to assess representation focusing only on the first period. First, the effect of selecting good or bad types on voters' welfare matters only in the last period in general. So, if we extend the current model to a model with many periods, the last period effect would be small. Second, in the base model with a single representative and a voter, the voter's overall welfare is strictly increasing in the probability of the representative's voting for the voter's preferred policy in the first period. That is, in equilibrium, the positive effect of good representation in the first period on the electorate's payoff is greater than the negative effect of incurring bad representation in the second period on it. For these reasons, our discussion on representation focuses on the outcomes in the first period.               "
"46","Another important question I have not answered yet is how well a legislature represents the whole society as a representative body of policymaking. Proposition 4 can be interpreted as a positive message on this matter in the following sense: the roll‐call record a*= (a*1, … , a*n) which mirrors the distribution of citizen preference is the most significant roll‐call result in expectation. However, this does not seem an appropriate answer to the question from the viewpoint of the “acting for” version of representation.12 When we only consider the relationship between a single legislator and a citizen, it is clear that the citizen is better represented by the legislator when she is more likely to vote for his favored policy. This is consistent with the citizen's welfare concern because, all else being equal, his expected payoff in the first period will increase (at least not decrease) as the legislator is more likely to vote for his preferred alternative.               "
"47","However, a different standard must be used if we consider the relationship between a legislature and a citizen. Applying the “acting for” definition consistently, we can say he is represented by the legislature if the legislature acts in his interest. Since the function of the legislature is to determine policies, we can say the citizen is better represented by it as his preferred policy is more likely to be the chosen outcome. This is the only standard that is consistent with the citizen's welfare concern.13"
"48","Then, applying the majoritarian vision of representation consistently, we can say a legislature is representative if x, the policy preferred by a social majority, is more likely to be the outcome than y. In the models with a single representative, representation with respect to the policy outcome simply follows representation with respect to the representative's behavior. However, when there are multiple legislators, there is a possibility of an aggregation problem. A high degree of representation in the districts of minorities may reverse the inequality of the outcome probabilities. Thus, in my model, Proposition 4 does not imply that the majority‐preferred policy is more likely to be the outcome than the other policy in every equilibrium.               "
"49","Note, however, that if a perfectly representative strategy profile is played, then there is no aggregation problem. Every legislator votes for her electorate with probability one and thus the majority‐preferred alternative will be the outcome for sure. My next result identifies the necessary and sufficient condition for existence of such an equilibrium."
"50","Proposition 5  There exists a perfectly representative equilibrium if and only if one of the following conditions holds.                "
"51","                                    "
"52","                               n = 1 and "

"54","                               n≥ 3 and "
"55","Proposition 5 divides the circumstances under which a perfectly representative equilibrium exists into three mutually exclusive cases. First, it is an equilibrium when a society is represented by one person if and only if . Second, when the number of districts where voters prefer x to y is the exact bare majority, such an equilibrium exists if and only if . For both cases, the condition is intuitive: politicians are patient enough or the value of office is high enough.               "
"56","Most notably, the third part of Proposition 5 shows that a perfectly representative equilibrium always exists when there are three or more districts and the number of districts that prefer x is at least two more than the number of districts that prefer y. In the real world, the legislature always consists of three or more legislators, and it is rare that the number of districts on each side of an issue is precisely balanced. Thus, the proposition shows that in the most empirically relevant case, a perfectly representative equilibrium exists. This is true no matter how small the value that legislators place on the office is, no matter how impatient legislators are, and no matter what the distribution of politicians' type is like.               "
"57","The intuition is simple. When there is a supermajority of districts where voters prefer x to y, if each legislator would vote for her voter's preferred alternative, then no one would be pivotal in legislative votes. Thus, each representative would simply vote for her electorate's preferred policy to pursue her reelection. One might wonder about the robustness of this equilibrium because the absence of a pivotal voter is involved. However, this equilibrium is completely different from those implausible equilibria in other simultaneous voting games, where players' actions do not depend on their preferences. While, in those equilibria, voting for an alternative is a best response only because of inability of changing the outcome, in my equilibrium, it is supported by a strict incentive to be reelected. Thus, while those equilibria are not robust to slight errors, the equilibrium here survives my refinement analogous to trembling hand perfection.               "
"58","Since the incentive for a legislator to vote against her electorate's preference is related to the probability of being pivotal, one might conjecture that increasing the number of legislators will send the pivot probability of each legislator to zero, resulting in convergence to perfect representation. Such reasoning is based on a decision‐theoretic framework and is not true in my model where the pivot probabilities are determined endogenously. On the one hand, decreasing the pivot probability in the first period provides a stronger incentive to vote according to the constituents' preference. On the other hand, decreasing the pivot probability in the second period decreases the value of reelection and thus provides a stronger incentive to shirk voters. Hence, the direction of the effect of increasing the number of legislators is not clear. In fact, the first and the second parts in Proposition 5 show that there are some values of parameters for which a representative system with a smaller number of legislators better represents a social majority than one with a larger number of legislators does. To see this, note that  for every n≥ 3. Thus, the strategy with perfect representation is supported in equilibrium for a larger set of values of δ and ρ in a single representative case than in the case of multiple representatives where only in a bare majority of districts voters share their preferences. Also,  is strictly increasing in n. Hence, as we increase n, fixing , the set of parameters supporting the perfectly representative equilibrium shrinks.               "
"59","The third part of Proposition 5 is certainly good news to advocators of the single‐member district system. A similar result is obtained by Groseclose and Milyo (2006). They analyze a model of legislative voting under complete information where legislators have preferences over position taking as well as policy outcomes. They find that all legislators vote according to their position‐taking preferences—i.e., they disregard their own policy objectives and follow their districts' preferences—if the number of districts on one side of the issue is at least two more than the number on the other side. However, there is a critical difference. In Groseclose and Milyo's model, this perfectly representative equilibrium is the unique equilibrium whereas the uniqueness is not generally guaranteed in my model. This difference is due to the different informational assumption. Groseclose and Milyo solve their complete information model for pure strategy Nash equilibria. This implies that when legislators vote in equilibrium they know how the other legislators are voting.14 Thus, the pivot probability is either zero or one, which is critical for the uniqueness result. By contrast, in my incomplete information model, legislators only have probabilistic beliefs about the other legislators' votes. Thus, a continuum of the pivot probability is possible depending on legislative strategies, so the logic that proves uniqueness in Groseclose and Milyo's model does not apply.               "
"60","Although we know that a perfectly representative equilibrium exists in many empirically relevant cases, there may be other equilibria as well. If so, it is possible that some of them fail to achieve representation of the social majority interest. Hence, we ask whether we can prove a counterpart statement of Proposition 4 for representation with respect to policy outcomes: is x more likely to pass in the legislature than y in every equilibrium? The next example shows that the answer is negative.               "
"61","Example 1  Equilibrium with representative legislators and a nonrepresentative legislature.                "
"62","Let , and . Let F satisfy . Consider the following strategy profile s = (ℓ, v, μ): (1) for all i = 1, 2, ℓi(θ) =x if and only if  for all θ∈Θ; (3)v is the simple retrospective voting rule. Given the specification,  for i = 1, 2, and βs3(y) = 1. Each representative votes for her voter's preferred policy with probability greater than one‐half in s, so s is partially representative. However, x is the outcome in the first period with probability , and y is the outcome with probability . So x is less likely to be the outcome than y is.               "
"63","I now show s is an equilibrium. The optimality of v is clear from the discussion of Proposition 3. Also, the strategies for legislators 1 and 2 for every positive type and the strategy for legislator 3 for every negative type are obviously optimal because their policy incentives and reelection incentives do not conflict. In what follows, I focus on the legislative strategies for 1 and 2 with type θ∈[−1, 0] and the legislative strategy for 3 with type θ∈[0, 1].               "
"64","The probability that legislator 1 or 2 is pivotal in legislative voting in the first period is , i.e.,  for i = 1, 2. And . Consider district 1 or 2, say i. If any type above  is drawn in the beginning of the game, incumbent i will vote for x in the first period and hence will be reelected. Then the probability that incumbent i votes for x in the second period conditional on her being reelected is . If any type below  is drawn, then incumbent i will vote for y in the first period and the challenger will be elected. Since the challenger will vote for x with probability one‐half, the ex ante probability that the elected legislator of district i will vote for x in the second period is . Since every type of incumbent 3 votes for y, the incumbent will be elected for sure and will vote for x with probability one‐half in the second period.               "
"65","Thus,  for i = 1, 2, and . Applying (2), we can derive that, for i = 1, 2 and for all θ∈[−1, 0],                  "
"66","In Example 1, although each voter controls his representative to some extent, the policy outcome is not preferred by a majority of voters in expectation. Of course, this is because the degree of control or representation varies across districts. In the example, while a minority voter controls his representative perfectly, a majority of voters control their representatives only partially. Notice that I assume the benefit of office and the discount factor are uniform across districts. Thus, there is no a priori reason that the representative of district 3 pursues reelection more than the other representatives do. Thus, strategic interaction among the representatives endogenously produces such a result."
"67","One might wonder how generally such a perverse equilibrium can be supported. In particular, because Example 1 deals with the bare majority case, we wonder whether an equilibrium like the one in the example exists in the supermajority case where there is a perfectly representative equilibrium. The next proposition demonstrates that the condition for existence of perverse equilibria is not extremely restrictive."
"68","Proposition 6  If m≠n, then, for some δ∈ (0, 1], some ρ > 0, and some continuous and symmetric density f onΘ, there exists a simple equilibrium in which x is less likely than y to be the outcome in the first period."
"69","Proposition 6 states that unless all districts prefer the same alternative, for some values of the parameters of the model, there is an equilibrium in which the minority‐supported alternative is likely to defeat the majority‐supported alternative. So, there are cases where a social majority is not represented by the legislature governed by the majority voting rule, even in expectation. A problem of aggregation may occur under incomplete information when representative institutions involve decision making at two levels. Note that this possibility is present without any distortion from allocation of districts and without any complicated agenda‐setting procedure with many alternatives. Therefore, if uncertainty is present, it may be naive to make the following statement: if every legislator represents a majority of her constituents, the collective decision of the legislature will represent a majority of the nation."
"70","Overall, our findings about the single‐member district system are somewhat indeterminate. We prove that in some cases there exist both a good equilibrium and a bad equilibrium. However, we do not have a systematic theory that can tell which equilibrium is likely to be played in this situation. If it is possible that a small shock to the decision environment, like redistricting, can cause an abrupt change from one equilibrium to another, we might cast a doubt about the robustness of the single‐member district system as a preference aggregation mechanism. In every sense, analyzing a model with multiple representatives, even in its simplest form, reveals much subtlety in representation and accountability."
"71","Before concluding, I should mention some extensions of the model. Several assumptions of the model are imposed only for simplicity, and relaxing them does not affect the main results of the article much. First, we could allow the number of districts to be even. When n is even, we need an assumption of breaking a tie in legislative voting. Possible assumptions are that a tie is broken by tossing a fair coin, that one of the two policies is a default policy, and that a tie in the first period is broken either by a coin toss or by an exogenous default policy and the chosen policy in the first period is the default policy in the second period. Under any of these assumptions, every proposition in the article holds without any modification.         "
"72","Second, we could allow the density for politicians' types to be asymmetric. We may assume an asymmetric density while maintaining the assumption that , i.e., a politician ex ante is equally likely to prefer each alternative. In this case, Proposition 1, Proposition 5, and Proposition 6 hold without any modification. Moreover, Propositions 2, 3, and 4 are true generically. That is, the parameter values under which these results do not hold are knife‐edge cases. Now suppose . Still, Propositions 1 and 5 are true, and Propositions 2 and 3 are generically true. We need to modify our definition of representative equilibrium when . That is, the probability one‐half of voting for the electorate's preferred alternative is no longer an appropriate demarcation point. For instance, if a politician ex ante prefers her electorate's preferred alternative with probability 0.7 and votes for it with probability 0.6 in an equilibrium, we should not say the equilibrium is representative because the mechanism of electoral accountability is not functioning. An alternative definition may be the following: an equilibrium is representative if every legislator votes according to her electorate's preference with probability greater than the probability that she ex ante shares policy preference with her electorate. With this modified definition, we can show that generically every equilibrium is representative.         "
"73","Third, we can allow that the discount factor, the salary for legislators, and the density for politicians' type vary across different districts. Then, simple equilibria would not be an interesting solution for the game anymore. Instead of Proposition 1, we then can show that there exists an equilibrium in which all legislative strategies are monotonic and voters play the simple retrospective voting rule. Also, the conditions in Proposition 5 would be written in a slightly different way. The other results hold without any modification."
"74","One extension that might be substantively interesting is to include political parties in the model. Assume there are two political parties X and Y. We may assume that parties have some devices to screen their candidates but their screening devices are not perfect. Thus, party labels provide voters with some but not full information about candidates. Specifically, voters believe that if a candidate is affiliated with Party X (Y), then her type is drawn from distribution FX(FY). A reasonable assumption will be that  and . That is, candidates of Party X prefer x to y on average and vice versa. Now since we have some prior information that distinguishes candidates, it is reasonable to hold an election in the first period of the model as well. Specifically, in the first period, one candidate is drawn from FX and the other is drawn from FY in each district, and then there is an election. After that, the game is the same as the one in our original model with the proviso that each challenger in the second election is drawn from the distribution of the party to which the incumbent does not belong.         "
"75","In this extended model, we can show that there exists a simple equilibrium in which the candidates of Party X are elected in all x districts and those of Party Y are elected in all y districts in the first period. Moreover, Propositions 2, 3, and 4 all will hold for the extended model. Most notably, although party labels provide some information about candidates' preferences, voters will still vote retrospectively in the second‐period election. The intuition is simple. Consider a district where the voter prefers x to y and the incumbent is affiliated with Party X. If the voter uses the simple retrospective rule, only the type of candidates who strongly prefer y to x would vote for y in the first‐period legislature. Thus, the posterior distribution of Party X politicians who voted for y is not as good as the prior distribution of Party Y candidates. Thus, the retrospective voting strategy is optimal. Overall, my main results in this article are robust against changing some assumptions in the model.         "
"76","Finally, one important extension is to consider the case that the issues on which the legislature votes change over time. The reason why prospectively rational voters engage in retrospective voting in my model is that an incumbent's voting behavior in the first period is positively correlated with her preference on the issue in the second period, as the issues are the same across the periods. If the salient issues in the past are very different from those in the future, an incumbent's past behavior would not be a good predictor of her future action, so rational voters might not vote retrospectively."
"77","An interesting way to model this situation is to use a spatial framework.15 For example, suppose the policy space is the real line, and voters and politicians have symmetric and strictly concave (e.g., quadratic) preferences. Politicians' types are simply their ideal points, and they are distributed on [− 1, 1] according to a continuous and symmetric density f. The legislature votes between x1 and y1 in the first period and between x2 and y2 in the second period. Without loss of much generality, assume x1 > y1 and x2 > y2. For simplicity, assume . Then, each politician will vote for x2 if her type is positive and for y2 if it is negative. Then, every positive type of voter reelects his incumbent legislator if and only if she is more likely to be a positive type than a negative type. Every negative type of voters does exactly the opposite.         "
"78","Note that if , then the preferences on the issue in the first period and on the issue in the second period are perfectly aligned. That is, one prefers x2 to y2 if and only if he or she prefers x1 to y1. In this case, the logic of our results in this article holds true. Assuming that the median voters in a majority of districts have positive ideal points, we can show that all results here hold in this spatial setup with small modifications. What would happen if we had ? Without loss of generality, assume . Under a cutpoint legislative strategy, an incumbent who voted for x1 is more likely than not to vote for x2, and an incumbent who voted for y1 is less likely than not to vote for x2. Thus, voters with positive ideal points again reelect their incumbent if and only if she voted for x1. However, for voters whose ideal point is between 0 and , this voting behavior cannot be called retrospective voting. Indeed, what they do is the opposite of retrospective voting: they reelect their incumbent if and only if she voted against their interests in the first period. The types of voters who do not vote retrospectively are precisely the ones who belong to . All others vote retrospectively.         "
"79","How will this affect representation of the majority interests in each district? Consider a district where the median voter's ideal point is positive. The incumbent of the district must vote for x1 if she wants to be reelected. Thus, some types of the incumbent that only slightly prefer y1 to x1 will vote for x1. Therefore, the electoral mechanism increases the probability that the incumbent votes for x1. However, if the median voter's ideal point in the district belongs to , then this mechanism works against the majority preference of the district. Furthermore, suppose that the median voters' ideal points are positive in more than  districts. Then there exists an equilibrium in which the reelection incentive is dominant for every incumbent and thus x1 is the outcome with probability one, as in the third part of Proposition 5. However, if the median ideal points are within  in sufficiently many districts, this means that the majority‐preferred outcome loses with probability one. This perverse effect of the electoral mechanism is more likely to occur as the size of the interval  increases, i.e., as the difference between  and  grows. Thus, as the issues in the two periods are less aligned, fewer voters vote retrospectively, and the perverse effect is more likely to occur.         "
"80","Of course, this short discussion cannot replace a full analysis of a spatial version of the model, which I leave open for the future."
"81","This article has addressed the following important issues of political representation under a majority‐rule legislature and a single‐member district electoral system. Do regularly held competitive elections make representatives responsive to their constituents' preferences? Do policy outcomes that are collectively decided by representatives from different districts represent the interest of a social majority?"
"82","I find that even when voters are not informed about different candidates' preferences, they can achieve partial representation with respect to their representatives' behavior by using their power to oust incumbents out of office. That is, voters in each district to some extent control their representative. However, we find indeterminate results regarding representation with respect to policy outcomes. On the one hand, in almost all cases, there is an equilibrium in which all legislators vote with their districts, and the alternative preferred by the social majority is enacted. On the other hand, there may be other equilibria and, moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility of equilibria in which the minority is more likely to get its way than the majority. It is difficult to identify the exact set of parameter values for which such a bad equilibrium is supported. However, it should be noted that the perverse equilibria occur neither because of any distortion of arithmetical representation caused by misallocation of districts nor because of difficulty of finding a well‐defined majority of citizens. It happens because the responsiveness of representatives to their constituents' preferences varies across electoral districts. Moreover, the varying degree of representation is not caused by heterogeneity of politicians' time preference or intensity of power‐seeking preference. The important cause of this problem is the fact that representatives strategically interact with each other, and they are subject to retrospective judgment of different constituents."
"83","My study contributes to the literature of principal‐agent models of elections by incorporating strategic interaction among policy makers. As we have seen, some of the logic from models of a single office holder carries over to my model and some does not. This emphasizes the importance of studying the interaction between elections and policymaking. Clearly, when deciding what to do, legislators consider both their colleagues' anticipated behavior and their constituents' responses. Since different rules are used in legislative policymaking and in elections, theories of institutions must be more comprehensive by studying alternative combinations of electoral rules and legislative rules."
"84","Finally, although I focus on political representation and electoral accountability in this study, the applicability of my model is not limited to this subject. The model essentially represents the following problem: (1) a group of people is divided into a certain number of subgroups; (2) each subgroup sends its agent to a collective decision‐making body; (3) an outcome that affects all people is determined by voting in the body; (4) each agent is accountable to her own subgroup; (5) each agent's preference is not perfectly known to others. As such, the model can be applied to any social situation that has the above characteristics, such as the decision making of international organizations where each delegate is accountable to her government and of associations of interest groups where each delegate is accountable to her group."
