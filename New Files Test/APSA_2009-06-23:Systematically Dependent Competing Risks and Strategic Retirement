"1","Survival analysis is the appropriate framework for studying when and how legislators' political careers come to an end. The present section employs a discrete time approach to survival analysis, although a general model using continuous time will be developed subsequently."
"2","Each observation is a legislator, indexed by i, at electoral term t. The dependent random variable Y represents the fate of the legislator at the end of the term. If a legislator decides not to run by the end of the term, y= 1. When an incumbent runs but is not reelected at primary, y= 2. In the case where the candidate wins the primary but loses in the general election, y= 3. Finally, if the incumbent survives the general election, the term is said to be “censored” and y= 4.         "
"3","In a serial competing‐risks model, a subject who survives one type of risk may be subsequently exposed to the next. For example, a lawmaker who decides to run for an election (in which case one knows that y > 1) is at risk of losing in the primary election. Once the incumbent wins the primary (y > 2), the candidate is then at risk of losing the general election. On the other hand, a candidate who loses the primary (y= 2) never faces the risk of general election defeat. No candidate is at risk of losing both primary and general elections at the same time. Thus, there is a serial order in which a subject is at each risk.            "
"4","In the discrete time model, an observation of a legislator i at term t appears in the dataset only if the legislator survives the previous terms u(<t). Thus, the hazard at term t is the same as the probability that an event occurs during term t. The quantity of interest is not the marginal hazard for risk r(Pr(y=r | t), r∈{1, 2, 3}) but the conditional hazard where a subject survives preceding risks s(<r): hr(t) =Pr(y=r | t, y≥r). The marginal hazards are thus               "
"5","Since these conditional hazards fall between 0 and 1, a binomial logistic model is employed. The log odds of the conditional hazard for risk r (r∈{2, 3}; r= 1 is addressed later) are parameterized by the log odds of a baseline hazard for risk r (log λ0r(t)) plus a linear predictor (gr(·)) of time‐varying covariates (x(t), not including the constant term):               "
"6","In a parallel competing‐risks model, a subject is exposed to several risks simultaneously. For instance, Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones (2004) decompose an incumbent's choice not to run (y= 1) into two distinct types: bypassing an election in order to seek an alternative office (which they refer to as “ambition”(y= 1(a))) and retirement for other reasons (y= 1(b)). There is no necessary order in which these events take place; that is, a lawmaker is at both risks simultaneously. Let the marginal hazard of ambition and that of retirement be denoted by h1(a)(t) and h1(b)(t), respectively.               "
"7","A common method of analyzing competing risks is the MNL model, where all risks are regarded as parallel. Suppressing the time indicator, the model is expressed as                "
"8","The most common way to deal with dependent competing risks is the frailty model (Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones 2004; Gordon 2002). The model of general election and retirement hazards can be written as follows:               "
"9","To address these limitations, this article proposes a systematically dependent competing‐risks model, where the hazard for one risk is conditioned on the same linear combination of covariates used to estimate the other hazard(s). For the two risks of the above example,               "
"10","Though there can be various model specifications of four risks of congressional career termination, this article assumes that, as strategic politician theory argues (Cox and Katz 2002; Jacobson and Kernell 1983; Lazarus 2005), general election hazard (h3) increases the other three hazards and that ambition hazard (h1(a)) decreases retirement hazard (h1(b)).               "
"11","If conditional hazards do not share any parameters, the above suggests use of nested (multinomial) logistic regression. Then, commercial software packages can estimate parameters by applying logistic regression for every risk separately, to only those observations that face a particular risk. For example, for the general loss hazard, only legislators who run for general election would be considered.5 However, this is not the case for congressional careers. Conditional hazards share some parameters (βr). So when researchers omit censored observations whose survival is dependent on the shared parameters, estimates of the parameters are biased. A better approach is therefore to use all observations in maximizing likelihood.            "
"12","Some technical caveats are in order. In the following dependence model, more than two variables in xr should be excluded from xs for the reason of identification (not vice versa).6"
"13","As in the case of the multicollinearity problem in OLS or the exclusion restriction condition in the Heckman selection model, deciding which variables to exclude from or include in the present model requires judgment and insight into the particular application. The present article recommends the following general rule:"
"14","                              "
"15"," Exclusion Rule: Exclude from xs those variables (say, xrs) that significantly affect hr, when they are expected to affect hs indirectly through ρrs.                     "
"16","The sections below will provide examples."
"17","Likewise, for every pair of hazards, at most one hazard may have a dependence parameter. For instance, in the current application, it is assumed that the general election hazard induces the retirement hazard, not vice versa. Once incumbents survive the retirement hazard, there is no reason to think that they would be more or less vulnerable in the general election solely due to their retirement hazard. This model therefore forces analysts to carefully and explicitly consider the direction of causality among competing risks in a way the frailty model does not. While somewhat restrictive, this may improve research design and make results easier to interpret."
"18","The SDCR model employed here follows Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones's (2004) measure of time dependency, namely, the natural log of the number of terms plus the constant term.               "
"19","The likelihood of a set of parameters, θ (the α's, the τ's, the β's, and the ρ's), for legislator i's exit type y at term t is denoted by :               "
"20","This subsection generalizes the dependent competing‐risks model to include both systematically dependent competing risks (SDCR model) and stochastically dependent competing risks (frailty model) and to account for continuous time. First, one can consider a partial SDCR model:               "
"21","It is also easy to synthesize partial SDCR and frailty models into a general dependent competing‐risks model:                "
"22","It is now clear when researchers should use the SDCR model or the frailty model. On the one hand, if they know what factors produce dependence among risks, one lets these risks share these same factors as covariates, as in xrs in the above notation. This was the approach taken in the previous section addressing the SDCR estimation of congressional career duration. On the other hand, when a researcher is not sure what factors produce dependence among risks or “an analyst has reason to suspect the presence of stochastic dependence among risks due to the prevalence of unobserved heterogeneity” (Gordon 2002, 214), he or she should put unknown factors or “unobserved heterogeneity” into the frailty model as random effects like the ν's. If the joint distribution of the two random variables (prs) follows a bivariate normal, its variance covariance matrix and dependence parameter ρrs represent how strongly and in which direction the two risks are correlated conditioned on covariates:               "
"23","In a continuous time model, hazards have an open lower bound of zero but no upper bound (unlike in the case of the discrete time model, where hazards are probabilities and thus bounded above at 1), the present article parameterizes log (not log odds as in the discrete time model) of marginal (not conditional as in the discrete time model) hazard by the log of the baseline hazard plus a linear predictor:                "
"24","Monte Carlo simulation in this section demonstrates that, when the true data generation process is what the SDCR model assumes (as described in the appendix), the MNL model produces biased estimates. It is shown that the coefficient estimates of a few independent variables on general election hazard are biased toward zero because strategic retirement is not considered. The setup of the Monte Carlo simulation is constructed so that it is easy to compare with the estimated parameters one obtains by applying the SDCR model to congressional data, as will be seen in the next section. The number of observations is 5,399. The independent variables are , Vote, Redistrict, Scandal, Dummy1, and Dummy2. Logarithm of the term, , is sampled from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance 0.6. Vote is sampled from a uniform distribution between −50 and 50. Suppose that a random variable b(m) is equal to 1 −m with the probability of m and is equal to −m with the probability of 1 −m. Redistrict, Scandal, Dummy1, and Dummy2 are sampled from b(0.02), b(0.013), b(0.2), and b(0.4), respectively. Since averages are almost zero for all sampled independent variables, it is easy to calculate approximate averages of conditional probabilities of an event by using the constant term only (e.g., ). These independent variables are sampled only once through the whole process of this simulation.            "
"25","Let , ,  (Vote, Redistrict, Scandal, Dummy1, Dummy2), and . The values of bvote and  are manipulated as explained shortly. Since the coefficients of Vote, Redistrict, and Scandal in  are not zero, they are excluded from  (Dummy1, Dummy2). Suppose  and . Not only Vote, Redistrict, and Scandal but also Dummy1 and Dummy2 are excluded from , and thus .            "
"26","A single iteration of the simulation is performed as follows. Following the SDCR model, the dependent variable Y is sampled. Then, point estimates of each parameter, their standard errors, and the 95% confidence interval are calculated with both the SDCR and MNL estimators. In the MNL analysis, all the independent variables are used as the covariates for all of the four events. This trial is repeated 1,000 times for a set of values of  and bvote. The simulation produces estimates using values of , which determines the average probability of retirement, ranging from −4 to 1 (at one‐point intervals), and bvote, the coefficient of Vote on general election hazard, taking the value of −0.06 or −0.1.7"
"27","Though it is usually impossible to compare parameters between different models, the SDCR model and the MNL model are the same as for the general electoral defeat probability conditioned on their primary victory (). If average estimates of  by the MNL are different from , the MNL estimator is biased (this does not hold for , and ). Among parameters in , this article focuses on the coefficient estimates of Vote, Redistrict, and Scandal, which are included in  but excluded from , and .            "
"28"," Figure 1 illustrates that larger values of  or bvote lead to worse bias of the estimate of bvote as predicted. The upper panel is the case where the true value of bvote is −0.06. The vertical axis represents estimate values of bvote, while the horizontal axis corresponds to the values of . The solid line connects averages of 1,000 estimates of bvote by the SDCR model for every value of . The shaded area is the 95% confidence interval of the 1,000 estimates, namely the area between the 2.5% quantile value and the 97.5% quantile value. The dashed line and the patterned area indicate the same for the MNL model. While the average of the SDCR estimates (solid line) is almost equal to the true value for all levels of , the average of the MNL estimates (dashed line) is above the true value, and increasingly so as  gets large. Deviation of the dashed line from the solid line illustrates the amount of bias. The MNL biases the estimate of bvote toward zero.            "
"29","                 The Larger the Retirement Level (α1(b)) or the Larger the True Coefficient of Vote (bvote), the More Biased Estimated Coefficient of Vote (                                                      )                         "

It is not surprising that roughly 95% of the SDCR estimates are in their 95% confidence intervals because the SDCR model is exactly the data generation process.

"35","The simulation indicates the extent to which dependence among competing risks can lead to bias in MNL estimates and suggests that scholars should instead consider an SDCR model when such dependence is suspected."
"36","This section continues to compare the SDCR and MNL models by applying both models to the U.S. congressional career data studied by Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones (2004).8 It is comprised of information pertaining to the career path for every House member elected in each freshman class from 1950 to 1976. Each member of the House was tracked from the first reelection bid until the last term served in office. The data do not contain elections of and after the Republican revolution in 1994. There are 5,399 observations. For the purpose of model comparison, dependent and independent variables (including the baseline hazard form) are the same between this article and Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones (2004, Table 10.6), though some covariates are dropped as noted below. The dependent variable is realized risk (y), which takes five values: ambition, retire, primary, general, or reelection. Duration time is the number of terms they have served up to the time of observation (t). The independent variables (x) are as follows:            "
"37","                              "
"38"," Party: Whether or not the incumbent is a Republican.                     "
"39"," Redistrict: Whether or not the incumbent's district was substantially redistricted.                     "
"40"," Scandal: Whether or not the incumbent was involved in scandal.                     "
"41"," Open Gub.: Whether or not there was an open gubernatorial seat available during the election cycle.                     "
"42"," Open Sen.: Whether or not there was an open U.S. senatorial seat available during the election cycle.                     "
"43"," Leadership: Whether or not the incumbent had a leadership position in the House.                     "
"44"," Age: The incumbent's age (in years) at each election cycle.                     "
"45"," Prior Margin: The percentage vote margin (over the next best finishing candidate) the incumbent (or the party) received in the previous election.                     "
"46","This choice of independent variables is not exhaustive but is reasonable in the context of existing scholarship (Black 1972; Brace 1984, 1985; Copeland 1989; Cox and Katz 2002; Frantzich 1978; Groseclose and Krehbiel 1994; Hall and Houweling 1995; Hibbing 1982; Kiewiet and Zeng 1993; Rohde 1979; Theriault 1998). Since the aim here is model comparison rather than interpretation of independent variables' effects, and since predicted effects of many variables are obvious, this article does not elaborate on them but refers interested readers to the original analyses (definition of these variables is described in Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones 1997, 1448–49, and Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones 2004, 109, 171).            "
"47"," Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones (2004, Table 10.6) employ all of the above covariates for each risk in the MNL model. Doing the same with the SDCR model would produce multicollinearity problems. Thus, the present article excludes Redistrict, Scandal, and Prior Margin from x1(a), x1(b), and x2. Why? According to the congressional studies literature and the results of the original analyses cited above, it is expected that Redistrict and Scandal increase the general election hazard (h3) (Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart 2000; Brace 1985; Cox and Katz 2002; Frantzich 1978; Hall and Houweling 1995; Kiewiet and Zeng 1993) while Prior Margin decreases it (Bond, Covington, and Fleisher 1985; Cox and Katz 2002; Hibbing 1982; Jacobson and Kernell 1983). Furthermore, the general election hazard is expected to increase the primary election hazard (h2), the retirement hazard (h1(b)), and the ambition hazard (h1(a)). Thus, for example, although Prior Margin will decrease retirement hazard, the (indirect) effect of Prior Margin on retirement hazard is already taken into consideration by way of hazard dependence parameter ρ31(b). Moreover, no substantive theory argues that Prior Margin has a direct effect on the retirement hazard regardless of the general election hazard. Therefore, we should exclude Prior Margin from the retirement hazard covariates (x2).9 A similar argument applies for Redistrict, Scandal, the primary election hazard, and the ambition hazard. There is no other path from these three covariates to the three hazards than through the general election hazard.            "
"48","By contrast, Age is supposed to have both direct and indirect effects on the ambition and retirement hazards. Once controlling for seniority (by baseline hazard), Age is expected to raise the general election hazard because older candidates are likely to be less attractive to their constituency since voters expect them to serve fewer future terms than younger candidates with the same seniority. Thus, Age will have an indirect effect on ambition and retirement via ρ31(a) and ρ31(b). In addition, according to previous studies (Brace 1985; Groseclose and Krehbiel 1994; Hall and Houweling 1995; Kiewiet and Zeng 1993; Theriault 1998), irrespective of congressional electoral prospects and controlling for seniority, older legislators are more likely to retire for not electoral but physical or mental reasons and to have shorter time ahead to enjoy other prestigious offices. Therefore, Age is expected to have a direct effect on ambition and retirement and is kept in x1(a) and x1(b).10"
"49","Open Gub. as well as Open Sen. are expected to facilitate ambitious exit from the House (h1(a)) (Black 1972; Copeland 1989; Rohde 1979), which will decrease retirement (h1(b)) and, thus, are purged from x1(b). There is no other route by which these two independent variables are expected to affect retirement hazard than through ambition hazard.            "
"50","Finally, Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones do not report the estimate of Leadership coefficient on defeats in primaries and note that “there were almost no cases where a member in the leadership lost in primary” (2004, 171). Thus, the variable Leadership is dropped from x2 in order to avoid unstable estimates.            "
"51"," Table 1 compares the results of the MNL model and the SDCR model.11"
"52","The most important quantities of interest are the between‐hazards dependence parameters (the ρ's). In the second to last row of the lower panel, the estimates of ρ32, ρ31(b), and ρ31(a) are presented from the left. The last line shows ρ1(a)1(b). Only the dependence of the retirement hazard on the general election hazard (ρ31(b)) is significantly different from zero (with the expected positive sign). But this measurement is not applicable to the MNL model. In order to compare estimated degree of strategic retirement between the two models, the current study pays attention to the ratio of the retirement hazard change to the general election hazard change, namely, the derivative of the retirement hazard with respect to the general election hazard (). This article refers to this as “strategic retirement responsiveness.”12Figure 4 compares strategic retirement responsiveness by both models. The figure was produced as follows. All covariates are set at zero (for dichotomous covariates and log (t)) or mean value (for a continuous covariate, namely, 51.4 for Age) except for Prior Margin (xPM), which moves from its empirical minimum (0) to maximum (100) by 0.1. The general election hazard (h3(xPM)) and the retirement hazard (h1(b)(xPM)) are calculated for each value of Prior Margin using the SDCR or MNL parameter point estimates. Since the retirement hazard does not have Prior Margin as one of its covariates (x1(b)), it changes only because of changes in the general election hazard. The corresponding strategic retirement responsiveness at h3(xPM) is approximated by . Besides these baseline curves, the lines for the cases where Redistrict is one or Scandal is one are also drawn similarly. Note that the lines of the SDCR model for the three cases overlap because, unlike the MNL model, the relationship between the general election hazard and the strategic retirement responsiveness does not depend on covariate values (footnote 4). The difference of the two models is clear: for most of the range of general election hazard values, the strategic retirement responsiveness of the MNL model is smaller than that of the SDCR model. Moreover, in the MNL model, after the general election hazard surpasses around 0.2, the strategic retirement responsiveness is less than zero, which means that the retirement hazard decreases; this is obviously not reasonable.            "
"53","                 The Larger the Conditional General Election Defeat Probability (h3), the Larger Strategic Retirement Responsiveness (                                                      )                         "
"54","Empirically, 5.8% of those who ran for general election lost, while the SDCR model implies that 8.6% () of those who retired would lose if they ran, an increase of one and a half times. Thus, the SDCR model supports the hypothesis that those who foresee electoral loss retire.            "
"55","Another focus of this study is the coefficient of covariates included for the general election hazard but not for the other hazards. The SDCR estimates of Redistrict and Scandal coefficients are larger than the original analysis (the MNL model), while the SDCR estimate of Prior Margin coefficient is almost the same as the original analysis. The empirical average of  is −3.2. If one assumes the SDCR estimates are the true values, the situation is almost equivalent to the case of α1(b)=− 3.2 in Figures 1 (the upper panel) and 2 where it is shown that bias of the MNL model is almost negligible and the 95% confidence intervals of the MNL model are as wide as they should be.13 Thus, the SDCR model suggests that the original analysis underestimates coefficients of Redistrict and Scandal but not that of Prior Margin because few lawmakers retire.            "
"56","Some readers may question whether the SDCR model fits the data much better than the MNL model. Table 2 reports −2 log likelihood, Akaike information criteria (AIC), and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) of every model. Since the MNL and the SDCR model differ in the number of parameters, it is better to use AIC or BIC. The (full) SDCR model (the second row) is better than the MNL model in terms of BIC, though not in terms of AIC. Since three of the four dependence parameters (ρ's) in the (full) SDCR model are not significant, a simple SDCR model is estimated where no dependence parameter other than ρ31(b) is used and all independent variables are included except for Redistrict, Scandal, and Prior Margin excluded from x1(b). This simple SDCR model (the third row) fits better than the MNL model not only in terms of AIC or BIC but also log likelihood, even if the former uses fewer parameters than the latter (note that the former is not nested within the latter). Finally, an unrestricted model is compared which has no dependence parameter and uses all independent variables. Again, in terms of BIC, both the full and simple SDCR models are better than the unrestricted model, though not in terms of AIC. Taking into account that both SDCR models contain fewer parameters than the unrestricted model, the SDCR models explain the data more efficiently. In sum, at least in terms of BIC, both SDCR models fit the data better than the MNL model and the unrestricted model.            "
"57","While one could argue whether SDCR is cost‐efficient in terms of its slightly better fit with the data, it is important to remember that the quantity of interest of this study is dependence among competing risks. The ρ's in both the full and simple SDCR models express this quantity directly, while the unrestricted model and the MNL model ignore it."
"58","Finally, the coefficients of Age for ambition and retirement are significantly different from zero. Age has direct effects on ambition and retirement other than indirect effects caused by their dependence on the general election hazard. Age facilitates retirement not just because Age dampens electoral prospects, but also because Age itself makes continued congressional service physically difficult. This result justifies inclusion of Age in x1(a) and x1(b).            "
"59","Should scholars always employ the SDCR model instead of the MNL model? Not necessarily. First, the MNL model assumes that every hazard is independent of the others. Thus, the MNL model is preferred when researchers affirm this assumption. Second, given a dependent variable and a set of independent variables, there is only one MNL model, though there can be various kinds of SDCR models corresponding to hazard dependence structure. When scholars have no substantive theory that suggests dependence among hazards, they cannot specify which SDCR model to use and may turn to the MNL model.14 Third, as the Monte Carlo simulation (Figures 1 through 3) implies, the smaller the retirement hazard (), that is, the smaller a “downstream” hazard dependent on an “upstream” hazard (such as electoral hazard), the less problematic the MNL estimates and, therefore, the less helpful the SDCR model.            "
"60","But if none of the three conditions above is met, researchers would benefit from employing the SDCR model. The SDCR model enables and prompts students to take into consideration strategic behavior and quantify it. Though, to date, no ready‐made software can implement the SDCR model, the author's code is available for the statistical software package R (see footnote 7). Even if scholars wish to study models different from that of the present article (e.g., with different risk dependence structure, different number of risks), it is easy to adapt the present code for their models (for use with other statistical software packages).            "
"61","Practically speaking, the present article recommends that scholars estimate the MNL model first, for exploratory reasons. When covariates xrs are significant for hr and hs and a reasonable theory supports that the upstream hazard hr (e.g., electoral defeat) causes the downstream hazard hs (e.g., retirement), researchers might omit xrs from xs and estimate the SDCR model (“Exclusion Rule” mentioned above). Only if students strongly suspect that some of these covariates also have direct effects on the downstream hazard, they might retain those covariates in the downstream hazard. Although the rule above may seem abstract, finding variables to exclude in the SDCR model is admittedly as difficult as exclusion restriction or instrumental variables.            "
"62","In addition, the SDCR model is biased in the case of omitted variables, because it does not take into consideration omitted variables. But the MNL model is biased toward zero compared with the SDCR models. This is because the MNL estimates suffer from omitted variables as well as dependence between risks, the latter of which the SDCR model addresses. Monte Carlo simulation (not reported, though available upon request) confirms this."
"63","In the field of political science, there are many other promising applications for which the SDCR model might be useful. A few of these are discussed below."
"64"," Diermeier and Stevenson (1999, 2000) and Lupia and Strøm (1995) improve upon earlier studies of cabinet duration by distinguishing between two types of cabinet termination in parliamentary systems: replacement by another cabinet without an election and chamber dissolution with a subsequent election. But, when a cabinet expects that it will be replaced, it may dissolve the legislature and call an election. Gordon (2002) applies his stochastically dependent competing‐risks model to this case but fails to find significant dependence. It may be the case, however, that the two hazards are systematically dependent, in which case those estimates are biased.            "
"65","The U.S. Senate tends to confirm most federal court judges and executive officials the president nominates. But the Senate sometimes rejects nominees, or adjourns without any decision. In some cases, nominees are withdrawn (Bond, Fleisher, and Krutz 2002). When the confirmation hazard is high, rejection or withdrawal hazards should be low. Moreover, a president who anticipates senatorial rejection may prefer to withdrawal a candidate rather than pay the political costs of a defeat.            "
"66","Cases worthy of study are also found in international relations. If countries involved in a war realize that an imposed settlement is likely but costly, they may hasten to stop the war by negotiation (cf. Slantchev 2004). Therefore, it seems likely that an imposed settlement hazard raises the negotiated settlement hazard. Or, in an international crisis that ends with either backdown or an attack (cf. Fearon 1994), the lower the backdown hazard, the higher the attack hazard. The SDCR model may be productively applied to test these hypotheses.            "
"67","Competing‐risks models of survival analysis study whether, when, and how an event happens in regard to a particular subject. Sometimes, these risks are dependent on each other. The SDCR model proposed in this article enables us to estimate more than two risks, which is almost impossible for the widely used frailty model (i.e., a stochastically dependent competing‐risks model). The SDCR model also allows the researcher to separately analyze direct and indirect effects of covariates and distinguish between serial risks from parallel ones. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that another often‐employed method, the MNL model, would result in underestimation of parameters in the case where data are generated in the way the SDCR model assumes. Finally, the present article combines both types of dependent competing‐risks models into a general one and extends it into continuous time."
"68","This article has relevance to American politics as well by applying the SDCR model to data on the career paths of members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The main substantive contribution is to reveal that lawmakers strategically retire so as not to incur electoral defeat and to estimate this effect by taking into account bias to which the often‐employed MNL model is vulnerable.15 The present analysis showed that, if they ran, retirees would be more likely defeated than the actual candidates. Thus, even if observed incumbent defeats are rare, voters may succeed in replacing legislators by forcing retirement. In this sense, American democracy works better in terms of popular control of the government than previously thought. This finding has relevance for policy debates on measures designed to counter incumbency advantage, such as term limits and campaign spending legislation.         "
"69","This study shows that the SDCR model can be useful when scholars want to understand the factors influencing distinct and interrelated ways in which a subject may be terminated (whether that subject is a legislator, a cabinet, a nominee, or a war). In addition to demonstrating the SDCR model's usefulness for explaining the end of congressional careers, the article offers a template for future applications in other promising areas of research."
