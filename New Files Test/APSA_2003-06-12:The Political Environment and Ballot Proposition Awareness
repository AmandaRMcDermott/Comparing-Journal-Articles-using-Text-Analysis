"1","The data for the dependent variable are from The California Poll (Field Poll). Since 1956, The Field Poll has asked Californians whether they have heard, read, or seen anything about a particular ballot measure.1Table 1 lists all ballot measures from 1956 to 2000 for which the Field Poll inquired about voter awareness.1 The column on the far right, the values for the dependent variable, lists the percentage of respondents familiar with a particular ballot proposition. Taken together, one can see that Californians have heard of a good number of statewide ballot measures.1 Overall, the mean value of aggregate awareness is 64 and the standard deviation is 19. To be sure, the high mean suggests that the Field Poll inquires about better‐known ballot propositions (see Bowler and Donovan 1998, chap. 5). Issues such as gun control, illegal immigrants, criminal sentencing, the death penalty, and homosexual teachers had 80% or more respondents claiming familiarity. Yet, despite this apparent bias, the large standard deviation suggests that awareness levels vary considerably.         "
"2","The data in Table 1 show that ballot propositions are not equally well known. Below, I discuss how various factors that makeup the political environment affect awareness of ballot propositions.         "
"3","Midterm  I expect voter awareness of ballot propositions to vary across election years. Although national issues predominate in presidential election years, with few exceptions (e.g., 1994) they seldom do so at the midterm. Without the presidential contest and the concomitant attention it draws, issues at the state level, particularly ballot propositions, may be better known at the midterm.1 To assess the effect of midterm elections, the variable Midterm is coded one if the election occurred at the midterm and zero in a presidential election year.            "
"4","Campaign Spending  High amounts of campaign spending increase the likelihood of exposure to political messages. As mentioned, Bowler and Donovan (1998) found that campaign spending influenced voter awareness of ballot propositions. Borrowing from these authors, I hypothesize that campaign spending will positively affect ballot measure awareness. For each ballot measure, I include the total campaign spending, both for and against, as reported to the California Secretary of State. In coding Campaign Spending, I use the Implicit Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Price Deflator to control for inflation. Further, because California's population has grown over the years of this study (1956 to 2000), I take into account per capita differences in the effect of campaign spending by dividing the deflated spending figures by state population size.            "
"5","Media Coverage  Citizen awareness of a ballot proposition may grow with increasing news media coverage since heavy news coverage of an issue helps shape the public's agenda (e.g., Iyengar and Kinder 1987). To assess Media Coverage, I coded whether a proposition was front‐page news in the Los Angeles Times, California's largest and most influential newspaper. A ballot proposition featured on the front page of the Times as a headline or designated vote return (e.g., not part of a summary of all election returns) the day following the election is coded one and zero otherwise.1 To be sure, front‐page coverage of a ballot proposition in the Los Angeles Times does not represent all possible media coverage. However, as California's leading newspaper, the Los Angeles Times is an agenda‐setter for other media and a good barometer of media attention in the Golden State.            "
"6","Morality and Civil Liberties/Rights Issues  Citizens will likely be more aware of issues concerning morality, civil liberties, and civil rights since they tap core values—values that reflect deeply held beliefs (Carmines and Stimson 1980; Gamble 1997). To account for these issues, I include two dummy variables, Morality and Civil Liberties/Rights. Morality is coded one if the proposition concerned public morality and zero otherwise. Similarly, Civil Liberties/Rights is coded one if the proposition concerned civil liberties or civil rights and zero otherwise. The policy areas coded zero for both variables include government and political process; revenues and taxes; the environment and resources; education; the regulation of business; welfare and health; public safety and nonclassifiable issues. Although the excluded categories may occasionally ignite the electorate's passions, I do not expect them to consistently do so.            "
"7","Voter Fatigue  In light of California's lengthy ballot, it is important to account for the possibility of voter fatigue. Although studies of voter fatigue traditionally look at its influence on turnout or voter drop‐off (Bowler, Donovan, and Happ 1992; Magleby 1984), the logic applies equally well to voter awareness. Burdened with an abundance of propositions and unable (confusion) or unwilling (too costly) to make sense of them all, citizens disengage from a long ballot. To evaluate whether an increase in the number of ballot propositions in a given election decreases voter awareness, Voter Fatigue is coded as the number of citizen‐initiated propositions on a given ballot.            "
"8","Days to Election  As Election Day approaches, the supply of information about ballot propositions increases as campaigns intensify their efforts to mold public opinion and news coverage follows this activity. Consequently, voter awareness levels of ballot propositions will increase as Election Day nears. Magleby (1989), for example, finds that time before the election is the most important determinant of awareness in California's 1984 ballot proposition elections (also see Bowler and Donovan 1994 and Cronin 1989, 71). To account for this effect, I code the variable Days to Election as the number of days before the election the question was asked. Although most of the questions in the sample were asked two weeks or less before Election Day, about 19% of questions were asked more than two weeks prior.            "
"9","Of the seventy‐eight cases listed in Table 1, four were dropped from the analysis because of missing data (N = 74).1Table 2, Model 1 presents the results of an Ordinary Least‐Squares (OLS) regression. The R2 indicates that the model explains 50% of the variation in ballot awareness (adjusted R2= .45). Furthermore, all of the independent variables in the model are statistically significant predictors of awareness in a one‐tailed test (p < .05).         "
"10","The first two variables listed in Table 2, Midterm and Days to Election, concern temporal effects. Midterm elections increase familiarity with ballot propositions by about 14 percentage points on average while the number of days before an election decreases the percentage of respondents aware of a ballot measure by less than half a percentage point.         "
"11","The number and kinds of ballot propositions also affect voter awareness. The number of propositions on the ballot in a given year, the indicator for Voter Fatigue, indicates that each additional ballot measure in a given year decreases awareness of each individual ballot proposition by a little over one percentage point on average.1 The coefficient for Morality indicates that these issues exhibit a little over 13 percentage points greater awareness while the coefficient for Civil Liberties/Rights indicates that these issues generate greater awareness by nearly 18 percentage points.1"
"12","Media attention and campaign spending have significant effects on voter awareness as well.1 As expected, Media Coverage has a positive effect on voter awareness of ballot propositions. The coefficient for this variable indicates that newspaper coverage increases awareness of ballot propositions, on average, by over 16 percentage points.1 Campaign spending also has a positive effect on voter awareness, increasing awareness about six percentage points on average. In Table 2, Model 2, I looked at the possibility that positive and negative campaign spending may have different effects. The results suggest that negative spending is driving the results for overall spending. Negative spending is statistically significant and has a positive effect on awareness. The coefficient for this variable indicates that negative spending increases awareness by a little over 16 percentage points. In contrast, the impact of positive spending is relatively small, and the coefficient for this variable does not obtain statistical significance.         "
"13","Given the small number of cases and unusual time component of these data, I evaluated the robustness of the results. The residuals plotted against the fitted values exhibited no apparent problems or obvious outliers. As an extra check for outliers, Table 2, column 2 reports the results of a robust regression analysis. Comparing the OLS and robust estimates, one can see that they are very similar which suggests that the data adhere to the assumptions of OLS (Western 1995).1"
"14","The preceding analyses indicate that the electoral cycle, campaign spending, media coverage, issue characteristics, voter fatigue, and the number of days before the election shape voter awareness of ballot propositions. What are the implications of these results? First, they provide additional evidence for the importance of the political environment. Changes in the information environment, not just individual differences, drive citizens' basic political awareness. Although further research is needed, especially at the individual level, environmental factors may play a more important role in shaping basic awareness than individual level factors because few cognitive resources are required beyond receiving a political message, storing it in memory, and retrieving it. Second, my results speak to ongoing debates about direct democracy in regards to voter competence and civic engagement. To be sure, awareness of ballot propositions does not equal voter competence. For example, Gerber and Lupia (1999) argue that voter competence in direct legislation elections turns on knowledge of which actors endorse and fund campaigns for ballot measures, information that a basic awareness does not necessarily communicate. Yet, a basic awareness is a necessary condition for such learning. The link between awareness of ballot propositions and civic engagement appears more direct. By inviting the citizen to play a greater role in the political process, ballot propositions may increase political efficacy, knowledge, and participation. Ballot propositions can only have this effect, of course, insofar as citizens know about them. In sum, although voter awareness of ballot propositions is not a panacea for all the ills of direct democracy, it might help promote civic engagement and voter competence.         "
