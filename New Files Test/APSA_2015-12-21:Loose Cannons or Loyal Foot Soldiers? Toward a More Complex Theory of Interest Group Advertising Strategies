"1","During the 2012 campaign, Gary Goldsmith, director of Minnesota's Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board, worried that the voices of candidates were being drowned out by political ads from outside groups. He explained, “The candidates are being defined by an outside entity. … It's a problem because the candidate's voice is the weakest voice being heard” (Brucato 2012). One political professional was even blunter. Paul Wilson, whose firm worked with American Crossroads, said, “The candidate doesn't control the message anymore…. We have organizations with the ability to marshal resources and focus a machinegun fire of ads at a particular message” (Boak 2011).         "
"2","Worries that outside groups now control the issue agendas of campaigns have taken on heightened importance since the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in early 2010 in the Citizens United case, which built upon the 2007 Wisconsin Right to Life opinion. Those decisions opened the floodgates to more interest group involvement in campaigns. In 2012, one‐third of ad spending in the presidential race came from groups other than the parties and candidates (Fowler and Ridout 2012). Additionally, groups sponsored 36% of ads in 2014 Senate races (Fowler and Ridout 2014). This prominent role for independent groups is only likely to increase in future election cycles as groups learn how to navigate this laissez‐faire regulatory environment.         "
"3","Although there has been much discussion of how outside groups in recent years have injected new spending into campaigns (e.g., La Raja 2013), there has been little focus on how interest group involvement in campaigns may affect the policy issues being discussed in the race. Instead of reinforcing the agendas of the campaigns, groups might be resetting the broader campaign agenda by focusing on different issues, which may harm citizens’ ability to hold candidates accountable. That said, it is not clear that interest group involvement will shift the issue dialogue in campaigns away from candidates. Indeed, for many groups, echoing the candidates’ agendas may be the most efficient way to help. Different types of groups, however, may have different incentives that may lead them to follow or diverge from the candidates’ issue agendas.         "
"4","In addition to normative concerns, whether candidates and their favored groups share an issue agenda has practical implications. Some have argued that candidates’ campaigns, such as that run by Mitt Romney in 2012, are handicapped when they cannot control the messages being disseminated (Plouffe 2009). A campaign's own message on one topic may not be as effective if it is competing with a message from a group on a different topic, even if that message is favorable to the candidate.         "
"5","In this research, we analyze campaign advertising in U.S. Senate races from 2008, 2010, and 2012, and we investigate the extent to which the issue focus of group advertising coincides with the issue focus of candidate advertising. In doing so, we advance the first systematic explanation of interest group advertising content, arguing that the extent to which groups converge with candidates during a campaign varies with the characteristics of the group, specifically whether the group is focused on a single issue or multiple issues and whether the group is membership based. Our findings suggest that multi‐issue nonmembership groups (often organized as 527 or 501(c) groups) are less likely to deviate from the issue agenda of the candidates they support than are single‐issue membership‐based groups; indeed, the degree of issue convergence between the former groups and the candidates is about as high as the convergence between political parties and the candidates."
"6","Although scholars have discussed how interest group activity increases in competitive elections (Franz 2008), little research has explored the content of this activity beyond acknowledging that groups tend to be more negative (Fowler and Ridout 2012). Different sponsors have different goals in airing advertising. The goal of candidate advertising seems simple: getting someone elected. And it is similar for parties: getting members of the party elected, while perhaps also conveying a positive image of the party or the party platform.1 Thus, we expect parties, by and large, to echo the issue agendas of candidates. Doing so reinforces the candidate's message, thereby not distracting and confusing voters with divergent issue messages (Dalager 1996). Moreover, echoing the candidate issue agenda would seem to be a low‐information strategy, as, presumably, any well‐financed campaign has polling data and expertise to support that issue focus. Thus, focusing on the same issues as the candidate is both low cost and electorally smart, as it bolsters—not competes with—the candidate's message. Even though parties may want to elect their candidates and promote their brands, electoral considerations seem to be foremost. In 2008, for example, the Republican National Committee ran an ad supporting John McCain titled “Balance” that discussed how McCain “push[ed] his own party to face climate change.”         "
"7","For independent groups, however, the incentives are multiple and vary by group. Electing supporters of their issue causes or ideologies—or potential supporters—is certainly one goal (Grossman and Helpman 1996). However, getting those issues they care about deeply on the public and political agenda may be another goal. Self‐preservation may also be a goal; groups want their members and donors to be happy.         "
"8","Because interest groups’ incentives are varied, the degree of divergence with the candidates’ issue agendas may vary considerably. We sketch out two competing views of interest group behavior. One suggests that groups will act “as if” they were candidates, converging with candidate allies in the issue focus of their advertising—the “loyal foot soldier” strategy. If a group supports a candidate and that candidate will do better if the issue agenda plays to his or her strengths or party reputation, then we should see high convergence between the interest group and favored candidate. Groups may also act as loyal foot soldiers if some external factor drives them to campaign on the same issues as the candidates they support. The most important of these external factors may be the salience of the issue. Simon (2002, 134) suggests that when “a particular issue captures the consciousness of the electorate,” then candidates cannot ignore that issue. And there is evidence that an issue's salience is positively related to the degree of issue convergence between competing candidates on that issue (Kaplan, Park, and Ridout 2006).         "
"9","The second view expects interest groups to act as “loose cannons,” introducing their favored issues into the debate regardless of whether their favored candidate is talking about that issue or engaging on that issue with the opposing candidate. This may be done to force voters to think about the issues the groups care about—and make candidates address those issues. The result would be a low degree of issue convergence between groups and their favored candidates. These broad characterizations do not preclude some important alternatives. First, what we describe as “loyal foot soldier” behavior may be the result of groups forcing candidates to adopt certain issues (as opposed to groups echoing the issue concerns of candidates). Second, “loose cannon” behavior may result from a division of labor whereby candidates disengage on certain issues when groups start discussing them."
"10","We argue that the degree of issue convergence between group and candidate should depend on the characteristics of outside groups. On the one hand, there are traditional political action committees (PACs) affiliated with large, long‐standing interest groups or labor unions with millions of members. On the other hand, 501(c)(4) organizations and super PACs have no affiliation with any traditional organized interest and have only vague issue agendas and no membership base. Whether a group acts more as a “loose cannon” or a “loyal foot soldier” should depend on the way the group is organized. Specifically, we expect variation in group activity depending on both the number of issues a group concerns itself with and whether the group has a membership base to which it is accountable.2"
"11","Interest groups organized primarily around a single issue should be more likely to diverge from candidate dialogue, focusing instead on their preferred issue topic and generally neglecting the issues talked about by candidates and parties. The National Rifle Association, for example, may air ads on the issue of gun rights regardless of what the two candidates are discussing, and in spite of whether the issue has even been brought up in the campaign. This is in contrast to groups with a wider issue focus, which can more readily adopt the issue agenda of parties and candidates. MoveOn.org, for example, has no real constraint on the issues on which it can focus, and it may therefore focus its ads on whatever issues would be beneficial to its preferred candidate. The extent to which a group varies on this dimension should be an important predictor of what type of advertising strategy the group pursues, with single‐issue groups being less sensitive to the campaign‐specific atmosphere and multi‐issue groups looking more like a political party, speaking about the issues that are most likely to resonate with the public.         "
"12","A second important factor is whether the group has members. In particular, we expect that groups with formal members will have constituencies they need to please, which will also constrain the types of issues on which they can advertise. For example, a membership group such as the Club for Growth might risk losing financial supporters if it departed from its focus on small government and low taxes to talk about abortion or same‐sex marriage. Thus, membership groups would seemingly be more “locked in” to their issues agendas, acting more as loose cannons. By contrast, a group such as Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, which does not have members per se, should have more freedom to reinforce its preferred candidates’ issues. Importantly, this logic should apply to both groups whose members are individuals and groups whose members are aggregates, such as businesses or local labor union affiliates."
"13","While we expect both issue focus and group membership type to influence the groups’ degree of issue convergence with the candidates’ issue agendas, we also anticipate an interactive effect. Combining the issue focus and membership dimensions leads to four basic types of interest groups: (1) the single‐issue membership group (e.g., the Sierra Club and National Rifle Association), (2) the single‐issue nonmembership group (e.g., America's Agenda Healthcare for Kids and Mainers for Employee Freedom), (3) the multi‐issue membership group (e.g., MoveOn.org and the Chamber of Commerce), and (4) the multi‐issue nonmember group (e.g., Let Freedom Ring and American Future Fund). We expect single‐issue membership groups to be most likely to focus on the group's stated issue focus, acting as loose cannons, and multi‐issue nonmembership groups to be most likely to echo the issue agendas of candidates, acting as loyal foot soldiers.         "
"14","One complication is that both single‐issue and membership groups—for which we expect lower levels of candidate issue convergence—might self‐select into races in which their preferred issue agendas are being discussed by a candidate. For example, if a candidate in a race is focused on discussing education, then a single‐issue group or a group with a known “brand” on the issue of education might contribute to that dialogue on education at a later point in the campaign. The candidate's own advertising could act as a signal to interest groups that the candidate shares their issue priorities. If true, then the issue agendas of single‐issue groups and membership groups should be more likely to converge with those of their preferred candidates later in the campaign."
"15","Beyond type of interest group structure, the partisan or ideological leanings of an interest group may also affect the likelihood that a group converges with its favored candidates. In recent campaigns, journalists have noted the close ties between Republican candidates and conservative groups. For instance, the New York Times reported in 2012 that conservative‐leaning interest groups were sharing “polling data and focus group research to develop many of the same lines of attack. And they are being careful to keep their efforts consistent with the themes being emphasized by Mitt Romney's campaign” (Peters 2012, emphasis added). Studies of the parties’ organizational cultures also point to profound differences between the ways the Democratic and Republican parties work. As Freeman (1986, 339) writes, “Republican activists are expected to be good soldiers who respect leadership and whose only important political commitment is to the Republican Party.” In the Democratic Party, by contrast, various groups are expected to speak out and represent their own interests; this is the perceived route to access (Freeman 1986).3 Given these different organizational cultures, we expect to find higher convergence between candidates and groups on the Republican side.         "
"16","To measure the issue focus of both candidates and interest groups, we rely on advertising data from the Wisconsin Advertising Project in 2008 and the Wesleyan Media Project (WMP) in 2010 and 2012. Both projects tracked and coded political advertisements in all 210 media markets in the United States. The unit of analysis in these data is each airing of a political advertisement. The data record the date and time of each airing, as well as the media market in which it aired. Coders assessed each unique ad on a variety of characteristics and noted each unique issue mention. We examine ads aired by candidates (including party‐coordinated spots) and groups in Senate races. We analyze here only ads that aired in the final 8 weeks of each campaign because interest group advertising was most intense during this time period, and it allows us to avoid mixing primary and general election advertising."
"17","The data also contain information about the issues addressed in each ad. Project staff were given a list of 60 issues (listed in the supporting information) and asked to identify all of the issues mentioned in the ad. The number of issues that coders could record for each ad was unlimited, though there was high consistency across coders in the number of issues identified (see the supporting information). We measure levels of issue convergence (1) between interest groups and their preferred candidates and (2) between parties and their preferred candidates.4 We measure issue convergence in 2‐week blocks for the last 8 weeks of the campaign, and only in weeks during which both candidates/parties and interest groups aired ads. We calculate coverage for 2‐week periods instead of the entire campaign because, first, it increases the number of observations and, second, it allows us to capture changes in advertising strategy over the campaign.         "
"18","Like Sigelman and Buell (2004), we measure issue convergence directly as the level of issue discussion on the same set of topics. And like Kaplan, Park, and Ridout (2006), we use televised political ads to measure convergence.         "
"19","Because each ad is coded on every issue mention from a list of about 60, we aggregate the political ad data to the level of the favored candidate, 2‐week period, and sponsor airing ads on behalf of that candidate. We then calculate the proportion of total ads aired by each campaign/group or campaign/party on each issue topic during each time period. Using a method advocated by Sides (2006), we weight ads that contain more than one issue mention to reflect the number of mentions. In other words, for an ad with only a single issue mention, that mention is coded as 1. For an ad that mentioned, say, both health care and education, each issue is given a weight of 0.5. The mean number of issue mentions per ad airing in the 2008 Senate data was 2.2; it was 2.7 in 2010 and 2.6 in 2012. We assess issue overlap as follows:            "
"20","Table 1 shows a hypothetical example of a campaign to illustrate how issue convergence was calculated. Here, we use only five issue areas instead of the approximately 60 used in the actual calculations. In the example, the candidate avoided Issue 1 and focused on all four other issue areas. In contrast, interest groups mentioned Issue 1 in 60% of their ads that week but did not raise Issue 2 in any ad. Note that issue focus may overlap partially; imagine one ad about Social Security and Medicare, and another about Medicare and government spending. Medicare overlaps, but the other two do not.         "
"21","The third row in the table shows the absolute difference in proportions. The greater the summed difference (across all issue areas), the less issue overlap. We divide the summed difference in proportions (third row in the table) by the total candidate and interest group proportions (fourth row in the table). The resulting number reflects issue divergence, and so we subtract that from 1 to obtain an issue convergence score.         "
"22","We also classify each group as membership based or not. This dimension is not easily operationalized, in part, because the idea of group membership might vary from group to group. Some groups may have members from the broader public who pay dues and receive certain benefits, and some may be unions, professional associations, or trade associations where membership is not as comparable or widely accessible. Moreover, some groups may identify their “members” merely as those who donate to the organization, regardless of whether this brings a particular benefit. Baumgartner and Leech (1998, 32) highlight this problem, arguing that “it is clear that no single definition of ‘membership’ is likely to fit in all cases, adding further difficulties to comparison across studies when scholars are not careful in comparing only apples to apples.” For the purposes of this analysis, such distinctions may not matter. If a group is accountable to what it terms a “membership base,” it may be more constrained in the issues it can emphasize in its publicly broadcast political messages.         "
"23","Although research highlights the problem of operationalizing the concept of a membership group, it offers no solutions. We cannot rely on group directories or Federal Election Commission classifications, for example, as many groups in this analysis are not present in either. Thus, our solution was to visit each interest group's website and note whether the group indicated it had “members.” If a group described itself as having “members”—and we looked explicitly for this word—we coded it as such. We did not code a group as having members if it merely encouraged web visitors to sign up for emails or RSS feeds, or if a group claimed an “active donor” base.5 Sometimes membership was clearly stated on a group's “About Us” page; sometimes it was a little more difficult to assess (e.g., in its “yearly report” archived as a pdf). Reliability of the membership code, based on two independent coders, was high (kappa = .83). Although this operationalization misses some of the complexity surrounding membership, the resulting classifications, which are in the supporting information, have high face validity.         "
"24","To categorize each group as focused on a single issue or on multiple issues, we consulted the group's website and coverage in the press.6 If our measure of single‐issue groups is valid, we would expect groups we classified as single‐issue to mention fewer issues than groups we classified as multi‐issue, and the data confirm this expectation. Across all three elections, the groups coded as multi‐issue mentioned, on average, 2.74 issues per state/market/2‐week period in which they advertised. Single‐issue groups mentioned 2.08 issues on average (difference is significant at p < .001). The supporting information lists the groups involved in Senate races in each year, along with our coding of the membership and single‐issue dimensions.         "
"25","To provide a baseline of levels of issue convergence, Figure 1 shows the distribution of convergence scores between candidates and their interest group allies across the last three election cycles, calculated separately for each of the four 2‐week periods we examined and broken down by group type.         "
"26","The figure shows that, regardless of group type, the modal value of convergence is 0, suggesting there are many loose cannons among interest groups. There are, however, a few instances of high, and even perfect, issue convergence. Consistent with our theory, the distribution does vary some by group type, with more density to the right in the multi‐issue membership figure and the multi‐issue nonmembership figure. The mean level of issue convergence across all three election years is 0.21. By way of comparison, mean convergence between Democratic and Republican candidates running against each other is 0.24 in 2008, 0.22 in 2010, and 0.24 in 2012. In the aggregate, then, there is great variation in the degree to which interest groups echo what their preferred candidates say."
"27","An example will help to make the variation more apparent. In the 2012 open Senate race in Nevada between Republican Dean Heller and Democrat Shelley Berkley, the pro‐Heller group American Future Fund aired 208 spots in the Las Vegas media market in the final 2 weeks of the election. The group focused its one ad on three issues: jobs, foreclosure, and ethics in government. Because of our weighting, each issue mention is counted as one‐third of the ad buy. Heller sponsored 881 ads in the market and focused on the same three issues at 23, 34, and 34%, respectively, plus one other issue (the broader economy) in 9% of the ads. The resulting issue convergence was 0.90."
"28","Can interest group type help to explain some of the variation across races? We have outlined four expectations:            "
"29","Before turning to the statistical analyses, we examine the growth of interest group activity in each category over the past three cycles. As Figure 2 shows, sponsorship of outside group advertising has shifted away from single‐issue nonmembership groups and multi‐issue membership groups toward multi‐issue nonmembership groups. Whereas only about a quarter of ads came from multi‐issue nonmembership group sponsors in 2008, such groups accounted for over 60% of group advertising in 2012.         "
"30","Involvement of Interest Group by Type, 2008–12"
"31","The group‐level ad totals reported in the supporting information make this change clearer. In 2008, the Chamber of Commerce was the top interest group advertiser, with over 14,000 ads aired in the fall campaign. That was nearly twice as many ads as any other group that advertised that fall. By 2010, and especially 2012, multi‐issue nonmember groups (those most likely to have taken advantage of campaign finance developments after Citizens United), became far more active. They included groups like Crossroads GPS (approximately 13,000 Senate ads in fall 2010 and 38,000 in fall 2012) and Majority PAC, which sponsored more than 20,000 ads in the fall 2012 campaign.7"
"32","Table 2 shows the impact of both group issue focus (single‐ versus multi‐issue) and membership on issue convergence. The most important finding, which is revealed by comparing the two columns of data, is that multi‐issue groups are more likely to converge with the issue discussion of the candidates than are single‐issues groups. Mean convergence is 0.233 for multi‐issue groups versus 0.125 for single‐issue groups, a statistically significant difference. Thus, we find support for our hypothesis that multi‐issue groups have more freedom to address the issues that the candidates are addressing—presumably issues that help them electorally—than do single‐issue groups.         "
"33","We also expected to find differences in levels of issue convergence depending on the membership base of the group. Nonmembership groups, as expected, are more likely to converge than membership groups, but the difference between the two is smaller than for breadth of issue focus. Nonmembership groups had an average issue convergence score of 0.228 versus 0.200 for membership groups. Still, this difference was statistically significant."
"34","One possibility raised earlier was an interactive effect of membership and whether the group was single‐issue. We had proposed that nonmembership multi‐issue groups should converge the most with the candidates, whereas levels of issue convergence should be lowest for member‐based single‐issue groups. Our descriptive data support this hypothesis to some extent. Average issue convergence between candidates and multi‐issue, nonmembership groups is the highest of any group type at 0.252, and it is almost (though not quite) the lowest for single‐issue membership groups at 0.127."
"35","But should we consider these levels of issue convergence to be high or low? An examination of issue convergence between the political parties and the candidates running under their labels may help us make sense of this. Because parties are motivated to a large extent by getting their candidates elected, we might consider their degree of issue convergence with candidates to be high. Table 3 shows average issue convergence between the competing candidates, between interest groups and the candidates they support, and between the parties and the candidates they support. Importantly, issue convergence between Democratic candidates and the Democratic Party (0.222) was comparable to convergence between Democratic candidates and multi‐issue nonmembership groups (0.205). The same is true on the Republican side, with Republican multi‐issue nonmembership groups converging with their candidates to a slightly higher degree (0.279) than the Republican Party (0.273). Multi‐issue nonmembership groups, it seems, are acting similarly to parties in terms of echoing the candidates’ issue agendas, though other types of groups show much less issue convergence than the parties do.         "
"36","Table 3 highlights a second important finding, which is that there is higher issue convergence between Republican candidates and groups (0.243) than between Democratic candidates and groups (0.164), a statistically significant difference consistent with our expectations.         "
"37","To better understand the factors that lead to issue convergence between a candidate and a group, we estimate an ordinary least squares model predicting the degree of issue convergence between candidates and groups across all issues. The dependent variable is the convergence score between an interest group and its preferred candidate in a media market/state/2‐week period. The model's predictors included an indicator of whether the group is a membership group; an indicator of whether the group is a single‐issue group; an interaction term between the single‐issue and membership dimensions; weeks to election, with 1 indicating 7–8 weeks, 2 indicating 5–6 weeks, 3 indicating 3–4 weeks, and 4 indicating the 2 weeks prior to Election Day; the number of ads aired by the candidates in the 2‐week block; the number of ads aired by the independent group in that 2‐week block; indicators of whether the Democratic or Republican candidate is an incumbent; an indicator of competitiveness, with 1 indicating a race ranked by Congressional Quarterly as too close to call; year indicators for 2010 and 2012; and an indicator of whether the group is Democratic‐leaning."
"38","Table 4 shows the estimates from the model predicting issue convergence between the group and its preferred candidate. Most importantly, the results for group type (demonstrated in Table 2) hold up when we include controls. Figure 3 displays the predicted convergence scores for each of our four group types, along with confidence intervals. The figure makes it clear that single‐issue membership groups are most likely to exhibit loose cannon behavior, diverging from their favored candidates’ issues in favor of their own issues. Multi‐issue nonmembership groups, on the other hand, are most convergent with candidate issue agendas, exhibiting loyal foot soldier behavior. Issue convergence for such groups is predicted to be about 0.100 higher than for single‐issue membership groups.         "
"39","Predicted Convergence Score Based on Group Type"
"40","One qualification is that all groups might wait to converge until later in the campaign after observing the issue debates between the candidates. Our model estimates, however, do not support this idea, as the week variable is not a statistically significant predictor."
"41","Some other results are also worth noting. First, and as hypothesized, Democratic groups have lower convergence scores with their favored candidates than do Republican groups. Second, increases in the number of interest group ads increase convergence, whereas an increase in the number of candidate ads has no impact on convergence. Finally, groups converge with their preferred candidates more when the race is competitive."
"42","There is one caution, however. We have suggested that when issue convergence is low, it is because interest groups are injecting new issues into the campaign. Our earlier results implicate single‐issue groups most strongly here. However, because we know that single‐issue groups appeal to fewer issues overall, lower levels of convergence should be expected. A complementary test is needed to confirm whether single‐issue membership groups introduce issues that were not similarly adopted by their preferred candidate.         "
"43","We counted the number of times a candidate and group jointly mentioned an issue in the various 2‐week blocks for each Senate race. For all three years, 56% of all issue mentions from single‐issue membership groups were on issues not also noted by their preferred candidate in that 2‐week block. The same statistic for multi‐issue nonmember groups is 47%. The difference between these percentages is statistically significant (p < .05). These numbers indicate that lower issue convergence from single‐issue membership groups is not just a sign of advertising on a smaller number of issues, but on a set of issues not also being promoted by the group's preferred candidate."
"44","When candidates and groups discuss the same issues in campaign ads, who is leading whom? One explanation for high issue convergence is that groups follow the lead of candidates, acting as loyal foot soldiers. Another explanation is that candidates are pulled into an issue debate because of the advertising of their group allies. Low issue convergence, by contrast, may result from groups injecting new issues into the campaign, regardless of what the candidates are talking about, acting as loose cannons. But low convergence may also indicate a “division of labor” whereby a candidate talks about certain issues and supporting groups talk about other issues.8 It is also possible that candidates and groups operate independently in terms of their issue agendas, both responding to issues raised by the news media or the public salience of an issue.         "
"45","To speak to these possibilities, we estimate four models. Two (one for each party) predict group attention to an issue as a function of previous candidate and group advertising on that issue, and two (one for each party) predict candidate attention to an issue as a function of previous group (collapsing across groups) and candidate advertising on that issue.9 For these analyses, the data are at the level of the market/group/week/issue. We switch from 2‐week to 1‐week periods to better reflect the time it takes for a campaign to produce a response to an opponent's ad and to increase the number of time periods so as to enable time‐series analysis. We then calculate the number of ads referencing each issue by each group and its preferred candidate in each market and week. The dependent variables in these models are ad counts.         "
"46","Using these data, we are able to see whether and to what extent a group's attention to an issue correlates with both on its own and its preferred candidate's attention to that issue in prior weeks. We are also able to see whether a candidate's attention to an issue correlates with both on its own and its supporting groups’ attention to that issue in prior weeks.10 We estimate time‐series models in which the key independent variables in each model were the 1‐week and 2‐week lags of same‐party candidate or group attention. The models also contain two lags of the dependent variable to address serially correlated errors (Beck and Katz 2011). We include fixed effects in these time‐series models to account for their panel nature.         "
"47","The model estimates, shown in Table 5, reveal that groups do appear to respond to candidates’ issue attention in the previous time block. The volume of Republican candidate issue mentions in each of the two previous weeks is a significant predictor of Republican group issue mentions, and the same is true on the Democratic side. The size of the previous‐week effect is almost twice as large, however, in the Republican model.         "
"48","There is also evidence that candidates follow the issue agendas of groups. Republican groups’ advertising on an issue has a small but statistically significant association with Republican candidate advertising on that same issue in the following week (b = .057). Group advertising 2 weeks prior has a similar relationship (b = .066). The Democratic model also shows a significant effect of group advertising 1 week prior on candidate advertising, and the effect size (b = .050) is similar to that for Republicans. In sum, we have evidence of loyal foot soldier behavior on the part of both Republican and Democratic groups."
"49","The idea of a division of labor would be supported if the coefficients on a group's or candidate's previous issue mentions were negative, that is, a group's or candidate's mentioning an issue in the past makes it less likely that their counterpart mentions that issue. But that idea is unsupported, as the coefficients on the variables indicating the behavior of the other actor are all positive. Thus, we reject the idea that candidates and groups are responding to each other by dividing up the issue agenda."
"50","Table 6 breaks down our previous analysis by group type. We expect that multi‐issue nonmembership groups would be most likely to follow the candidates’ issue agendas, and that is what we find. Candidate issue agendas in the previous week positively predict the issue agendas of multi‐issue nonmembership groups, and the coefficient on the variable (b = .065) is the largest of any group type. There is also evidence that multi‐issue membership groups are following candidates, as both the coefficient for the prior week and the coefficient for 2 weeks prior are positive and statistically significant. Single‐issue groups, whether membership based or not, did not echo the issue agendas of the candidates.         "
"51","To provide further evidence on the question of issue leadership, we provide in the supporting information a secondary analysis that uses vector autoregression (VAR) to assess Granger causality."
"52","Although we present evidence of leadership and followership between groups and candidates, the effects are not overwhelming in magnitude. Is there anything else, then, that can explain issue convergence between the two when they do converge? One answer is the salience of the issue, which has already been identified as an important driver of convergence (Kaplan, Park, and Ridout 2006; Simon 2002). Table 7 shows estimates from two models, one predicting candidate‐group convergence on the Democratic side and the other doing the same on the Republican side. These models are at the issue level, and thus convergence is calculated by differencing the sponsor's proportionate attention to the issue in the fall campaign and dividing by the summed proportions across sponsors. Salience is measured through responses to the “most important problem” question from Gallup polls taken in each year (see the supporting information for details). In the Republican model, salience is a positive and significant predictor of issue convergence. Thus, when the public cares more about an issue, both Republican candidates and groups appear to respond by talking more about that issue, resulting in higher issue convergence. Moreover, the coefficient on the interaction of salience with multi‐issue nonmembership groups is positive and significant in both the Democratic and Republican models, which suggests that these groups—which we have argued should have the most freedom to choose their own issue agendas—are the most responsive to issue salience of any group type.         "
"53","Our research has produced several important findings. First, we found low to moderate levels of issue convergence between candidates and their allied interest groups. The two actors are, by and large, not speaking about the same issues. Still, we must acknowledge that this finding is, in part, driven by our measurement strategy. By using 60 different issue topics to assess overlap in topics, we set the bar for convergence high since, for example, ads that talk about jobs and ads that talk about minimum wage have a lot in common but nevertheless count as mentions of different issues."
"54","Our second finding is that variation in levels of convergence between an interest group and its preferred candidate is a function of the group's organizational characteristics, namely, whether the group focuses on a single issue and whether it has members. We find that multi‐issue nonmembership interest groups are more likely than single‐issue membership groups to focus on issues similar to their preferred candidates, and the level of issue convergence between candidates and the former is similar to levels of party‐candidate issue convergence. In short, groups like Priorities USA and Crossroads GPS are acting similarly to parties, partially matching their issue discussions to that of the candidates they support. This may be unsurprising given that many of these groups are essentially run by former party officials or by top politicians’ associates and is consistent with other examinations of 527 committees (Skinner, Masket, and Dulio 2013). Our evidence is the first that contextualizes the issue content of these groups’ participation in electoral politics. In acting like party committees, they are not distracting viewers with new issues but rather engaging voters with the same issue debates being promoted by the campaigns directly.11"
"55","The bottom line of this analysis is that fears about candidates’ issue agendas being distorted may actually be less likely in today's post–Citizens United regulatory environment than before because of the types of organizations that have been encouraged. Multi‐issue non‐membership groups—increasingly common in contemporary campaigns—are more likely to address the same issues as the candidates than are their older interest group counterparts and to address them in rates more similar to parties. In fact, the degree to which they converge with candidates on issues in some cases exceeds candidate‐party issue convergence.         "
"56","A third finding of our research is a partisan difference, with the issue agendas of Republican candidates and their groups converging at higher levels than Democrats. This finding is consistent with the media narrative from recent campaigns and with literature on the parties’ different organizational cultures, which describes the Democratic Party as a coalition of interests and the Republican Party as more unified."
"57","Who is leading issue convergence, groups or candidates? Our time‐series models suggest that both can be leaders, but the extent to which a group leads or follows varies depending on the type of group. Multi‐issue nonmembership groups—and to some extent, multi‐issue membership groups—do much more to echo the issue agendas of candidates than do the single‐issue groups. This finding is consistent with our theoretical argument that multi‐issue nonmembership groups are less constrained by donors and reputations in the choice of issues to campaign on than are single‐issue membership groups, which must worry about maintaining their brands and making their members happy. Some of the issue convergence between multi‐issue nonmembership groups with their preferred candidates, then, results from their echoing what those candidates said in the previous week. Reinforcing the arguments of the candidates—rather than competing with them—certainly helps to keep voters focused on a smaller number of arguments, presumably smart campaign strategy. Thus, some of the convergence is due to groups taking cues from candidates. Some of the convergence comes from candidates taking cues from groups, according to our time‐series models."
"58","Our findings also point to a third driver of issue convergence: the salience of the issue. Not only does public concern about an issue correlate with candidates and groups converging on discussion of that issue, but that convergence is most likely to occur for multi‐issue nonmembership groups, which have the freedom to address issues that are salient in the news media and in the minds of voters. We noted in the introduction a real fear from campaign operatives that outside advertising would steer the issue agendas of candidates. There is little in our findings, however, to suggest a widespread pattern of candidates engaging on issues that groups have defined as important. And multi‐issue groups—those most likely to be super PACs and 501(c)(4)s at the center of the firestorm post–Citizens United—are actually more responsive to candidate agendas than other groups.         "
"59","Overall, our findings about group issue involvement in campaigns suggest both good and ill for the American voter. As Goldstein, Schweidel, and Wittenwyler (2012, 1753) argue:            "
"60","In the post‐Citizens United environment, an issue or theme has greater potential to be promoted even where a candidate might prefer not to raise that issue. This would suggest that meaningful political speech is in fact more open and more accessible than it once was.               "
"61","The positive result, then, is that voters may be exposed to discussion of additional issues given the many groups involved in competitive races, though our findings are clear that a group's discussing an issue does not necessarily imply that the candidates themselves will discuss the issue."
"62","Of course, when campaigns feature discussion of more issues, the potential for voter confusion rises (Lipsitz 2013). Group advertising in the current era may both direct voters’ attention in many directions and make it difficult for voters to hold candidates accountable for what they say. As Rozell, Wilcox, and Madland (2005, 163) argue:            "
"63","When interest groups frame the issues, attack the character of candidates, and otherwise run shadow campaigns, accountability suffers. Candidates are not responsible for the claims and attacks in the advertisements, and it is more difficult to hold candidates to campaign promises when those promises are made by interest groups and not by the candidates themselves."
"64","This tendency toward more speech and more diverse speech, however, may be counteracted by the types of groups encouraged by Citizens United. These groups are more likely to converge with candidates on their issue agendas than older, more recognizable single‐issue groups. At the end of the day, plenty of concern may be directed at how super PACs are funded, at how disclosure laws limit accountability for 501(c)(4)s and unknown groups (Dowling & Wichowsky 2015; Johnson, Dunaway, & Weber 2011), and how groups undermine party influence (e.g., La Raja 2013). Our findings, however, suggest that less ire should be directed at the influence of multi‐issue nonmembership groups on the issue agenda when they enter a campaign and work to convince voters of the merits or weaknesses of candidates. These groups, it turns out, are not dissimilar to parties in terms of their issue overlap with the candidates they support.         "
