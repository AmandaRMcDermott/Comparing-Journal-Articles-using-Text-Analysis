"1","A key first step in analyzing the moral dissolution of political authority is to clarify what follows from such dissolution. As my opening example of the military coup in Chile was meant to suggest, if a given (de facto) government does not have a compelling normative claim to authority over its citizens, it does not follow that disobeying the government is always permitted (let alone that disobedience is required, or that it is required with regard to all laws issued by the government). Rather, the dissolution of political authority means that citizens should not have a strong moral presumption that they must suspend their own practical judgment when confronted with the law. When political authority dissolves, each citizen (at least in principle) ought to weigh the balance of moral reasons for and against compliance with the law in any given case. In some cases, this balancing task will be simple (e.g., when considering laws that enforce basic moral prohibitions, such as laws against murder or assault). In other cases, the balancing task may be more complex (e.g., when payment of legally mandated taxes supports some just policies but also supports other, unjust policies). But the point is not that this task of balancing moral reasons for and against compliance will always yield a conclusion of disobedience. The point is rather that, when political authority obtains, and the duty to obey the law qua law accordingly exists, citizens do not (normally) face this balancing task at all.10 Only when this duty vanishes does the “moral ball,” we might say, return to each citizen.         "
"2","Equipped with this understanding of the relationship between the dissolution of political authority and disobedience, we can turn to the connection between political authority and democracy. I indicated above that I follow here a democratic equality model of political authority. This label is meant to capture a variety of views on political authority that share three key features. The first is an assumption that each government has a basic moral duty to treat each of its citizens with equal respect. The second is an emphasis on reasonable moral disagreement among citizens regarding the shape that a government's laws ought to take in order to best uphold the idea of equality. However, third, notwithstanding enduring disagreements on many public policy questions, laws must be made that, for practical purposes, settle these disagreements. We may, for example, disagree with our fellow citizens about which tax code best realizes the equality of all citizens, but we must converge on some practical decision as to what the tax system will be at any given time.         "
"3","The democratic equality model aims to show that these three features should lead us to vest egalitarian procedures for making political decisions with moral authority. According to the model, if we combine the basic commitment to equality, the fact of enduring reasonable disagreements on the shape of the laws, and the need for laws that settle these disagreements for practical purposes, we should not only endorse egalitarian law‐making procedures. We should also (with some important exceptions, discussed in a moment) treat these egalitarian procedures as binding upon us, even where we find their substantive results to be unjust.         "
"4","There are different ways to argue for this thesis. Thus, for example, on one view (Christiano 2008), to attempt to impose our public policy judgments on an unwilling majority amounts to a failure to recognize that others’ moral judgments about public affairs are just as credible as ours; such a unilateral attempt therefore constitutes a failure to respect others as equals. Another view (Viehoff 2014) emphasizes that if we need to make laws together despite continued disagreement about their content, then our choice is ultimately simple: We can let power differentials among us effectively dictate what the laws will be or—assuming we reject this strategy as incompatible with the ideal of relating to our fellow citizens as equals—we can submit to the results of an egalitarian procedure that will neutralize these morally irrelevant power differentials as much as possible. Yet other views emphasize different variants of egalitarian ideas (see, e.g., Waldron 1999). But the core point all of these views share is that disobedience to the results of an egalitarian political procedure normally amounts to a failure to respect the equality of our fellow citizens.         "
"5","Normally, however, does not mean “always.” This is where important exceptions to the authority of egalitarian political procedures come in, and with them the idea of systemic effects. An egalitarian political procedure can yield substantive outcomes that are not merely suboptimal from the point of view of equality but, much more drastically, are incompatible with any plausible interpretation of the value of equality. Thus, for example, when two political camps disagree over whether gender equality requires affirmative action laws (or over which such laws does gender equality require), each camp can recognize that the claims of the other camp are (or at least might conceivably be) rooted in a genuine acceptance of the value of equality. This is not the case, however, if one side demands gender equality, but the other insists that marital rape must not be seen by the law as a crime. Accordingly, even if the camp that supports such discriminatory measures wins a perfectly free and fair election, it would be difficult to show that value of equality itself requires citizens to defer to the laws it enacts.         "
"6","In turn, once we recognize this point, we can see why the democratic equality model should be interested in the idea that laws that are deeply flawed can have systemic effects, dissolving general political authority. At least, something like systemic effects seems to follow when the relevant laws are fundamental—when these laws have a considerable impact on many individuals’ circumstances and life plans.11 Morally untenable fundamental laws make it that much harder to explain to a citizen who believes that any piece of government legislation is unjust, why she has a duty to obey the law qua law.12"
"7","The same thought can be motivated in another way. The democratic equality model holds that only democratic governments can have general authority over their citizens: The model thus ascribes a special moral power to such governments. But this power should be assigned with considerable caution. We should not automatically treat any de facto government as having this moral power simply because it displays some of the important hallmarks of democracy. If we insist that major substantive policies beyond the moral pale have systemic effects, this helps to guard against the bar of democratic political authority being set too low. Moreover, such insistence captures our sense that appeals to a government's democratic credentials ring hollow when fundamental laws it enacts (or retains) flatly ignore morality's most basic demands.         "
"8","However, as I emphasized above, although the thought that fundamental laws can dissolve a government's general authority is attractive, it is also not simple to ground. Accounting for the systemic effects of deeply flawed laws—however fundamental—is not a trivial task. I now turn to this task."
"9","My aim in this section is to show that initially promising ideas, which we might first invoke to explain the systemic effects of flawed laws, do not work as well as we might hope."
"10","Let us begin by focusing on a paradigmatic example of a specific set of fundamental laws that are clearly beyond the moral pale. Consider, then, the legal institution of slavery in the antebellum United States. It is uncontroversial to say that American citizens had no moral duty to respect the legal institution of slavery. But some additional step is needed in order to explain why precisely the institution of slavery had systemic moral implications, undermining the general authority of the U.S. government. Arguably, the most natural additional step will be to point to the pervasive impact of slavery on American society, including this society's core economic activities and basic way of life.         "
"11","However, the global conviction—that the very worst forms of government conduct toward outsiders can dissolve political authority at home—poses a problem here. This conviction suggests that the pervasive impact argument is lacking. The reason is that we can imagine laws that replicate the same egregious wrongs in their treatment of outsiders, but that do not have anything like a pervasive practical impact on the lives of citizens within the polity. Sticking with the case of slavery, we can easily imagine, for instance, a society that has laws clearly perpetuating slavery beyond its borders without these laws having a discernible impact on its domestic affairs. This society may allow slave trade as long as the slaves are not citizens, and it may incentivize, benefit from, and perpetuate trade in goods produced by slaves who are not citizens. However disturbing the relevant laws might be in such a case, they will not necessarily have a serious impact on economic activity or everyday life within the society. Therefore, even if the relevant laws are clearly ones that citizens have no presumptive duty to uphold, the appeal to pervasive impact cannot, by itself, explain why such laws have systemic effects—why these laws undermine citizens’ general duty to defer to the law qua law.         "
"12","Let us turn to consider an alternative, individual complicity explanation of systemic effects. According to this explanation, major laws that are deeply morally flawed have systemic effects because they mean that when supporting the system of laws in general—paradigmatically, by paying taxes—individual citizens become complicit in wrongs inflicted by their government. The guiding idea here is that, through compliance with the law, each citizen makes a causal contribution to the polity's wrongdoing, and if a critical mass of citizens acted as they ought to, this wrongdoing would stop.13"
"13","The individual complicity argument suffers from two main problems. First, the argument might work when we think about “classic” wrongs of which a government could be guilty in its foreign conduct, such as predatory wars funded by citizens’ tax contributions. Yet the argument seems significantly weaker when considering those severe global wrongs in which one's government may be implicated, but which it may not be able to end on its own. Consider again the case of international slave trade. One's polity may incentivize, perpetuate, and benefit from international slave trade, as well as from international trade in goods produced by slaves; but many other polities might be similarly implicated in these practices. Therefore, even if one's polity ended its entanglement in the practices of slavery, these practices might persist due to other countries’ actions. However, it strains credulity to saddle each individual citizen with a meaningful causal connection to (let alone with a clear ability to end) the wrongs of foreign regimes. To insist on this point, of course, is not to excuse a polity's entanglement in international practices such as slave trade, nor to say that such entanglement leaves a government's authority unscathed. Rather, it is to say that individual complicity arguments cannot be the correct explanation of why such entanglement undermines a government's general authority.         "
"14","The second problem goes deeper. The individual complicity argument tries to explain why we may override the authority of some specific laws (e.g., tax laws) that have a causal connection to other specific laws (e.g., laws and policies pertaining to unjust wars). But, notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, this is not really an explanation of systemic effects. For one thing, when trying to account for systemic effects, we are not trying to account for why we may override the authority of some specific laws. Rather, we are seeking an explanation of why the severe moral failure of specific substantive laws means that there is no authority to override: What we wish to know is why, given such localized failure, the general authority of the law qua law disappears, just as it disappears when democratic procedures are destroyed. Additionally, to explain systemic effects is to show that the moral failure of some laws can undermine the moral authority of the entire legal system, not only of those particular laws that are causally connected to the relevant failure.         "
"15","If what I have said in the preceding paragraphs is right, then neither the pervasive impact argument nor the individual complicity argument can offer a compelling explanation as to why major flawed laws have systemic effects. Accordingly, I now turn to develop an alternative explanation, first showing its value in the domestic context, and only then moving to the global level."
"16","The alternative that I wish to propose focuses on the following thought. If fundamental laws that are heavily flawed have systemic moral implications—if they dissolve a government's general authority—this is because of a basic inconsistency that these laws trigger. More precisely, I wish to suggest that such laws expose elected governments to a charge of a profound inconsistency in their exercise of political power. Elected governments that enact, retain, or pursue fundamental laws that clearly violate any plausible interpretation of the value of equality are thereby violating the moral principles that underlie their own general claim to authority. This argument, I believe, provides the best account of how deep moral failures of specific major laws undermine a government's general authority.         "
"17","As a first step in developing the argument, let us consider an issue that may initially seem quite distinct: the way in which elected governments’ abuse of public power for private ends undermines their general authority. Imagine a party that wins a free and fair election, yet proceeds to abuse its power once in office. The party's top brass—occupying all senior government offices and enjoying firm control over legislation—commit grave wrongs on a routine basis. The minister running the treasury practices constant tax evasion. Another senior minister regularly solicits massive bribes. Another minister still illicitly exploits inside information, known only to those within his government department, to make a fortune in the stock market once a month. And so on up to the prime minister, who (let us say) engages in outright nepotism, selling exploration rights for the country's most valuable natural resources to a corporation controlled by his relatives for a fraction of the real value of these rights. To make things worse, however, let us suppose further that senior government members not only abuse its powers through such illicit acts, but also develop a culture of impunity: They seek to prevent publication of their misdeeds, abusing their powers over the security services to intimidate potential whistle‐blowers.         "
"18","It seems highly intuitive to think that there is going to be some point at which the elected government's “long train of abuses” will run so deep that it will undermine its general authority.14 We do not need to try to identify this point with perfect precision. All we need is to note that this tipping point—where the government will lose its general moral claim to authority over ordinary citizens—will come long before its conduct corrupts the country's institutions entirely. The government's abuse of power would undermine its general claim to authority much before its misdeeds cover every aspect of social and political life. But how can we explain this intuition regarding the systemic moral effects of abuse of power?         "
"19","The following explanation seems the most forceful. The government's abuse of its power undermines its authority because it effectively replaces the rule of law with the rule of persons.15 For a rule of law to exist, all members of the polity, including those who wield effective political power, must be bound by the law. Once this ceases to be the case, it is no longer the law that rules, but rather particular individuals who rule over others.         "
"20","Despite its promise, however, this explanation still requires more detail. First, it is important to note that—at least from the perspective of the democratic equality model—the objection to a “rule of persons,” as distinct from a rule of law, has to be driven by a more fundamental concern with equality. In turn, the best way to elaborate this egalitarian concern is the following. The government's abuse of power has systemic moral implications that extend beyond the specific laws it is violating (i.e., this abuse destabilizes its political authority much more broadly) because it flatly contradicts the principles that underlie the government's own general claim to authority. After all, this general claim is supposed to be rooted in equality: An elected government is supposed to be able to justify its authority to enact laws by appealing to the egalitarian credentials of the electoral process through which it gained power. It is in virtue of these credentials that we normally say citizens who disobey democratically enacted governments fail to respect the demands of equality.16 But elected governments can hardly claim to take these demands seriously themselves if they blatantly violate the law while insisting that others obey it.17"
"21","Now, how do we make the move from the moral analysis of elected governments breaking the law to the analysis of cases where elected governments enact the wrong kind of fundamental laws? Fortunately, this move should not be too difficult. Even if elected governments’ lawbreaking can be distinct in principle from elected governments’ enacting the wrong kind of laws, the two can—at least sometimes—be indistinguishable in their normative status. Moreover, the two can—at least sometimes—be understood through exactly the same normative perspective."
"22","To see these points, consider again a scenario of rampant government corruption. Suppose that the top echelons of an elected government repeatedly break the law by soliciting numerous massive bribes from foreign firms, in exchange for favorable treatment of these firms’ interests, and also systematically abuse their powers to try to suppress reports of this widespread practice. If we follow the reasoning developed above, then we should be led to the conclusion that such abuse of power undermines the government's general authority. But now imagine that instead of violating legal prohibitions against bribery, the government's top echelons simply cancel these prohibitions or even announce new laws that require firms that wish to do any kind of business with state entities to transfer sizable sums to ministers’ personal bank accounts. It seems fairly obvious that our conclusion should remain the same in the latter case, where the elected government is enacting what are clearly the wrong kinds of laws, rather than violating the law. And we can ground this identical conclusion quite easily if we focus on the fact that both types of cases feature a deep inconsistency in the government's exercise of power. Both feature a blatant disregard for the demands of equality, whether by violating laws that the government demands everyone else upholds or by exempting the members of government from the reach of the laws ex ante, without any plausible moral justification. In turn, by exhibiting such brazen disregard for the demands of equality, elected governments in both cases flatly ignore the moral principles that underlie their own general claim to authority."
"23","So far, I have presented the inconsistency account of systemic effects in the context of fundamental laws that relate to domestic affairs. But we now need to ask whether this explanation can capture the global conviction as well. Can the inconsistency argument also explain why laws that are fundamental in their impact on outsiders might have systemic effects?         "
"24","I believe the answer is yes. The key to this answer lies with the following idea: that the equality of all citizens, on which the democratic equality model pivots, is itself at least partly derived from universal human equality. If a government ought to treat all of its citizens as equals, this is at least partly because of the basic moral equality of all human beings."
"25","This universal derivation of domestic equality, as we might call it, is present in the work of various contemporary theorists. Robert Goodin's work provides one particularly explicit example. As Goodin (1995, chap. 1) notes, we have the firm conviction that government officials ought to treat all citizens as equals, insofar as they must discharge their public roles in a strictly impartial manner, without singling out some subset of the citizenry for special treatment. But the demand that government officials treat all citizens impartially ultimately derives from morality's demand of universal impartiality: It is ultimately “general duties” toward all human beings—“that we have toward other people, merely because they are people”—that yield “special duties” toward particular subsets of humanity, such as special duties to compatriots (Goodin 1988, 663).         "
"26","Goodin's main argument for this thesis is that we have a general moral duty to advance the interests of all human beings, but this duty is best discharged when divided among agents who are each made responsible for advancing the interests of some specific portion of humanity:            "
"27","A great many general duties … are pursued more effectively if they are subdivided…. Sometimes the reason this is so has to do with the advantage of specialization…. Other times, it has to do with lumpiness in the information required to do a good job.… And still other times it is because there is some process at work … that presupposes that each person will have some particular advocate and champion.… [I]t is simply the case that our general duties toward people are sometimes more effectively discharged by assigning special responsibility … to some particular agents. (Goodin, 1988, 681)               "
"28","This understanding of special responsibility as derivative responsibility allows us to see why, despite the widespread recognition that states have special duties toward their own citizens, there is ultimately nothing unique about compatriots:            "
"29","The duties that states … have vis‐à‐vis their own citizens are not in any deep sense special. At root, they are merely the general duties that everyone has toward everyone else worldwide.… Citizenship is merely a device for fixing special responsibility in some agent for discharging our general duties vis‐à‐vis each particular person. (Goodin 1988, 681–82)               "
"30","Goodin's approach, however, is not the only way to see the equality of all citizens as at least partly derived from universal human equality. A related approach focuses on the morally relevant features that qualify all citizens for equal treatment from their government.18 The main thought here is that at least some of the relevant features are universal—that a government's moral duty to equally respect all of its citizens stems from attributes that all citizens have in equal measure simply in virtue of their humanity.         "
"31","Theorists of different persuasions might conceptualize these attributes differently. Certain philosophers, for example, might describe the relevant attributes as “equal moral status” or “equal moral dignity.” Others might point more specifically to the practice of mutual justification that is essential to human interaction and that presupposes interlocutors’ equal standing (Forst 2011). And still others might emphasize that a government treats its citizens as equals when it equally respects each citizen's interest in leading a fulfilling life—an interest that every human being has (Dworkin 2002). While these diverse formulations might be theoretically distinct, for our purposes here, what matters is their common upshot: At least to some significant extent, a government ought to treat all of its citizens as equals simply because of features that all human beings equally possess, rather than because citizens belong to any distinct group of human beings (be it ethnic, racial, religious, or otherwise).         "
"32","It is worth stressing that this universal derivation of domestic equality can be endorsed from a wide variety of theoretical perspectives and is compatible with a broad range of normative views. Among other things, this ecumenical feature is due to the fact that one can endorse the universal derivation (i.e., one can think that the equality of citizens is at least partly derived from universal human equality) without going all the way to full derivation. It is possible to endorse the universal derivation even while conceding (arguendo) that a government may have other salient moral reasons, apart from those tied to universal human equality, to treat all of its citizens as equals. Similarly, in line with “statist” arguments (e.g., Blake 2001), it is possible to endorse the universal derivation even while accepting that the equality of all human beings may not have policy implications that are completely analogous to those that follow from the equality of citizens.         "
"33","It should be fairly obvious why I have spent multiple paragraphs on the universal roots of domestic equality. For if it is indeed the case that the equality of all citizens that underlies the authority of elected governments is itself derived at least in part from the equality of all human beings, then elected governments pursuing policies that flatly contradict any reasonable interpretation of the requirements of universal human equality expose themselves to the same charge of inconsistency that we have been discussing. Ordinary citizens can complain to elected governments pursuing such laws in much the same way as they can complain with regard to domestic laws. Ordinary citizens can argue that fundamental laws that clearly contradict universal human equality flatly contradict the moral principles underlying the government's own general claim to authority. The same charge of inconsistent exercise of political power that the democratic equality model enables at the domestic level thus reappears at the global level."
"34","It will be helpful, however, to develop this parallel in slower motion. We can do so by starting with an extremely intuitive thought: that fundamental laws that manifestly fail to respect some citizens as equals undermine these citizens’ general moral duty to obey the law qua law. It is hard to say to racial minorities who are the obvious victims of racist fundamental laws, for instance, that they have this kind of general duty.19 The inconsistency argument can easily capture this thought, as follows. Elected governments that enact or retain fundamental laws that fail to respect some citizens as equals are inflicting a grave injury upon these citizens. But elected governments that also appeal to the same value of equality, as a way of insisting on their victims’ general moral duty to obey them, are adding, through their manifest self‐contradiction, an insult to the injury they are already imposing. That is why it is morally offensive for elected governments to say to the victims of their racist policies, for instance, that equality itself requires that the victims obey the law qua law.         "
"35","This inconsistency claim, however, already contains the seeds of its own extension. This is because, when they pursue fundamental laws that clearly fail to align with any plausible interpretation of the value of equality, elected governments necessarily engage in a broader kind of self‐contradiction, going beyond the direct victims of the relevant laws and involving other citizens as well. Therefore (to continue with the running example), it might be especially morally offensive for elected governments to argue that, because of the demands of equality, the victims of their racist policies ought to obey the law qua law. But, at least on the inconsistency argument, it is also morally offensive for such governments to appeal to equality as an explanation of why other citizens—even those who are not the obvious victims of their racist policies—ought to obey the law qua law.         "
"36","What follows from all this is that the inconsistency argument has broad ramifications not only in terms of the laws that fall within its scope, but also in terms of the people that fall under its purview. According to this argument, citizens do not have to be direct victims of major laws that are deeply morally flawed in order for such laws to undermine their general moral duty to obey the law qua law. What matters is not this kind of direct effect. Rather, what matters is whether the relevant laws implicate an elected government in a manifest violation of the egalitarian principles that underlie its own claim to authority.         "
"37","Once we put this point center stage, it should be clear why the inconsistency argument has global implications. For if an elected government acts beyond its borders in a manner that flatly contradicts the moral principles underlying its own general claim to authority, then this contradiction undermines the government's general authority over its own citizens, even though citizens themselves are not the direct victims of the relevant governmental conduct.         "
"38","If what I have said up to this point is correct, then the inconsistency argument allows us to see how the democratic equality model can align with the global conviction. The model can show why the most severe forms of wrongdoing in which a democratic government might be implicated beyond its borders have systemic effects, dissolving its general authority at home."
"39","But when we consider the democratic equality model from a global perspective, we should try to expand our view further, going beyond the very worst forms of foreign conduct. Once we have a satisfactory account of systemic effects, we should use it to also try to advance our thinking about more difficult cases, where our initial intuitions are less secure. In the introduction, I suggested as an example of such a difficult case the U.S. involvement in the military coup against Chile's elected government. What might the inconsistency explanation of systemic effects imply for such a case?"
"40","The answer should be fairly clear. The determination of the elected government of the United States to ensure the overthrow of Allende's democratically elected government flatly contradicted the egalitarian principles that were supposed to underlie the authority of the U.S. government itself. Moreover, this contradiction was especially manifest when considering the repeated willingness of the United States, during the Cold War, to overthrow multiple democratically elected governments of whose substantive policies the United States disapproved. Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s, Brazil in the 1960s, and Nicaragua in the 1980s provided only some of the most (in)famous instances.20 This systematic policy would have made hollow any attempt by the U.S. government to appeal to its democratic credentials to justify its general authority (This systematic policy would have made hollow any attempt by the U.S. government, to appeal to its democratic credentials to justify its general authority ‐ to explain why its own citizens ought to obey its own law qua law).         "
"41","Now the Cold War, to be sure, is no longer with us. However, it is still the case that the elected government of the United States and the elected governments of many other countries currently enact, pursue, or retain some laws and policies that are fundamental in their impact on outsiders. Yet at least some of these laws and policies flatly contradict any plausible interpretation of universal human equality. Therefore, these laws and policies ultimately conflict with the moral principles underlying the relevant governments’ own claim to authority. And this in turn means that we should at least contemplate the possibility that these laws and policies dissolve these governments’ authority over their own citizens.         "
"42","Three brief examples should suffice by way of illustration. One useful example, which has already received attention from a number of global justice theorists, concerns the customary transactions in state‐owned natural resources, ongoing between various odious regimes and corporations based in established democracies. The customary policy of virtually all established democracies is to recognize whoever wields effective monopoly over the use of force within a given state as legitimate vendors of the state's natural resources, “regardless of how violently they came to power and how badly they exercise it” (Pogge 2010, 177).21 This customary policy flatly contradicts any plausible interpretation of universal human equality, in several ways. For one thing, this policy legitimates a condition where some individuals in foreign countries—those best equipped with the means of violence—assert a de facto hierarchy over their conationals, whom they subject to the most extreme forms of oppression and destitution, thanks to their control and abuse of natural resource wealth that is supposed to be public property rather than their private property. This customary policy toward outsiders, furthermore, also contradicts universal human equality insofar as no established democracy would ever apply it to its own citizens.22"
"43","Another important example concerns affluent democracies’ massive‐scale purchases of goods produced in foreign sweatshops. It seems safe to assume that even the most modest conception of universal human equality has to include some minimal provisions for the protection of the bodily integrity of all human beings and the supply of minimally adequate nutrition. These minimal conditions are violated in an extraordinarily large number of sweatshops that produce a vast range of products consumed in affluent democracies. Hence, it seems at least prima facie plausible to think that the laws of affluent democracies that allow the massive‐scale purchases of such products, despite full knowledge of the conditions in which they are manufactured, contradict the idea of universal human equality.23"
"44","Yet another example is human trafficking. In June 2014, the U.S. State Department, defining human trafficking as the “recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining a person for compelled labor or commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud, or coercion,” estimated the number of victims of such practices to be 20 million men, women, and children. Yet despite this staggering number, many democracies still feature at best limited efforts to enact or enforce meaningful legislation to combat human trafficking.24"
"45","These three examples are arguably far from unique. But, if the reasoning I have developed throughout is sound, these examples should suffice to give at least presumptive force to the thought that the current response of many democratic governments to realities ongoing beyond their borders dissolves their own authority within their borders.         "
"46","Now, over the last several paragraphs, I have been careful to suggest this dramatic result only in tentative form. One reason for this caution is simply that while I think there are key commonalities tying together the examples that I have just described, I do not have the space here to fully rule out the possibility that there are also salient differences among them. Another reason for caution here has to do with the unfolding of political processes. We can imagine, for example, an elected government that displays credible evidence of its commitment to enact and enforce just laws concerning ongoing global practices, but that faces a variety of real‐world obstacles, ranging from morally flawed policies entrenched by political inertia to collective action problems that hinder agreements with the leaders of other countries. My argument is compatible with thinking that where such obstacles are obviously present, we may (sometimes, at least) give elected governments the benefit of the doubt, insofar as their general authority is concerned."
"47","However, even bearing these allowances in mind, some readers might very well worry that my claims about systemic effects are ultimately too radical to be plausible. I want to end by anticipating two variants that this worry might take. One variant has to do with the thought that governmental moral failures abroad often feature (formal or effective) silence of the law in the face of wrongdoing, rather than laws that officially call for wrongdoing.25 And some may think that the latter is much more likely to have systemic effects than the former.         "
"48","I do not mean to deny that there are contexts where this distinction matters. Sometimes, there might be a genuine moral distinction between the law's officially calling for wrongdoing and the law's simply being silent in the face of wrongdoing. But we should be very careful not to overestimate the normative weight of this distinction.26 Take again the case of women's rights discussed in the opening section. Imagine a society in which women are treated as the property of their husbands, enjoy little protection against sexual assault, and are generally viewed as manifestly subordinate to men anywhere from the workplace to the household. We should be willing to say that a democratic government that formalized any such discrimination in the law would thereby lose its moral claim to authority. But then why not say the same if the government's laws are simply silent (formally or in practice) in the face of such pervasive and widely known discrimination? And if we are willing to reach this conclusion about domestic cases, why not reach a parallel conclusion at the global level? We are willing to say, for instance, that laws officially designating certain outsiders as slaves and protecting the “property rights” of traders who “purchase” these outsiders dissolve a democratic government's authority. Then why not say the same about laws that are (formally or effectively) silent even when global trade in human beings is known to be extremely prevalent?         "
"49","Some readers may want to grant all of this but still insist that my account is too radical, for a different reason. The reason is that this account still leaves too much space for moral disagreements that could have dramatic practical implications. Thus, for example, what should we do when we disagree on whether a given flawed law is “fundamental” enough to dissolve authority? Or when we disagree on the severity of the law's moral failure? Or when we disagree in our assessment of how much genuine effort a given elected government is putting into reform of fundamental flawed laws?"
"50","My main response to such concerns is that some significant level of moral indeterminacy, and therefore moral disagreement, is inevitable with regard to many of the questions that we have been considering, in a way that goes far beyond the specific model that I have defended. Thus, for example, no account of political equality can meaningfully aim to settle all disagreements over the range of morally plausible interpretations of equality. But the inevitable space for moral disagreement that this fact engenders does not lead us to shy away from discussing political equality and its implications. The same thought obtains, more specifically, with regard to the democratic equality model of political authority: Even if the model necessarily leaves certain practical questions without a precise resolution, it nonetheless provides a useful critical standard with which to assess real‐world politics."
"51","This critical standard is demanding. But I believe it is demanding to the right degree—a degree that encourages both hope and humility. It encourages hope because we can certainly imagine a future (perhaps not an impossibly distant future) in which all fundamental laws of all elected governments will clearly be compatible with some plausible interpretation of the value of equality, and in which these governments will accordingly have a compelling claim to authority.27 But this account also encourages humility because it pushes us to consider the possibility that such a vision is still not realized—and, in fact, may be far from realized—in the present. We would do well to take this possibility seriously, and to orient our moral efforts accordingly.         "
