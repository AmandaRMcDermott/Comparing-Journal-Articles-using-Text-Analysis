"1","State repression is most often understood as the result of a cost‐benefit analysis by political authorities. The main benefits are considered to be the sustained access to rents following from the maintenance of political office and power. States, in other words, are assumed to be seeking a continuation of the status quo and political quiescence in the population (Davenport 2007b).8 Based on this fundamental interest, authorities will make assessments of the threats to their rule and the costs incurred as well as benefits gained by engaging in various policies to defeat challengers.         "
"2","In the decision‐making process, rulers have to assess the various tools at their disposal, ranging from draconian repression and infringing on physical integrity rights to more moderate repressive measures, granting symbolic concessions, or buying off possible opposition through private side payments and social benefits. The options for and costs of applying various measures for maintaining the status quo may vary between governments, depending on the skills and expertise of the repressive apparatus or the perceived threats which might vary in type and severity.9 The last is typically believed to be the most important (e.g., Davenport 1995; Hibbs 1973; Pierskalla 2010).         "
"3","For example, if threats are perceived to be large and the costs associated with staying in power are substantial, then political authorities will consider it necessary to make large investments in measures to counter the threat. Overall, it is assumed that the larger or more significant the threat, the more likely the state will be to apply repressive measures, all else being equal. It is, however, necessary to also take into account how threats can be diffuse or specific, and how this might be important for understanding repressive action taken by the state. Related to this, recent work has suggested that the repression decision calculus is guided not only by the overarching structure of the political economy and the type and frequency of behavioral challenges put forward against it, but also by who precisely is challenging authorities (e.g., Davenport et al. 2011). In the Davenport et al. study, the ethnic or racial characteristics of perceived challengers are important for the degree of threat perceived and the likely repressive response from the state. This specification of the theoretical understanding of repression is important because it suggests that governments are not only mechanistically responding to dissent, terrorism, and insurgency but also to the identity of the perpetrators of this activity—and that this factors into the calculus of the nature of the threat and the chosen response.         "
"4","We propose that in order to properly specify the likely cost‐benefit analysis behind states’ decision to repress, states actively monitor and factor in the size of its youth cohorts and consider youth bulges a significant threat that can be costly to ignore. We also suggest that because youth bulges are relatively predictable, the possibility of preemptively acting to prevent problems escalating due to demographic pressures becomes viable as well as economical."
"5","To date, existing research has been focused more on the costs of repression than upon the benefits.10 In looking for relevant cost factors, scholars have mostly examined how structural characteristics are related to state repression. For example, researchers find consistent support for an effect of political democracy (Davenport 2007a; Davenport and Armstrong 2004; Hibbs 1973; Poe and Tate 1994). The cost of repression is believed to be higher in more democratic societies where citizens can hold leaders accountable for and sanction repressive behavior; similarly, the cost of coercion is lower in authoritarian regimes. The relationship between regime type and repression is empirically supported.         "
"6","Some recent attention has been given to various external structural factors such as the influence of signing and ratifying international treaties (e.g., Hafner‐Burton 2005b; Hathaway 2002), naming and shaming (e.g., Hafner‐Burton 2008), and international trade (e.g., Hafner‐Burton 2005a). These factors also impose costs on repressive leaders and therefore reduce the amount of repression they apply. Findings on these issues, however, have been mixed.11"
"7","Common for the structural focus on costs to leaders is how governments tend to be viewed as reactive actors, responding to constraints imposed on them. We suggest that with respect to the effect of youth bulges, authorities can also be explicitly proactive. Given an emerging youth bulge, governments are unlikely to ignore an impending threat to the status quo and also unlikely to remain passive in this situation. Although they may implement various policies to deal with a large youth cohort, we propose that an increase in state repression should be expected. Below, we outline how youth bulges affect the cost‐benefit analysis of states’ decision to repress and, hence, why states may turn to repressive measures when faced with a youth bulge."
"8","Observations of a link between youth and political violence have a long legacy, and the evidence of such a link is extensive. Young people, particularly males, dominate insurgent armies, protests, images of terrorists and rioters, and are the most frequently associated with violent crime. This lends initial credibility to a youth‐rebellion connection. Goldstone (1991, 2002) has argued that youth bulges have historically been associated with political crises and revolutions and that youth played a prominent role in political violence from the English Revolution to the revolutions of 1848. Although both England and France expanded their education systems as a measure to deal with the large youth cohorts, the flood of graduates could not be absorbed by the labor market and became a source of social instability and unrest (Goldstone 1991, 248). The work by Goldstone and others echoes a long‐standing literature on the critical role of youth in radical political movements. It is thus well‐known that youth play a prominent role in antiregime movements (Cohn and Markindes 1977; Lipset 1968).         "
"9","Just after September 11, 2001, well‐known commentator Fareed Zakaria suggested that the fact that the Arab world is going through a massive youth bulge could explain Islamic resurgence, and he drew parallels to the French Revolution and the 1979 revolution in Iran. According to Zakaria (2001), a large number of “restless young men” usually gives rise to a new politics of protest. Today, almost 70% of Iran's 68 million citizens are under the age of 30, and the vast majority of them are liberal and antiregime (Cohen 2006). The Iranian regime “seeks to prevent these political sentiments from exploding into full‐scale revolution by imposing restrictions on civil liberties” (2006, 3) or, in other words, engaging in state repression. Huntington (1996) also points a finger at youth in general, and males in particular, as a problem, identifying them as a key ingredient within his clash of civilizations thesis. High birth rates in the Muslim world from the 1960s to the 1980s foreshadow the youth bulge which suggested to Huntington that the Muslim world would see increasing violence as these generations reached the ages of 16 to 30 years.12"
"10","Systematic empirical evidence has revealed a relationship between youth and political violence in various ways.13 For example, Mesquida and Wiener's (1999) path‐breaking research finds that the ratio of men between the ages of 15 to 29 years, relative to those above 30 years of age, is associated with both the occurrence of conflict as well as the severity of the activity. Related to this, Urdal's (2006) work also finds that youth bulges significantly and substantively increase the possibility of internal armed conflict, terrorism, and rioting.         "
"11","Given the robustness and substantive importance of these results, it is intriguing that no studies have investigated whether or how youth bulges may be associated with state repressive action. Indeed, this is particularly curious given that political leaders are more than aware of the rebellious potential in a youthful population.14 Therefore, the shadow of a contentious future suggested by a large number of political “at‐risk” youth should lead states to attempt to protect the status quo through repressive means.15 This seems especially probable as demographic changes are relatively predictable and slow moving: knowing birth rates and infant mortality rates makes it possible to predict future youth bulges with reasonable accuracy.         "
"12","We thus derive the following hypothesis concerning the direct relationship between youth bulges and state repression:            "
"13","Rather than respond to any and all youth bulges, it is possible that repression will become particularly likely beyond some “critical threshold”—i.e., the relationship between youth bulges and repression is nonlinear. Fuller and Pitts (1990), for instance, noted that unrest arises when the age cohort of 15–24 years reaches 20% of the total population, and the same critical threshold was later suggested by Huntington (1996).16 If states are attentive to the possible threshold effect of youth bulges on social unrest, they might turn to repressive action only when the youth bulge approaches the 20% mark or some other threshold. This leads to our second hypothesis:            "
"14","We not only expect the direct effects outlined above, but we also expect two interactive influences to be important."
"15","The first interaction concerns political dissent and youth bulges—repression when overt dissenting behavior is already underway. This acknowledges the fact that the perception of threat maintained by political officials does not simply involve overt manifestations of behavioral threat and the latent threat of youth bulges—viewed independently. Rather, authorities can be sensitive to the fact that, within contexts where youth bulges are present, situations of political unrest could quickly escalate out of hand. In other words, challenging activity might seem all the more threatening to political authorities in a context of large youth cohorts. Accordingly, we expect that when protest, rebellion, or insurgency is underway and youth bulges are present, political authorities should be even more inclined to engage in political repression. Based on this, we posit the following hypothesis:            "
"16","The second interaction of interest concerns political institutions and youth bulges—fighting the youth with inclusion rather than repression. This hypothesis captures the fact that when faced with large youth cohorts, political authorities in democratic states do not have the same incentives as more authoritarian regimes to rely upon repressive action to handle the situation. Democratic state authorities generally have stronger restrictions on executive power, such as institutional checks and balances on government activity, than do autocracies. Government coercive action can come with a particularly high premium in democratic states, as repressive leaders risk being ousted in elections (Davenport 2007a). Instead, democratic regimes could attempt to minimize disruption by bringing the potential challengers back into the fold—for instance, by appealing specifically to young people during elections or channeling the youth into less disruptive activities (Earl 2003; Gamson 1975). Of course, the interest in including youth, and ability to do so, is also a function of organizational capacity. As such, authoritarian governments have less interest and less ability to channel the youth into peaceful participation, while full democracies may have both a stronger interest and greater capability.17 Democratic regimes are therefore likely to be more hesitant to use repressive activities to deal with a youth bulge. Based on this, we posit the last hypothesis:            "
"17","Of course, we acknowledge that repression is not the only way that governments could respond to the “problem of youth.” As an alternative or a supplement, states can also choose other means to respond, or they can use a combination of repression and other policies intended to quell opposition and to create quiescence (Moore 2000). For example, the fundamental basis for the expectation that youth cohorts are problematic is that the large cohorts will lead to stronger competition for finite resources (such as education, jobs, housing, etc.). Grievances that emerge from a lack of access to these resources can then spur a violent uprising, as the deprived see violence as a means to redress social and economic grievances, following the basic logic of a relative deprivation model of conflict (Gurr 1970). Anticipating this, authorities may try to appease large youth cohorts by introducing financial, educational, or other incentives to meet the grievances (e.g., Gamson 1975). This includes using higher education programs, job creation, or financial redistribution or establishing patriarchal networks and corruption to gain footholds and loyalties in important segments of the youth. Such approaches may simultaneously decrease the opportunity costs of joining a rebellion, as outside options for the youth worsen (Gates 2002). The focus of this study is, however, on repressive options.         "
"18","Below, we discuss how we go about examining the propositions developed above."
"19","To test the hypothesized relationship between youth bulges and state repression, we use a cross‐sectional time‐series research design, which is consistent with earlier research on both topics. The unit of analysis is the country year, and the dataset covers a maximum of 180 countries in the period 1976–2000.18"
"20","To measure repressive behavior, we use the Political Terror Scale, or PTS (Gibney, Cornett, and Wood 2011; Gibney and Dalton 1996).19 This is the most commonly used measure of state repression in the studies we build upon (e.g., Davenport and Armstrong 2004; de Soysa and Nordås 2007; Hafner‐Burton 2005a, 2005b; Poe and Tate 1994; Poe et al., 1999; Wood 2008).            "
"21","As conceived, the PTS is a 5‐point categorical indicator of state violations of physical integrity rights.20 The scale is defined as follows:               "
"22","The PTS coding is based on two sources: the U.S. State Department and Amnesty International. The sources have slightly diverging coverage, and both have been criticized for possible biases. Specifically, it has been argued that State Department reporting reflects political considerations and the interests of the United States to protect itself from the criticism of its allies and countries in which the United States has an interest (Poe et al. 2001, 650). Similarly, Amnesty International has been criticized for being too uncritical in their reporting on socialist regimes (Wood 2008, 500). Particularly in the earlier years of reporting on human rights abuses (1970s and 1980s), there is a nonrandom divergence between the political terror score based on Amnesty International reports and the U.S. State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (Poe et al. 2001). To address these issues, we run models based on Amnesty International PTS(A) and the State Department PTS(S) separately.22 In our sample, the correlation between PTS (S) and PTS(A) is 0.79.23"
"23","Youth bulges are exceptionally large cohorts of individuals in the age group of 15 to 24. The mean proportion of this cohort in the sample is about 30% and varies between a low of 11.6% (Monaco in 1990) and a high of 45% (Cape Verde in 1985)."
"24","To evaluate Hypothesis 1, we use a measure of youth bulges from Urdal (2006) as our main explanatory variable. He defines a bulge as existing where one can find “large cohorts in the ages 15–24 relative to the total adult population” (Urdal 2006, 608; emphasis added), defined as persons 15 years old and above.24 Earlier measures of youth bulges by such scholars as Huntington (1996), Goldstone (2002), Fearon and Laitin (2003), and Collier and Hoeffler (2004) all measured the size of youth cohorts or male youth cohorts relative to the total population. The latter could be problematic as it underestimates the problem of demographic “bottlenecks” in countries with continued high fertility (and hence high rates of young children).25 We therefore utilize Urdal's (2006) improved measure.26"
"25","To evaluate Hypothesis 2 based on the assertion from both Huntington (1996) and Fuller and Pitts (1990) that there is a threshold effect whereby youth bulges become problematic for states only when they reach a certain “critical level,” we run models including a squared measure of youth bulges.27"
"26","The main controls in this study are similar to those used in previous studies of state repression (e.g., Davenport and Armstrong 2004; Poe and Tate 1994): regime type, economic development, population size, ongoing armed civil conflict (intrastate), and levels of dissent. We also use different indicators for some of these dimensions for robustness checks. Each control variable is discussed briefly below.            "
"27","First, it is a well‐established finding in the literature that democracy is positively related to respect for personal integrity rights (e.g., Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2005; Davenport 1995, 2007a; Hibbs 1973) and hence lower levels of state repression. Using the Polity database (Marshall and Jaggers 2005), Davenport and Armstrong (2004) established that there is an important threshold effect for when democracy matters for curbing repression: on and below a specific high value of democracy (7 on the Polity measure), there is no impact; above this value, there is a strong and negative influence in two distinct phases (one exerted at levels 8 and 9 as well as one exerted at level 10). Based on this, we follow the convention from Davenport and Armstrong (2004) and include a dummy for Polity scores 8–9 and a dummy for a Polity score of 10. These dummies have been found to be significantly different from the Polity scores below 8 in predicting repression and also statistically significantly different from each other (Davenport and Armstrong 2004).            "
"28","Other structural characteristics of states have also been found to predict repression, such as population size and development (e.g., Mitchell and McCormick 1998). We therefore control for total population size (natural log) and development measured by GDP per capita using data from Penn World Tables, both measures from Urdal (2006).            "
"29","Previous studies have found that ongoing conflict activity may increase the risk that leaders will repress their citizens (Davenport and Armstrong 2004; Landman 2005; Poe 2004). We therefore include a dummy variable for ongoing intrastate armed conflict, using the Uppsala and PRIO Armed Conflict dataset (Gleditsch et al. 2002). A related finding is that dissent could increase repressive action (Davenport 1995; Hibbs 1973). Hence, we control for the annual number of antigovernment protests, riots, or strikes involving more than 100 persons from Banks (2002) following Wood (2008). This measure varies between 0 and 46 in our sample.28"
"30","In a data structure like the one used here, there is likely no independence between all observations, and we should expect that previous repression levels within a country matter for currently observed levels. Several studies find that a lagged dependent variable (LDV) of repression is highly significant (Davenport 2007a; Poe 2004), and we therefore run statistical models with LDVs, indicating the level of repression in the previous year (LDV = 2, LDV = 3, LDV = 4, LDV = 5).29"
"31","Following de Soysa and Nordås (2007) as well as others, we use an ordered probit model, as our dependent variables are categorical and ordered and close to normally distributed.30 Acknowledging that there might be problems of highly correlated errors within panels, each model is run with the Huber‐White corrected robust standard errors clustered on countries.            "
"32","We control for temporal patterns by including year dummies. One reason for this is that human rights data may be affected over time by the increased sophistication of the technologies of detection as well as other time‐dependent biases (Poe, Vasquez, and Carey 2001). Year dummies can also take care of other unobserved factors, such as the end of the Cold War or global policy shifts that may affect human rights through the process of diffusion of norms and increased activism across the globe (Keck and Sikkink 1998; Simmons and Elkins 2004).31"
"33","Essentially, we are interested in answering two questions regarding youth bulges and their direct influence on state repression and two questions about possible interactive effects between youth bulges as well as regime type and dissent. Each will be discussed below."
"34","To test Hypothesis 1, we include as our main explanatory variable the measure of youth bulges, indicating the share of 15–24‐year‐olds to the total adult population (15 years and older),32 and we use two separate dependent variables (DVs) for state repression. These dependent variables are the 5‐point Political Terror Scale based on Amnesty International, PTS(A), and the Political Terror Scale based on the U.S. State Department reports, PTS(S). Initial bivariate regressions of youth bulges on the repression measures (not reported) confirm the expectation that there is a strong, statistically significant relationship.            "
"35","Table 1 presents multivariate ordered probit (oprobit) analyses of youth bulges and state repression measured two different ways: PTS(S) and PTS(A). The models are reported with a lagged dependent variable, i.e., the level of repression in the previous year (repression t‐1), with robust standard errors clustered on country, and year dummies (not reported).            "
"36","Based on our theoretical discussion, we expect a higher youth bulge to be associated with higher state repression (Hypothesis 1). Models 1 and 2 provide strong support for this hypothesis, as youth bulges are indeed positively and significantly related to higher levels of repressive behavior."
"37","From the results, it is clear that the effect of having a large youth bulge is substantive. Based on Model 2 in Table 1, we run a predicted probability of reaching a level 4 on the PTS(A) repression variable for a nondemocratic government with no ongoing civil war and the rest of the variables in the model held at their mean. We chose to focus on reaching level 4 because this is the point at which large segments of the politically active population are affected by severe repression, such as political imprisonment and political murder.33 The baseline probability of reaching this level of state repression is 5.7% at the 25th percentile level of youth bulges (23.9), whereas at the 90th percentile (36.9), the probability is increased to 11.2%, a near doubling. Graph 1 illustrates the increase in the predicted probability of PTS = 4 at different levels of youth bulges based on Model 1 in Table 1.            "
"38","Among the findings, the control variables perform largely as expected. In line with previous studies (Davenport and Armstrong 2004), the highest levels of democracy (Polity = 10 and Polity at levels 8 and 9) are associated with significantly lower levels of repression relative to Polity scores ≤ 7 as a reference category. More populous states consistently engage in higher levels of repressive behavior, as found by de Soysa and Nordås (2007). We find that states are more likely to repress citizens when there is an ongoing intrastate conflict in the country. This variable is a statistically and substantively important predictor of government coercion. We also find a consistently positive and significant relationship between the level of dissent activity and repressive behavior. Population size is a consistent predictor of repression levels, with increasing repression associated with larger populations. Additionally, the level of repression in the previous year is a strong predictor of repression in the current year. Our expectation that richer countries (in terms of higher GDP per capita) are likely to have lower levels of state repression is not consistently substantiated by the models in Table 1 (a finding that is reflected in earlier work). This may be partially accounted for by the association between youth bulges and level of development (correlation of 0.698). However, running a likelihood ratio test of Model 1 with and without youth bulges shows that the addition of the youth bulge measure contributes significantly to improved model fit.            "
"39","We ran Model 1 using different control variables as a robustness test (see the online supporting information). When this is done, the youth bulge measure is robust across the alternative specifications. For example, the results for youth bulges remain highly significant (at the 1% level) if we exchange GDP per capita with infant mortality rates (IMR) or use the Polity scale34 as an alternative measure of democracy, in line with earlier studies (e.g., Davenport 1999; Hafner‐Burton 2005a, 2005b; Saideman et al. 2002). Other variables have also been introduced without changing the results.35 The results are also robust to additional controls for temporal patterns.36 We tested the alternative measure of youth bulges (measured as 15–24‐year‐olds relative to the total population). Regardless of what is done, the main finding still holds. In sum, therefore, based on Models 1 and 2 above and various robustness tests, we have a strong indication that the relationship between youth bulges and repression is in line with Hypothesis 1: youth bulges are associated with higher state repressive action.            "
"40","This question builds on the proposition from Huntington and others that the “critical level [for youth rebellion] is the point at which youths make up 20% or more of the [total] population” (1996, 259ff). In line with this argument, when societies cross the threshold, we should expect violence as well as state repression as an attempt to preemptively meet the demographic threat. To test whether there is a threshold effect, we run models with a centered and a squared measure of youth bulges in order to explore any nonlinear relationships (Models 3 and 4, Table 1).37 We also test a dummy for youth bulges above the “critical threshold” of 20% (not reported).            "
"41","When this is done, we find that Models 3 and 4 do not yield significant support for the hypothesis about a nonlinear effect of youth bulges on state repression, and the coefficient for the squared terms of youth bulges is even negative.38 The coefficient for the squared term of youth bulges in Model 3 is weakly statistically significant in the opposite of the expected direction. Graph 2 shows the predicted probability of reaching level 4 on the PTS scale at various levels of youth bulge to the total population by using the controls in Model 3 and holding the other variables at their mean and civil conflict as well as democracy at zero.            "
"42","Graph 2 illustrates that there does not seem to be a threshold effect at a youth bulge of 20% of the total population or more (or at any other percentage), as the graph does not show an increase on or around 20%. The relationship between youth bulges on repressive state behavior seems to be linear, with a leveling off at the high end.            "
"43","Hypotheses 3 and 4 proposed that there might be interaction effects to consider. First, we argued that the response by governments to youth bulges might be conditional on the actual level of behavioral challenge they are experiencing. Second, we argued that different regime types might respond to youth bulges in different ways, specifically that democracies may be more reluctant to use repression when faced with a youth bulge than what authoritarian regimes would be."
"44","Model 1 in Table 2 shows the results for an interaction between dissent and youth bulges. Here, we coded a dummy variable for whether there were dissident events in the country year (1) or not (0). When the interaction term is not included in the model, this variable is positive and a significant (at the 1% level) predictor of state repression. The inclusion of the interactive term renders the dummy for dissent negative and insignificant, while the interaction is positive but only marginally statistically significant (at the 10% level). As an alternative test of Hypothesis 3, we also ran an interaction with ongoing civil conflict. We find no significant interaction effects. These findings give very limited support for Hypothesis 3 that states will increase repression more in contexts of manifest dissent than contexts of no overt dissent; in addition, this effect will be stronger the larger the youth bulge in the country happens to be. The relationship between youth bulges and repressive action does not seem conditional on actual displays of dissent, which indicates that preemptive repression may indeed be at play.            "
"45","Turning to the hypothesized interaction between regime type and youth bulges on state repression (Hypothesis 4), Models 2 and 3 in Table 2 show the interaction effects based on a dummy of democracy (Polity scale score 8–10; Model 2) and the full Polity scale (Model 3). Both analyses show that when we introduce the interaction terms, the effect of democracy (Polity) remains unchanged and the youth bulge measure remains positive and highly significant, while the interaction terms are positive and significant. This indicates an interaction effect of regime type and youth bulges. Graphing this relationship (Graph 3, below), holding intrastate conflict at zero and all other variables at their mean reveals that the predicted probability of PTS level 4 increases monotonically for nondemocracies (Polity score below 8), but within democratic governments, the response is delayed (i.e., the youth bulge must be at a higher level before repression increases).            "
"46","This can be interpreted as giving support to the notion that democracies have mechanisms and incentive structures that dampen the repressive impulse of political authorities. Although not eliminating the effect of youth bulges on repressive behavior (the effect of youth bulges on state repression is also positive and significant for democracies), democratic regimes are only likely to respond with coercion at relatively higher levels of youth bulges. Although the effect of youth cohorts seems to operate across regime types, the findings within Table 2 still lend some support to Hypothesis 4 that the relationship between youth bulges and state repression is stronger in nondemocratic states than in democracies.            "
"47","There is a long‐standing awareness that youth bulges can affect revolutions, protest, and rebellion. However, in existing literature, the state is generally conceptualized as a passive actor. In the study of political repression, the topic of demography in general has been underdeveloped, and the issue of youth bulges in particular is largely ignored. The current study has been directed toward filling this gap. Within this article, we conceptualize the state as being quite active, seeing youth bulges as an imminent threat to the status quo too costly to ignore. In line with this view, we hypothesize that political authorities faced with a youth bulge are, all else equal, more likely to apply repressive measures against their populations than states with a less threatening population‐age structure. We also propose that governments will focus their attention on youth bulges because youth are more likely than other age groups to rebel. A youth bulge should therefore signal to authorities that sociopolitical control may be needed to maintain order."
"48","Employing a statistical analysis of the relationship between youth bulges and repression from 1976 to 2000, we find strong support for our main hypothesis. When faced with a large group of youth between the ages of 15 and 24, governments are more likely to engage in repressive action (e.g., diverse rights restrictions as well as arrests, disappearances, and violence). This relationship is found across regime types and both in contexts of overt dissent or not. The effect is also largely linear, which contradicts the proposition by Huntington (1996) and others that there is a threshold effect at which youth bulges start to matter. Finally, we find that the relationship between youth bulges and state repression is direct. It is not only an artifact of particular regime types; it is also not found solely in interaction with actual levels of dissent.         "
"49","With these results, our study has important implications for future research. First, based on the current findings, subsequent work should consider demographic factors more seriously when trying to explain repression, and youth bulges should be included in future models. Second, future research should continue to explore diverse ways that youth cohorts might interact with other variables and disaggregate governments’ decision‐making processes. For example, authorities may be more repressive in their response to protest before and during a youth bulge in order to prevent behavioral diffusion across the bulge. Last, and perhaps most important, this research indicates that the commonly seen implicit assumption in the state repression literature of political authorities as being passive actors is probably inaccurate. Indeed, our findings suggest that states proactively set repression levels to hedge against a perceived threat that has not yet materialized in terms of behavioral challenges (protest). This is indicative that future research should continue to more explicitly model states as proactive."
"50","While attentive to the strengths and potential directions of our work, we are also attentive to the limitations. For example, it would be useful for us to identify government efforts to identify and track youth cohorts. We are aware of a few that seem to support our argument (e.g., the Ministry of Youth, Culture and Sport in Rwanda right after the genocide and civil war; the events in many Middle Eastern and North African countries such as Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia; and the extensive interest in African American males throughout U.S. history), but it would be useful to identify a wider range of cases. It is also possible that certain state policies affect demographic trends in ways that may, down the line, affect the likelihood of youth bulges (e.g., policies of female literacy and improved sanitation). As discussed briefly in the theoretical discussion, governments may also choose to try to deal with the “problem of youth” by attempting nonrepressive measures. Studying the array of strategies (and their intersections), from accommodation to repressive action, could be an important extension of the current research. Education, job and sports programs, and similar ways to occupy youth, as well as government incentives for property ownership and early child rearing, may be attempted by authorities in their efforts to appease the youth and address the potential youth bulge problem. Such dynamics of state strategies during a youth bulge are a promising avenue for future research. Indeed, there are likely numerous ways that governments fight the youth, and for us to better understand the topic, it would be useful to identify as well as track these different strategies."
