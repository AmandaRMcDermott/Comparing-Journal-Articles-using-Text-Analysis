"1","Ethnocentrism divides the world into two opposing camps. From an ethnocentric point of view, groups are either “friend” or they are “foe,” eliciting loyalty and favoritism on the one hand or suspicion and disdain on the other. Ethnocentrism is commonly expressed through stereotypes. Stereotypes capture, or rather seem to capture, the characteristics that define a group, that set it apart from others. Most often, such characteristics have to do with underlying dispositions—temperament, intelligence, trustworthiness—the deep core of human nature (Allport [1954] 1989; Fiske 1998).         "
"2","To measure ethnocentrism expressed in terms of stereotypes, we draw upon a battery of questions originally developed by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and included in the 2008 ANES. In these questions, survey respondents are presented with a series of paired antonyms—hard‐working versus lazy—and asked to judge whether members of some designated group—whites—are mostly hardworking, mostly lazy, or somewhere in between. After being asked to judge whites on this score, respondents are asked to make the same judgment, this time about blacks, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans, in randomized order. The procedure is then repeated for a second dimension: intelligent versus unintelligent. These questions suit our purposes well. Moral character and intellectual capacity are central features of stereotypes in general (e.g., Fiske 1998; Stangor and Lange 1994), and claims of ingroup superiority are often expressed in just these terms (Brewer and Campbell 1976).         "
"3","Based on answers to these questions, we created a scale of ethnocentrism, E. We scored E to range from −1 to +1. A “perfect” score of +1 means that on both traits, “nearly all” members of the ingroup are believed to be virtuous, and “nearly all” members of all outgroups are believed to be virtue‐less. A score of +1 is perfect in the sense that it represents an extreme form of ethnocentrism. A score of −1 is equally perfect, but in the opposite direction: −1 represents a topsy‐turvy world in which outgroups are seen as virtuous and ingroups as utterly without virtue. An overall score of 0, finally, indicates an absence of ethnocentrism; that on average, ingroups and outgroups are indistinguishable.2"
"4","Figure 1 presents the distribution of E among white Americans in 2008. As indicated there, ethnocentrism scores follow the familiar bell‐shaped curve reasonably well. Figure 1 also reveals that the American public is on balance ethnocentric: first, the curve is displaced away from the neutral point to the right, in the ethnocentric direction; and second, the curve is asymmetric, sloping downward less precipitously to the right, toward the ethnocentric point of view.3"

"7","Figure 1 reveals what might be called mild ethnocentrism. On the one hand, ingroup favoritism is common. On the other hand, ingroup favoritism is restrained. No one is prepared to claim categorical superiority: that members of their group are uniformly intelligent and hardworking, while members of all other groups are uniformly stupid and lazy. What we have here is a sense of gentle superiority, widely shared.         "
"8","We know that as a general matter, voters in U.S. presidential elections are motivated by partisanship, policy, and assessment of national conditions. Surely this would be so in 2008. No doubt Obama gained and lost votes because he was a Democrat; gained and lost votes because of the positions he took on major policy matters; gained and lost (mostly gained) votes because of the condition of the country. The multinomial logit results in the first column of Table 1 confirm that these factors all played an important role in the 2008 vote.4"
"9","As expected, party identification shaped the vote more than any other single factor: Democrats were very likely to vote for Obama while Republicans were very likely to vote for McCain. Policy positions mattered in a big way as well, with liberals moving to Obama and conservatives moving to McCain. The condition of the economy also contributed: those who believed economic conditions to be worsening were more likely to sign up for change; economic optimists stayed with McCain. All of this is completely familiar and is documented in existing research on the 2008 election (e.g., Lewis‐Beck and Nadeau 2009; Pasek et al. 2009).         "
"10","What is new in Table 1 is that, taking standard explanations into account in 2008, ethnocentrism matters as well. White voters who scored high on the ethnocentrism scale were much more likely to vote against Obama than were white voters who scored low on ethnocentrism. In the 2008 ANES sample of white voters, scores on the ethnocentrism scale range from –0.5 on the low end to +0.7 on the high end. Across this range, the predicted probability of voting against Obama rises sharply, from 0.46 to 0.88, respectively.5"
"11","Ethnocentrism did not affect all voters in the same way, though. The effect of ethnocentrism on voting against Obama can be seen more clearly inFigure 2, where we display the predicted vote for Obama as a function of ethnocentrism, when its effect is estimated separately for Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.6 As revealed there, the effect of ethnocentrism is most pronounced among Independents; less dramatic but still potent among Democrats; and fades away among Republicans. In 2008, Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Senator McCain regardless of their ethnocentric inclinations. But among Democrats and Independents, as ethnocentrism increased, Obama's prospects plummeted.         "

"14","The importance of ethnocentrism in the 2008 vote is confirmed in a second and entirely independent test. Here we draw on data from the CCAP, the online panel study of registered voters during the 2008 campaign. Key for our purposes, the September 2008 wave of CCAP included instrumentation that allows us to build a good measure of ethnocentrism.7 The CCAP results, shown in column 2 of Table 1, reveal that, just as we saw with NES data, ethnocentrism had a strong, independent, and statistically significant effect on the 2008 vote.8"
"15","This strong connection between ethnocentrism and opposition to Obama, appearing in two independent tests, also shows up across alternative specifications and alternative measures. These additional tests, all based on the 2008 ANES, appear in Table 2. The first column presents results from a simple replication of the vote model, but with vote replaced by the thermometer score rating of Obama. (We carry out these additional tests with the thermometer rating because it offers a more sensitive measure than vote.) As the first column shows, ethnocentrism has a large negative effect on Obama's rating, as expected.         "
"16","The second column of Table 2 entertains the possibility that white opposition to Obama in 2008 was rooted, in part, in principle. White Americans might have said no to Obama not so much because they experienced him as different, but because they saw him as advocating a bigger, more intrusive government. Or, they might have voted against him because they saw him as a radical egalitarian bent on spreading the wealth. Obama did in fact advocate an expansion of government programs, and he did in fact push for progressive tax policies. It would not be surprising to discover that, when faced with a choice between Obama and McCain, voters in 2008 were influenced by their views on government and equality. Nor would it be all that surprising to discover that the effect we have so far attributed to ethnocentrism belongs, in part, to principles.9"
"17","Fortunately, good and reliable measures of Americans’ views on government and on equality were included in the 2008 ANES.10 When we added both to the baseline model, we discovered that there appears to be something to the argument that opposition to Obama was rooted in principle. White Americans who placed a relatively low priority on the place of equality in American society tended to vote against Obama, as did those who were worried over the size and scope of government. But the key point for our purposes is this: taking equality and limited government into account makes virtually no dent in the estimated effect of ethnocentrism (see column 2 of Table 2).         "
"18","What about authoritarianism? Authoritarians are distinguished by their predisposition to submit to established authorities and to support violence against targets sanctioned by such authorities (Stenner 2005). As such, authoritarians might have been drawn to McCain and Palin in 2008, who were much clearer in articulating the view that the world remains a very dangerous place. Moreover, authoritarianism and ethnocentrism are correlated: by valuing uniformity and authority over autonomy and diversity, authoritarians come “naturally” to ethnocentrism (Kinder and Kam 2009; Stenner 2005). Perhaps the story we have been telling about ethnocentrism would be better recast as a story about authoritarianism.         "
"19","Apparently not. When the standard measure of authoritarianism11 is added to our baseline model, the effect due to ethnocentrism barely budges (shown in column 3 of Table 2). Opposition to Obama arises primarily from ethnocentrism, not authoritarianism.         "
"20","We have argued that the best way to conceive of ethnocentrism is as a form of stereotyping, and the best way to measure ethnocentrism is through stereotypes. Accordingly, our principal measure of ethnocentrism, the one we have relied on so far, is based upon Americans’ beliefs about the characteristic attributes of social groups—on their stereotypes. However, given the inevitable fallibility of measurement, it is always prudent to develop additional measures whenever possible. With multiple measures, it is possible to check the robustness of results, to make sure that results are not a product of some undiscovered and unimagined defect of measurement. Hence we created an alternative and second‐best measure of ethnocentrism, drawing on the ANES 0–100‐point “feeling thermometer” scale. Designed to serve as a general‐purpose measure of political evaluation, the thermometer scale asks respondents to rate a series of prominent political and social groups. Counted among these groups in 2008 are whites, blacks, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans. The thermometer scale taps emotional aspects of ethnocentrism more directly than does the stereotype battery, but the parallel in measurement between the two is otherwise close.12"
"21","This second‐best measure (call it E*) is also scored to range from −1 to +1. As before, +1 means that the ingroup is rated very warmly and all outgroups are rated very coldly, 0 indicates that on average, ingroup and outgroups elicit indistinguishable feelings, and −1 means that all outgroups are rated very warmly while the ingroup is rated very coldly. 13 When we substitute E* for E, we find that while the estimated effect of ethnocentrism is reduced, it remains in absolute and relative terms a strong and significant predictor of opposition to Obama (shown in column 4 of Table 2).         "
"22","In both measures of ethnocentrism we have made use of so far (E and E*), the social groups that are the basis for ethnocentric beliefs and feelings are defined by race (popular understandings of race, that is): white, black, Asian American, and Hispanic American. Of course, this is not the only way to partition the social world, and so not the only way to measure ethnocentrism. Race is a good choice: American politics and society have been organized in important ways around racial conflict from the very outset (e.g., Burnham 1974; Myrdal 1944; Smith 1997), and folk theories of race are widespread and consequential (e.g., Devine 1989; Hirschfeld 1996). But race is not the only choice. Indeed, one of ethnocentrism's distinctive features is its versatility (e.g., Levinson 1949). Depending on circumstances, ingroup and outgroup might be defined by religion, language, sex, occupation, nationality, and more.         "
"23","With this in mind, we took advantage of new items appearing in the 2008 ANES to fashion a third measure of ethnocentrism, this one based on religious differences. Respondents were asked to rate Christians, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Atheists on the thermometer scale. Elsewhere in the survey they were asked to report their religious affiliation (if any). We combine the two sets of questions to create a measure of ethnocentrism based on religion, E*R.14 When we estimate the effect of ethnocentrism on ratings of Obama with ethnocentrism based on religion, we find very much the same result as when ethnocentrism is based on race (see column 5 of Table 2).         "
"24","In short, the effect of ethnocentrism on opposition to Obama in 2008 seems to be real. The effect is significant and substantial across alternative measures and different specifications. To many white voters, Obama appeared as an outsider, and as such, unworthy of the nation's highest office.15"
"25","Among the ways that Obama was seen as different, no doubt the most conspicuous was race. When Obama's victory in 2008 was celebrated as historic, it was the election of a black man to the presidency that was taken to be the reason. The morning after the election, the New York Times announced that Obama had succeeded in “sweeping away the last racial barrier in American politics with ease” (Nagourney 2008). To Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Obama's election was “a magical transformative moment … the symbolic culmination of the black freedom struggle, the grand achievement of a great collective dream (Gates 2009, 2, 3). Obama's rise to prominence and power requires us to consider the relationship between ethnocentrism, on the one hand, and racism, on the other.         "
"26","Ethnocentrism and racism are related, but they are not the same. Ethnocentrism is broader. Ethnocentrism is a reaction to outsiders in general. The condescension or disdain that the ethnocentric feels applies to strangers of all varieties. Racism, in contrast, is condescension or resentment directed toward a single and particular group. Racism is both an expression of, and a justification for, a set of specific practices of exclusion and oppression directed at African Americans, from slavery on. Ethnocentrism is a universal human appetite; racism is part of American history."
"27","Ethnocentrism and racism are not the same, but they are related. In particular, we argue that they are causally related. Ethnocentrism is a general readiness to partition the world into allies and adversaries, a way of looking at the social world that paves the way to racism. Putting the same point in a different way, the appeal of any particular prejudice will be greater if a person is already ethnocentrically predisposed. Prejudice of any kind, and racism in particular, is all the more comfortable, all the more satisfying, and all the more sensible for someone given to ethnocentrism. Such a person is         "
"28","                        "
"29","… prepared to reject groups with which he has never had contact; his approach to a new and strange person or culture is not one of curiosity, interest, and receptivity but rather one of doubt and rejection. The feeling of difference is transformed into a sense of threat and an attitude of hostility. The new group easily becomes an outgroup. (Adorno et al. 1950, 149)               "
"30","If this is right—if ethnocentrism enables and motivates racism—then certain empirical consequences follow."
"31","First of all, we should find that ethnocentrism and racism are related but distinct, correlated but not identical. To find out if this is so, we made use of a measure of racial resentment included in the 2008 ANES.16 Racial resentment presumes the existence of differences between whites and blacks in achievement and status and explains those differences as due to deficiencies in black culture. Racial resentment is especially concerned with black Americans’ individualistic shortcomings. From this point of view, blacks fail to display the virtues of hard work and self‐sacrifice that white Americans claim as central to the moral ordering of their own lives and to the life of their society. As expected, racial resentment, defined this way, and ethnocentrism (E) are related (Pearson r = 0.30, p < 0.01).         "
"32","A second observable implication of our claim that ethnocentrism is a cause of racism is this: if we add racism to the standard model, the estimated effect due to ethnocentrism on opposition to Obama should diminish. The effect should diminish, but it should not disappear. Obama was an outsider—was seen as an outsider—for reasons in addition to race. And, although Obama's campaign could not avoid race—Obama embodied blackness—it did the next best thing, which was to attempt to neutralize it. By and large, Obama did not talk about race; did not go out of his way to seek the endorsement of prominent black leaders; spent most of his time in front of white audiences; and avoided the rhetoric of racial grievance and compensation. Throughout the campaign, race “was the thing always present, the thing so rarely mentioned” (Remnick 2008, 83; for a good account of the 2008 campaign, see Balz and Johnson 2009). Accordingly, racial resentment should explain some, but not all, of ethnocentrism's effect on Obama's ratings.         "
"33","The relevant results appear in Table 3. They show, first of all, that racism has a strong independent effect on opposition to Obama, consistent with research on the 2008 election (e.g., Lewis‐Beck, Tien, and Nadeau 2010; Pasek et al. 2009; Piston 2010; Tesler and Sears 2010). Table 3 also shows that, with racism held constant, the direct effect of ethnocentrism is cut roughly in half. These findings support our interpretation. Ethnocentrism leads to racism. Racism, in turn, motivates opposition to Obama. Obama triggers ethnocentrism partly, but not entirely, for reasons of race.17"
"34","Next to race, the most prominent aspect of Obama's otherness had to do with religion. During the 2008 campaign, many Americans came to believe that Obama was Muslim. Never mind that Obama identified as a Christian; that he wrote movingly about his personal search for Christ; that he chose to be baptized in Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago; that he attended services there regularly; that he was married in Trinity United; and that his two children were baptized there. No matter: in November of 2008, at the close of the presidential campaign, significant proportions of white voters—27.2% by one estimate—believed Obama was Muslim. And many more may have had an unconscious or unverbalized belief that Obama was a religious outsider.18"
"35","In this context, religious intolerance, more specifically, anti‐Muslim sentiment, ought to work the same way in 2008 as racism did. This means, first of all, that ethnocentrism and dislike of Muslims ought to be correlated. Conveniently for our purposes, Muslims were among some 25 groups included as part of the 2008 ANES thermometer scale. White Americans were cool toward Muslims, giving them an average score of 49.9. By comparison, Christians received an average rating of 75.2. Of the full set of 25 groups, Muslims were rated above only three: illegal immigrants, homosexuals, and atheists. As expected, this simple measure of attitude toward Muslims is correlated with ethnocentrism (Pearson r = 0.36, p < 0.01).19"
"36","If, as we suspect, opposition to Obama rooted in ethnocentrism was a product, in part, of the mistaken but widespread belief that he was or might have been Muslim, then when we add a measure of anti‐Muslim sentiment to our standard model, we should see roughly the same thing happen with religious intolerance as we saw with racial intolerance. Table 3 indicates that we do. First of all, dislike of Muslims powerfully predicts opposition to Obama (consistent with results reported by Tesler and Sears 2010). Second, with religious intolerance held constant, the direct effect of ethnocentrism is sharply reduced—in this instance, by more than half. In direct parallel to the case of race, the results on religion are consistent with the conclusion that ethnocentrism leads to anti‐Muslim sentiment; that anti‐Muslim sentiment generates opposition to Obama; and that Obama triggers ethnocentrism in 2008 partly, but not entirely, for reasons of religion.         "
"37","What happens when both religious and racial intolerance are taken into account? These results appear in the final column of Table 3. As indicated there, anti‐Muslim and antiblack sentiments each contribute significantly and substantially to opposition to Obama. Moreover, with religious intolerance and racial intolerance held constant, the direct effect of ethnocentrism disappears entirely.20"
"38","This extremely tidy pattern of results, based on our analysis of the ANES, is replicated in fine detail when we turn to the CCAP.21 The replication results appear in the bottom panel of Table 3. What we found to be true in ANES, we find to be equally true in CCAP.         "
"39","We conclude that Obama was marked as different in 2008 in two principal ways: by his race and by his (imagined) religion."
"40","Ethnocentrism is a deep and abiding habit. But this does not mean that ethnocentrism is an inevitable feature of political life. On the contrary, the part played by ethnocentrism in politics is variable, contingent on circumstance. Candidates, issues, and problems come and go, and they often come and go rapidly. Meanwhile, the carrying capacity of citizens and institutions is distinctly limited. At any single moment, only a few topics can become the center of a society's attention. And only some such topics that manage to command public attention lend themselves to ethnocentric thinking. Ethnocentrism is more likely to be activated insofar as there is close correspondence—a “good fit”—between ethnocentrism, on the one hand, and what is taking place in politics that commands attention, on the other. By correspondence we mean primarily that the events or issues or appeals that happen to occupy center stage in political life lend themselves to an ethnocentric point of view. Fit improves, and activation is more likely, when politics is portrayed as conflict between ingroups and outgroups—between the virtuous and alien."
"41","In previous work, we showed that political events and issues can activate ethnocentrism (Kinder and Kam 2009). Such activation often requires some rhetorical frame to focus the ethnocentric lens on the issue, to direct citizens on how to connect distinctions between the ingroup and outgroup with a policy opinion. The ethnocentric lens focuses easily and readily upon differences that can be simply and clearly observed and comprehended, and, we argue, candidate characteristics—particularly those that are easily observable or comprehensible—fit particularly well into this criteria.         "
"42","With ethnocentrism in mind, then, the 2008 election was unusual. In 2008, one of the major party candidates was marked by difference. Obama was black, and he was, to a surprising number of Americans, Muslim. Indeed, he was the embodiment of otherness. If this is right, and if we are right to claim that the potency of ethnocentrism depends on circumstance, then ethnocentrism should not simply matter in 2008, it should matter more in 2008.         "
"43","More compared to what? It is at this point that we exploit the great advantage of the American National Election Studies: the provision of continuity and comparability in the study of American national elections. In every presidential year since 1952, ANES respondents are interviewed before the election and once again afterward, questioned each time in person by a professional interviewer. Each year, adults of voting age are selected into ANES studies through comparable probability sampling designs. And of crucial importance for our project, the standard ethnocentrism scale, E, was included not only in the 2008 American National Election Study, but also in the four preceding presidential ANES studies as well. This permits us to compare the effect of ethnocentrism in 2008 to the effect of ethnocentrism under more orthodox conditions.         "
"44","Table 4 reports the results of comparable vote models estimated separately for each of the five most recent American presidential elections: Bill Clinton's victory over George H. W. Bush in 1992; Clinton's defeat of Robert Dole in 1996; George W. Bush's paper‐thin victory over Al Gore in 2000; Bush's defeat of John Kerry in 2004; and Barack Obama's victory over John McCain in 2008. Every election is, of course, unusual in some degree. But with respect to the activation of ethnocentrism, we say that 2008 stands alone, and that for the purposes of an empirical test, the four presidential elections that immediately precede 2008 provide an adequate comparison set.22"
"45","Table 4 shows that, as expected, ethnocentrism played an important part in the 2008 election—but not elsewhere. The effect of ethnocentrism on the vote is effectively zero in 1996, 2000, and 2004. Against expectations, the effect of ethnocentrism is statistically significant in 1992, though, consistent with expectations, smaller than the effect in 2008. Altogether, these results support the general proposition that the activation of ethnocentrism depends on the political circumstances of the times.23"
"46","A second and distinct test of activation takes advantage of the 2008 Democratic nomination contest. Recall that Senator Clinton entered the season as the presumptive nominee. She enjoyed the backing of her party, an experienced and professional staff, endorsements from prominent African Americans, money to burn, and widespread public support. In a tight and fiercely contested race, it was Obama who eventually emerged victorious, of course, but in the early spring of 2008 the outcome was far from clear."
"47","Hence it made perfect sense for respondents in the March wave of the CCAP to be asked about two hypothetical races: one between McCain and Obama (should Obama turn out to be the Democratic nominee) and the other between McCain and Clinton (should Clinton prove victorious). In March, both contests were hypothetical but both were realistic. Comparing the importance of ethnocentrism across the two allows us to test activation while holding important factors constant: the state of the economy, the ongoing war, and the identity of the Republican opponent."
"48","Perhaps this is a hard test for us, since, after all, Senator Clinton—Hillary Clinton—embodied another dimension of otherness through her sex. Perhaps ethnocentrism ought to be directed toward her as well as Obama. However, in prior work (Kinder and Kam 2009), we found that ethnocentrism is not activated in the domain of gender, possibly because women as a broad social grouping are less susceptible to demonization than other social categories such as race, religion, and sexual preference. Hence, we suspect that the ethnocentrism effect will be directed toward Obama, not Clinton.         "
"49","And this is what we find. Table 5 provides estimates of the effect of ethnocentrism in each of two hypothetical matchups. In column 1, we see the familiar result: in the contest between McCain and Obama, ethnocentrism stands out as very important. In column 2, the familiar result disappears: in the contest between McCain and Clinton, ethnocentrism has no effect at all.         "
"50","That said, was Obama helped or hurt by ethnocentrism? This question may seem odd. Up to this point, we have concentrated on ethnocentrism as a force working against Obama. Yet, it is entirely possible that voters who reject ethnocentrism might have been especially attracted to Obama. Figure 3 shows that Obama does indeed pick up support (relative to what Clinton would have received) among the small proportion of white voters who score below –0.05 on the ethnocentrism scale and loses support (relative to what Clinton would have received) among those who score –0.05 or above on the ethnocentrism scale (roughly 82% of the sample).24 On balance, ethnocentrism hurts rather than helps Obama, since the former are vastly outnumbered by the latter.         "

"53","In short, the part played by ethnocentrism in American politics can be large or small, depending on conditions. Candidate characteristics, we say, can be a particularly clear and powerful means of triggering ethnocentrism. By virtue of Obama's otherness—his race and his imagined religion—the conditions were right in 2008. Ethnocentrism was activated. Obama paid a price."
"54","Ethnocentrism is a deep‐seated habit of thinking that partitions the world into ingroups and outgroups—into “us” and “them.” Defined this way, ethnocentrism is pervasive in the United States and around the world. Previous research has established that Americans differ from one another in their level of ethnocentrism and that this difference has important consequences for the positions they take on a wide range of government policies (Kinder and Kam 2009). Here we investigated whether ethnocentrism might also have an important part to play in American presidential elections, selecting the 2008 contest, and the candidacy of Barack Obama, as a likely case in point.         "
"55","As we suspected it would, ethnocentrism emerged from our analysis as a potent short‐term force in 2008. Faced with a choice between John McCain and Barack Obama, voters were swayed by the usual and familiar play of factors—party identification, views on policy, the state of the economy—but also by one unusual and unfamiliar factor: ethnocentrism. The effect of ethnocentrism on the white vote was significant, substantial, and robust. Many voters looked at Barack Obama in 2008 and saw an outsider, a black man committed to a strange religion."
"56","Ethnocentrism is a deep‐seated habit, but the part it plays in politics is contingent on circumstance. By virtue of his race and religious convictions, Obama turned the 2008 American presidential election into an exceptional case, one that activated ethnocentric sentiments powerfully."
"57","We do not mean to suggest that only candidate characteristics can trigger ethnocentrism. Indeed, in prior work (Kinder and Kam 2009) we showed that political events and policy framing can activate ethnocentrism across a range of policy domains. Candidates, parties, and interest groups have various ways to signal alignment with and opposition to various social groups: by proposing particular policies that visibly favor some groups at the expense of others; by emphasizing or neglecting problems that are of special concern to a particular group; by keeping certain company, spending time in the public eye with iconic representatives of one group or another; and more.         "
"58","We may have stumbled upon one such case ourselves. Contrary to expectation, we found an effect of ethnocentrism in the 1992 presidential election, albeit a modest one. Perhaps this finding is a reflection of the unusually strident Republican National Convention of that year, which featured a declaration of a “culture war” against homosexuals, abortionists, and immigrants. While we think the most effective signal of all is membership itself (perceived membership, we should say), as in Barack Obama's racial background and religious faith, we should be mindful that there are other ways to activate ethnocentrism."
"59","Given all the evidence we have marshaled here, the reader might well be thinking: but Obama won. How could this be, if ethnocentrism intruded so visibly and consequentially in 2008? Good question."
"60","Obama lost votes among whites due to his race and his imagined religion, but other factors present in 2008 worked in his favor.25 For one thing, black turnout increased sharply in 2008. From 1980 through 2004, blacks made up 11% of the electorate. In 2008, this percentage jumped to 13%. Because African Americans voted nearly unanimously for Obama in 2008, the successful mobilization of the black vote by the Obama campaign yielded a rich harvest of votes, an increase in the popular vote of about 2%.         "
"61","More important still, national conditions favored the Democrats overwhelmingly. Presidential elections are, in very important part, a judgment of the incumbent party's performance in two domains: economic prosperity and peace and security (e.g., Hibbs 2000; Rosenstone 1983). With this in mind, consider John McCain's predicament in 2008. He found himself with two Herculean tasks: to defend an increasingly unpopular war and to persuade the country that it should trust the Republican Party to fix the economic mess that it had apparently just created.         "
"62","“Mess” understates things considerably. By the summer of 2008, energy prices were soaring, housing prices were falling, and credit was drying up. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the two mortgage titans that together owned or guaranteed roughly half the home loans of Americans, teetered on the edge of collapse. Early in September, Lehman Brothers went belly‐up. Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America, narrowly escaping a similar fate. American International Group (AIG), the gigantic insurance firm, was rescued by an 85 billion dollar government loan. Industrial production fell, unemployment rose, and the stock market tumbled. The credit crisis was spreading into the real economy and rippling through Europe and Asia. As the election approached, American confidence in the economy plunged to a record low."
"63","This cascade of terrible news played directly into Obama's hands. Plausible models of presidential elections, ones that take into account in reasonable ways economic conditions and peace and security, predicted a landslide for the Democrats in 2008. Obama in fact won 53.7% of the vote; the models say Obama “should” have won close to 60% of the vote. The models imply that if the timing had gone a little differently, if the surge in Iraq had begun a bit earlier and especially if the great recession and the collapse of major financial institutions had not begun until after the first week in November, Obama would not have been elected at all."
"64","As things turned out, of course, Obama was elected. Our point here is that he was elected despite ethnocentrism. Race and religion entered into the 2008 election in a significant way. Only the dismal and frightening conditions that surrounded the election, which were widely blamed on Republicans, kept the election in the Democratic column."
"65","The 2008 election provided unusually fertile grounds for the activation of ethnocentrism. On the idea that we would rather see election outcomes decided by ideas and results and character than by intolerance, prejudice, and ethnocentrism, we might take some consolation over 2008's seeming exceptionalism. Perhaps, but there is another way to look at it. The 2008 election was unusual, one might say, because the stable two‐party system that has characterized American politics for so long generally protects against the selection of outsiders as presidential candidates. Candidates like Obama are rarely nominated. Over the sweep of American history, only one black person has run for president at the head of a major party; no women; only three Catholics; no Muslims (despite what a significant fraction of the American public continues to believe); no Jews; no Atheists; no Latinos; no Asian Americans; no (uncloseted) gays. Looking over the full set of presidential candidates reminds us that in some important respects, the United States remains an exclusive political community—a reflection, we would suggest, of the power and persistence of ethnocentrism."
