"1","We introduce here a setup common to all models we consider. Consider two parties, A and B, competing for power.8 Citizens have strict political preferences for one or the other. We denote by  the preference split, that is, the chance that any citizen is assigned (by Nature) a preference for party A (thus,  is the expected fraction of citizens who prefer party B). Besides partisan preferences, the second dimension along which citizens differ from one another is their cost of voting: Each citizen's cost of voting, c, is drawn from a distribution with twice differentiable cumulative distribution function  over the support , with . The cost of voting and the partisan preferences are two independent dimensions that determine the type of voter.         "
"2","For any vote share V obtained by party A, an institutional system γ determines the mapping to the respective power shares,  and . For normalization purposes, we let the utility from “full power to party i” equal 1 for type i citizens and 0 for the remaining citizens.9. Hence, the power shares are the reduced‐form “benefit” components of parties' (respectively, voters') utility functions that will determine the incentives to campaign (respectively, vote) in a given institutional system γ. In a system, payoffs as a function of the vote share are represented by a standard “contest success function,”10 where γ ranges from 1 to ∞:            "
"3","This representation can accommodate a wide range of intermediate power‐sharing rules between pure proportional power‐sharing systems (P) and systems entirely without power sharing (M), using a single parameter in the payoff function. The two extreme cases correspond to  (P) and  (M), and, for instance, the intermediate case  represents the so‐called “cube law.”11"
"4","As we discussed in the introduction, intermediate systems that are a mixture of proportional power‐sharing and no‐power‐sharing systems are very common and have plenty of institutional details we do not model.12 Intuitively, we just want to capture the fact that the larger γ is, the lower the extent of power sharing in the system.         "
"5","Even in a winner‐take‐all electoral system like the U.S. presidential race, a large winning margin carries with it added benefits to the winner due to a “mandate” effect, and larger winning margins for the president can carry over to a larger majority in one or both houses of Congress, via the “coattails” effect.13 Also, the fact that the legislative branch in an M system has leverage over the executive branch and the presidency will tend to smooth out the winner‐take‐all discontinuous payoff function in the direction of a more proportional power‐sharing scheme. Similarly, an increase in vote shares might have a disproportional impact on payoffs also in electoral systems with proportional representation. For example, in parliamentary systems that require the formation of a coalition government, a party that is fortunate to win a clear majority of seats outright has much less incentive (or in some cases none at all) to compromise with other parties in order to govern effectively.         "
"6","Figure 1 illustrates the power share payoff  as a function of the vote share V for three power‐sharing parameters γ, namely:  (i.e., the P system, dashed line),  (i.e., an intermediate power‐sharing system, continuous line), and  (i.e., a pure M system, dotted line).         "
"7","Citizens choose whether to vote for party A, vote for party B, or abstain. If a share α of A types vote for A and a share β of B types vote for B, the expected turnout for party A and party B and total turnout are, respectively:            "
"8","Without loss of generality, in the remainder we assume party A is the ex ante underdog, namely,  where applicable . We also define the preference ratio Q and the turnout ratio R as            "
"9","We look for symmetric equilibria. These equilibria can be characterized by a voting cost threshold for each side , below which supporters turn out and above which they abstain; hence, the share of A (B) supporters who turn out can be expressed by  (). Henceforth, we denote as  the probability density function of the cumulative cost distribution function , and we call G its inverse, namely, . Moreover, we denote partial derivatives of any function Z with respect to q or γ (our main comparative statics parameters) with the following compact notation: .         "
"10","The basic idea behind these models is that the positive externality of voting among supporters of the same party is internalized, leading to higher turnout. The rationale behind the solution to this collective action problem may differ across group voting models, but the end result is that, contrary to the instrumental voting model (discussed in the next main section), the share of voters turning out is high regardless of the size of the population. In group voter models, the two sides compete in an election by turning out their supporters, who have a voting cost to turn out. The population is a continuum of measure one, divided into q A supporters and  B supporters. In a  power‐sharing system, the marginal group benefits to the two sides, with respect to , can be derived from Equation 1 and are, respectively,            "
"11","Our main approach to studying turnout in elections, which is grounded in group‐oriented behavior, is the ethical voter model (Coate and Conlin 2004; Feddersen and Sandroni 2006). This model assumes that citizens are rule utilitarian,  which means that they overcome the free‐riding problem and manage to act as one cohesive group. Since the ethical voter model assumes that citizens are rule utilitarian, all citizens of one group act as one agent. Namely, we assume citizens follow the voting rule that, if followed by everyone else on their side, would maximize the benefit  of their side from the outcome of the election minus the aggregate cost C incurred by their side. As a consequence, this model involves an equilibrium between two party planners, or representative agents, on each side, A and B. In the solution, each planner looks at the total electoral benefit net of the total cost of voting incurred by his supporters, taking the other planner's turnout strategy as given.14 The cost of turning out the voters for the social planner on side A is the total cost suffered by all the citizens on side A who vote, namely,               "
"12","Defining the generalized reversed hazard rate as , we introduce the following definition: A distribution satisfies the decreasing generalized reversed hazard rate (DGRHR) property if and only if  is decreasing. We call it DGRHR by analogy with the known increasing generalized failure rate (IGFR; see, e.g., Lariviere 2006), which refers to the function .15"
"13","To insure corner solutions are ruled out, it suffices to assume a cost density function that has two additional boundary conditions. First, a large enough density for low costs: this rules out the zero turnout best response by making it almost costless to turn out the first voters. Second, a large enough support: this makes it unfeasible to turn out all voters.1 Namely:               "

"21","The solution for the ethical voter model for a general γ is not straightforward to derive, because the underdog compensation is strictly partial (rather than zero), so , and the two equations of the system of first order conditions (FOCs) do not decouple. It is convenient for the analysis to rewrite the two FOCs compactly as               "
"22","where:               "
"23","The DGRHR property turns out to be key for several reasons, not only to guarantee existence, but also for the competition effect and for the contest effect. It is easy to show nonexistence if DGRHR is violated, at least in certain parameter ranges. Even when existence is granted, a violation of DGRHR can cause the competition effect to fail, that is, higher equilibrium turnout in more lopsided elections, as we show later in an example. The DGRHR property guarantees some regularity in the cost distribution function, so that, for instance, if the ratio of the proportion of voters turning out from each side——increases as parameters change, then the cost threshold ratio——also increases. The latter implies, among other things, that there is monotonicity between the relative support ex ante and the relative support ex post: If q, the relative ex ante support for A increases, then the relative turnout for A,  does too in equilibrium. For instance, if 1 out of 4 citizens prefers A and 1 out of 3 voters actually voted for A (see the partial underdog effect described below), then it cannot be that increasing the former reduces the latter, under DGRHR. We now discuss the properties we derived in order.               "
"24","We provide first a simple example that satisfies DGRHR. Second, to show that DGRHR is a tight condition, we provide an example that violates it and violates the competition effect."
"25","Assume the cdf comes from the family (which satisfies weakly DGRHR):                  "

"28","Figure 2 shows T as a function of both q and γ for or  and .               "
"29","This picture summarizes the main insights. For any electoral/institutional system γ, the competition effect is apparent: Turnout increases the closer the ex ante preference split becomes. Fixing the preference split q, turnout is nonmonotonic in the electoral/institutional system γ, first increasing and then decreasing. For any , the turnout maximizing  is increasing in the competition q: The closer the election, the more uneven the power sharing in the institutional system has to be in order to achieve its highest turnout. In other words, if ex ante preference splits are uneven, then more proportional power‐sharing systems maximize turnout; on the other hand, if ex ante preference splits are even, systems with less power sharing achieve the highest turnout. In sum, the electoral/institutional system that delivers the highest turnout crucially depends on the initial preference split and in a nontrivial way. This questions the validity of all cross‐country empirical comparisons of turnout, which, to the best of our knowledge, lump together electoral turnout results over time in each country, never controlling for the value of q in each election.16"

"35","Figure 3 shows a violation of the competition effect. Namely, despite the presence of the underdog effect, total turnout is not always increasing for .               "
"36","The main message of this article is to document the robustness of our comparative statics results of turnout across several well‐known turnout models. Morton (1987, 1991), Cox and Munger (1989), Shachar and Nalebuff (1999), and others have proposed models based on group mobilization, where parties can mobilize and coordinate citizens to go vote. In major elections, candidates and parties engage in hugely expensive get‐out‐the‐vote drives. Empirical evidence suggests that these drives are effective (Bochel and Denver 1971; Gerber and Green 2000). There is also evidence that mobilization efforts can explain turnout variation across elections and across electoral systems (Gray and Caul 2000; Patterson and Caldeira 1983). We adopt here a group mobilization model á la Shachar and Nalebuff (1999), where parties' campaign efforts and spending are able to mobilize and coordinate citizens to go vote. In this model, each group can “purchase” turnout of its party members by engaging in costly get‐out‐the‐vote efforts. Thus, parties trade off mobilization costs for higher expected vote shares, taking as given the mobilization choice of the other party.            "
"37","A mobilization model assumes that more campaign spending by a party brings more votes for the party according to an exogenous technology. We consider a very simple version of group mobilization. We assume that the cost a party incurs in order to bring to the polls (i.e., mobilize) all its supporters with voting cost below c is , where  and l is an increasing, convex, and twice differentiable function. We also assume that it is infinitely costly for a party to turn out all its supporters: . In addition to twice differentiability, we assume the distribution of citizens' voting costs  satisfies a (weakly) decreasing reversed hazard rate (DRHR, or log‐concavity of F) property.17"
"38","As in the ethical voter model, to make sure the first order conditions identify actual maximizers we need to impose additional conditions. First, both a large enough cost density for low costs and low enough marginal cost of mobilizing the first voters: this rules out the zero turnout best response, by making it almost costless to turn out the first voters.2 Second, the log‐convexity of the marginal cost of mobilization: this ensures the objectives are single peaked, thanks to the DRHR property. Namely:               "
"39","Condition 2.The cdf of the cost distribution  defined on  must satisfy the additional conditions:                     "
"40","Under the above conditions, we have the following result, without loss of generality, for all .               "
"41","Proposition 2.In the mobilization model, an equilibrium exists, it is unique, and it has the following properties:                     "
"42","               "
"43","Proof.See the appendix."
"44","The weak DRHR property of the cost distribution roughly means that the relative variation in the number of agent‐types does not increase as we span the support of the distribution. In other words, as we increase the cost, we do not suddenly find many more agents with a given cost. This guarantees monotonicity, and it is essential for a unique interior solution: The cost‐benefit ratio of turning agents with marginally higher costs is increasing."
"45","The results for this model and their intuition are very similar to the ethical voter model, with one caveat. The zero underdog compensation obtained in the mobilization model means that, regardless of the electoral system and of the preference split, either side turns out the same proportion of its supporters. The zero underdog compensation is due to the nonrival structure of the campaign spending costs in mobilization models (see, e.g., Morton 1987, 1991; Schachar and Nalebuff 1999). Namely, it costs the same for either side to mobilize all their supporters below a given voting cost threshold. In particular, it does not cost less to turn out the same share of supporters of the smaller group than of the larger group. This is, for example, the case if one thinks of campaigning as advertising through media, which is in its nature nonrival, but not for other forms of campaigning such as door‐to‐door persuasion, which are clearly rival. If the latter were the case, then compensation would be partial and the results would be similar to the ethical voter model.            "
"46","If the voting cost distribution and the cost of mobilizing voters are:                  "
"47","Figure 4 shows T as a function of both q and γ. The similarity with Figure 2 is apparent. Also, for any electoral/institutional system γ the competition effect is clear, as well as the contest effect for any preference split q.               "
"48","Another workhorse model for studying turnout in elections is the rational voter model (Palfrey and Rosenthal 1985). Some scholars consider the rational voter model nonsatisfactory, as it predicts very low levels of turnout in large electorates. Far from contributing to this debate, our goal here is rather to show that, regardless of the turnout levels predicted, the comparative statics we obtain in the rational voter model across institutional systems and across preference splits are consistent with what we obtained in the high‐turnout‐yielding, group models of turnout we discussed above.         "
"49","Let N denote the total number of voters. As usual, the symmetric equilibrium is characterized by two cutoff levels, with  and , which solve:            "
"50","where  and  are the marginal benefits from voting for an individual of, respectively, group A and group B. Given expected turnout rates in the two parties, α and β, the expected marginal benefits of voting for a party A and party B citizen are equal to, respectively,            "
"51","In Equations 3 and 4, the first term in brackets in the summation is the increase in power share as a consequence of an increase in vote shares. The remaining terms represent the probability of the vote share being equal to  without your vote, given turnout rates α and β.18 For this model, we can offer analytical proofs for two results: existence of an equilibrium and the presence of a partial underdog effect. To show that the comparative statics discussed for the previous models hold also under these alternative modeling assumptions, we recur to numerical computations.         "
"52","Fix N, γ, and q. The pair of equilibrium conditions can be written in terms of cost thresholds as:                  "
"53","This proof is contained in Kartal (Forthcoming a) and Herrera, Morelli, and Palfrey (2014). As pointed out there, in general, the partial underdog effect holds whenever a symmetric power sharing function  (e.g., as the purely proportional one with  in our model: ) has the property that an additional vote for the underdog has a higher marginal impact for the underdog than an additional vote for the leader has for the leader. In other words, the proof just hinges on following two properties of :                  "
"54","While closed‐form analytical expressions of the equilibria do not exist, they are easily computed numerically. Figure 5 shows the equilibrium overall turnout as a function of the institutional environment, γ, and the ex ante preference split, q, for , , and a benefit from winning the election of 10. This figure is qualitatively similar to the ones we presented for the mobilization and the ethical voter models. Table 1 shows the overall turnout as a function of γ and q for the same parameters. From these numerical computations, we can conclude that comparative statics similar to the one discussed for the other two models hold.               "

"57","First, given γ, turnout increases in the size of the underdog group and peaks when the preference split is even. This is an analogue of the competition effect we discussed in the previous two models. Second, turnout increases and then decreases as we approach a system with no power sharing (i.e., as γ grows). In the large majority case, that is, an uneven preference split (e.g.,  when ), turnout is maximized for  and decreases as we increase γ. When preferences are closer (e.g.,  when ), turnout initially increases as we increase γ. As the power sharing of the system becomes less proportional, winning the election becomes paramount, so competition becomes fiercer. On the other hand, the γ that maximizes turnout is still finite (i.e., does not coincide with pure first‐past‐the‐post). As we approach a system without power sharing, the incentive to vote is reduced: Winning becomes all that matters, and the underdog, which has a smaller chance of winning (especially when preferences are uneven) turns out less. This is an analogue of the contest effect we discussed in the previous two models. Finally, we see in both cases the presence of a partial underdog effect. The underdog effect in this model comes from the benefit side, not from the cost side. The underdog has a larger benefit from turning out, as an additional vote for the underdog brings the election closer to a tie, raising the stakes; specifically, the benefit function becomes steeper as we approach a tie. The fact that the underdog effect is partial thought is entirely due to cost heterogeneity, as in the ethical voter model.               "
"58","This article investigated how the endogenous decisions of voters in participate to an election is affected by the degree of power sharing of the political system. We introduce a novel modeling instrument, a generalized context success function, in order to measure the sensitivity of power sharing to vote shares. Contrary to previous theoretical studies linking turnout to political institutions, this allows us to consider a wide array of both electoral systems—ranging from a perfectly proportional system to a pure winner‐take‐all system—and also, independently, of power‐sharing regimes."
"59","We show that turnout depends on the degree of proportionality of influence in the institutional system in a subtle way, and that it is important to control for the interaction of political institutions and the relative strength of parties in the electorate. With the exception of the knife‐edged case of a perfectly even split of preferences, turnout is highest for an intermediate degree of power‐sharing. When the distribution of preferences is lopsided, turnout is maximized with a relatively more proportional power‐sharing system; when the distribution of preferences is close to even, turnout is maximized with a relatively more uneven power sharing system. The fact that, with low power sharing, the underdog is unlikely to win a large election when partisan preferences are lopsided strongly discourages turnout. On the other hand, with high power sharing, some competition remains even when preferences are uneven, and therefore the effect of relative party support on turnout is small. These theoretical results are robust to a wide range of alternative assumptions about the role of parties and about the rationality of voters."
"60","There are many possible directions for the next steps in this research. In this article, we identify theoretically how the overall proportionality of influence and turnout interact with the distribution of preferences in the elecotrate, and we find that these interaction effects are important, yet quite subtle. A direct empirical test of the theory is not readily available because there are no good measures of the overall degree of power sharing of a political system. There are well‐established indices only for the mapping from votes to seats, which is just one component of the broader mapping from votes to power, which is what ultimately matters for the decision of voters to participate in an election. However, as suggested in the appendix, a researcher interested in evaluating our theory can usefully compare how turnout varies with the level of competitiveness when varying only one of the two mappings and keeping the other constant (e.g., varying the degree of power to the legislature while keeping the electoral rule constant, or varying the electoral rule within classes of countries with similarly powerful legislatures). The preliminary tests discussed in the appendix are broadly supportive of our theoretical predictions. In particular, turnout increases significantly more with competitiveness in first‐past‐the‐post (FPTP) systems with respect to proportional representation (PR) systems when keeping one component of the mapping from seats to power constant, and the degree of power conferred to the legislature (which we assume is positively correlated with γ) increases the sensitivity of turnout to competitiveness when focusing exclusively on countries with the same electoral rule. There is a large scope for better empirical tests of this theory, and we believe this offers a fruitful avenue for future research in comparative politics. Finally, on the theoretical side, it would be interesting to study voters' turnout decisions when elections have a common value dimension and how the extent of power sharing in the system affects political platforms and the endogenous entry of parties."

"107","The proof that the first order conditions identify the global maximum (hence that corner solutions are ruled out and the objectives are single peaked) is essentially identical to the one presented for the ethical voter model (replacing qc with ).               "
"108","For any fixed cost distribution and cost mobilization function, turnout depends only on the marginal benefit (MB) and increases with it. Hence, in what follows, we study MB as a proxy for turnout T. Fixing the institutional setting γ, we study turnout as we increase the ex ante preference split q from zero (landslide) to 1/2 (close election). We have ; hence, we can focus only on the sign of the derivative with respect to Q:                  "
"109","Hence, regardless of the institutional setting, as the preference split becomes tighter the marginal benefit of voting (MB) and turnout T increase."
"110","Fixing the preference split q, we study turnout as the contest becomes more competitive, namely, if we increase γ from 1 (proportional power sharing) to infinity (no power sharing). We have                  "
"111","For any , the first factor is always positive and does not change the sign of the slope of MB or its maximum. Therefore, the above condition is equivalent to                  "
"112","Hence, Ω can cross zero only once, where turnout is highest, that is, for                  "
"113","In sum, for any given preference split , turnout is highest for an intermediate system :                  "
"114","Lastly, it is easy to see that                  "
