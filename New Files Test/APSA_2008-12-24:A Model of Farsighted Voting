"2","A subset C⊆N is called a coalition of voters. Coalitions that are large enough to enact a policy are called decisive, or winning. The collection of winning coalitions is W.

Monotonicity implies that if C∈W and C⊂C′, then C′∈W, or that adding people to a decisive coalition yields another decisive coalition. Properness implies that if C∈W, then , or that any two decisive coalitions must have at least one individual in common.         "
"3","The legislative process is modeled as a sequence of sessions in which votes on policy occur. In each round the status quo is determined by the bargaining outcome of the previous round. A policy to be pitted against the status quo arises exogenously in each round. This policy is drawn from a probability density Q. A vote then occurs between this policy and the status quo. Every voter receives a payoff from the winning policy and this policy then becomes the status quo of the next round of bargaining. This process is pictured in Figure 1.            "

"5","The probabilistic and exogenous nature of the proposal process distinguishes this model from Baron (1996), Baron and Herron (2003), Kalandrakis (2004), Duggan and Kalandrakis (2007), Baron, Diermeier, and Fong (2007), and Riboni (2008) and warrants a short discussion. Baron, Baron and Herron, Kalandrakis, and Kalandrakis and Duggan analyze repeated bargaining games with endogenous reversion points. In these papers a player is selected at random to make a proposal in each round. The proposal is pitted against the status quo, with the winning alternative becoming the status quo in the next round of bargaining. Baron looks at the case of a unidimensional policy space and finds that outcomes converge to the ideal point of the median voter. Baron and Herron consider a two‐dimensional policy space, three players, and a finite horizon, and numerically compute equilibria. Kalandrakis examines a three‐player divide‐the‐dollar game and finds that a Markov perfect equilibrium of the game is characterized by a situation where the proposer in every round proposes the entire dollar for himself, and this allocation is approved by a majority of players. Duggan and Kalandrakis extend the model to multidimensional space and a very general preference and voting environment. In addition to proving the existence of pure strategy stationary Markov perfect equilibria, they provide an algorithm for computing equilibria numerically. Riboni considers a similar model in which policy changes are proposed by a strategic agenda setter (who is not a member of the voting body), and then voted upon by a committee.            "
"6","In the context of political economy, this article is related at a more general level to recent articles by Battaglini and Coate (2007, 2008) that examine the dynamics of taxation and public spending. In these articles, policymaking periods are linked by endogenous levels of public goods and public debt, respectively. Krusell and Ríos‐Rull (1996) also study the connection between current and future policies in a model of economic growth and stagnation. The equilibrium concept they develop is related to the concept utilized in this article, in that voters forecast the effects of the present political climate on the future. Agents in their model vote via majority rule on the regulation of new production technologies and may decide whether or not to accumulate skill in a given technology. Another recent line of research, including papers by Cho (2008), Baron, Diermeier, and Fong (2007), and Fong (2006), has built upon Baron and Diermeier's (2001) model of parliamentary systems under proportional representation. While differing in various institutional specifics such as the role of elections, issue dimensionality, formateur selection, and number of policymaking rounds, these models consider the incentives for political coalitions to form and implement policy when these choices affect subsequent government formation cycles.            "
"7","All of these papers differ from my article in an important respect. While each of these papers is concerned primarily with predicting equilibrium policy outcomes and voter behavior on the path of play, the goal of this article is to model voter preferences over all alternatives when voters evaluate policies in terms of what they are likely to produce over time. By separating voting strategies from the policy proposal process, results about farsighted preferences and behavior are easier to interpret. For example, in Penn (2003) I endogenize the proposal process in this model by allowing randomly drawn players to make proposals themselves. The numerical results I find are similar to those found by Kalandrakis (2004) and suggest that Kalandrakis's result that a legislative dictator emerges with certainty in every round is likely an effect of the particular endogenous proposal process assumed.4"
"8","The assumption of an exogenous and probabilistic process by which future proposals are generated reflects the notion that legislators are not certain of the policy proposals that will be brought to the floor in the future, but are aware of the current political climate and have priors over the distribution of future proposals. While “endogenous” is frequently interpreted as being more realistic than “exogenous” in any game‐theoretic model, the assumption of an exogenous agenda here makes the model easier to interpret, easier to apply to different situations, and, I argue, more realistic. This is because an agenda in this setting will depend on a number of complex factors (recognition rules, special interest, and constituency pressures; the ordering of the legislative calendar; party control; etc.) that are beyond the scope of this model. For example, in game‐theoretic models it is generally assumed that legislators are randomly recognized to propose alternatives to the floor via a particular recognition rule. This assumption yields a very specific kind of strategic agenda‐setting process that is separate from the goal of this article, which is simply to model voter preferences in an environment where policies are replaced by new policies over time."
"9"," Roberts (2007), Dougherty and Edward (2008), and Compte and Jehiel (2008) study similar bargaining problems with randomly generated offers. Roberts considers a setting where policymaking is continuing, and every alternative is equally likely to be brought to the floor. Dougherty and Edward compare the ability of majority and unanimity rules to attain Pareto efficient outcomes when proposals may be generated at random and find that majority rule dominates unanimity rule in this regard. Compte and Jehiel assume the bargaining process ends when a certain number of players accept the random offer. They examine the effect of patience, the number of players, and the majority requirement and find that as the majority requirement increases more efficient outcomes are generated, but that it also takes longer to reach agreement. They motivate their random proposal process with the argument that it is rare for any individual or group to have full control over an agenda‐setting process, and that even if a person did have full control over proposals, it would be difficult for him to perfectly target a collection of specific payoffs for the other players. They also find that simplifying the proposal process in such a way enables them to better analyze many empirical regularities that have not been supported by previous bargaining problems; for example, the fact that agreement is frequently more difficult to obtain when unanimous consent is required.

"10","This section presents the model of farsighted voter preferences. Utility function ui(x) represents Player i's one‐shot payoff from policy x when x is enacted today. However, if Player i is farsighted then he not only cares about his payoff from having x enacted today, but also his future payoffs from the policies that will ultimately replace x."
"11","Let Player i's value function be denoted vi, where . This function represents the discounted sum of utility Player i can expect to receive from having policy x enacted today, given that a stream of policies will be enacted after x. Let v={vi}i∈N be the collection of all voter value functions, with  being the space of all value functions (so that ). In equilibrium each voter will assign a “true” long‐term value to every policy. This means that players will vote based on their equilibrium value functions and by voting this way they ultimately generate those same functions.            "
"12","In equilibrium, value functions capture a consistency between beliefs and behavior; when a player behaves according to such a function, the value he assigns to a policy equals the true future expected value of that policy. When this holds for all players, then the vote strategies of players generate value functions that generate those same vote strategies. Thus, beliefs and behavior are entirely consistent with each other. The following equilibrium concept captures this idea.            "
"13","Definition:  A dynamically stable voting equilibrium is a collection of value functions, v*={v*i}i∈N, such that for all i∈N and x∈X,                  "
"14","The case of an infinite X is defined analogously.5"
"15","The function ui(x) equals the utility Player i receives from alternative x in one period. The probability that policy y will defeat status quo x is denoted p(v(x), v(y)). This function is simply assumed to be the probability that a winning coalition votes for y over x, given that every voter knows that policy selection will continue into the future. Thus voting decisions are made based on voters' value functions and not their utility functions (i.e., voters are farsighted). The specific functional form of p(v(x), v(y)) can be found in Appendix A; it is simply the probability of victory of y over x.               "
"16"," Q is the probability mass from which alternatives y to be pitted against the status quo are drawn. As discussed earlier, Q represents the fixed beliefs that voters have over the types of alternatives that will be brought to the floor in the future. These beliefs could be uniform over all alternatives (uninformative) or could be generated by fixed external pressures from political parties, special interests, constituencies, or simply the current political climate. While Q is assumed to be independent of the current status quo x, a similar model could be constructed where Q is conditioned on x. This construction would not dramatically change the analytic results of the model, but is omitted for ease of exposition.6 When the set X is infinite, Q is instead a density. In this case, Q is assumed to have full support, and to be differentiable in y. δ∈[0, 1) is a discount factor that represents players' time preferences. When δ is high, voters place greater relative weight on the future. For notational simplicity δ is assumed to be common for all players, but this assumption does not affect any of the analytic results.               "
"17","One feature of this model that differentiates it from an endogenous proposal model is that the probability of victory of y over x, or p(v(x), v(y)), is averaged over all decisive coalitions. Alternatively, when proposals are endogenous the proposer does two things: he chooses an alternative to propose, and he identifies a particular decisive coalition to target his proposal to. Therefore, when proposals are endogenous, policy outcomes will typically change at every round of voting unless the status quo is the proposer's ideal point. However, in this model, because winning coalitions are no longer uniquely determined but instead are averaged over, a consequence is that universalistic, or close to universalistic, majorities can arise given particular policy pairings. Thus, policy will remain at more desirable status quos for longer, and undesirable policies will be replaced quickly.               "
"18","To summarize this section, the above model characterizes long‐term individual preferences in a setting where policies are repeatedly being challenged and replaced by new alternatives. In a given round a transition from status quo x to new policy y is dependent upon two factors. First, policy y must be chosen to be pitted against status quo x from density Q. Second, voters must choose policy y over status quo x, and the probability that y defeats x when infinitely more rounds remain is denoted p(v(x),  v(y)). The function vi(x) represents i's discounted expected sum of utility when x is enacted today, given that infinitely more rounds of policy selection will occur. This equals ui(x), or i's utility from x today, plus the discounted expected value of what x will ultimately lead to in the future.               "
"19","In the sections that follow, I will provide examples of dynamically stable voting equilibria in specific settings. The goal of this section is to provide more general results about the types of environments in which we can expect dynamically stable voting equilibria to exist and to be unique. Recall that an equilibrium in this setting is a collection of value functions such that, when individuals vote according to these functions, individual valuations of policies equal the true future expected values of those policies. Therefore, we are looking for fixed points in a mapping from one value function into another. Mathematically, this is different from a more standard game‐theoretic setup in which we look for fixed points in action profiles. The difference stems from the fact that while value functions (which are necessarily cardinal) will yield action profiles, action profiles do not provide us with enough information to give us back cardinal valuations. Therefore, stronger conditions are required in order to obtain equilibrium existence in this setup than in a standard game‐theoretic setup.7"
"20","Propositions 1, 2, and 3 all focus on the problem of equilibrium existence. Although the voting behavior of players is purposefully left unspecified in this model, individual behavior is implicit in the definition of the function p(v(x), v(y)), or the probability of victory of y over x. While p is defined formally in Appendix A, let the probability that individual i (with value function vi) votes for y over x be denoted pi(vi(x), vi(y)). The three existence results all require that this probability be continuous in vi for all individuals i, or that individuals vote probabilistically. Probabilistic voting is defined formally in Appendix A. However, while probabilistic voting is sufficient for equilibrium existence in many cases, it is not necessary in order to find equilibria of the model. The following sections provide several examples of equilibria in situations where individuals vote deterministically.         "
"21","Many authors have invoked the assumption of probabilistic behavior on the part of voters (see Banks and Duggan 2004; Coughlin 1992; McKelvey and Patty 2006; and Schofield 2004), with the implication being that models of behavior are incapable of perfectly predicting vote choice, and that this reality should be incorporated into the calculations of voters. This model is consistent with the more game‐theoretic formulation of probabilistic voting adopted by McKelvey and Patty (2006). As in their setup, and opposed to some more classic models of probabilistic voting, the expected payoff of casting a vote is represented correctly for each voter.8 In other words, individuals vote with the knowledge that other voters are also behaving probabilistically. As in other recent work on the topic, the assumption of probabilistic voting in this model is consistent with pure strategy equilibrium behavior in a Bayesian framework in which individuals receive privately observed payoff shocks for each possible action or vote. This formulation of probabilistic voting, and in particular, the effect of these random payoff disturbances on individual vote functions pi, is presented in Appendix A.         "
"22","The three existence results require various conditions on individual vote functions pi.9 Proposition 1 simply proves that when the alternative space X is finite and individuals vote probabilistically, an equilibrium exists. Proposition 3 proves that when individuals vote probabilistically, then a unique equilibrium will exist when the number of players is large enough, regardless of whether X is finite or infinite. Proposition 2 proves that an equilibrium will exist when X is infinite and there are any number of players, but requires that the derivative of p be bounded by a particular constant. This implies that individual behavior is sufficiently probabilistic. In Appendix A this constant is defined both generally (Assumption 1) and more specifically for the case of a logit agent quantal response equilibrium. All proofs of the propositions can be found in Appendix B.         "
"23","Proposition 1  If X is finite, then there exists a dynamically stable voting equilibrium when individuals vote probabilistically.             "
"24","Proposition 2  If X is infinite, then there exists a dynamically stable voting equilibrium when individuals vote “sufficiently probabilistically,” or individual behavior is not too responsive to payoffs.             "
"25","Proposition 3  If the number of voters is “large enough” then there always exists a unique dynamically stable equilibrium provided that individuals vote probabilistically, regardless of whether X is finite or infinite.             "
"26","To understand why additional requirements on transition probabilities p are needed to generally prove existence when X is infinite, note that the set of all functions over a finite alternative space is a finite‐dimensional vector space, while the set of all functions over an infinite and compact subset of  is a function space. Compactness of the space of value functions is generally needed in order to find a fixed point. While any closed and bounded subset of a finite‐dimensional vector space is compact, closed and bounded sets of functions are rarely compact. Proposition 2 is proved by showing that the set of value functions is equicontinuous, and thus compact, when a certain restriction (Assumption 1 described above) on the derivative of transition probability p holds.            "
"27","Proposition 3 proves existence differently, by showing that when the total number of players is sufficiently large we can construct an iterative definition of a dynamically stable voting equilibrium that is a contraction mapping. This definition (Equation 2 in Appendix B) is also used to perform the numerical estimations that follow in the next section and is discussed in greater detail in that section. Furthermore, this definition can be easily utilized to calculate farsighted evaluations of policy when only a finite number of rounds of policymaking will occur. The extension of this model to the setting of a finite number of rounds is discussed in Appendix B.            "
"28","Last, it is important to note that under different specifications of the functions pi a dynamically stable voting equilibrium is equivalent to other commonly used equilibrium concepts. For the final proposition and corollary of the article I construct a game in which equilibrium behavior is consistent with behavior generated by dynamically stable voting equilibria. In particular, I show that when individuals vote probabilistically, behavior in a dynamically stable voting equilibrium is equivalent to pure strategy Bayesian Markov‐perfect Nash equilibrium behavior in the constructed game (Proposition 4). As a corollary it follows that when individuals vote deterministically, so that pi(vi(x),  vi(y)) = 1 if vi(y) ≥vi(x) and zero otherwise, then at a dynamically stable voting equilibrium the collection of functions pi constitute a Markov‐perfect equilibrium. In both cases, the v* vector represents the expected utility functions of the players, and strategies as specified by the functions pi are consistent with the maximization of these expected utility functions. The proofs and the construction of the game are relegated to Appendix B.            "
"29","Proposition 4  If individuals vote probabilistically, then at a dynamically stable voting equilibrium,                                 v                     *, the collection of functionspiare consistent with behavior in a pure strategy Bayesian Markov‐perfect Nash equilibrium of a game,Γ.            "
"30","When the policy space is finite and small it is not difficult to solve for equilibria analytically. In this subsection and the next I will present simple analytic examples of dynamically stable voting equilibria. This first example depicts a one‐dimensional spatial model; the second depicts a setting in which there is a majority preference cycle over a subset of the alternative space. In both examples I assume that discount factor δ= .9 and that voting is deterministic, with               "
"31","To motivate this first example, consider the story presented in the introduction about the political strategies of gay rights groups after the 2004 elections. Suppose that there are three political actors in the model: a gay rights activist (R), a defense‐of‐marriage activist (D), and a neutral voter (N). Also, suppose that there are three possible political outcomes: a court‐mandated overturn of state constitutional amendments banning gay marriage (“court mandate,” for short), legalization of civil unions and benefits for same‐sex partners (“civil unions”), and a federal constitutional amendment banning gay marriage (“marriage amendment”)."
"32","Last, assume that the “marriage amendment” outcome is currently being strongly forwarded by special interests, and is three times more likely to arise as a policy proposal than the other two policy alternatives. Thus, , and .            "
"33"," Figure 2 depicts the hypothetical spatial location of the ideal points of the three players and the locations of the three policies.            "
"34","                 A One‐Dimensional Example                         "
"35","This figure generates Tables 1 and 2, which show the utility functions of the three players and the sum of expected utility each policy yields in the long term, at a dynamically stable voting equilibrium.            "
"36"," Table 2 summarizes the above information by depicting individuals' rankings over the alternatives when individuals are both shortsighted and farsighted. If Player i strictly prefers policy x to policy y, it is written x?y. If Player i is indifferent between the two, it is written x∼y.            "
"37","As is consistent with a traditional spatial model, the neutral voter is always indifferent between legalized civil unions and a constitutional marriage amendment, and strictly prefers both of these policies to a court mandate legalizing gay marriage. However, the gay rights activist, with ideal point “court mandate,” will strictly prefer to implement “civil unions” rather than his own ideal point when he is farsighted. This is because when “marriage amendment” is more politically salient than the other two policies (i.e., is more likely to be brought to the floor as a policy proposal) then the policy that makes the gay rights activist best off over time is not his ideal point, but the policy closest to his ideal point that can defeat a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Thus, it is in the activist's best interest to concede some utility in the current round in order to prevent his least favorite policy from being quickly implemented. Finally, the defense‐of‐marriage activist strictly prefers “court mandate” to “civil unions” when he is farsighted, even though “civil unions” is closer to his ideal point. Loosely speaking, this is because at “court mandate” there is a 60% chance of transitioning to “marriage amendment,” the defense‐of‐marriage activist's favorite policy, while at “civil unions” this chance drops to 30%."
"38","The purpose of this example is to demonstrate several key features of this model. First, all three players care both about the policy chosen today and about the types of policies that will replace it in the future. Second, farsightedness requires taking into account institutional particularities at any given time. In this example this is reflected in the exogenous Q term, which captures the fact that there is currently considerable pressure from interest groups to enact gay marriage bans at the federal level. And third, farsightedness also requires taking into account the preferences of other political actors. In the absence of a defense‐of‐marriage activist, the gay rights activist would have pursued a different political strategy. While this example is obviously highly stylized, it provides a clear picture of how this model works and demonstrates that the predictions that the model yields are often quite intuitive.            "
"39","A final point to note is that the “farsighted preferences” conceived of in this model are only farsighted with respect to the current political climate, or Q term. In this sense, the model predicts short‐term behavior when individuals care about policy in the long run. In this example a strategic gay rights activist will not challenge state‐level bans of gay marriage in the federal courts given the current political climate. Clearly the political climate will change over time, and these changes will necessarily change the predictions of the model.            "
"40","In this next example there are three voters and four alternatives, X={c, x, y, z}, with one alternative, c, being a Condorcet winner. The other three alternatives form a majority preference cycle, with x?y, y?z, and z?x. The Condorcet winner gives each voter a one‐shot payoff of 2, while the expected value of an alternative in the majority preference cycle is 3. Thus, while every player is better off cycling through the alternatives x, y, z than remaining at Condorcet winner c, c always gives two players strictly greater utility in the short term than they would receive at any other policy. Table 3 presents players' utility functions and their farsighted valuations when Q is uniform over all alternatives (i.e., when every alternative is equally likely to be brought to the floor for a vote).            "
"41"," Table 4 depicts individuals' rankings over the alternatives when individuals are both shortsighted and farsighted. As in the previous example, a preference reversal occurs. This reversal changes Condorcet winner c into a Condorcet loser in farsighted valuations, or a policy that is majority‐defeated by every other policy.10"
"42","The logic behind why the preference reversal occurs takes two steps to reveal. First note that in the short run Player 1 prefers c to y, but in the long run this preference is reversed. However, c and y both lead to similar payoffs in the subsequent round for Player 1: since every alternative beats c when voters are farsighted, the expected payoff to Player 1 in a round following the implementation of c is . Player 1's expected payoff after y is implemented is the same: y is only defeated by x, and so Player 1's expected payoff in the round following implementation of y is . However, c and y lead to different expected payoffs for Player 1 two rounds out. While y and c both lead to an expected payoff of  in a subsequent round, y leads to an expected payoff of  two rounds out, while c leads to an expected payoff of  two rounds out.11 Thus, while equilibrium evaluations in this framework capture expected payoffs for an infinite stream of future policies, the intuition behind why preference reversals occur can be seen in settings with a finite (and even small) number of periods.            "
"43","This example demonstrates that when voters are farsighted, outcomes will not necessarily coincide with many commonly known tournament solution concepts including the uncovered set, minimal covering set, tournament equilibrium set, Banks set, largest consistent set, and von Neumann‐Morgenstern stable set, as all of these sets reduce to the core, if one exists.12 In the spatial settings considered in the following section, outcomes do appear to coincide with elements of the von Neumann‐Morgenstern stable set. However, this observation cannot be extended to a general preference environment. The relevant issue is that cardinality of preferences matters in this setting, whereas tournament solution concepts only require ordinal preferences. This same issue distinguishes this model from sophisticated voting (the standard definition of which is presented in Shepsle and Weingast 1984), which is defined solely with respect to ordinal preferences. Sophisticated voting will always yield a Condorcet winner as the unique voting outcome, if a Condorcet winner exists. Here a Condorcet winner exists, but it is chosen with probability zero as an equilibrium policy outcome.            "
"44","More generally, this example of a Condorcet winner‐turned‐loser provides a good basis of comparison between this model and the standard sophisticated voting setup that is frequently used to analyze forward‐looking behavior in legislative settings. Sophisticated voting describes strategic voting behavior over a finite, predetermined sequence of alternatives. As in this model, sophisticated voters may seemingly exhibit “preference reversals,” in that they may vote in favor of alternatives that give them lower utility in order to beneficially affect the future path of play. However, under sophisticated voting, voters do not actually concede anything; individuals may vote against policies that they like, but only because they know that what they like cannot win. In this model, farsighted voters may take short‐term losses in order to do better in expectation than they could have in a one‐shot game.13"
"45","What follows is a look at several numerical estimations of this model in settings where the policy space is two‐dimensional. The first setting is that of a three‐player constant sum game and the second setting is that of a three‐player spatial model where players have convex preferences. The graphs that follow depict both the equilibrium value functions of one of the players and the equilibrium distribution over observed outcomes.14 In all of the estimations it is assumed that voting is via majority rule and that players vote deterministically, as in the previous section. It is also assumed that every player has the same discount factor, δ= 0.9, and that Q is uniform over the policy space. Q was chosen to be uniform simply as a baseline.         "
"46"," Figure 3 is a graph of Player 1's value function. The setting is a three‐player divide‐the‐dollar game; the policy space equals the set of all divisions of the dollar between three people and a player's utility from a particular policy equals the amount of money he is allocated by that policy. The policy space is pictured, and Player 1's ideal point (the policy x= (1, 0, 0)) is at the top of the simplex. The bottom of the simplex denotes those policies that give Player 1 no portion of the dollar. The darkest areas correspond to the policies that yield the highest values for Player 1, and the lightest areas denote the policies that yield the lowest values.            "
"47","                 Player 1's Value Function                         "
"48","It is apparent that the policies that Player 1 values most are not near Player 1's ideal point, but rather those that divide the dollar about equally between himself and one other player, or  and . The intuition for this is simple. Suppose that the status quo policy in a given round is Player 1's ideal point, (1, 0, 0). Then whichever policy is chosen to be pitted against the status quo in the next round will win with near certainty, because every policy weakly defeats Player 1's ideal point. Conversely, the point , as an example, is more stable and less likely to be defeated by a new policy. This is why Player 1's least favorite policy is at . Not only does Player 1 get a payoff of zero from this policy, but it is also a relatively stable outcome, unlikely to be replaced quickly.            "
"49"," Figure 4 depicts the density over observed policy outcomes. The darkest areas correspond to the most frequently observed policies. In this example only a small subset of the total policy space is ever observed with positive probability. The observed policies appear to constitute a majority‐rule core with respect to players' equilibrium value functions. Figure 3 demonstrates this—since the setting is symmetric, it is clear that each of Player 1's most preferred policies is also the most preferred policy of another player. This example demonstrates that the assumption of farsightedness gives us sharp predictions in this divide‐the‐dollar game. It predicts outcomes corresponding to the set of policies that divide the dollar evenly between all members of a minimal winning coalition. In this example, the likelihood of a policy defeating a status quo such as  is approximately 1%.            "
"50","                 Density Over Outcomes                         "
"51","In social choice theory this set of predicted policies is referred to as the von Neumann‐Morgenstern stable set and is defined by the property that no element in the set strictly defeats any other element in the set and that any policy outside the set is strictly defeated by an element inside the set.15 It is interesting to note that the predictions generated by this model when Q is uniform closely coincide with elements of the von Neumann‐Morgenstern stable set in all of the spatial settings considered. However, as the third section demonstrates, this is not true in general.            "
"52","It is also interesting to compare this example with a standard one‐shot bargaining model in which players are recognized with equal probability to propose allocations of the dollar and if an allocation is approved by a majority of voters, it goes into effect. In the one‐shot model proposals are made optimally with regard to future optimal behavior by players (in the event that a proposal is rejected). Baron and Ferejohn (1989) demonstrate that the only stationary subgame‐perfect equilibrium of the one‐shot model is for the proposer to give himself  of the dollar and to give  other players  each. In both models, only a bare majority of players receive a positive share of the dollar. In Baron and Ferejohn's model, members of the winning coalition receive different allocations of the dollar depending on whether or not they were the proposer. Here members of the winning coalition divide the dollar equally among themselves, as proposals are exogenous. Of course, ex ante outcomes in the one‐shot model and in this model are the same in expectation.            "
"53","This last series of pictures depicts a two‐dimensional spatial model, where the ideal points of the three players are no longer symmetric but are located at , and (1, 0). The policy space is bounded by the lines connecting the ideal points of the three players.16 First, preferences are assumed to be circular so that players are indifferent between all policies equidistant from their ideal points. This implies that each issue dimension matters equally to each player. Then we will consider the case where two of the three players care more about one issue dimension than the other.            "

"58","In Figure 6 we can see that Player 1's highest‐valued alternative is close to the point (0, .25). Although not pictured, the equilibrium “highest‐valued” policies of Players 2 and 3 are (.03, .03) and (.94, 0), respectively. Farsightedness induces Players 1 and 3 to prefer policies that may spark the formation of a coalition between themselves and Player 2, the most moderate player. Figure 6 shows that the most observed outcome is approximately (0, .22), close to the alternative in the stable set corresponding to a coalition between Players 1 and 2, the two players whose ideal points are closest to each other. In this example the stable set consists of the points {(0, .19), (.28, .36), (.19, 0)}, approximately.            "
"59","In the last example the preferences of Players 2 and 3 are now elliptical rather than circular, and are defined by the equation                "

"61","Interestingly, even though Player 1's utility function is the same as in the previous example, his equilibrium value function is quite different from both his utility function and his value function in the previous example, when the preferences of the other two players were circular. Figure 9 shows that Player 1's most preferred alternative now lies close to the origin, the ideal point of Player 2. The reason for this is similar to the intuition behind the example given earlier. Because Players 2 and 3 both favor policies that lie close to the x‐axis, Player 1 knows that implementing a policy that appeals to him along the y‐dimension is a lost cause. This is because the point , Player 1's ideal point, is the alternative in X that is farthest from the x‐axis. Thus, he is willing to concede a great deal of utility along the second dimension of the policy space in order to collude with Player 2 along the first dimension.            "

"63","The stable set in this example approximately equals {(.14, .03), (0, .01), (.09, 0)}. Figure 10 shows that there exists a single alternative, (.09, .02), that arises with near certainty. This alternative is close to the alternative in the stable set corresponding to a coalition between Players 2 and 3. As in the previous example, this prediction corresponds to the most socially efficient element of the stable set; it is the element of the stable set that maximizes the sum of the players' utilities.

"65","Societies frequently make decisions that will persist into the future. Indeed, it is not a stretch to argue that most policies that people care about are of this form, with examples being social policies, entitlements, budgets, and redistributive policies. This article argues that there is no reason to expect that preferences over these “continuing” policies will be similar to preferences over “once‐and‐for‐all” policies. This is because, when evaluating continuing policies, individuals consider not only their payoffs from the policies themselves, but also from what the policies will lead to in the future. I show that when preferences are considered in this way, surprising outcomes can emerge in several standard legislative settings. For example, I demonstrate that a policy that is a Condorcet winner in a one‐shot game is selected with probability zero as a policy outcome when voters are farsighted."
"66","One implication of the model is that its predictions can give insight into the sorts of coalitions that may form in settings where policy is implemented over many rounds. While the existence of stable coalitions is undeniably central to political life, such coalitions can be difficult to understand from a theoretical perspective. This type of dynamic environment is perhaps one of the most natural in which to think of the formation of alliances, and this article formalizes a common argument for why stability can arise and persist in the real world. In the theory presented here, individuals consider the trade‐off between the immediate value of a policy and the long‐run stability of the coalition implementing that policy. Ultimately, this consideration leads to the recognition that policies that fairly divide benefits between members of a winning coalition leave individual players best off in the long run. The cooperation that emerges in this model does not rely on any threat of punishment other than the fact that current policies can be replaced by new alternatives."
"67","The theory can also be interpreted as providing an explanation for why particular coalitions are more likely to form than others. Both the analytic and numerical examples demonstrate that farsighted voters will frequently vote for policies that do not necessarily give them the highest one‐shot payoff. The favorite policies of a farsighted voter will depend on a combination of his own preferences, the preferences of other voters, the voting power of other voters, and the likelihood with which certain policies will be brought to the floor. Thus, the model provides a nuanced characterization of voter considerations that encompasses many different elements of the institutional environment. It also provides a characterization of voting behavior that is estimable, because the model yields distributional predictions."
"68","While the model presented in this article is purely formal, the theory is applicable to a variety of real‐world legislative settings, as it utilizes only weak assumptions about the number of voters, their preferences, their respective voting weights, the voting rule, and the policy space. However, the predictive power of the model will depend largely on the functional form of the proposal process Q. This process can be thought of as representing the likelihood with which particular policies will be considered by the group in the future. Estimating these likelihoods in real‐world situations may provide insight into the prospective voting behavior of legislators, with the implication being that the perceived distribution of future policy considerations may be an omitted variable in some empirical models of legislative voting.

"110","Proof:  Markov perfection requires that if two histories ht and  have the same value of type profile ωt, then  for all i. In considering Markov‐perfect equilibria suppose that strategies σi are measurable with respect to ωi≡ (x, y, θi).

In other words, if Player i votes for y over x, then the likelihood that y defeats x is weakly greater than it would have been had Player i voted for x over y.                  "

Since  is by definition Markovian with respect to ωi≡ (x, y, θi), we can conclude that, for any dynamically stable voting equilibrium, v*, the strategy profile  is a Bayesian Markov‐perfect Nash equilibrium.          □                  "
