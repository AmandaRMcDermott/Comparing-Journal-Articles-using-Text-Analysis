"1","Citizens reach out to their representatives for a variety of reasons, such as to express their views on issues and pending legislation, to raise new concerns, to praise or criticize a representative's actions, and to solicit help with bureaucracies. This ability for people to directly engage the individuals who represent them—to express their views in a way not constrained by the small number of competing electoral choices—is a hallmark of democratic governance (Verba and Nie 1972) and is explicitly enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.         "
"2","Like so many other decisions, however, the choice of whether or not to participate in politics via direct contact occurs amidst the exigencies of everyday life. At the margin, citizens decide to undertake effortful contact with attention to the benefits and costs—material, psychological, or otherwise (Jones et al. 1977; Thomas 1982).         "
"3","A number of perspectives suggest that citizens might find contacting a copartisan legislator relatively more appealing. First, a rich tradition in the psychological study of intergroup relations documents that people tend to prefer interpersonal contact with fellow group members and avoid contact with outgroups. For example, many whites tend to avoid interpersonal interactions with blacks and prefer interacting with other whites (e.g., Allport 1954; Blascovich et al. 2001). Moreover, when individuals are forced to interact with outgroup members, they often become anxious (e.g., Plant and Devine 2003), grow weary (e.g., Richeson and Trawalter 2005), and develop feelings of resentment or hostility (e.g., Enos 2014, 2015). In light of research that citizen partisanship sometimes mimics the properties of social identities like race and gender (Green et al. 2002; Iyenger and Westwood 2014; Mason 2014; Theodoridis 2012), we expected partisans in the public might similarly prefer contact with elites in a partisan ingroup relative to a partisan outgroup. Consistent with this view, work on descriptive representation suggests that shared personal traits between politicians and constituents facilitate trust and communication (e.g., Broockman 2014; Gay 2002; Mansbridge 1999). Likewise, partisans seem to prefer encountering information consistent with their partisan proclivities (Ryan and Brader N.d.; Stroud 2011; Taber and Lodge 2006).         "
"4","Second, a blossoming literature in political science documents how citizens seem to show a preference for contact with copartisans in their day‐to‐day lives. People seem to prefer living in places populated by copartisans (Cho, Gimpel, and Hui 2013; Hui 2013; Public Policy Polling 2012; but see Nall and Mummolo 2014) and prefer copartisans as mates (Alford et al. 2011; Huber and Malhotra 2013; Klofstad, McDermott, and Hatemi 2012). We similarly expected that, when it comes to the consequential decision of whether to contact their representatives, citizens may exhibit a similar preference for interacting with copartisans.         "
"5","Finally, we conjectured that citizens might expect copartisans to be more responsive to their concerns. When a citizen is in an elite's winning coalition, she may expect that elite to work harder to maintain her support than an elite who is able to win office without her support. Consistent with this view, experiments have found that elites are more responsive to communications from copartisans (Butler and Broockman 2011; Grose 2015). Citizens may also tend to associate some negative traits with outpartisans, such as stubbornness or incompetence, that might lead them to expect contacting outpartisan legislators to be relatively less worthwhile.         "
"6","The extent to which these expectations would apply to citizens contacting their representatives is unclear a priori. Contacting a representative is typically one‐way or impersonal (e.g., e‐mail, postal mail) and so may not evoke the same aversion to outpartisans as face‐to‐face contact or dating decisions. Gay (2002) and Broockman (2014) find that citizens are more likely to communicate to legislators of their race, but partisan identity might not be as potent as racial identity. Moreover, citizens who might engage tend to contact legislators mostly about matters of special importance, which could swamp partisan considerations. However, there are few studies of whether partisan identities influence everyday decisions of this sort (Iyenger and Westwood 2015).         "
"7","Comparing how likely citizens are to contact representatives of different parties seems a straightforward task but is fraught with inferential challenges. One tempting approach would be to compare the contact habits of (for instance) Democrats living in areas represented by a Democrat to the contact habits of Democrats living in areas represented by a Republican, as would be possible with publicly available data sets such as the American National Election Study (ANES) or the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). The concern with this approach is endogeneity: Significantly different contact rates could reflect a causal effect of a copartisan representative, but they could also reflect unrelated differences in district characteristics. This is not an idle concern. The possibility that Democrats most predisposed to participate in politics would sort themselves into the kind of areas likely to be represented by Democrats has a ring of plausibility (e.g., Cho, Gimpel, and Hui 2013). Moreover, districts with the most active Democratic citizens might be more likely to elect Democratic representatives in the first place, leading Democratic legislators to tend to have more active Democratic constituents. Each of our studies thus attempts to isolate the relevant counterfactual—would a citizen's contact decisions have been different if an elected official were of a different party?—in its own way.         "
"8","We begin by examining whether citizens exhibit a preference for communicating to copartisan legislators when they have their choice of a copartisan and an outpartisan, both of whom hold the same office. To do so, we focus on the 17 U.S. states that have one senator from each of the two major parties. In particular, we compare citizens’ self‐reported preference for contacting their copartisan senator to the self‐reported preference for contacting their outpartisan senator and find that citizens consistently report greater interest in contacting their copartisan senator. Moreover, consistent with our theory, we find that the preference for contacting copartisans is larger when subjects have information about their senators’ party affiliations and persists whether or not ideological considerations are at stake."
"9","Study 1's approach has strengths and weaknesses. Our comparison between citizens’ contacting the copartisan rather than the outpartisan senator is not a perfect counterfactual—that could only come from changing the partisanship of the same politician—but it does hold constant attributes of citizens and the effects of political office. Moreover, the within‐subjects design facilitates well‐powered question‐wording experiments to probe the resilience of these effects. Nevertheless, the self‐reported and hypothetical nature of the dependent variable leaves Study 1 open to demand effects, a pitfall our other studies help address.         "
"10","Study 1 draws from two distinct samples. First, we fielded a pilot study on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing service (N = 150; Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012). Second, we repeated the study—and replicated the findings—on a larger sample (N = 330) collected by Survey Sampling International (SSI). Whereas MTurk is a convenience sample, SSI is a diverse national panel built through targeted recruitment in various online communities that compares favorably with Census benchmarks.3 The MTurk sample was fielded December 28–30, 2013, and the SSI sample was fielded February 21–25, 2014.            "
"11","After introductory questions collecting subjects’ demographic information and issue opinions (part of a separate investigation), subjects were asked about how they might express their political views about the Social Security program. In a baseline version of the question (experimental variations explained below), they were asked:               "
"12","Several government programs pay benefits to many Americans. Social Security is one example of such a program, but there are others. Suppose you heard about a proposal the U.S. Senate was considering to make a change to Social Security that you did not like. How likely would you be to do each of the following?"
"13","There was then a grid with five activities, presented in a random order: “Write a letter to the editor of a local newspaper”; “Voice your concerns through social media, such as Facebook or Twitter”; “Encourage your friends and neighbors to sign a petition”; “Contact Senator [Name], a Democrat”; and “Contact Senator [Name], a Republican,” where the names were programmed to be appropriate for the respondent's state.4The response options were Certain, Extremely likely, Very likely, Somewhat likely, and Not at all likely.            "
"14","Our study also included two manipulations that provide robustness checks for our theory of partisan‐motivated communication. The first of these stemmed from our concern that partisan preference, if found to exist, might be driven by familiarity rather than psychological aversion. By virtue of being on party mail and canvassing lists, or by attending to one's own party primary, a citizen might be more likely to recognize a copartisan's name than the outpartisan's. This familiarity could lead to a greater contact propensity for the copartisan, but would not be a preference per se. One implication of our account is that removing party labels should decrease the preference for contacting a copartisan senator, since partisan considerations may grow less salient, and since some subjects will not know which party each senator belongs to. To test whether this pattern holds, we randomly assigned whether senators’ party labels were included in the response items.            "
"15","The second manipulation represents an effort to examine how far‐reaching a preference for contacting copartisans might be. One possibility is that citizens have a preference for contacting copartisans when there are ideological considerations in play, but they are indifferent between copartisans and outpartisans otherwise. This pattern might emerge, for instance, if the copartisan preference arises from a perception (by citizens) that partisan rifts are insurmountable—that is, when it comes to divisive issues with ideological overtones, critical feedback will receive little heed. Our theory, in contrast, suggests that the preference for contacting copartisans might reach beyond hot‐button policy issues. If this preference arises from an aversion to communicating with outpartisan legislators in general, it should emerge in ideological and nonideological contexts alike."
"16","As a test of whether the copartisan preference is contingent in this way, half the subjects in our sample saw a version of the question where we attempted to minimize ideological considerations. The question focused on constituent services (i.e., “casework”), a realm of activity that legislators like to emphasize precisely because it generally avoids implicating traditional partisan divisions (e.g., Butler, Karpowitz, and Pope 2012; Grimmer 2013; Serra and Cover 1992). Subjects were asked whether they would contact each senator not to express their opinions, but for help dealing with the bureaucracy. To maximize parallelism with the formulation above, we retained the mention of Social Security. The alternative question read as follows:               "
"17","Several government programs pay benefits to many Americans. Social Security is one example of such a program, but there are others. Suppose there was an error and you did not receive a government benefit to which you were rightly entitled. How likely would you be to do each of the following?"
"18","The response items were unchanged in the Casework formulation, although the Casework formulation was fully crossed with the Party Label manipulation, making for a 2×2 factorial design."
"19","The main test statistic for Study 1 is the mean within‐subject difference between self‐reported likelihood of contacting the copartisan senator and self‐reported likelihood of contacting the outpartisan senator. We code each senator as being a copartisan or an outpartisan with respect to the subject5 and then define Copartisan Preference as the subject's preference for contacting the copartisan minus her preference for contacting the outpartisan (scaled to run –1 to 1). Thus, subjects who register a stronger preference for contacting their copartisan senator have positive values of Copartisan Preference. Negative values of Copartisan Preference reflect a preference for contacting an outpartisan senator. Values of zero on Copartisan Preference reflect indifference.            "
"20","Table 1 and Figure 1 report Study 1's main results. In the table, Copartisan Preference is regressed on an intercept (which allows examination of the bias as averaged across experimental conditions). There are also models that regress Copartisan Preference on indicators for each condition and their interaction.6 In the figure, the y‐axis refers to the mean level of Copartisan Preference in each condition.            "
"21","Experimental Results, Study 1"
"22","As can be seen, partisans in both samples tend to show a greater preference for contacting their copartisan senator, consistent with our hypothesis. To convey the basic result in more intuitive terms, we find (in both samples) that more than 25% of respondents report a preference for contacting a copartisan. Less than 7% report a preference for contacting the outpartisan."
"23","Differences across experimental conditions are also consistent with our hypothesis. First, consider the effect of removing party labels. In both samples, Copartisan Preference is stronger when party labels are present, which, as we discuss above, is consistent with partisanship itself playing a role in generating copartisan preference. However, Copartisan Preference is also significantly positive (p < .02 in both samples) when party labels are absent, propitious for the generalizability of this effect. Next, the groups of columns in each panel show the effects separately for whether the scripts asked respondents to consider whether the issue at hand concerned a policy or constituency service matter. Here, we find no effect from manipulating whether the contact context concerns a bill versus casework, a result that suggests copartisan contacting preference spills over even into domains where policy concerns should fade into the background. We return to this result in the Discussion.7"
"24","Study 1 presented subjects with a choice in which they directly consider their own likelihood of contacting a copartisan and an outpartisan senator. The virtue of this approach is that, because both senators hold the same office, it allows the influence of copartisanship to emerge clearly. The design, however, also had some weaknesses. Subjects were aware of participating in research, so their responses might be colored by demand characteristics, such as the desire to affirm their partisan leanings (Bullock et al. 2013). The dilemma our subjects faced was also somewhat artificial, leaving open the possibility that citizens distinguish between copartisans and outpartisans when the two are starkly presented side‐by‐side, but not in more typical circumstances, such as when prompted by an interest group. Finally, it queried subjects’ hypothetical intentions, which might or might not reflect how they actually would behave.         "
"25","Our next study considers two field experiments conducted by an advocacy group, data that complement the evidence from Study 1 in two important ways. First, whereas Study 1 relied on responses within an academic survey, the field experiments are more naturalistic: They allow us to observe citizens responding to real‐world political stimuli instead of a survey instrument. Second, Study 2 employs a between‐subjects design, reducing concern the results reflect demand effects. Finally, the field experiments examine real behaviors instead of self‐reported intentions on surveys."
"26","The experiments took place through two organizing campaigns conducted by a liberal interest group. The group maintains a list of several million Americans who have opted in to receive notices about opportunities for political activism. Both campaigns concerned Senator Dianne Feinstein's FISA Improvements Act, Senate Bill 1631 in the 113th Senate. Senator Feinstein drafted the bill in response to the revelations of Edward Snowden about the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance programs. The bill proposed some regulation and oversight of the NSA but also would establish the legality of many of the programs Snowden's summer 2013 disclosures brought to light. The group that conducted the experiment opposed the bill because it would codify many of these NSA programs, to which it objected."
"27","The group sent e‐mails to its members asking them to contact their senators and request that they oppose the bill. As part of internal studies of how to increase the effectiveness of their outreach efforts, the group randomly assigned which of each recipient's two senators he or she was asked to contact. Therefore, in the 17 states with senators of two parties, half the message recipients were asked to contact their Republican senator, and half were asked to contact their Democratic senator. The group conducted two such studies: one focused on generating signatures on petitions addressed to senators and the other focused on generating phone calls to their offices."
"28","Because the group in question is very liberal in its orientation, and because its mailing list is opt‐in on the basis of performing liberal activism with the group, it is safe to assume that the proportion of message recipients who see themselves as Democrats vastly exceeds the proportion who see themselves as Republicans.8Therefore, if the outpartisan communication aversion hypothesis holds true, recipients should be more likely to engage in activism when the message asks them to contact their Democratic senator than when it asks them to contact the Republican.            "
"29","In the first experiment, the group asked members to sign an online petition. There were 117,984 message recipients in the 17 split‐delegation states, and 13,253 of them signed the petition (11.2%). In Table 2, we regress (OLS) the binary Signed indicator on the treatment indicator for the copartisan condition.9 The top‐left coefficient means that the signing rate was 0.7 percentage points higher in the copartisan condition, a significant difference. The data set provided to us also includes a small number of covariates, and including them in the model likely sharpens our estimate of the treatment effect, so we present the results accounting for this information as well.10 As can be seen, this inclusion does not change inferences.            "
"30","Signing a petition is an easy task that takes just a few moments. Does the preference for contacting copartisans also apply to more effortful actions? There is evidence that it does. The interest group followed up its initial solicitation with a second e‐mail asking its members to call one of their senators’ offices about opposing the bill. Calling merits separate attention because it requires a more substantial time investment and, for this reason, might influence legislators more powerfully (e.g., Bergan 2009; Congressional Management Foundation 2011; Kollman 1998).            "
"31","As in the Petition Experiment, in the Phone Call Experiment, the group contacted its members via e‐mail and randomized which senator members were urged to contact.11Message recipients expressed a desire to call the senator they were assigned by clicking a link in this e‐mail reading, “Call Senator [Name]…Click here for the sample script and the number to call.” (The full text of the e‐mail is shown in the supporting information.) When clicked, this link took group members to a website containing the phone number for the senator's office and sample arguments opposing the policy they could deliver. The outcome variable we analyze is whether recipients sought to engage in this form of contact by clicking the link in order to get information on how to call their senator's office.12"
"32","Not surprisingly, fewer subjects overall sought to engage in this more effortful form of contact relative to petitions—just 3.13% of those prompted. However, as Table 2 reports, subjects were significantly more likely to do so when asked to call their copartisan senator. Again, this effect is robust to the inclusion of controls.            "
"33","In percentage point terms, the effect we observe in the Phone Call Experiment is slightly smaller than in the Petition Experiment, although the baseline is also much lower. Alternatively, when viewed as a percentage increase over the control, the effect is larger than in the Petition Experiment, evidence that the copartisan preference might be more important for this more personal and interactive form of contact. Put differently, in the Phone Call Experiment, it appears that about 1 in 7 group members who sought to contact their copartisan senator would not have done so had the group asked them to contact their outpartisan senator instead. In the Petition Experiment, this same figure is about 1 in 15.13"
"34","Together with our earlier results, Study 2 increases our confidence that American citizens’ stated preference for contact with copartisan representatives translates into their actual participation decisions. However, like all field experiments, Study 2 has important limitations. The results are limited to one group, one population, and one issue. In our view, the most important question is whether the same dynamics would persist when citizens decide whether to contact their legislators organically, and not at the prompting of an interest group. Study 3 attempts to expand the external validity of Studies 1 and 2 in considering this question."
"35","Our studies so far consider how citizens react when an interest group or survey researchers present them with the opportunity to contact their representatives. However, this approach may not fully capture the significance of copartisan preference when citizens choose to contact legislators of their own accord. For example, if citizens find a political issue particularly distressing, they may not be much encouraged or deterred by their representative's party. On the other hand, subjects in the field experiment may also have felt compelled to contact their representative at the interest group's insistence, pressure that could overwhelm many citizens’ preference for contact with copartisans. Our studies so far have also been limited to the U.S. Senate, leaving open the question of whether the same patterns would be present in other institutional contexts."
"36","Study 3 helps address these questions by approaching the copartisan preference from an entirely different angle. We take advantage of the 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), a large data set (N = 32,800) collected online by YouGov/Polimetrix in October and November of 2008.14Convenient for our purposes, the 2008 CCES asked each respondent whether he or she has contacted his or her current representative in the U.S. House of Representatives.15Because the CCES also collects information on subjects’ partisanship, it is possible to compare (retrospective) contact of copartisans to contact of outpartisans.         "
"37","So far, this approach leaves unaddressed the matters of endogeneity we emphasized earlier. Fortunately, the prodigious size of the CCES sample allows us to carry out a regression discontinuity (RD) analysis geared to address problems of endogeneity.16Increasingly common in the study of political representation and behavior (e.g., Eggers and Hainmueller 2009), RD exploits quasi‐random assignment of very close U.S. House races to identify the causal effect of electing a legislator of a particular party under fairly weak conditions (Lee 2008). The intuition that underlies the technique is that, while election outcomes are not generally random, the outcome of narrowly decided elections is “as good as random” and thus can serve to identify causal effects of the outcome. Here, we examine whether Americans living in congressional districts where a copartisan narrowly won the last U.S. House election are more likely to report having contacted their U.S. House member than Americans living in congressional districts where the copartisan narrowly lost. The assumptions needed to recover unbiased effects are even weaker in our studies than in other applications of RD design, as they analyze variation across partisan groups within districts.         "
"38","To preview our results, we find that copartisans tend to contact their representatives more when copartisan candidates narrowly won the last election than when copartisans narrowly lost. That is, for example, Democratic citizens in districts where Democratic members of Congress narrowly won the last election tend to report having contacted their members of Congress more often than do Democratic citizens in districts where Republican members of Congress were barely elected. These results are robust to a variety of different modeling approaches."
"39","As described above, our data come from the 2008 CCES. To this data set, we append information on the outcome of the 2006 House elections gathered from the CQ Press Voting and Elections Collection. We also manually incorporated information on a small number of special mid‐term elections. We treated the most recent election in a given district as the election of record. Based on respondents’ reported partisanship (leaners included), we code each as being represented by a copartisan or outpartisan House member."
"40","As we note above, a number of studies find narrowly determined House elections—including some of the same elections we analyze here—to satisfy the requirements for an RD design. Still, because we are using a subset of the previously used data (i.e., results from a single election cycle, rather than multiple cycles), we examine a number of covariates that might relate to political engagement to determine whether they are balanced in a way that allows us to recover the effect of being represented by a copartisan, rather than an outpartisan, House member.17 As reported in the supporting information, when we examine respondents in districts where congressional races were determined by 1 percentage point or less, we find only small and insignificant relationships with performance on a political knowledge battery, frequency of church attendance, self‐reported attention to politics, and respondents’ income. Like previous studies using some of the same data (e.g., Caughey and Sekhon 2011), however, we do not find perfect balance on every covariate. As the supporting information reports, there are moderate relationships with average strength of Democratic Party identification and proclivity to make political donations. For both of these measures, though, the imbalances are in a direction that makes our hypothesis tests more conservative: Having a copartisan representative corresponds to weaker partisan identification and fewer political donations. We expect that these relationships would cause us, if anything, to understate the effect of having a copartisan representative on contact, as people whose copartisans narrowly won the last election tend to be slightly less politically engaged in other ways. There is a positive relationship with strength of Republican identification, though it is modest in size and, by a difference‐of‐means test, not statistically significant. Still, as a robustness check, we supplement the results of our RD analysis with a flexible matching approach that accounts for remaining imbalances.18"
"41","First, we inspect the potential discontinuity in contact behavior visually. Using kernel‐smoothed polynomial regression, we fit lines that illustrate how citizens’ contact behavior depends on their own party's margin of victory (Figure 2).19 We fit separate lines on either side of the potential discontinuity. As the figure shows, there is a marked increase in the likelihood of a citizen saying she contacted her congressional representative when the citizen's own party narrowly won the 2006 election.20"
"42","Effect of a Copartisan Representative"
"43","For our main statistical analysis, we regress (OLS) self‐reported contact on an indicator variable for having a copartisan representative within the 1 percentage point RD window described above. Because our independent variable of interest varies at the district level, we cluster standard errors by district. In Table 3, we present two models: one that includes a fixed effect for each district in the sample and one that does not. As can be seen, citizens are more likely to contact their representative if a copartisan narrowly won than if a copartisan narrowly lost—a difference that is statistically significant and of a substantively consequential size.21"
"44","For the reasons noted above, we also supplement our RD analysis with a matching analysis that potentially sharpens estimates of treatment effects by comparing observations with similar values on observable characteristics. We use GenMatch (Sekhon 2011), an approach that employs a genetic search algorithm to assign weights to observations so as to maximize covariate balance.22To increase the plausibility of the assumption that the treatment variable is independent of subjects’ potential outcomes conditioned on observables, we conduct our matching analysis within a 1 percentage point discontinuity window. GenMatch allows us to achieve strong covariate balance (see the supporting information, Section 2.1). As reported in Table 2, this estimate of the copartisan ATE corroborates the results from our RD analysis.23"
"45","Across all the analyses we employ, the results are strikingly stable. Victory by a copartisan representative appears to increase self‐reported contacting of representatives, a result that is significant both statistically and substantively. We take these results as further evidence in favor of partisan‐motivated communication."
"46","We motivated our discussion of Study 3 by noting that how citizens behave when deciding to spontaneously contact their representatives may differ from how they behave when others prompt them to do so, as in Studies 1 and 2. By contrast, Study 3 asks subjects to report their previous contacting behavior across circumstances, which includes both their own decisions to contact their representatives as well as the mobilized variety of contact we considered in the previous studies."
"47","The results suggest that the total magnitude of copartisan preference across these circumstances is quite sizable. For example, the genetic matching method suggests that the causal effect of being represented by a copartisan on contact is 7.9 percentage points from a baseline of about 31%. This suggests that being represented by a copartisan leads citizens to contact their representatives about 27% more often, the implications of which we expand on in the Discussion."
"48","There is one more important takeaway from Study 3. Study 1 leaves open the possibility that copartisan preference does not decrease citizen contact of politicians, but rather displaces it from an outpartisan to a copartisan. Study 2 does not go far in addressing this possibility because it focuses on responses to a mobilization campaign. By focusing on members of the House of Representatives, Study 3 gives the strongest evidence that the preference for contacting a copartisan representative silences voices that might otherwise be heard.            "
"49","Many scholars have worried that partisan attachments serve to insulate citizens from encountering meaningful disagreement with their political views (e.g., Haidt 2012; Mutz 2006; Taber and Lodge 2006; Zaller 1992).         "
"50","Here, we present evidence that such motivations bear not only on the information citizens receive from elites; they also work in the other direction, isolating elites from hearing the perspectives of the citizens most likely to disagree with them. Drawing evidence from a variety of data, and a mixture of observational and experimental research designs, we found a reliable copartisan preference in communication that manifested in real‐world participation decisions."
"51","Although not dispositive about the size of this effect in all circumstances, our evidence suggests it can be substantively significant. In Study 1, over 25% of respondents reported a preference for contacting a copartisan. In the phone call field experiment, 13% of group members who sought to contact a copartisan senator would not have done so had the senator been an outpartisan instead. On the other hand, the effect size we found in our petition experiment was somewhat smaller. But in Study 3—arguably the most helpful for contemplating broader effects—the effect is quite large: a 27% increase.24As we elaborate below, this variation is a fruitful topic for future research. Nevertheless, we see consistent evidence that, under a variety of circumstances, it can be quite sizable.         "
"52","Given how closely elected officials appear to watch the communication they receive from constituents (e.g., Bergan 2009; Congressional Management Foundation 2011; Miler 2010), these findings have important implications for understanding the mind‐set of elites. As an illustration of one such possibility, consider a simple analysis from the CCES. For members of Congress who “just won” the 2006 election,2550% of the citizens who reported contacting them were copartisans, compared to only 40% who were from the other party (the remaining 10% did not state a party identification). Such a disparity suggests that even legislators making their best effort to represent their constituencies faithfully may place too much weight on the views and priorities of their copartisans. Such implications need not be limited to citizens’ policy preferences per se: Given evidence that partisan citizens often seem hostile to elite compromises (Harbridge, Malhotra, and Harrison 2013, Ryan N.d.), this bias might also discourage elite cooperation.26"
"53","Our results also raise an intriguing possibility about the sources of rising partisan polarization. A number of studies show that politicians of different parties tend to represent and perceive the very same constituents quite differently (Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart 2001; Broockman and Skovron 2014; Fiorina and Abrams 2009; McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2009). This is crucial, for it means that some differences between how Democratic and Republican elites behave do not arise solely from differences in the citizens they represent. Recognizing this, some scholars have turned to institutional factors, such as enhanced tools to enforce party discipline, to explain this representational disconnect (e.g., Theriault 2008). We do not take issue with findings that stress the role of elites, but we note that our results point to a potentially prominent role for citizens in contributing to differences in elite behavior.         "
"54","The patterns we identify also bear on a number of broader questions. First, although not dispositive, our results are consistent with other research that finds partisanship can behave like a social identity, “spilling over” into behaviors other than vote choice (e.g., Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012; Iyenger and Westwood 2015; Klofstad, McDermott, and Hatemi 2012; Mason 2014). The behavioral patterns we found do not seem to represent mere cheap talk on surveys (e.g., Bullock et al. 2013), but are consistent with the view that partisanship can affect ancillary behavior (e.g., Gerber and Huber 2009; Gift and Gift 2015). To be sure, our results cannot definitively establish what aspect of partisanship leads Americans to prefer contacting copartisans. For instance, we cannot distinguish whether people assume that the outpartisan will not respond to their requests or instead attempt to avoid negative feelings that come from communicating with an outgroup. However, our results further underline that partisanship's influence is far‐reaching.         "
"55","In addition, the preference for contacting copartisans we find bears on the strategies that interest groups will find attractive as they seek to mobilize supporters. Political outcomes frequently turn on interest groups’ ability to manage the scope of conflict (Schattschneider 1960), and observers often welcome the idea of a more energetic and participatory electorate (e.g., Schlozman et al. 2012).         "
"56","As Study 2 illustrated most vividly, our results suggest that interest groups seeking to drum up the maximum volume of correspondence directed at an elected official might see benefits in urging citizens to contact copartisans. As such, our results resonate with other findings that suggest some strategies that make the electorate more participatory can also exacerbate political ills (e.g., Enos, Fowler, and Vavreck 2014). Making partisan considerations focal in grassroots campaigns might be an effective way to increase citizens’ involvement, but it might also serve to further distort legislators’ perceptions of their constituencies. Indeed, in Study 1, we found that reminding citizens of their senators’ partisan affiliations made them less interested in contacting outpartisan senators relative to copartisans.         "
"57","Our results also point to a number of possible extensions. First, even when citizens are contacting a copartisan, their messages can be supportive (“Keep up the good work”), critical (“You are out of line”), or merely directive (“I want you to support this bill”). Studies 1 and 2 fit most comfortably in the directive category, whereas Study 3 lumps all types of contact together. This combination of approaches requires us to be measured in how much we can conclude about the extent to which the bias we identify causes elites to entrench in their current issue positions versus prognosticate what partisan voters will want. Future work could more systematically examine the content of citizens’ contact efforts."
"58","Second, one could imagine the extent of the copartisan bias depending on institutional factors. For instance, the preference for contacting copartisans might be attenuated for state‐level offices, where partisan considerations and rhetoric are sometimes subdued. For another possibility, representatives from single‐member districts (e.g., the House) might seek to downplay partisanship relative to dual‐member districts (e.g., the Senate), since senators are eager to differentiate themselves from each other (Schiller 2000).         "
"59","Third, our theoretical focus on social identity leads us to think that the extent of bias might depend on the mode of contact. In particular, it is possible citizens exhibit a greater copartisan preference when it comes to especially intense or personal forms of contact, such as speaking to a representative at an event, the very kinds of interactions that research suggests weigh most heavily in legislators’ minds (Congressional Management Foundation 2011). Consistent with this potential, the differences we uncover in Study 2 are larger (in percentage terms) when it comes to phone calls—a relatively personal and effortful form of contact—than for signing a petition. We cannot conclusively establish a relationship between the preference for copartisan contact and how personal this contact is with our data, however, and we would welcome more on the matter.         "
"60","Despite our general leeriness of a tendency for politicians to live in bubbles, isolated from the views of citizens they are supposed to represent, we can close on a cautiously optimistic note. Across many settings, one of the best ways to address biases in behavior and decision making is to make individuals aware of the biases in their behavior (e.g., Monteith 1993). For example, sports referees who exhibited racial bias when allocating points and fouls adjusted their behavior once made aware of it (Pope, Price, and Wolfers 2014). Likewise, making politicians aware that the balance of communication they receive from constituents is skewed by partisanship might help reduce their misperceptions of their constituents’ views and encourage moderation, to the extent politicians wish to do so (Butler and Nickerson 2011).27 Citizens could benefit from a reminder too. Divisions are deep; political animosities are rife. But the folks on the other side just might listen.         "
