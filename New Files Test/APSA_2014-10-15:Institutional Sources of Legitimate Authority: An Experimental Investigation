"1","While political legitimacy has a distinguished history in normative political thought (Peter 2010), efforts to quantify and measure legitimacy or describe its strategic (e.g., game‐theoretic) underpinnings are less well developed (Hyde 1983). Max Weber ([1922] 1978) provides the seminal analysis of legitimacy as a descriptive concept, defining legitimacy as a belief in or orientation to the validity of a social order—one that involves the recognition that the rules governing behavior within that order are binding on its subjects and “constitute a desirable model for him to imitate” (Weber 1947, 124).         "
"2","We focus on two potential institutional sources of government legitimacy. The first is the means by which public officials (especially bureaucrats) are compensated. In describing “legal‐rational” authority, Weber writes of “a complete absence of appropriation of his official position by the incumbent,” and that “[staff] are remunerated by fixed salaries in money” (Weber [1922] 1978, 219, 220). For Weber, fixed compensation ensures the objectivity of public officials, who can direct their actions toward neutral, prescribed ends rather than personal enrichment or advancement.         "
"3","The most immediate objection to the Weberian model is that officials may be insufficiently motivated to exert effort performing their responsibilities absent some high‐powered system of incentives (Becker and Stigler 1974; Harris and Raviv 1978). Indeed, departures from the Weberian ideal are ubiquitous throughout history: Tax farmers (e.g., the publicani in ancient Rome, pronoiai under the Byzantine Empire; the fermiers Généraux in ancien régime France; and holders of medieval English fiefdoms) were granted authority to collect revenue on behalf of the state; excess revenue thus represented pure profit. Appropriative incentives might also be informal, as in environments where corrupt officials can extort bribes from citizens accused of offenses (Rose‐Ackerman 1978). Quasi‐appropriative behavior may also emerge from the career concerns of salaried officials: Regulators or law enforcement officials may be rewarded based on the number of arrests, citations, or convictions they can claim credit for (Gordon and Huber 2002; Huber 2007; Knowles, Persico, and Todd 2001).         "
"4","Our analysis of the relationship between official incentives and legitimacy is closely related to literature on the economics of agency, which identifies conditions under which high‐powered incentives are undesirable (Benabou and Tirole 2006; Dewatripont, Jewitt, and Tirole 1999; Gailmard and Patty 2007; Holmstrom and Milgrom 1991; Wilson 1989), and to experimental research on reactions to perceived selfishness and/or unfairness (Fehr and Fischbacher 2002; Lin‐Healy and Small 2013).         "
"5","A second feature of government institutions long posited to affect their legitimacy is transparency. In a discussion of representative assemblies, Bentham ([1791] 1999) advocates the “superintendence of the public” as a solution to a moral hazard problem between representatives and constituents. He also argues that publicity helps to secure the confidence of the people in their officials, arguing, “Suspicion always attaches to mystery. It thinks it sees a crime where it beholds an affectation of secresy; and it is rarely deceived.” Contemporary scholars and nongovernmental organizations have stressed the salutary effects of transparency on government performance and accountability (Alt and Lowry 2010; Besley and Burgess 2002; Ferraz and Finan 2008; Sen 1999). Moreover, the absence of transparency is a defining feature of nondemocratic regimes' reliance on secret police forces to suppress dissent (Friedrich and Brzezinski 1965). Uncertainty about culpability may make untargeted citizens reluctant to “get involved” in enforcement relative to the full information environment; alternatively, it may place citizens in the thrall of the apparently arbitrary exercise of state power (Linz 2000).         "
"6","We conducted 14 experimental sessions at the NYU Center for Experimental Social Science lab to explore the dynamics of legitimacy. Each of the 225 subjects who participated took part in one session only. Subjects interacted anonymously via networked computers. The experiments were programmed and conducted using the software z‐Tree (Fischbacher 1999). Participants signed up via a web‐based recruitment system that draws on a large, preexisting pool of potential undergraduate subjects. (Subjects were not recruited from the authors' courses and did not receive course credit for participating.) After giving informed consent according to human subjects protocols, subjects received written instructions that were subsequently read aloud to promote understanding and induce common knowledge of the experimental scenario. No deception was employed, in accordance with the long‐standing norms of the lab in which the experiment was carried out. Before beginning the experiment, subjects took an on‐screen quiz that both measured and promoted understanding of the instructions. Subjects earned tokens, convertible into dollars at the end of the experiment (40 tokens = US$1) in amounts determined by the outcomes of play. Subjects' overall payoffs in a given session were equal to the sum of payoffs from each of the 20 periods (converted into dollars), plus a US$7 show‐up fee.            "
"7","At the beginning of each session, subjects were randomly assigned to a group of five people, of which one was randomly assigned as an authority (“Role A,” in the neutral parlance of the experiment) while the others were assigned as citizens (“Role B”).2 Group and role assignments remained fixed over 20 periods of interaction. However, on authorities' screens, individual group members in Role B were labeled with an “ID number” from 1 to 4 commonly known to be randomly reassigned every period.3"
"8","Each period consisted of one play of the following extensive form game:               "
"9","Appendix B in the supporting information provides a detailed description of the game and its equilibria."
"10","The game is built around a standard linear public goods game: Across treatments, all citizens (and the authority) received 0.4 times the amount in the common pot (in addition to tokens kept). Thus, in the absence of enforcement, each citizen had an incentive to keep his or her tokens (for a payoff of 20), but all would benefit if everyone chose to contribute (which would yield a payoff of 32)."
"11","Each citizen who intervened on behalf of the authority increased the probability that enforcement would be successful by ; each citizen who intervened on behalf of the targeted group member decreased this probability by . Given a  probability of successful enforcement in the absence of intervention, enforcement would be successful for certain if all three nontargeted group members were to intervene on behalf of the authority, whereas enforcement would be unsuccessful for certain if all of these group members were to intervene on behalf of the targeted citizen. In the event of successful enforcement, the penalty suffered by the targeted group member was 30 tokens.            "
"12","The four treatments differed along two dimensions. The first dimension is the compensation scheme for the authority. In the salary treatments, the authority received a fixed per‐period endowment of 20 tokens, but was not a claimant on any sanction successfully imposed. In the appropriation treatments, on the other hand, the authority received no fixed per‐period endowment but was awarded 30 tokens for each sanction successfully carried out. The second dimension concerned the information available to the citizen (Role B) players. In the full information setting, those players learned the contribution decisions of each of the other players in that period and which, if any, was targeted for enforcement. Thus, in addition to seeing their compatriots' behavior in the period, they could observe whether a targeted individual had or had not contributed. By contrast, in the limited information setting, untargeted citizens could observe only that a fellow citizen was targeted—but not whether the target or others had contributed – and only learned the total contribution level for the group at the end of the period.            "
"13","Four experimental sessions (involving 60 subjects) were devoted to the salary/full information treatment, and four other experimental sessions (also involving 60 subjects) were devoted to the appropriation/full information treatment. Additionally, three sessions (involving 55 subjects) were devoted to salary/limited information, and three sessions (50 subjects) to appropriation/limited information.4"
"14","As a benchmark for our subsequent analysis, we examine nonperverse symmetric weak perfect Bayesian equilibria of the stage game. Weak perfect Bayesian equilibrium is defined conventionally (see SI Appendix B). Symmetry implies (a) all citizens play the same strategies; and (b) given more than one similarly situated enforcement target (e.g., two noncontributors), the authority targets each with equal probability. Finally, nonperverse entails focusing only on equilibria in which, when indifferent but given the choice, the authority will target a noncontributor over a contributor (and so will only ever target a contributor if all citizens contributed)."
"15","Given our substantive focus, the critical result is that because citizen interventions are costly but offer no prospective benefit, in all possible equilibria of all treatments, citizens should never intervene to help or hinder the authority.5"
"16","In the salary treatments, enforcement is costly and provides no prospective benefit to the authority; thus, salaried authorities should never attempt enforcement. Accordingly, citizens, fearing no sanction, should not contribute. Thus, (No Contributions, No Enforcement, No Intervention) is the unique equilibrium strategy profile."
"17","In the appropriation treatments, the expected benefit of sanctioning to appropriator authorities (30 tokens  = 15 tokens) clearly exceeds the cost. Thus, appropriators should attempt enforcement, anticipating no resistance from untargeted citizens. Three equilibria are possible given our parameterization: In the first of these, there are no contributions, the authority targets one noncontributor, and group members choose not to intervene. In the second, all group members contribute to the public good, the authority targets one contributor, and again, group members choose not to intervene. And in the third, each citizen contributes with probability 0.78, the authority targets one group member (a noncontributor unless all group members contributed), and again, no intervention takes place. Note that these equilibria do not depend on any distinction between full and limited information: At the point when this information is or is not revealed, citizens' only remaining decisions involve interventions, which are never sequentially rational.            "
"18","The multiplicity of equilibria emerges due to strategic complementarities: If no other group members contribute to the public good, then the threat of sanction, if attempted, is spread sufficiently thin to make noncontribution a best response. On the other hand, if all other group members contribute to the public good, a given group member who does not contribute will be targeted for certain (given nonperverse enforcement), making the expected sanction sufficiently high to induce compliance."
"19","Under full information, citizens earned an average of $0.65 per period in the salary treatment, and a statistically indistinguishable $0.67 in the appropriation treatment. By contrast, authorities' earnings under full information did differ significantly across treatments: Salaried authorities earned $0.98 per period, versus $0.72 for appropriator authorities."
"20","Figure 1 presents a comprehensive view of authority and citizen decision making under full information. The data are presented in 24 panels—one per group. Within each panel, the solid line traces the overall level of public goods contributions (indexed by the left tick marks) over time. First‐period contribution levels vary widely, from 1 to 4 in both compensation treatments. Within the salary treatment, seven out of 12 groups settle into a pattern of generally high contributions (three or four citizens contributing) in later periods, whereas the other five groups settle into a pattern of generally low contributions (zero citizens or one citizen contributing). Within the appropriation treatment, a similar distribution of group tendencies is observed.               "
"21","Summary of Data from the Full Information Treatments."
"22","Note: Each panel provides a comprehensive history of the group: The line represents contributions (as measured on the left axis), and symbols represent net helping/hindering (as measured on the right). Triangles denote a targeted noncontributor, and squares a targeted contributor. Hollow symbols denote enforcement failure, and solid symbols enforcement success.                           "
"23","Authorities' decisions to attempt enforcement are also depicted within these panels. Each small shape within the panel represents a decision to target a group member in a given period—triangles when a noncontributor has been targeted or squares when the authority's target contributed. There is considerable variation in the extent to which authorities attempted enforcement in both treatments. A key point to note, which we will analyze in greater detail below, is the paucity of “unfair” attempted punishment in which the authority targets a contributor. In the salary treatment, the authority never targets a contributor in 10 out of 12 groups (and does so only a few times in each of the other two groups). In the appropriation treatment, the authority never targets a contributor in eight out of the 12 groups (doing so only once in two groups, but frequently in two groups).               "
"24","Citizens' intervention decisions are also depicted within these panels. The height of each triangle or square indicates the net level of intervention chosen by the three nontargeted group members taken collectively (indexed by the right tick marks). This measure ranges from–3 (all untargeted citizens help the target) to +3 (all untargeted citizens help the authority). The data in the panels exhibit considerable variation in the extent to which intervention took place (and on behalf of whom)."
"25","Finally, the figures also display whether each instance of attempted enforcement was successful or unsuccessful. Solid shapes (triangles or squares) represent instances in which enforcement was successful, whereas hollow shapes represent unsuccessful enforcement. The relationship between opacity and height reflects the fact that citizen intervention affects the probability of success."
"26","Each panel provides its own narrative, describing subjects' behavior and containing hints about their motivations. In G10, for example, the salaried official never needed to deploy his enforcement authority because full contribution was sustained. In G16, citizens tended to contribute, a predatory authority repeatedly attempted to improve his payoffs by targeting a contributor, and these attempts were generally thwarted as untargeted citizens frequently aided the target."
"27","Apart from citizen intervention choices, the strategic incentives implied by our model offer three predictions about contributions and targeting. Analyzing these decisions helps validate our study design by showing that behavior in the lab comports, on average, with these theoretical predictions. First, we should rarely, if ever, see authorities engage in perverse targeting—attempting to sanction a contributor when at least one group member did not contribute. Indeed, of the 140 group‐period observations in which at least one group member did not contribute but not all failed to contribute, in only seven was a contributor targeted: three out of 68 instances under the salary/full information treatment, and four out of 72 instances under the appropriation/full information treatment."
"28","Second, we should observe that appropriator authorities target citizens more than salaried ones. In the absence of perverse targeting, more frequent targeting can come in the form of greater resoluteness (i.e., a propensity to target noncontributors) or in the form of greater predation (i.e., a propensity to target contributors when all citizens contribute). Table 1 displays the frequency with which authorities engage in resolute and predatory targeting, excluding the small number of perverse cases.               "
"29","The comparisons in the table strongly confirm our expectations (associated p‐values are less than .001). For example, appropriator authorities behaved resolutely in 86% of the 105 group‐period interactions with at least one noncontributor, but only in 62.5% of the 120 such cases under the salary treatment. The difference in predation across treatments is also stark: In 20% of the 131 interactions in which all citizens in the group contributed, appropriator authorities behaved in a predatory fashion; by contrast, predatory behavior occurred in just 1.7% of the 117 comparable cases for salaried authorities."
"30","Third, we should observe evidence of deterrence. In particular, contribution levels should be higher where noncontributors are sanctioned at a high rate and contributors are sanctioned at a low rate. To test for the presence of this association, we created a lagged deterrence index: In a given group at period t, the index is calculated as the rate in the previous  periods at which noncontributors were successfully punished minus the rate at which contributors were successfully punished.6 Higher values of the index should correspond to greater levels of deterrence and, thus, higher contribution levels.7 Figure 2 plots contribution rates against the lagged deterrence index (by group‐period), along with treatment‐specific local polynomial smoothers and their associated 95% confidence intervals. As is evident in the figure, the data are consistent with deterrence in both of the full information treatments. Although we are careful to note that these relationships should not be interpreted as causal, they are consistent with our expectations about the study design.               "
"31","Evidence of Deterrence Effects under Full Information"

Solid curves denote treatment‐specific local polynomial smoothers, and dashed curves their associated 95% confidence intervals. See main text for an explanation of the deterrence index.                           "
"33","We turn to a comparison of citizen contribution rates across treatments. Overall, groups with a salaried official averaged 2.46 contributions per period, whereas their counterparts with an appropriator official averaged 2.83. These figures are not statistically distinguishable at the group level (p = .58, two‐tailed). Regression analyses of contribution rates disaggregated to the group‐period level, with standard errors clustered at the group level, also show no significant difference in contribution rates across treatments (with and without period‐specific indicators). Figure 3 displays smoothed polynomial estimates of average contribution levels per period (and their 95% confidence intervals) for the salary (black) and appropriation (white) treatments over all 20 periods of the experiment. In both treatments, contribution levels are sustained at a moderate level over time. A sequence of period‐specific t‐tests reveals that in no period can we reject the null hypothesis of equal contribution rates across treatments.               "

"35","Note: Each point corresponds to a group‐period observation. Points are jittered and vertically shifted (by 0.1) from their true values for clarity. Solid curves denote treatment‐specific local polynomial smoothers, and dashed curves their associated 95% confidence intervals.                           "
"36","Because our primary objective is to identify differences in citizen willingness to intervene that stem from considerations of legitimacy and not, for example, direct monetary incentives or the enforcer's behavior, the absence of differences in contribution rates (as well as the nearly identical earnings for the citizens in these two treatments, described above) is helpful from a research design perspective: We can be confident that observed differences in citizen intervention are not driven, for example, by differential response to prior levels of public goods provision, or by wealth effects. At the same time, it is worth noting that the absence of significant differences in contribution rates across treatments diverges from the equilibrium predictions above. The benchmark prediction for the salary treatment was no contributions; in the appropriation treatment, no contributions, full contribution, and an intermediate level of contribution were all consistent with equilibrium play. Thus, equilibrium predictions suggest (weakly) higher contribution levels in the appropriation treatment. The data, however, clearly indicate that this is not the case.               "
"37","We now examine citizen intervention choices. At the most basic level, citizens clearly take into account the guilt or innocence of the authority's target. When an authority targeted a noncontributor, individual untargeted citizens intervened on behalf of the authority 30% of the time, and on behalf of the target just 8% of the time. (In the remaining 62%, citizens did not intervene.) By contrast, when the authority targeted a contributor, individual untargeted citizens intervened on behalf of the authority just once in 105 opportunities, and group members intervened on behalf of the targeted group member 61% of the time (and did nothing 38% of the time)."
"38","Citizens Help Salaried Authorities More. Under full information, there are substantial across‐treatment differences in citizens' propensities to intervene on behalf of or against the authority. Conditional on attempted enforcement, net support for the authority (−3 to +3) was 0.89 in the salary treatment, as compared with −0.21 in the appropriation treatment (p < .001, two‐tailed). In other words, on average, about one in three untargeted citizens chose to assist a salaried authority in her enforcement duties. Untargeted citizens intervened less often in the appropriation treatment—and more likely than not on behalf of the target.8"
"39","The left panel of Figure 4 provides a graphical summary of net assistance over time, at the group‐period level: For all but the very early and very late periods, untargeted citizens are significantly more likely to intervene on behalf of the authority in the salary treatment (black) than in the appropriation treatment (white). Moreover, we observe statistically significant net hindering of appropriator authorities in periods 10−17. By contrast, we observe statistically significant net helping of salaried authorities in all periods.               "
"40","Intervention on Behalf of or Against the Authority, Full Information Treatments."
"41","Note: Each point corresponds to a group‐period observation. Points are jittered and vertically shifted (by 0.1) from their true values for clarity. Solid curves denote treatment‐specific local polynomial smoothers, and dashed curves their associated 95% confidence intervals. The left panel plots net citizen assistance over time. The right panel plots net assistance against the average previous contribution rates. Black denotes salary treatment, and white appropriation treatment.                           "
"42","The right panel depicts net assistance for the authority as a function of the average contribution rate of the group in prior periods. In groups with historically low levels of contribution, there is little intervention in either the salary or appropriation treatment, on behalf of either the authority or the target. By contrast, when historical contribution rates exceed 50% (i.e., two contributors per period on average), we see a marked (and highly significant) divergence between the treatments. In the salary treatments, net intervention jumps to over two. In the appropriation treatment, however, net intervention is negative for high levels of average contribution."
"43","The figures indicate that the propensity to help or hinder varies as a function of variables other than the treatment. We therefore conducted a series of regression analyses to ensure that our results are not driven by a failure to control for additional observables. The dependent variable in these specifications is net assistance to the authority (ranging from −3 to +3). Observations are groups in individual periods where enforcement was attempted. Coefficient estimates appear in the first two columns of Table 2. (Complete descriptions of the estimations carried out in generating Table 2 and Table 4 appear in SI Appendix C, where we also discuss potential threats to inference.)               "
"44","Specification (1) estimates the treatment effect controlling for period‐specific indicators. Specification (2) adds three control variables: lagged average group contributions; lagged average resoluteness (coded as the proportion of prior periods in which any noncontributor was targeted, conditional on the presence of a noncontributor); and lagged predation plus perverse targeting (coded as the proportion of prior rounds in which any contributor was targeted). In both specifications, the difference between the appropriation and salary treatments remains highly statistically significant and comparable in magnitude to the results above. In specification (2), we find that the propensity to help or hinder the authority is strongly related to previous contribution levels. However, the resilience of the treatment effect in the presence of this control indicates that salaried authorities are not helped more in net because of different contribution rates under salaried and appropriative authorities (and recall that contribution levels were statistically indistinguishable across compensation institutions). Regarding our other control variables, we find no significant relationship between the authority's past resoluteness and citizens' propensities to intervene, but we find a strong negative relationship between propensity to assist the enforcer and past bad behavior by the enforcer.               "
"45","Predatory Appropriators Do Not Drive the Result. Given this strong relationship, there may be some residual concern that appropriators' relative illegitimacy may be due not to the appropriative institution itself but rather to the behavior of appropriators induced by that institution. A strategy more conservative than controlled regressions is simply to drop all group‐period observations in which the group's authority had ever targeted any contributor. The analysis in specifications (3) and (4) of Table 2 accordingly includes only group‐periods where the authority did not target a contributor in the current period and had not done so in any previous period. With this more conservative strategy, it remains the case that appropriator authorities receive less assistance than salaried authorities (although the statistical significance of this difference is slightly diminished in the specification with minimal controls).               "
"46","Citizens Are Not Substituting for Irresolute Enforcement. The above analysis allows us to calculate the probability that a given enforcement attempt is successful in each treatment. Recall that on average, 0.89 untargeted citizens assist a salaried enforcer in net, whereas in the appropriation treatment, 0.21 untargeted citizens assist the target in net. Thus, conditional on targeting, an enforcement action would be successful  of the time in the salary treatment and  of the time in the appropriation treatment. However, recall from Table 1 that appropriative authorities are more resolute, actually choosing to target noncontributors 85.7% of the time, whereas salaried authorities do so in 62.5% of opportunities. Multiplying these figures yields the probability of a successful enforcement outcome (conditional on the presence of at least one noncontributor): 40.5% in the salary treatment, and a nearly indistinguishable 39.9% in the appropriation treatment. The significant difference in citizen interventions almost perfectly cancels out the gap in enforcer resoluteness.               "
"47","This suggests an alternative explanation: that citizens in the salary treatment, recognizing that authorities may be less resolute, may substitute for the authority's resoluteness by intervening more often to maintain deterrence. The analysis in Table 2 controls for lagged resoluteness, mitigating against this concern. Nonetheless, we undertake two further analyses to evaluate this possibility. First, we estimated specifications (3) and (4) from Table 2 on the subsample of cases for which lagged resoluteness is 1 (i.e., the enforcer has always attempted enforcement given a lack of full contributions, and has never targeted a contributor). In this restricted subsample, we continue to find higher levels of assistance for salaried enforcers (p < .05, one‐tailed tests); this cannot be due to substitution for observed past weak enforcement given the subsample composition.               "
"48","Second, if citizens were substituting for irresolute enforcement, we would expect a negative relationship between the prior resoluteness of the authority and citizen intervention within the salary treatment. Moreover, we would expect resoluteness to have a larger effect in the salary treatment than in the appropriation treatment. Columns 5 and 6 of Table 2 contain separate effect estimates for the salary and appropriation treatments, respectively. The findings are not supportive of the alternative explanation. The negative relationship between citizen intervention and resoluteness is actually estimated to be modestly stronger in the appropriation treatment than in the salary treatment (though one cannot reject a null hypothesis that the two effects are the same). The salary‐treatment estimate is also not statistically distinguishable from zero (though its sign is negative).               "
"49","Citizen Types Do Not Explain Differences in Legitimation. Finally, we note that there is no significant difference in first‐period contributions between the salary and appropriation treatments. This suggests no underlying difference in the baseline “public‐spiritedness” of subjects assigned to the two treatments.               "
"50","In this section, we make three sets of comparisons: (1) between salaried and appropriator authorities under limited information, (2) between salaried authorities under full and limited information, and (3) between appropriator authorities under full and limited information."
"51","Under limited information, group members earned $0.54 per period on average in the salary treatment and $0.62 under appropriation (a statistically significant difference). Authorities earned $0.71 per period in the salary treatment and a statistically indistinguishable $0.70 under appropriation."
"52","Figure 5 displays an overview of behavior under limited information. Under salary/limited information, only one group sustains high contribution levels for the duration of the experiment. Other groups see initially high contributions fade or consistently low contributions throughout. Contributions under appropriation/limited information appear higher, with several groups sustaining higher contribution rates. There is also substantial heterogeneity in group members' willingness to help or hinder authorities.               "
"53","Summary of Data from the Limited Information Treatments."
"54","Note: See the Figure 1 note for a key to this figure.                           "
"55","We replicate our earlier tests of first‐order incentives. Table 3 compares rates of resoluteness and predation in the salaried and appropriation treatments under limited information. As in the full information case, appropriator authorities enforce more frequently than their salaried counterparts. When all citizens contribute, appropriator authorities engage in predation 35% of the time under limited information, as compared to a lower 20% figure under full information.               "
"56","The test for first‐order deterrence effects requires elaboration. In the full information setting, our index of deterrence was an objective indicator capturing the frequencies with which noncontributors and contributors were targeted. In the limited information setting, citizens cannot generally be certain about the culpability of an enforcement target. As a consequence, deterrence is fundamentally subjective. However, citizens' beliefs should correlate strongly with the objective measure. For example, a citizen can infer predation with certainty if all citizens contributed and yet one was targeted, or resoluteness if none contributed but one was targeted; likewise, he can infer perverse targeting if he contributed and was targeted, upon learning at the end of the round that not all citizens contributed."
"57","Figure 6 displays group‐period‐level contributions as a function of the lagged deterrence index. The white lines represent locally smoothed polynomials (and their 95% confidence intervals) for appropriation/limited information; black lines represent the smoother for salary/limited information. A comparison to Figure 2 is revealing. First, the distribution of deterrence under limited information is considerably to the left of the distribution under full information (note that the horizontal axis now begins at −.25). Second, while we observe positive relationships between the deterrence index and contribution rates under both limited information treatments, those relationships are muted relative to their full information analogs.               "
"58","Evidence of Deterrence Effects under Limited Information."
"59","Note: Figure constructed in the same manner as Figure 2.                           "
"60","Figure 7 displays smoothed polynomial estimates of average contribution rates, by treatment. The contrast between this limited information figure and its full information counterpart (Figure 3) is stark. Under full information, contribution rates were not appreciably different across compensation institutions, and exhibited no secular change in either treatment. By contrast, under limited information, the average contribution rate is substantially lower with salaried authorities than with appropriator authorities; moreover, average contributions decline over time in both treatments with this decline being more precipitous with salaried than with appropriator authorities.               "
"61","Does a decline in deterrence contribute to the drop in contributions under limited information when officials are salaried? If we assume that the deterrence index is an unbiased proxy for citizens' subjective beliefs, we can conduct a simple difference in means test comparing the deterrence index in the full and limited information salary treatments. Under full information, the mean deterrence index is 0.44. Under limited information, it is 0.17. The 0.27 difference is highly statistically significant (p < .001, two‐tailed). Deterrence, of course, is driven by the behavior of both the authority (via targeting) and the citizens (via contributions and by helping and hindering). Comparing salaried officials in the limited and full information environments, there are no statistically significant differences in either resoluteness or predation rates, although resoluteness is modestly higher in the full information setting. This, in turn, implies that if the collapse of contribution rates under salaried limited information is driven by a concomitant collapse in deterrence, the source of the collapse must be a change in citizen intervention behavior, which affects the probability that attempted enforcement is successful."
"62","Figure 8 presents citizen willingness to help or hinder authorities under limited information, by method of authority compensation. The left panel displays group‐period help/hinder propensities, along with local polynomial smoothers. The right panel displays propensity to help or hinder as a function of lagged average group contributions.               "
"63","The pictures differ markedly from their full information analogs (Figure 4). The left panel indicates little, if any, difference between salary and appropriations under limited information; the confidence intervals of the smoothers substantially overlap for almost all periods. Moreover, the right panel lacks the clear separation across treatments under full information when previous contributions were high.               "
"64","Since the analysis in the figures does not control for key covariates, we conducted a series of regression analyses for the limited information treatments. The results of these appear in the first two columns of Table 4. These estimates suggest that notwithstanding the graphical analysis above, it is, in fact, possible to replicate the finding from the full information treatments that citizens exhibit a higher propensity to help salaried than appropriator authorities. However, the finding is sensitive to specification: The estimate in the column 1 specification, including only period‐specific indicators, is not statistically significant (p = .30, two‐tailed). The column 2 estimate is about twice as large and is statistically significant at conventional levels (p = .07, two‐tailed).               "
"65","In columns 3–6 in Table 4, we analyze the effect of limited information holding authority compensation constant. Columns 3 and 4 restrict attention to the salary treatments. Limiting the information available to citizens is estimated to reduce net assistance for the authority by about .6 relative to the full information case. The effect is about 80% of the size of the difference between appropriation and salary treatments under full information (see column 2 of Table 2). In the column 3 specification, this result skirts conventional levels of statistical significance (p = .107) using a two‐tailed test, though arguably a one‐tailed test is appropriate given our a priori expectations about transparency's effects. In the column 4 specification, the result does reach conventional significance levels in a two‐tailed test (p = .08).               "
"66","By contrast, reduced transparency does not appear to affect citizens' willingness to assist an appropriator authority. As columns 5 and 6 show, appropriator authorities under limited information are estimated to garner slightly more support than appropriator authorities under full information, but these differences are modest and not statistically significant."
"67","An analysis of the combined effects of authority and citizen behavior addresses why contributions are lower in the salary/limited information treatment than in the other treatments. In the one‐shot game, contribution is a best response for a citizen if she believes that the probability that she will be sanctioned if guilty (less the probability of sanctioning if innocent) exceeds . The deterrence index provides a useful proxy for this probability. In the salary/full information treatment, 51% of group‐periods have a lagged deterrence index above this threshold; under appropriation/full information, 57% of group‐periods do.               "
"68","The corresponding figures are much lower under limited information: 29% under appropriation/limited information, and merely 17% under salary/limited information. This decline is larger in both absolute and proportional terms with salaried authorities.9"
"69","Using a novel behavioral measure of legitimacy, we have explored the determinants of legitimacy by experimentally manipulating two institutional variables: how officials are compensated and the transparency to citizens of authorities' decision making."
"70","Our analysis suggests that an authority's legitimacy is directly affected by her institutional environment, even holding her behavior constant. Under full information, our findings confirm Weber's ([1922] 1978) intuition that authorities' compensation schemes affect their (legal‐rational) legitimacy. Weber's account, however, does not include a causal or even a particularly detailed argument about why appropriative incentives should undermine legitimacy.         "
"71","One possibility, consistent with our results, concerns citizens' abilities to discern officials' true underlying motives based on their behavior. Imagine a world populated by two kinds of officials: venal and virtuous. If officials are salaried, venal ones will shirk unless the prospective benefits of deterring future noncompliance are substantial. By contrast, virtuous officials, whether through a strong commitment to the community's interests or because of other intrinsic motivations, will be resolute. In this context, resolute enforcement serves as a costly signal of virtue. If officials have appropriative interests, however, both virtuous and venal types benefit materially from resoluteness. As such, citizens cannot discern an official's virtue through observing resolute enforcement. Given this, as well as evidence that benefiting personally from an action induces perceptions of selfishness (Lin‐Healy and Small 2013), it would be understandable if citizens felt more obliged toward, and were more willing to help, salaried than appropriative authorities, even if authority behavior were the same under these different compensation schemes. Hermalin (1998) describes a model in which a leader can legitimate her actions through investing in a public good or undertaking other costly actions.10 However, Hermalin's leader signals private information about the marginal benefits of contributions, not private information about herself, as in our interpretation. Additionally, Hermalin's leader induces greater effort through exclusively instrumental motivations; by controlling for citizens' material incentives across treatments, our approach focuses on noninstrumental motivations for assisting authorities. In Levi (1988, 52–54), leaders encourage “quasi‐voluntary compliance” by implementing a fair tax system and honoring their commitments. Her microfoundations focus on strategic complementarities in punishment: Enforcement by a capacity‐constrained authority is more effective when citizens are more willing to comply, as in our theoretical model. By identifying systematic variation in citizens' willingness to assist authorities, our experimental research complements her work by revealing an additional source of enhanced enforcement capacity.         "
"72","Moving from full to limited information, levels of citizen support for appropriative authorities remain unaltered, whereas support for salaried officials collapses. This decreased support for salaried authorities appears at odds with rational accounts of how citizens might use information. Theoretically, salaried officials have no incentive ever to target a contributor—such an action yields no material benefit and could only serve to undermine the authority's deterrence powers in future periods. Empirically, authorities behave as expected, targeting contributors a mere three times in our salary/limited information treatment. While citizens receive no direct feedback about the justice of enforcement attempts, they receive informative indirect feedback, for instance, through observing that they themselves are never unfairly targeted or that enforcers target nobody when everyone has contributed to the public good. As such, it might be expected that full versus limited information would not affect citizens' expectations about enforcer behavior, and therefore also not affect citizens' intervention decisions. Instead, citizens in our experiments help salaried officials significantly less often under limited information."
"73","Transparency appears instead to affect citizens' intervention behavior above and beyond the material value of the information that transparency entails. This suggests a novel behavioral rationale for transparency. If Bentham (1791) is correct and suspicion does attach to mystery, then it does so even when there is little actual mystery given the structure of the game. Lack of transparency undercuts legitimacy, and (indirectly) deterrence, not because enforcers are less resolute or more predatory, but because citizens do not give authority figures the benefit of the doubt about behaving in an appropriate fashion. Thus, benign motivation and behavior are not sufficient to engender legitimacy. Citizens appear also to need to verify the appropriateness of an enforcer's behavior. By contrast, in the appropriation treatments, enforcers' activities are already perceived as less legitimate even when they are transparent, so net deterrence differs little across informational contexts.         "
"74","We conclude by noting that the results of our limited information treatments not only extend our full information findings, but also aid in their interpretation. That the gap in legitimacy between salary and appropriation under full information is not reproduced under limited information excludes, for example, the possibility that particular institutions induce unconditional senses of obligation to cooperate with authorities. Instead, citizens appear to internalize norms of cooperation in a way that is conditional, reciprocating publicly observable fair conduct by officials. The flexibility of our framework will allow us to carry out additional treatments that could, in a similar way, further clarify the mechanisms through which institutions affect an authority's legitimacy. We plan to explore other facets of legitimacy's origins, including the role of elections, the role of social identities, and the dynamics of legitimacy where potential sources of authority compete. We also speculate that citizens' modes of psychological engagement with authorities may vary across cultural contexts; our framework could be adapted to measure cross‐cultural variation in the dynamics of legitimacy using lab‐in‐the‐field experiments."
