"1","Our data comes from three sources. First, we use data from the Field (California) Poll for Democratic and Republican primaries in California between 1966 and 2006. The Field Poll is conducted approximately eight times during every election year in California, with three to four of the polls asking questions about primary campaigns to respondents who indicate they were likely to vote in the next election. Besides asking its respondents about their voting intentions in the primaries, the Field Poll also collects covariates for each respondent, including ideology (coded on a 3‐, 5‐, or 7‐point scale), age, race, gender, income, education, and area of residence within California. The Field Poll releases individual‐level data to the public, so we will be able to make use of these covariates."
"2","Our second data source comes from the press releases of the survey research firm Survey USA (hereafter, SUSA). SUSA has conducted election polls since 1992, but we have found publicly available releases of polls for primary elections in a usable format since 2005 for a variety of states. The sample frame is likely voters. The publicly available data consists, not of individual‐level data, but of cross‐tabulations of ideology (coded on a 3‐point scale) and other covariates (usually age, gender, race, income, and region of state are included), so we cannot exploit the data as much as we can for the Field Polls. We study all of the available primaries in either source of data for the offices of governor and senator that do not include incumbents, and where we have at least two polls before the primary date (see Table A.1 in the online supporting information for a list of these races). We also study some primaries with incumbents and primaries for down‐ballot offices, such as lieutenant governor and attorney general."
"3","Our third data source is panel surveys we conducted during the 2010 primaries. We surveyed likely primary voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire before and after their gubernatorial and senate primaries, with 1,201 complete panel respondents. Before Election Day, we recruited participants with Facebook.com online ads and through a consumer Internet panel (for details, see the supporting information). We then recontacted participants after the election and reinterviewed 60% to 75% of the original respondents. The surveys asked about perceptions of the candidates' ideologies and about each participant's ideology, vote, party identification, age, race, gender, education, political interests, and political knowledge. In the analysis below, we first show the results for the cross‐sectional surveys and then turn to the panel data."
"4","To test for learning, we assume the following simple model. Consider a primary election with only two candidates: one who is more conservative and one who is more liberal. Also suppose that there are only two types of voters in the primary electorate: relatively conservative and relatively liberal. Finally, assume that two polls were taken during the primary: an early poll and a late poll. Let  denote the early poll and let  denote the late poll, and let  be the indicator for the late poll (). Let  be the preference of respondent i at time t, with  if respondent i prefers the more conservative candidate and  if respondent i prefers the more liberal candidate. Let  be the respondent's ideology, with  if the respondent is relatively conservative and  if the respondent is relatively liberal. To look at the relative change in support for the conservative candidate among conservatives, we estimate the following regression model:               "
"5","Our quantity of interest is precisely this coefficient γ. Under the assumption that the only differential trends in support for the conservative candidate among conservatives and liberals arise from voter learning—not reverse causality, omitted variable bias, or priming (which we discuss below)—the coefficient γ also is a measure of how much voters' voting intentions change because of information that they learn during the campaign. If campaigns inform voters about candidates' positions and voters incorporate that information into their voting decisions, then we should observe ; that is, conservatives should increase their support for the conservative candidate over the course of the campaign more than liberals do for that same candidate.            "
"6","In order to implement this specification empirically, we need to match the rich data on primaries that we have—with multiple polls and many ideological shades—to the stylized description of a primary that we present above. In particular, we need to identify candidates as either liberal or conservative. We also need to classify respondents as either liberal or conservative. Finally, we divide the polls between those that are “early” versus those that are “late.”"
"7","For all gubernatorial and senate primaries, we classified candidates as either liberal or conservative using information from newspaper articles and interest group endorsements. In most of the races, this distinction is relatively clear. In races with more than two candidates, we focus on the two with the largest ideological difference who were also among the top three vote getters. For the list of 37 governor and senate primaries analyzed, see the supporting information (Table A.1), which also presents the candidates' liberal or conservative classification."
"8","Even though we were able to easily identify candidates' relative ideological positions from various sources, we confirmed our classification using independent coders of candidates' positions who read newspaper coverage of the primary campaigns. Using an automated process, we collected sentences likely to identify candidates' issue positions from newspapers available on a news‐aggregating service (Factiva) for the three months prior to the primary election. The sentences collected had to mention at least one of the candidates together with certain key words or phrases related to an issue or ideological position, such as abortion or tax cut (see Section A of the supporting information for the full list).11 For each sentence, the coders attempted to identify the ideological position of candidates mentioned in the sentence on a 5‐point scale based only on the information conveyed within each sentence. Because of limitations in Factiva coverage, this independent coding only covered two‐thirds (27 out of 37) of the races we originally coded. Among these two‐thirds, however, the independent coders confirmed our liberal/conservative classifications of the candidates in all but one case.12 We describe the procedure for coding the sentences and computing ideology gaps in Section A of the supporting information.            "
"9","The newspaper sentence coding also provides us with a quantification of candidates' relative ideological positions. We use this measure to divide primaries into a “baseline” sample of races with acute ideological distinctions and a “placebo” sample of races where we would expect little ideological learning because of minimal ideological distinctions between candidates. We consider primaries with an ideology gap of 0.5 or more (on the 5‐point scale) to be “baseline,” and primaries with gaps less than 0.5 to be “placebo” (the results are similar with other cutoffs). For the races that lack independent ratings, we rely on our classifications."
"10","In our main analyses, we classify voters as either liberal or conservative using their self‐reported ideological position in the surveys. For most of our analyses, we discard voters in the ideological center of each party in order to focus on voters with relatively distinct self‐identified ideological positions. In Democratic primaries, all self‐identified conservatives are classified as conservative, and strong liberals (or all liberals on a 3‐point scale) are classified as liberal. Weak liberals and moderates are excluded from analyses of the Democratic primaries. In Republican primaries, strong conservatives (or all conservatives on a 3‐point scale) are classified as conservatives, and all self‐identified moderates and liberals are classified as liberal.13 In these primaries, we are unable to study liberals separately from self‐identified moderates, since so few Republican respondents identify themselves as liberal. We call this the Extremist Only coding and adopt it because it provides predictions about voting decisions without additional assumptions.14 We examine the robustness of our findings to these decisions, including specifications where we include all respondents. The main substantive findings remain relatively unchanged. These are reported in Section B of the supporting information.            "
"11","Finally, in our main analysis, we focus on only the first (early) and the last (late) polls. We would expect the difference between these polls to best reflect the amount of learning that occurs during the campaign. We also examine whether our results are sensitive to the exclusion of the intermediate polls or the variation in the dates of the first and last polls across primary races. More specifically, we conducted additional analyses where we classify all polls 45 days or more before the primary as early, and all polls fewer than 45 days before the primary as late. The 45‐Day cutoff is motivated by a simple analysis of the number of newspaper sentences about primaries per day prior to the election (discussed above). The coverage remains flat at a low level, averaging 59 sentences per day until about 45 days before the primary, at which point it rises linearly until the primary date. During the week before the primary, the average number of sentences per day reaches 302.15 These are reported in Section B of the supporting information.            "
"12","Note that we must drop from the analysis all respondents who do not state a preference for any candidates in a poll. Since these respondents are more common in early polls than in late polls, and since they tend to be less well informed in the early polls, our estimates likely understate the total amount of learning, as well as the overall impact of learning on voters' choices. We can address this issue directly using the data from our panel surveys. We discuss this in more detail in the panel survey analysis."
"13","In this section, we focus on primaries for governor and senator. These tend to be the statewide primary elections most salient to voters. Moreover, given the amount of newspaper coverage and campaign expenditures, voters are more likely to be exposed to information about candidates for these offices as compared to down‐ballot offices over the course of the primary campaign. Voters also begin the campaigns for these races knowing little about the candidates. In fact, averaging across all nonincumbent candidates in the California polls, 67% of respondents were unable to rate the candidates on favorability scales in the early poll, instead answering “don't know.”16 Thus, we would expect considerable voter learning about the candidates. After presenting the main results, we test several predictions consistent with learning.         "
"14","Do liberal voters shift their support towards liberal candidates, and do conservative voters shift their support towards conservative candidates over the course of a primary campaign? To answer these questions, we estimate a saturated version of Equation 1 in which we allow all coefficients to vary by primary:               "
"15","In Table 1, we present our estimate of γavg for the 28 “baseline” gubernatorial and senate primary races, that is, races where campaigns should especially help citizens differentiate between the candidates because they lack incumbent candidates and because the candidates differed ideologically (the independent coders found an ideological difference between the candidates larger than 0.5 on a 5‐point scale). The table also presents the estimates for races where we would expect electoral campaigns to have less of an effect on the congruence between the ideological position of voters and the ideological positions of the candidates they support, that is, races where the candidates do not differ in their ideological positions or races with an incumbent.            "
"16","The first column of Table 1 finds that citizens do indeed appear to learn in these “baseline” races. The average interaction coefficient is positive and statistically significant.18 Moreover, the coefficient is large in magnitude: 0.10. Conservatives increase their support for conservative candidates over the course of the campaign by an average of 10 percentage points more than liberals do. The congruence thus increases between the ideological position of the voters and the candidates they support. Figure 1 presents a histogram of the interaction coefficients for each of these races (i.e., ). It reveals that the average 0.10 effect reflects the central tendency of the distribution and is not skewed by outliers.            "
"17","Histogram of Δ Voter‐Candidate Ideological Congruence Coefficients"
"18","Note: Δ Voter‐Candidate Ideological Congruence is the interaction coefficient γ and estimates the amount by which conservative voters increase their support for the conservative candidate over the course of the campaign over and above the amount by which liberal voters increase their support for the conservative candidate. The histogram shows these coefficients for baseline races.                        "
"19","The first estimate uses the Extremist Only classification and the first and last poll, but the estimate is robust to other coding decisions. In results reported in the supporting information (Tables B.1 and B.2), we find a similar effect when we include voters who classify themselves as “moderate” and include all polls but divide them between those taken more or fewer than 45 days prior to the primary. Not surprisingly, the effect attenuates slightly as we expand the sample to include moderate voters and/or intermediate polls."
"20","According to these findings, voters appear to be learning about candidates' ideologies in primaries and changing their support accordingly. If these associations do indeed reflect learning, we should observe several other patterns in these data. In particular, we should fail to find the same effect in the “placebo” races—those with minimal ideological differences between candidates. In the second column of Table 1, we present our estimate of γavg for the nine “placebo” races for governor and senator.19 For these races, our estimate of the interaction coefficient is close to zero and has the wrong sign, ‐0.036, indicating little effect of any learning about the ideological positions of the candidates among the voters in these races. The F‐test fails to reject the null hypothesis that all the interaction coefficients for all of the races are zero (p > 0.33), and the difference between the “baseline” and “placebo” races is statistically significant (p < 0.01).20"
"21","Finally, in the third column of Table 1, we present the results for five races where an incumbent governor or senator was challenged in his or her primary.21 In these races, we suspect that voters are better informed about the incumbents' ideological positions before the campaigns. As with the “placebo” races, the coefficient is indeed smaller: 0.022. The F‐test again fails to reject the null hypothesis that all of the interaction coefficients for all of the races are zero (p‐value of 0.20), and the coefficient is significantly smaller than the “baseline” estimate (p < 0.10).22"
"22","If these effects indeed reflect learning, then we would expect voters to learn more when the ideological gap between candidates is relatively large. In particular, we expect a positive association between the magnitude of the ideological gap between the candidates and the increase in congruence between voters' and candidates' ideological positions. This is precisely what we find."
"23","This association is evident in a simple scatterplot of our estimates of voter and candidate ideological congruence for each race—the interaction between late poll and conservative voter ideology—and our measures of ideological gap between the candidates. In Figure 2, we observe that the races with a relatively pronounced ideological gap between the candidates are also those where we find more “learning.” One exception is the 1994 California Republican senate primary. In this case, the voters seemed to have identified the ideological position of candidates early in the primary. As discussed above, we find less learning in these types of cases.            "
"24","To parametrically test for this relationship, we add a triple interaction between the ideological gap measure, the late poll indicator, and the conservative respondent indicator variables. In other words, we run a triple‐difference specification of the following form:               "
"25","We estimate Equation 4 using a variety of measurement approaches for the ideological gap, that is, a variety of methods of constructing . One straightforward way to obtain  is to use the ideology gap itself. However, one may be skeptical about the cardinalization assumptions implicit in using the gap directly. Therefore, we also consider an indicator variable equal to 1 when the ideology gap is above a chosen cutoff. In Table 2, we present the results using a cutoff of 0.5, which is the same cutoff used to identify the “baseline” and “placebo” samples in Table 1.23"
"26","We also varied the period over which we obtain the information from newspapers to measure the ideological gap. If candidates manipulate their ideological stances or emphasize different issues over the course of the primary campaign, then sentences taken from newspaper stories and editorials later in the campaign might reflect these changes, and thus the ideological gap measure might be endogenous. Thus, in addition to measuring the gap using all of the sentences describing a primary (as described in the previous section), we also construct a measure of it using only the sentences from the first third of our sample for each primary. Focusing on the ideological gap between candidates in the early part of the campaign reduces the potential endogeneity problem.24"
"27","Table 2 presents the estimates of γint and γgap. Using the candidate ideological gap from either the whole period or the first third of the sample, our hypothesis is confirmed: voter‐candidate ideological congruence increases more when the gap between the candidates is larger (i.e., ) and does not increase when the gap is absent (i.e., ). In fact, γgap is close to our “baseline” estimate (evaluated at the median gap in the continuous case), and γint is always close to zero. Using the ideological gap from newspaper coverage during first third of the sample yields coefficient estimates that point to the same conclusion. These results therefore increase our confidence that our findings reflect voter learning.25"
"28","The results in Table 1 where we find no significant “learning” in primary races with an incumbent candidate may reflect the amount of information voters have about the candidates at the outset of the primary campaigns. We might expect that voters are more likely to “learn” about candidates' ideological positions over the course of the campaign when they start with no perceptions or incorrect perceptions of these positions. Thus, another prediction consistent with learning concerns the relationship between the coefficient on ideology () and the interaction coefficient () in each primary. If a large number of conservatives initially do not favor the conservative candidate (low ), then we should observe a greater increase in their support for the conservative candidate relative to liberals over the course of the campaign (higher ). If a large number of conservatives already favor the conservative candidate at the start of the campaign (high ), then we should observe a smaller increase in their support for her relative to liberals over the course of the campaign (lower ).            "
"29","In Figure 3, we plot our estimates of  against our estimates of  for each race. The pattern in this figure is consistent with this prediction: it shows a strong negative association between our estimates of these two coefficients. This negative association is consistent with an error‐correcting model of voter learning, in which voters have a prior perception of candidate ideology and then correct it over the course of the campaign.26"
"30","One potential concern with the above analysis is that the Field Polls and SUSA interviewed different individuals across the polls within races. Consequently, the composition of the survey respondents in a primary might change over the course of the campaign in a way that could lead to differential trends in vote intentions without there actually being learning. While we address this concern directly in our Internet panel surveys by polling the same respondents over time, we can also examine whether the results are sensitive to including covariates in the Field Poll and whether they noticeably differ across the samples. When we include covariates—such as age, income, and religion—our effect becomes slightly larger and more significant than the average baseline interaction effect shown in Table 1. We describe the specifications and show the results in Section C of the supporting information.            "
"31","Besides including the covariates in our regressions, we can also check their stability in the primary electorate or (for the Field Poll) among conservatives and liberals separately. Finding stability would reassure us about the main finding, but finding instability does not necessarily invalidate it. Even if changes in the composition of the primary electorate take place, they might offset each other or even work against our hypothesis, and so not explain the differential trends we observe between conservative and liberal voters. We find few changes in the distributions of voter characteristics over the course of the primary campaigns and that those that might have taken place were scattered and unsystematic (see Section C of the supporting information for details)."
"32","The above results suggest that voters do learn about candidates' ideological positions during primary election campaigns that generate relatively large amounts of information, that is, in gubernatorial and senate races. However, the campaigns for many offices do not receive the same amount of attention as these races do. Do voters in relatively low‐information races, such as lieutenant governor or attorney general, also learn about their candidates' ideological positions?"
"33","In this section, we investigate whether we observe a similar pattern of learning about the ideological positions of candidates for down‐ballot offices. Primaries for down‐ballot offices often involve substantial ideological conflict. For example, in the 1990 Republican primary for lieutenant governor in California, one of the contestants accused the other of being insufficiently conservative during the Republican state convention. However, the amount of information about the candidates made available to voters during the primary campaigns tends to be relatively sparse, as the media often fails to cover these races and the candidates themselves have limited campaign resources. For example, the Los Angeles Times published, on average, 295 articles for each gubernatorial primary and 115 articles for each senatorial primary, but only 44 articles, on average, for an attorney general primary, the down‐ballot primary with the most media exposure. It published even fewer articles for other down‐ballot primaries. Between 2002 and 2007, down‐ballot candidate spending was, on average, 20% of gubernatorial candidate spending.27 We might therefore expect that voters would not learn as much about down‐ballot candidates' ideological positions as senate or gubernatorial candidates.         "
"34","The California Field Polls include surveys of voter preferences for several down‐ballot offices (see Table A.2 in the supporting information). Thus, we can estimate whether voters learn about the ideological positions of the down‐ballot candidates using the same saturated model as in the above section. Again, we are mainly interested in the coefficient estimates on the interaction between the late polls and voter ideology, . Since voters are not exposed to as much information about down‐ballot candidates, we would expect the magnitude of  to be smaller for these races as compared to our estimate of this coefficient for the “baseline” gubernatorial and senate races in Table 1.         "
"35","Because of the scarcity of newspaper coverage of down‐ballot candidates, we could not have independent raters evaluate candidate ideology by coding newspaper sentences, as we did with top‐of‐the‐ticket primaries. Instead, we used a variety of sources, including roll‐call voting scores, endorsements, newspaper articles, and various other media sources to classify the down‐ballot candidates in 36 races.28 For several races, we were unable to identify the relative ideological positions of the candidates. In some cases, this was due to the candidates having similar ideological positions. More often, we were unable to identify the positions due to lack of information about the candidates' issue positions. Thus, similar to the “baseline” estimate for governors and senators, our “baseline” estimate of the change in voter‐candidate ideological congruence (γavg) for down‐ballot races excludes the cases where we could not determine the relative ideological positions. We also estimate γavg for the two types of races that tend to receive slightly more media coverage and campaign resources: lieutenant governor and attorney general.         "
"36","In the first column of Table 3, we present our “baseline” estimates of γavg. We find little evidence that voters were learning about the ideological positions of the candidates. The coefficient estimates are close to zero. In the second column, we present the estimates for the “placebo” races—those in which the candidates held similar positions. The estimates are also incorrectly signed and not statistically significant.         "
"37","In the third column of Table 3, we present our estimates of γavg for the primary campaigns for lieutenant governor and attorney general. Even in these down‐ballot races, which receive slightly more media coverage,  is still relatively small and not statistically significant. Moreover, the F‐test fails to reject the null hypothesis that all of the interaction coefficients are zero for each sample of races.29"
"38","In contrast with our top‐of‐the‐ticket findings, where voters appear to learn about candidates' ideological positions and act on that knowledge, these results raise concerns about voters' ability to make informed judgments in down‐ballot primaries.30 We return to this point in the conclusion.         "
"39","Our analysis above relied on two assumptions that we investigate further by conducting Internet panel surveys. First, we assumed that learning about the candidates' ideologies lies behind the increased associations we found between ideology and vote choice. Second, we assumed that reverse causation—people adjusting their own ideology to match that of their preferred candidate—is absent. Both assumptions seem plausible in part because of the kinds of races we study: primary races without incumbents. In these contests, voters presumably had much to learn and lacked strong views about the candidates and thus seem unlikely to have adopted (or rejected) candidates' ideologies. Since these races are intraparty, voters were also not necessarily learning their parties' positions (only potential party nominees' positions) and so were unlikely to be learning and then following the ideologies of their parties."
"40","To provide further assurance, however, we conducted our own panel surveys. We interviewed likely voters before and after seven gubernatorial and senate primaries in 2010 (see Table 4). With these surveys, we can test the learning assumption because we can determine who learned about the candidates' ideologies and who did not. Since we also measured voters' ideologies earlier in the campaigns, we can be more certain that increased voter‐candidate ideological congruence arises, not from voters changing their ideology, but from changing their votes.         "
"41","Our panel surveys are not probability samples of voters. We recruited participants online through our own ads and through a consumer Internet panel.31 Although not perfectly representative, the samples are generally representative of the public on demographics (see Section D of the supporting information) and the panel nature of our data nevertheless allows us, to some extent, to vet further the cross‐sectional findings. We discuss concerns with self‐selection after presenting the findings.         "
"42","In analyzing these data, we follow the earlier analyses as closely as possible. To classify candidates as liberals or conservatives, we rely on respondents' postelection perceptions and on coding of newspaper sentences, which largely agreed. We present respondents' perceptions in Table 4 and show the newspaper coding in Section E of the supporting information, where we also discuss the minor differences between them and present robustness checks.         "
"43","As shown in Table 4, respondents perceived noticeable ideological gaps between the major candidates. In the Republican New Hampshire senate primary, for example, our respondents placed the most moderate candidate, Bill Binnie, at 4.0 on a 7‐point ideology scale and the conservative candidate, Ovide Lamontagne, at 6.4. In the races with more than two contestants, we grouped the candidates into liberal and conservative categories based on natural breaks in perceptions. For example, in the Michigan Republican gubernatorial primary, three of the candidates shared similar conservative ideologies (5.7, 5.9, and 6.0), so we classified these as conservative, whereas Rick Snyder, the ultimate winner, was more moderate (5.1), so we classified him as liberal. Two races had small gaps in perceptions: the New Hampshire Republican gubernatorial primary and the Pennsylvania Republican senate primary. We exclude these races and the race with an incumbent (Pennsylvania Democratic senate race), leaving five primaries: the Michigan gubernatorial primaries for both parties, the New Hampshire Republican senate primary, and the Pennsylvania gubernatorial primaries for both parties.         "
"44","Between the early and late interviews, many respondents learned about the candidates' positions. Measuring this learning, however, can be complicated especially in multicandidate races. We adopt a simple approach and use a minimal definition of knowledge: we code respondents as knowing the positions if they placed at least one conservative candidate to the right of a liberal candidate.32 Using this minimal test, an average of 45% passed early in the primary and 75% did so after the primary, for a net increase of 30%.33 Although this 75% may appear high, we are using a minimal definition of knowledge in a politically interested sample. The increase in minimal knowledge is statistically significant at conventional levels for all the races with an ideological difference between the candidates, as shown in the top of Table 5. In contrast, minimal knowledge increases much less in the two “placebo” races and the one race with an incumbent, as shown in the bottom of Table 5.34"
"45","Not only did these panel respondents learn, but they also appeared to act on this knowledge. Table 6 shows the findings for the panel respondents, presenting estimates from a series of models. As in the prior analysis, we use the Extremist Only classification of ideology (the results are similar for other classifications).35"
"46","Since the sample of panel respondents is less representative than the cross‐sectional polls we analyzed earlier, we start by replicating the previous analyses with these data and assess whether the results are similar. We therefore first treat the panel as if it were two separate cross‐sections and estimate a variant of Equation 1. Since we have individual‐level data, we estimate an individual‐level model in a pooled data set, including indicator variables for primary and sample type, and clustering the standard errors at the individual.36 After excluding respondents because they failed to report an ideology or a vote preference, or because of the Extremist Only classification, the sample size in this pooled data set is 716 pre‐election and 868 post‐election, for a total of 1,584. As shown in column 1 of Table 6, the cross‐sectional and panel findings are reassuringly similar. The interaction between the conservative indicator variable and vote is positive and statistically significant. On average, conservatives increased their support for the conservative candidate over the course of the campaign by 16 percentage points, somewhat larger than the 10 percentage points we found in the cross‐sectional surveys. This difference could arise because of differences between the samples, the races we sampled, or just by chance. The important point, however, is that the estimates are not too far apart despite these differences.         "
"47","To rule out reverse causation, we next present estimates based on measures of ideology only from the earlier interview. Since regression to the mean on the dependent variable can bias downwards coefficients on prior‐wave variables (Finkel 1995), we modify the model for panel data:            "
"48","Besides measuring conservativeness at , this model includes a lagged vote, , which addresses this potential bias and transforms the equation into a model of vote change. Since this model examines respondents from both waves, we retain only those who expressed a vote intention and an ideology in both interviews (649 of a possible 868 Extremist Only respondents). Column 2 shows that the cross‐sectional estimate in column 1 remains similar for this subset of respondents.         "
"49","Column 3 presents the estimates of Equation 5. The prior conservative coefficient is 0.10 and is statistically significant. It implies that a conservative became 10 percentage points more likely to vote for the conservative candidate over the course of the campaign, a somewhat smaller effect than in column 1. Since reverse causation cannot bias this estimate, we can therefore be more confident that it represents a causal effect of ideology.         "
"50","These findings show that prior ideology drives later changes in votes, but alone they do not establish that the changes are the result of learning. To investigate whether they are, we add an indicator for those who learned according to the minimal knowledge test (“learners”) and the interaction between this indicator and prior conservative ideology.37 We compare the learners only to those who never passed the minimal knowledge test (“never learners”). We compare learners and never learners because the comparison lends itself to a clear interpretation: the learners appear to know nothing early, but something late, whereas the never learners remained ignorant of even the most minimal knowledge. In contrast, drawing clear inferences about the other major group—those who passed the minimal test in both interviews—is hard because it may include individuals who learned more about the candidates' positions between interviews. We therefore exclude respondents who passed the minimal test in both waves.38 This leaves us with a sample of 323 Extremist Only respondents who learned or never learned. Column 4 shows that the effect of prior ideology is somewhat smaller in this subsample compared to the overall estimate. Column 5 shows the learning results. The interaction between prior conservative and learning is large: 0.39. Compared to conservatives who never learned, it suggests that conservatives who did learn increased their support for the conservative candidate over the course of the campaign by 39 percentage points. As expected, conservatives who never learned failed to shift towards the conservative candidate—if anything, they shifted away. Finally, column 6 adds the 119 respondents who failed to report a vote intent pre‐election but who did report a vote choice post‐election, coding their vote to 0.5. The estimate of the learning effect is larger: 0.43.         "
"51","Taken together, these results support the cross‐sectional findings and provide us with greater confidence that the increasing association between ideology and vote over the course of primary campaigns reflects voter learning by further ruling out the reverse causation alternative. During primary campaigns, voters appear to learn about the candidates' ideological positions and then act on this newly acquired knowledge, shifting their votes to the candidates who agree with them."
"52","To provide added reassurance, we also directly test for reverse causation, that is, test whether individuals adopt the ideology of their preferred candidate. We estimate models such as those in columns 3—6, but with post‐election ideology as the outcome variable. If people were following their preferred candidate, we should see prior vote influencing change in voters' ideologies, especially among learners. In contrast with evidence from national elections (Lenz 2012, chap. 8), the estimates reveal no such findings. The coefficient on prior vote and its interaction with learning is always close to zero and precisely estimated.         "
"53","One potential concern with these findings is self‐selection into the panels. Individuals who care enough to learn the candidates' ideologies and change their votes could be extraordinarily rare in the population—too rare to explain the cross‐sectional findings in earlier sections—but extremely likely to self‐select into our panels. Although this seems unlikely, the panel samples undoubtedly do overrepresent politically knowledgeable and interested individuals. However, other research on learning candidate positions finds little variation by political knowledge in learning, subsequent vote changes, or subsequent opinion change (Lenz 2009, 826; 2012, 208). Moreover, our results hold up among high‐ and among not‐so‐high‐knowledge individuals in the two states where we included a political knowledge battery (see Section F of the supporting information). Without representative panels, we cannot be absolutely sure. Nevertheless, the panel results combined with cross‐sectional findings point to learning as the mechanism.         "
"54","Although the conventional wisdom is that U.S. voters are not well informed about politics, a number of studies find that many voters acquire a substantial amount of information about candidates' policy positions and attributes over the course of electoral campaigns, especially for the presidential candidates. What is less well known is whether the information voters gain during campaigns actually affects their voting decisions. Our results suggest that voters learn about candidates during state primary election campaigns and that this information affects their vote choices. This pattern is most apparent for gubernatorial and senate races with no incumbent candidate."
"55","In down‐ballot races, however, this pattern appears absent—we observe little evidence that voter learning about ideology is influencing vote choices. This could be due to the lack of easily available information for voters. As noted above, many of these races receive little media coverage, and the candidates often have little money for campaign advertising. Voters may also pay little attention to ideology in these races, since it presumably matters less for the job. Does it matter if the state treasurer, auditor, or secretary of state is liberal or conservative? This issue deserves further study, since one possible implication is that the amount of information in these low‐salience primary campaigns is too low to allow voters to make meaningful choices; so, perhaps, these offices should be filled by appointment rather than elections."
"56","Our findings advance the literature in part because we are better able to rule out alternative explanations. Since the primary candidates we study are relatively obscure figures (at least relative to presidential nominees or national party leaders in other countries), reverse causation poses less of a problem. Specifically, voters are unlikely to adopt their preferred candidates' ideologies as their own, an expectation confirmed by our panel analyses."
"57","One recent study that also attempts to address this reverse causation concern is Lenz (2012), which reaches different conclusions about learning. Analyzing panel surveys that span campaigns in several countries, Lenz finds that while campaigns do inform voters about candidates' policy stances, this learning generally fails to affect how they vote (or even how much they approve of candidates).39 Instead, when voters learn their preferred candidates' stances, they adopt those positions as their own. They even adopt the overall ideologies of their preferred candidates. How can we reconcile these contradictory findings? Lenz examines campaigns by presidential candidates and national party leaders. In these high‐level races with often nationally recognized candidates, voters who care about policy may already know the candidates' positions, and, if they do not, they may be able to rely on party cues. In contrast, we examine races where even the best‐informed voters have a great deal to learn, because the candidates are generally unknown at the beginning of their campaigns but receive considerable coverage in the media, and—because primaries are intraparty competitions—voters cannot rely on party cues. Understanding why the effects of voter learning may vary across races and electoral environments remains an open area for future research.         "
"58","Our study focuses on the effect of learning about candidate ideology, but voters may act on what they learn about candidates' other attributes as well. Do voters in primaries learn about candidates' positions on salient and divisive issues (e.g., gay marriage inside the Democratic Party, or immigration policy inside the Republican Party) and vote on the basis of these positions? Voters might also learn about “electability.” If voters are strategic in the sense that they look ahead to the general election, then electability might interact in subtle and interesting ways with candidate ideology. For example, voters who are extremely strategic and well informed might even respond to the events in the primary campaign of the opposing party."
"59","Do our findings reflect learning or priming? The evidence supporting learning is considerable. Given how little voters know about the nonincumbent primary candidates early in the races, learning would have to occur before or in conjunction with any priming. Our finding that increases in candidate‐voter ideological congruence is positively related to the size of the ideological gap between the candidates, as well as the lack of early congruence, is also consistent with learning. Finally, while not representative, the panel studies find a tight link between learning the candidates' ideologies and increases in voter‐candidate congruence and fail to support the reverse causal pathway. Nonetheless, since learning and priming are often deeply entangled—messages meant to inform voters about candidates' positions on issues may also prime those issues, and messages meant to prime issues may also convey information—part of the effect we are observing may be due to priming, as both may lead to ideological congruence. Further disentangling the learning and priming effects is another open area for future research."
"60","Finally, our study says nothing about how voters learn. Is it through media coverage? Campaign advertising? Debates? Word of mouth? Are there other cues—race, ethnicity, and gender—that help voters identify or make educated guesses about candidates' ideologies? At this point, we cannot say, but future research can address these important questions.40 For example, if campaign advertising by candidates and interest groups proves to be a key channel, this would have important implications for campaign finance reforms.
