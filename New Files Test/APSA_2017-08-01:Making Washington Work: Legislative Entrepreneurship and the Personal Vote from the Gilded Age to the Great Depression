"1","The portrait of the modern member of Congress as an entrepreneur operating independently of party organizations is well established in congressional scholarship. Under a candidate‐centered system of electoral politics, congressional candidates are responsible for organizing campaigns, raising money, and crafting messages to voters (Jacobson 2000). Once in Congress, retaining a strong base of support for reelection contests becomes an overriding motivation. While national issues and presidential performance might influence the prospects of some (Jacobson and Kernell 1981), candidates believe and scholars agree that their ability to win election to Congress and stay there depends mainly on their own efforts. As Mayhew (1974) argues, the organization of Congress provides members with ample opportunities to build a base of support that is independent of their party. Members tailor their roll‐call voting and floor remarks to engage in position taking. The franking privilege facilitates the dissemination of taxpayer‐funded advertisements to constituents, and members allocate staff resources to casework, thereby receiving credit for doing favors for constituents that require no legislative action (Fiorina 1989). Efforts to cultivate personal relationships with constituents based on accessibility and trust rather than partisan or ideological affinity are a staple of contemporary representation (Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987).         "
"2","More recently, scholars have focused on bill introductions or sponsorship as another tool in the congressional arsenal. Studying bill sponsorship is appealing because unlike roll‐call votes, where members choose from among a fixed set of proposals over which they have limited influence, members control what bills they sponsor (Schiller 1995). Studying bill sponsorship can provide insights into members’ strategies and goals (Woon 2008), as well as their constituents’ demands. Using data on bill introductions, scholars can identify personal attributes that lead members to introduce legislation and quantify the effects of committee membership and other resources on their propensity to do so. Finally, bill sponsorship is integral to Congress' policymaking role. Without members’ efforts to draft bills and push them through the legislative process, Congress would be unable to perform its function of responding to the public's preferences with concrete policy actions (Wawro 2000).         "
"3","In this study, we conduct the first individual‐level analysis of bill sponsorship in the premodern House. Specifically, we examine more than 417,000 bills introduced by House members from 1881 to 1931 and code them by type (private, local, and policy bills). We then compile a count of each type of bill introduced by each member in each congress. We use matching and event count models to estimate the effects of electoral system institutions, constituency characteristics, and members’ institutional positions and political experiences on their proclivity to introduce different types of legislation."
"4","In examining bill sponsorship during this period, we overcome an important limitation of studies that focus on the modern Congress. Since the early twentieth century, the vast majority of members have been nominated in partisan primaries and elected using official ballots that voters complete away from the prying eyes of party workers. In the late nineteenth century, however, nominations were private affairs, and the ballots voters used were distributed by party workers. Using our original data, we can determine the effect these differences in electoral system rules had on bill sponsorship. Focusing on bill introductions in the premodern House is also useful because of the extent to which private claims that today are referred to legislative staff and the bureaucracy spilled onto the legislative agenda. In addition to addressing pressing national challenges, bill introductions were used to resolve the individual concerns of Civil War pensioners and others. Thus, bill introductions in the premodern House offer a more complete picture of members’ time and resource allocation."
"5","We find that two electoral system reforms—the Australian ballot and nominating primary—contributed to the growth in private legislation and bills aimed at local constituencies. Such bills were the main drivers of the House's workload in this period. We also find evidence of an electoral connection linking members’ efforts to cultivate personal votes via private bills to the size of the veteran population. Constituency characteristics also influence members’ choices of which issues to focus on. Finally, our results indicate that members’ institutional positions and political experiences help explain their inclination to introduce policy bills addressing salient national issues. Taken together, our results shed light on the origins of many behavioral hallmarks of the modern Congress and address debates over its institutional development and performance. They establish ballot and primary reforms as a major event shaping lawmaking activity and, with it, the character of contemporary representation."
"6","Despite its value as an indicator of legislators’ priorities and its importance to Congress' policymaking role, scholars have paid little attention to bill sponsorship in the premodern House. For much of the nineteenth century, members needed explicit authorization to introduce a bill. This system limited the use of sponsorship as a tool for serving members’ reelection, policy, and power goals. However, as Cooper and Young (1989, 98) observe, by the 1890s, most limits on bill introductions had been removed and “members prized the opportunity to introduce their own bills for credit seeking and advertising purposes.”         "
"7","Studies of the modern Congress have identified several factors that influence bill sponsorship. In the Senate, Schiller (1995) finds that bill sponsorship contributes to electoral success, and that bill introductions increase as senators acquire seniority, committee assignments, and leadership positions. Studies of the House have mostly focused on cosponsorship, with scholars attributing heightened activity to both extra‐legislative position taking aimed at constituents and intra‐legislative signaling aimed at party leaders and the chamber median (Kessler and Krehbiel 1996). Specific factors predicting cosponsorship include electoral vulnerability, ideology, minority status, expertise, and past legislative activism (Campbell 1982; Fowler 2006; Koger 2003; Wilson and Young 1997).         "
"8","The few studies of bill sponsorship in the premodern Congress focus on the Senate. Meinke (2008) finds that directly elected senators introduced more constituency and policy bills, but fewer private bills than senators elected by state legislatures. As in the modern Senate, senators with more seniority, majority status, and better committee assignments introduced more bills. Schiller (2006) finds that state population and margin of victory were significant predictors of legislative activism before direct elections. She concludes that bill introductions helped reelection‐minded senators cultivate support with state legislators and citizens.         "
"9","While there have been no systematic, individual‐level studies of bill sponsorship in the premodern House, several studies suggest a link between electoral system reforms adopted in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and other legislative activities. Katz and Sala (1996) argue that Australian ballot reforms led to the development of committee property rights. Kernell (2003) finds that ballot and primary reforms influenced legislative turnover. Wittrock et al. (2008) show that postreform members exhibited less party loyalty on roll‐call votes and were more successful in securing desired committee assignments and pork barrel projects.         "
"10","Nonetheless, while previous research provides reason to expect that electoral system reforms, constituency characteristics, and members’ institutional positions will affect legislative activity, little empirical evidence links these factors to bill sponsorship in the premodern House. This lack of evidence is unfortunate given the expansive legislative agenda. As we show below, bill introductions during this period are particularly informative because of the extent to which private claims occupied members’ personal and collective attention. They provide a more complete picture of how members allocated their resources across different legislative priorities. Thus, we fill an important gap in the literature by assessing the effects of electoral reform, constituency characteristics, and members’ institutional positions and political experiences on bill sponsorship in the premodern House. Using original data on bill introductions, we show that growth in private and local legislation, fueled by adoption of the Australian ballot and nominating primary, was the main driver of the House's increasing workload. We also explain how such factors as electoral vulnerability, committee membership, and political experience influenced members’ sponsorship of different types of legislation."
"11","The data used in this study consist of more than 417,000 bills introduced by House members between 1881 and 1931 (the 47th to 71st congresses), a period characterized by large‐scale upheaval in the House's internal organization and external environment. Our primary source is the Index of House Bills in the Congressional Record. Imaging software was used to record the bill number, short title, sponsor, committee of referral, and subsequent legislative actions for each piece of legislation, which was then verified for accuracy and merged with data on the constituency characteristics, political experiences, and institutional setting of its sponsor.         "
"12","We follow other scholars in using committee of referral to classify the subject matter of bills (Meinke 2008; Schiller 2006). We classify as private any bill referred to one of several committees that predominantly handled claims of private citizens against their government. Examples of private bills include those dealing with pensions, military records, wartime property loss, and Indian depredations. Such matters frequently involved interfacing with federal agencies and would be considered casework today. We classified as local any bill referred to a committee whose jurisdiction typically encompassed legislation with more diffuse benefits than private bills, but that was, nonetheless, limited to a narrow geographic locale. Examples of local bills include those providing for bridge, harbor, canal, or other public works. Much of the congressional pork barrel might fall under this category. Finally, we classify as policy any bill referred to a committee that ordinarily dealt with salient national issues, such as appropriations, foreign policy, or large economic sectors (e.g., agriculture). The classification scheme is described in the supporting information (SI).         "
"13","Figure 1 plots the total and average number of bills introduced by House members during this period. Bill introductions rise through the first half of the time series, peaking between 1905 and 1913. More than 115,000 bills were introduced in the 59th through 62nd congresses alone. After 1913, bill introductions decrease considerably before stabilizing well above pre‐1905 levels. Figure 1 also plots the number of bills referred to the Committee on Invalid Pensions, whose jurisdiction included pensions for Civil War veterans and their dependents. Federal expenditures for pensions surpassed all other budget categories at the turn of the century. As the black bars indicate, such private legislation (20–50% of bills in most congresses) was a major contributor to the House's workload.         "
"14","Paradoxically, the increase in private pension legislation coincides with expansive public legislation that made it quite easy for anyone with a legitimate claim to be added to the pension roll. The beneficiaries of private pension bills often had been turned down by the Pension Bureau. Since these bills sought exceptions to increasingly permissive eligibility requirements, they were derided as examples of political favoritism. Though sponsoring members claimed that their bills merely helped those disqualified by technicalities (Clark 1920, 360–61), most scholars agree with the critics (Glasson 1918; Skocpol 1992). Whatever their true motive, private claims were an important focus of legislative attention, with members rushing dozens and sometimes hundreds of bills through the House on “Pension night.”1"
"15","Bills servicing narrow geographic constituencies formed another fast‐growing area of the House's expansive agenda. Figure 2 plots the total number of local and policy introductions. The pattern for local bills tracks the trends in Figure 1 closely, with introductions peaking in the 62nd Congress before leveling off near the end of our period. As the dashed line in Figure 2 indicates, the increase in local legislation was driven by the work of three committees—Commerce, Public Buildings and Grounds, and Rivers and Harbors—with jurisdiction over internal improvements and public works such as post office buildings. In the SI, we show that non‐committee members account for the vast majority of such bills, a testament to House members’ increasing interest in public works legislation. Indeed, the number of these bills exceeds the total for all policy committees combined in most congresses.         "
"16","Figure 3 plots the average number of private, local, and policy bills per member. The time series for private legislation excludes bills referred to the Committee on Invalid Pensions. Nonetheless, private bill introductions exceed the counts of local and policy bills. Indeed, the extent to which such constituency matters appeared on the legislative agenda is remarkable. In the post–Civil War era, most House members had at best a single staff person, and constituent claims required significant personal attention. White (1958, 70–84) estimates that members spent one‐third to two‐thirds of their time on constituency service.         "
"17","Introductions of private (non‐Invalid Pensions) and local bills closely track Invalid Pensions bill introductions. In contrast, policy introductions are flat. As the dashed line in Figure 3 suggests, these trends do not track the increasing tenure of members. These averages, however, obscure much variation in individual sponsorship activity. Some members trafficked exclusively in private bills, whereas others focused on broader legislation. Some members went entire congresses introducing no bills at all. The cross‐sectional and temporal differences in legislative entrepreneurship beg explanation.         "
"18","What factors explain members’ proclivity to introduce private, local, and policy bills? On the one hand, scholars recognize the opportunities that bill sponsorship provides for modern members of Congress to appeal to audiences inside and outside of Washington (Mayhew 1974). On the other hand, previous research emphasizes the imbalance between the many issues competing for members’ attention and the limited time and resources members have available (Hall 1996). These insights imply that members will be strategic in deciding which areas of legislation to focus on, and their proclivities will be shaped by individual differences in capacity—whether generated by institutional resources like committee service or such personal attributes as political experience.         "
"19","We theorize that similar position‐taking benefits and resource scarcity motivate bill sponsorship in the premodern House. Much evidence testifies to the existence of a strong electoral connection linking members’ desire to be reelected and their legislative activities during our period (Carson and Jenkins 2011). After 1880, members were free to use bill introductions as a tool for pursuing their reelection goals. We believe the expansive legislative agenda, a unique feature of late nineteenth– and early twentieth–century congresses, made bill sponsorship particularly useful in this regard, especially after the adoption of electoral system reforms that gave members greater incentives to cultivate a personal vote in their districts.         "
"20","The same resource scarcity afflicting members in the modern era is apparent in our period. Indeed, we posit that inadequate staff and the absence of cosponsorship, a low‐cost alternative to authoring legislation, made it essential for members to deploy their limited resources judiciously. Private bills, especially pension claims that required no expertise and attracted little controversy, provided a viable low‐cost bill sponsorship strategy. Beyond private bills, members had to concentrate their energies on those areas of legislation where constituent demand (and potential electoral impact) was greatest. Resource scarcity might also lead members to focus on areas where institutional resources were available, such as in their committees, where additional staff might reduce the costs of drafting legislation. Previous political experience might also help members overcome resource scarcity and thereby enhance their interest in bill sponsorship."
"21","Incumbents’ ability to respond to constituents’ interests through legislative activities is a core element of the electoral connection (Mayhew 1974). Whether through roll‐call votes, floor remarks, casework, or bill introductions, members seek to exploit the perquisites of office to enhance their reelection prospects. Campbell (1982) argues that members facing difficult electoral circumstances are especially motivated to sponsor legislation, though the evidence for this hypothesis is mixed. We suspect that the benefits of bill sponsorship vary by area of legislation. Among our three categories, private bills yield the most immediate, tangible benefits. These bills benefit a few constituents without sparking controversy and are more likely to pass. Local bills also yield tangible benefits, but they require more effort and are less likely to pass. Policy bills, in contrast, rarely pass and typically involve taking controversial positions that could harm vulnerable incumbents. We expect that vulnerable members, as measured by previous margin of victory, will introduce more private bills. But such bills are unlikely to satisfy members’ power and policy goals. We expect less vulnerable members to devote more effort to local and policy bills.            "
"22","Responsiveness to constituents might also be achieved by focusing on particular issues. For example, members representing farming communities might value agriculture legislation differently than other members. To investigate how constituency demand might stimulate bill sponsorship and direct members to particular issues, we first identify a subset of bills within our three categories of legislation. Specifically, we examine sponsorship of pension, maritime, and agriculture bills. We then measure constituency characteristics that might predict demand for members’ attention to these issues. To measure demand for pension legislation, we use data compiled by the Bureau of Pensions to rank the size of each state's veteran population. We expect members from highly ranked states (small values indicate high rankings or large veteran populations) to introduce more private bills overall and more pension bills in particular. To measure demand for maritime legislation, we identify members from states bordering the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, or the Great Lakes. We expect these members to introduce more maritime bills. Using Census data, we identify states that rank above the median in farm value per capita in each congress. We expect members from these states to introduce more agriculture bills."
"23","In addition to electoral vulnerability and constituency demand, we control for the size, partisanship, and economic characteristics of members’ constituencies. Prior to the 1960s, congressional districts varied markedly in population. We use data from Parsons, Dubin, and Parsons (1990) and the Congressional Directory to identify districts that rank in the upper quartile of population. We expect that members representing large districts will introduce more local and policy bills.2 Scholars have cited industrialization as a potent force stimulating legislative activism at the national level (Skowronek 1982; Wiebe 1967). We use Census data to identify states characterized by high levels of manufacturing, an indicator of industrial development (see the SI). Presumably, members from industrialized areas were especially responsive to demands for federal action. Similarly, as the parties began to trade positions on the role of the federal government in economic development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century (Bensel 2000), Democrats became the party advocating federal action. Thus, members representing constituencies with large Democratic majorities might have introduced more bills than other members.3"
"24","In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, two electoral system reforms—the Australian ballot and nominating primary—transformed the way elections were conducted (Engstrom and Kernell 2014). Prior to reform, operatives of the major political parties took the initiative in compiling slates of candidates for national, state, and local offices. On Election Day, party workers distributed ballots listing only their party's candidates and watched as voters delivered these “party tickets” (mostly) unaltered to their polling places (Bensel 2004). In states adopting ballot reforms starting in the 1880s, voters were given an official ballot listing all qualified candidates and allowed to make their choices in secret. In states implementing the nominating primary starting in the first decade of the twentieth century, voters rather than private party caucuses and statewide conventions were further allowed to determine which aspiring candidates would receive the official party label.            "
"25","Scholars credit these reforms with eroding party control over candidates and voters (Ware 2002), stimulating innovation and career development inside Congress (Katz and Sala 1996; Kernell 2003), reducing party loyalty (Wittrock et al. 2008), and increasing the incumbency advantage (Roberts 2009). To date, however, little research connects these reforms to bill sponsorship. We argue that these reforms altered members’ incentives to engage in legislative entrepreneurship. By allowing voters to easily split their tickets and enabling any party member to contest a nomination, they motivated House members to seek out personal votes. Rather than allow their fates to be determined by the party's collective reputation or the performance of presidential and gubernatorial nominees, House candidates might bolster their chances by personally campaigning in their districts. For incumbents, bill introductions could be used to take positions in line with constituents’ views and claim credit for delivering tangible benefits.            "
"26","We expect that ballot and primary reforms will have a positive effect on private bill introductions. For members looking to build a base of support independent of their party, private bills would enable them to establish personal connections with constituents. Similarly, we expect that members from reform settings will introduce more local bills than members from non‐reform settings. These bills might allow members to burnish their reputations by claiming credit for tangible benefits. We expect the effects of these reforms to be weakest with regard to policy bills. Indeed, by focusing members’ attention on legislation with the potential to yield attributable benefits while avoiding controversy, ballot and primary reforms might actually decrease policy bill introductions."
"27","No theory of legislative entrepreneurship is complete without attention to the unequal distribution of parliamentary rights and resources in Congress. Given the high barriers to authoring legislation in our period, we focus on aspects of members’ institutional positions that reduce the costs of bill sponsorship. We emphasize in particular the effects of committee membership in directing members to particular issues. We suspect that members of the pension committees, for example, who are best positioned to see private claims enacted, will introduce more private and pension bills, and be less active in other areas. We expect that committee chairs and ranking members, who have significant influence over the flow of legislation, will sponsor more local and policy bills. We expect members and chairs of committees of jurisdiction to be especially active on maritime and agriculture legislation, taking advantage of superior access to resources that reduce the costs of authoring these bills."
"28","Following previous studies, we control for the effects of majority status and seniority. Cox and McCubbins (2005) find that, as in the modern Congress, the majority party dominated the agenda and all key positions of influence in the post–Reed's Rules House. Because members of the majority party are more likely to see their proposals acted upon, they should introduce more local and policy bills. Pension and other private bills, in contrast, were less costly to introduce and more likely to pass in omnibus vehicles that were universalistic in nature (Wilson 1986). Thus, it is likely that majority status had minimal effects on private legislation. We also expect that more senior members introduced more bills of all types, reflecting their greater proficiency at all aspects of lawmaking.            "
"29","Other attributes not tied to their institutional positions might also have enhanced members’ interest in and capacity for legislative entrepreneurship. We focus on members’ varying capacities that result from their previous political experiences. The average time spent in public office prior to entering the House was increasing during this period, and many members had previous legislative experience (MacKenzie 2015). These experiences might translate into greater legislative activism. We expect that more experienced members will introduce more private bills, as they are likely to be attuned to their electoral payoffs.4 We also expect that members with legislative experience will sponsor more local and policy bills. Their past experience and demonstrated interest in legislative service suggest a greater interest in these bills.            "
"30","As we argue above, the premodern House is a useful arena for examining bill sponsorship because of its unique institutional variation and the extent to which private claims spilled onto the legislative agenda. The concerns of private citizens competed for members’ individual and collective attention alongside policy challenges like industrialization, western expansion, and immigration. The fact that bill introductions were used to deal with Civil War pensions and other private claims provides unique opportunities to examine members’ allocation of scarce resources."
"31","Even so, this expansive legislative agenda brings potential limitations in generalizability and research design. Our period is unparalleled in that it coincides with the aftermath of a conflict resulting in 620,000 deaths and untold material damages. The Civil War and resulting pension program for Union veterans was instrumental in shaping the workload trends we observe. In the SI, we provide evidence that the rise and decline in private legislation are not purely driven by changes in the eligible veteran population. We offer similar evidence that our counts of local bills are not unduly influenced by contextual circumstances. To further address these concerns, we separately analyze Civil War pension and other private legislation. We also separately analyze bills referred to the Commerce, Public Buildings and Grounds, and Rivers and Harbors committees. The legislation handled by these committees was least likely to be affected by the contextual changes described above."
"32","Finally, we expect that many of our hypotheses will not hold for Southern members. Although electoral competition was not entirely absent in the South, two‐party competition was, suggesting that a key mechanism generating an electoral connection with respect to bill sponsorship was lacking. We believe the effects of electoral system reforms are likely to be different for Southern and non‐Southern members. Reforms in the South were designed to disenfranchise poor, illiterate, and minority voters (Kousser 1974). As such, they did not generate the same personal vote‐seeking incentives for Southern members. In any event, Southern constituents were mostly ineligible for federal benefit programs aimed at veterans from the winning side. We follow many other scholars in separating Southern and non‐Southern members in our analyses.            "
"33","Differences in the constituency characteristics, electoral circumstances, political experiences of members, and timing of electoral system reforms across states offer much variation for empirical models to exploit. Nonetheless, scholars assessing the effects of these factors on legislative entrepreneurship must overcome a difficult methodological challenge. Previous research demonstrates that reform and non‐reform settings differ in ways, apart from reform, that affect both the characteristics of House members and their legislative activities. In this section, we describe the challenges of estimating the impact of reforms and the matching procedures we use to address them."
"34","To assess the effects of electoral system reforms, we divide House members into three groups. The first group (Control) consists of members serving before their state adopted the Australian ballot or nominating primary. The second group (Ballot) consists of members serving after their state adopted the Australian ballot, and before the nominating primary. The third group (Ballot + Primary) consists of members serving after their state adopted both the Australian ballot and nominating primary. The second and third groups are the two treatment groups in the analyses below."
"35","The large differences in reform and non‐reform settings are apparent in Figure 4 (see Tables A1–A2 in the SI). The circles indicate the standardized bias of the covariates we use to explain bill sponsorship. Large positive (negative) values indicate that the treatment group exhibits much higher (lower) covariate means than the control group. The upper left panel, for example, indicates that there are more majority party members, fewer Democrats, and more members from states with large veteran populations in non‐Southern Australian ballot states. In the lower left panel, there are fewer members from competitive electoral settings from non‐Southern states with both the Australian ballot and nominating primary. The right‐hand panels show similar imbalances among treatment and control groups for the South.         "
"36","Standardized Bias of All Covariates Before and After Matching"
"37","Note: Circles (triangles) indicate standardized bias of covariates before (after) matching. Dashed lines indicate bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. *Indicates mean difference exceeds 0.6.                     "
"38","To minimize the impact of these differences, we use matching to select samples of treatment and control group observations that exhibit greater “balance” with respect to our covariates. Specifically, we use genetic matching (Sekhon 2011) to pair each member in our treatment groups (Ballot and Ballot + Primary) with a suitable match from a non‐reform setting (Control). The goal of matching is to reduce bias by simulating the conditions of a randomized experiment using observational data. If the matched samples differ only randomly with respect to observed covariates, any differences in outcomes (bill introductions) can be ascribed to the treatment (reform) rather than preexisting differences between our groups.5"
"39","The improved “balance” achieved by matching is indicated by the triangles in Figure 4, which plot the postmatching standardized bias of the covariates. The bias in our unmatched data has been reduced, although some differences remain. To what extent do these remaining differences undermine the inferences we can draw about the effects of reform? To investigate this question, we use Monte Carlo simulations to obtain bootstrapped confidence intervals for the standardized bias calculations (Mayer 2011). Specifically, we randomly assigned members to two groups whose sizes were determined by the populations of our unmatched treatment and control groups. We then calculated the bias between these groups for each covariate. We repeated this process 10,000 times and identified the 5th and 95th percentiles for the bias of each covariate. The dashed lines in Figure 4 are confidence intervals that contain 95% of the randomly drawn biases. To the extent that the postmatching bias calculations are within the dashed lines, we have confidence that our treatment and control groups are sufficiently similar.         "
"40","Figure 4 shows that the remaining bias after matching is within the bounds of what one would expect if assignment to a reform setting were randomized with respect to our covariates. Most of the triangles lie within or close to the 95% confidence intervals, suggesting that our treatment and control groups are quite similar. To address the remaining differences, we estimate a series of event count models using our matched data sets.6 We estimate separate models for each bill type to test our predictions of how electoral system reforms, constituency demand, and other factors influence legislative entrepreneurship. Recent work encourages researchers to use matching to reduce differences in covariate distributions and then perform regression‐based adjustments on matched samples to increase the efficiency of estimates. Ho et al. (2007) argue that such “preprocessing” makes parametric methods more reliable. The next section presents results from our models that use the matched samples of members from reform and non‐reform settings.         "
"41","The results of our analyses of bill sponsorship among non‐Southern members show a strong relationship between ballot and primary reforms and the rapid growth of private legislation. Both reforms induced large increases in private and local bill introductions. The significant effects we find for electoral vulnerability and constituency demand provide evidence of an electoral connection motivating bill sponsorship and directing members to particular issues. Members’ institutional positions and individual capacities strongly affect local and policy bill introductions. For Southern members, we find similar effects for members’ institutional positions, but neither reform nor electoral circumstances are related to bill sponsorship. These findings illuminate the factors shaping legislative entrepreneurship and, with it, the character of representation."
"42","The relationship between electoral system reforms and bill sponsorship is evident in Table 1, which contains the results of our event count models. The models in columns 1–3 estimate counts of private, local, and policy bills using the matched samples of non‐Southern members from Australian ballot and non‐reform settings. Positive coefficients indicate that the predictor increases bill introductions. The left‐hand panels of Figure 5 plot predicted first differences based on these models. For example, the average House member from a non‐reform setting introduced approximately 28.8 private bills. The same member could be expected to introduce 14.1 additional private bills following ballot reform. As the upper left panel in Figure 5 indicates, this difference is statistically significant.            "
"43","First‐Difference Estimates of Bills Introduced (Non‐South)"
"44","Note: Points are predicted first differences of bills introduced given changes (25th to 75th percentiles for continuous variables) in each covariate, as generated from the models in Table 1, setting other covariates at their median values. Solid lines are 95% critical intervals. *Indicates upper bound exceeds ± 21 private, 3 local, or 1.5 policy bills.                        "
"45","The effects of our second treatment on private bill introductions are also large and significant. Columns 7–9 in Table 1 contain models that estimate counts of private, local, and policy bills using the matched samples of members from states implementing the Australian ballot and nominating primary, and those from non‐reform settings. The right‐hand panels of Figure 5 plot predicted first differences based on these models. A member from a state that adopted both ballot and primary reforms sponsored 17.3 more private bills than a member from a non‐reform setting. These results support our argument that these electoral system reforms generated new incentives for members to cultivate personal votes via private legislation.            "
"46","The effects of reform are significant for both Civil War pension and other private legislation representing a large share of the House's workload. Figure 6 plots predicted counts of pension and other private bills for members in reform and non‐reform settings. The average member from a non‐reform setting introduced 17.6 pension and 14.1 other private bills. Thus, even before the onset of reform, members were producing a high volume of private legislation. The same member could be expected to introduce 12.1 additional pension (a 68.6% increase) and 4.5 additional non‐pension private bills (a 31.7% increase) following ballot and primary reforms.7"
"47","Electoral System Reform and Bill Sponsorship"
"48","Note: Lines are predicted counts of bill introductions, with 95% critical intervals for our Ballot + Primary and non‐reform settings. For the two upper (lower) panels, the predicted counts are generated from the matched Ballot + Primary models in Table A7 (Table A10), setting other covariates at their median values.                        "
"49","The impact of ballot and primary reforms on local bill introductions is also substantial. Both treatments increased local bill introductions, though the effects are not significant for our first treatment. The increase among members from states that adopted both reforms is sizable and statistically significant. On average, these members sponsored 1.3 more local bills (a 22.3% increase over our non‐reform baseline of 6.0), which supports our prediction that these reforms will lead members to introduce more local bills."
"50","As Figure 2 implies, the work of the Commerce, Public Buildings and Grounds, and Rivers and Harbors committees accounts for most of the uptick in local bills. Figure 6c plots predicted counts of bills referred to these committees for members in reform and non‐reform settings. The average House member from a non‐reform setting introduced 3.2 such bills. The same member could be expected to introduce 4.8 such bills following ballot and primary reforms, a 52.3% increase. In contrast, Figure 6d, which plots predicted counts of other local bills, shows little change.            "
"51","Consistent with our hypothesis, we find weak effects for ballot and primary reforms on policy bill introductions. If anything, as the lower panels of Figure 5 suggest, non‐Southern members from states adopting ballot and primary reforms introduced fewer policy bills than members from non‐reform settings. Given that these bills were difficult to write, were unlikely to pass, and yielded few tangible benefits members could claim credit for, our nonsignificant results make sense.            "
"52","The results of our models of private bill introductions support our hypotheses about the effects of electoral vulnerability. Members with smaller electoral margins introduced more private bills. For example, changing a member's electoral margin from 5% to 21% decreases private bill introductions by 1.2 (a 4.3% decrease). Increasing electoral safety could free up time and resources for other types of bills that might satisfy members’ power and policy goals. The same change in electoral margin increases introductions of local bills by 0.4 (an 8.7% increase)."
"53","The presence of a large veteran population influences bill sponsorship considerably. The effect of veterans rank (large values indicate smaller veteran populations) is negative and significant in our private bill models, supporting our hypothesis. In our matched sample of members from ballot states and non‐reform settings, moving from the 25th to 75th percentile in veterans rank—for example, from Missouri with 3,549 to Minnesota with 2,590 veterans per district in 1896—reduces private bill introductions by 4.9, or 16.9% below our baseline. While we did not expect this variable to strongly influence local and policy bill introductions, we find that the same change increases local bill introductions by 1.9 (a 44.2% increase) and policy bill introductions by 0.5 (a 26.0% increase). One explanation for these results is that members handling a high volume of private claims had less time (and, possibly, less incentive) to pursue legislation in other areas."
"54","Our measures of constituency demand increase sponsorship of pension, maritime, and agriculture legislation. Figure 7 plots predicted first differences based on our models that estimate counts of pension, maritime, and agriculture bills using matched samples of members from states implementing the Australian ballot and nominating primary, and those from non‐reform settings (see Table A3 in the SI). Moving from the 25th to 75th percentile in veterans rank reduces pension bills by 5.1, or 25.4% below our baseline. Members from coastal states introduced more maritime bills. Though the absolute increase (0.28 bills) is small, these members nonetheless proposed 52.8% more maritime bills than other members. Members representing constituencies that rank above the median in value of farmland and buildings per capita introduced more agriculture bills. As with maritime legislation, the absolute increase is small (0.26 bills), but it still constitutes a 53.4% increase.            "

"57","The partisanship of members’ constituencies had different effects on private and local bill introductions. As Figure 5 shows, in our matched sample of members from ballot states and non‐reform settings, moving from the 25th to 75th percentile in Democratic vote increases private bill introductions by 1.9, or 6.7% above our baseline. The same change reduces local bills (–0.7) while having no effect on policy bills. Members representing districts in the upper quartile of population introduced 1.7 more local bills and 0.4 more policy bills, which supports our hypothesis about the effects of district size.            "
"58","Our results also support our hypotheses about the effects of members’ institutional position. Committee prerogatives were powerful catalysts of legislative entrepreneurship and helped direct members to particular issues. We find that members serving on pension‐related committees introduce more private bills and less local and policy bills. Committee chairs introduce 0.6 more policy bills, 32.5% above our baseline. Committee membership has large effects on pension, maritime, and agriculture legislation, increasing sponsorship by 18.7, 0.5, and 0.4 bills, respectively. Each constitutes a significant increase in bill sponsorship and attests to these members’ resource advantages. Chairs and ranking members of committees of jurisdiction propose the most maritime and agriculture bills overall."
"59","As expected, long‐serving members are more active in every area. For example, a member in his fourth term could be expected to sponsor 9.6 more private bills, 1.2 more local bills, and 1.2 more policy bills than a freshman member. These effects are consistent with scholarly portraits of the modernizing House as a hierarchical place where senior members take active policymaking roles, whereas junior members secure their districts and bide their time in committee systems dominated by the seniority norm (Polsby 1968). Majority party members sponsored more bills overall, with the effects being most pronounced on local and policy bills.            "
"60","Finally, we find that members’ previous political experiences influence bill sponsorship. In our matched samples of members from ballot states and non‐reform settings, more experienced members introduce more private and local bills. For example, a non‐Southern freshman with 5 years or more of previous officeholding experience could be expected to sponsor 6.2 more private bills and 0.7 more local bills than a member with less than 5 years. Former legislators were more active on general legislation, introducing 0.3 more policy bills (a 17.0% increase). We read these results as evidence that more experienced members gravitated toward legislation likely to yield tangible electoral payoffs. Meanwhile, former legislators, those with perhaps the most inclination and ability to draft general legislation, shouldered more of the House's responsibilities in this area."
"61","The results of our analyses of bill sponsorship among Southern members bear only passing resemblance to those of non‐Southern members. Thus, our study joins many others that show the exceptional nature of the House's Southern contingent and different political system supporting it. Columns 4–6 and 10–12 in Table 1 contain models that estimate counts of private, local, and policy bills using our matched samples of Southern members from reform and non‐reform settings. The panels in Figure 8 plot predicted first differences based on these models. These results suggest that Southern members responded most to the institutional opportunities afforded them by long service inside the chamber, majority status, and committee membership. Their bill sponsorship activities do not reflect differences in individual capacity in the way that those of non‐Southern members do. Additionally, the relationship between constituency characteristics and legislative entrepreneurship is mostly lacking.            "

Solid lines are 95% critical intervals. *Indicates upper bound exceeds ± 21 private, 6 local, or 1.5 policy bills.                        "
"64","Some of the most important differences between Southern and non‐Southern members are on private bills. For one thing, the differences between Southern members from reform and non‐reform settings are mostly small and statistically insignificant. While the coefficient for ballot reform is positive in our model of private bills, reform had no other significant effects on Southern members’ bill sponsorship activity.8"
"65","Much previous research has observed the facility with which the Southern contingent made use of the House's committee system. Southern members often reached the House with more experience than non‐Southern members, and the “courthouse gangs” in these states kept their Congress members in place long enough to benefit from the seniority norm. We find that Southern members introduced more policy bills (0.6) when in the majority. Long‐serving members also sponsored more policy bills; a Southern member in his sixth term could be expected to sponsor 0.6 more policy bills than a member in his second term. These results suggest that Southern members responded to opportunities conferred by their institutional position in the same ways non‐Southerners did."
"66","Our results establish a strong empirical link between several electoral and societal changes playing out beyond the walls of Congress and legislative entrepreneurship in the House. Most impressive is the relationship between electoral system rules, which governed members’ pursuit of reelection and structured their relationships with political parties and voters, and members’ sponsorship of private legislation. Theory provides reason to expect that states’ adoption of the Australian ballot and nominating primary would encourage members to seek new opportunities to establish relationships with voters. In handling requests for intervention on private claims, members appealed to voters based on personal accessibility and trust rather than partisan or ideological affinity. Such personal votes could help members withstand uncertain national tides and provide a foundation for careers inside the chamber."
"67","As we show, growth in private legislation accounts for much of the House's increasing workload between 1881 and 1931. This period also witnessed a scaling up of members’ efforts to service geographic constituencies with public works projects. Thus, our results highlight the crucial role played by electoral system reforms in Congress's institutional development. Much scholarship cites these years as a formative period when many institutional features—the seniority system and Reed's Rules to name just two—of the modern Congress took shape. Less appreciated is the corresponding rise of the “Washington establishment,” the evolving networks of Congress members, bureaucrats, and groups of citizens all pursuing their own goals (Fiorina 1989). Writing in the 1870s, Mark Twain described the new atmosphere in the capitol, where “every other person was an aspirant for a place, or … had some claim or interest or remedy to urge” (Twain and Warner [1873] 1996, 397).         "
"68","Our original data on bill introductions capture the legislative side of this system's emergence and the role of electoral system reforms in its early development. House members quickly embraced their new proposal powers to push legislation designed to make fewer enemies and more friends in their districts. The pension program installed after the Civil War provided an unparalleled opportunity to reach large numbers of constituents on an individual basis. The usefulness of pension legislation as a mechanism for delivering tangible benefits faded eventually, though the personal vote‐seeking incentives sharpened by electoral system reforms did not. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 later made other private bill introductions more difficult by delegating responsibility for resolving certain claims to the bureaucracy. However, members retained the ability to intervene on behalf of constituents, and increases in legislative staff in the postwar years enabled them to accomplish through casework what once required legislative action (Hill and Williams 1993).         "
"69","Our results also demonstrate the existence of a strong electoral connection motivating bill sponsorship in our period, complementing research on other activities. We show that electorally vulnerable members and those representing large veteran populations attempted to improve their prospects by sponsoring private bills likely to yield immediate electoral payoffs. Such particularistic legislating appears to have diverted members’ attention from other priorities, including policy bills addressing pressing national challenges. Nonetheless, we show that constituency demand was important in directing members’ attention to particular issues."
"70","Members’ institutional positions and individual capacities played a major role in directing bill sponsorship activity in the premodern House, much as they do in the modern Congress. Members with political experience, acquired inside or outside the chamber, distributed their energies most strategically in this regard. The ability of the majority party to pursue its legislative agenda unimpeded by the dilatory tactics of pre–Reed's Rules congresses encouraged members to sponsor more bills, including local and policy bills. Indeed, it is not surprising that Reed's Rules, which improved flexibility over the legislative calendar, were adopted less than 10 years after members secured the “prize” of unfettered opportunity to introduce their own bills. The stabilizing of the committee system after 1910 had the equally salutary effect of distributing committee assignments that were important to members’ hopes for legislative accomplishment according to predictable rules rather than the whims of Speakers."
"71","In establishing these links between electoral system rules, constituency characteristics, members’ institutional positions and political experiences, and legislative entrepreneurship in the premodern House, this study contributes to debates about Congress' institutional development and performance. We identify the micro‐ and macrolevel dynamics that shaped members’ allocation of resources to different types of legislation. These individual decisions by members were integral to Congress' fulfillment of its policymaking role. We also shed light on the origins of many behavioral hallmarks of the modern Congress, including members’ use of the perquisites of office to build a strong base of support that is independent of their party. While scholars argue that Congress' internal organization enables these efforts, our examination of bill sponsorship in the premodern House highlights how external electoral system institutions can similarly influence legislators’ behavior."
