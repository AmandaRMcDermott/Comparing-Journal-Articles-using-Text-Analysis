"1","The reason why anxiety promotes learning follows from the theory of affective intelligence. When cues from the environment generate an anxious response, the resulting increase in anxiety signals that extant habits are no longer adequate for dealing with the day‐to‐day environment. An effective way to address novel circumstances is to seek out information about what has changed in the environment and then to explicitly consider how to proceed. When people are faced with familiar rewarding situations, such as the anticipated victory of one's partisan candidate, reactions are governed by enthusiasm and translated into positive action. On the other hand, when people encounter familiar disliked political groups, issues, and leaders, they experience aversion. With aversion, one habituated practice is avoidance—rejecting distasteful news much in the way that one spits out a bite of a rotten apple. With both enthusiasm and aversion, people's responses are governed by already learned and mastered habits."
"2","Once people devote attention to an issue, they can engage in either a defensive search focused on the information that supports prior beliefs, practicing selective exposure, or they can engage in an exploratory search that gives consideration to the claims of opponents. When anxiety signals a problem with prior attitudes, selective exposure will be set aside as people search for useful information, some of which will be found in new arguments from new sources. Thus, people made anxious will pursue more opposing information, and on the whole conduct an information search that is more balanced than those who are not made anxious.7 In the case of aversion, we expect a different pattern. When confronted by a familiar threat, people do not need a novel perspective. Instead, they seek information that reinforces rather than challenges—so that the normal defenses will stand strong. Accordingly, we expect that those who feel aversion will limit their search for information and any search for information will be biased.            "
"3","How do emotions and information balance set the stage for the decisions people make about policy? Much of the previous research on how people react to political messages examines persuasion and the conditions under which people reject or accept opposing views. In regard to citizenship, however, the more important concern is not persuasion but consideration—where people who disagree about political goals are willing to listen to alternative viewpoints and seek common ground. In this sense, compromise represents something greater for citizenship than persuasion, not an accession to others' preferences but a willingness to consider the claims of the other side in the service of defining the public interest together. A standard expectation is that when people get emotional about politics, their positions become entrenched, resolute, and steadfast. Our theory predicts that this will be true—for aversion but not for anxiety. Those who are angered by a policy change will protect their prior views by limiting exposure or seeking confirmation and thereby reduce their willingness to endorse compromise. In contrast, we argue that anxiety will have the opposite effect. As anxiety inhibits reliance on habitual routines, it encourages people to seek out more information and to discover alternatives besides their own view. This exposure sets the stage for compromise and cooperation."
"4","Thus, people can engage either as deliberative or partisan citizens, where the kind of citizenship practiced will depend on whether people react with anxiety or with anger.8Figure 1 summarizes our expectations. Those who experience anxiety should search for more information on a policy change and explore oppositional as well as supportive information. Those who react with anger should search for less information and that information search should be biased toward prior attitudes. Finally, for those who experience an anxious response, the ensuing behavior should show them as more likely to compromise on the policy issue, while the behavior after an aversive response should show people as less likely to compromise. In short, if heightened anxiety is the predominant emotional state, then citizens will be drawn to a more balanced and cooperative state than if the predominant response is aversion.            "

"6","Despite our emphasis on emotion, we understand that other mechanisms are important as well. We want to be especially careful to consider explicitly those psychological mechanisms that might generate a spurious emotion‐attention link and thus lead to false inferences. In particular, we consider the roles of prior commitments and chronic attentiveness."
"7","First, a long research tradition has established that an individual's commitment to prior beliefs shapes attention and information processing. The idea has deep roots in psychology under the rubrics of selective attention and selective perception (see a summary of early work in Frey 1986). Further, it continues to be explored fruitfully in contemporary political science (Gaines et al. 2007; Redlawsk 2002; Taber and Lodge 2006; Taber, Lodge, and Glathar 2001). While it is clear that prior commitments matter, our theoretical perspective suggests that selective information processing is context specific: it operates more forcefully in conditions that give rise to feelings of aversion and less forcefully in conditions that give rise to anxiety. Second, we now know that chronic attentiveness affects attention (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Zaller 1992)—some people simply pay more attention to public affairs because they have chosen the field as an area of personal interest. The chronically attentive, as compared with the politically uninterested, routinely seek more information and develop stronger psychological commitments to their policy preferences. Again, our expectation is that emotion will affect attention for both the habitually attentive and habitually inattentive. In our research design, we are careful to account for these additional explanations. We want to isolate emotion's power to shape political attention.            "
"8","To test our claims that emotional appraisals condition how people handle information, we created a web‐based environment where participants have full freedom to wander as they wish, selecting from hostile, harmonious, neutral, and unrelated information. By tracking how people use these web sites, we examine how emotional reactions motivate the pursuit of information. This design improves on prior studies on affective intelligence by shifting from survey data to a laboratory setting, allowing us to better explore the mechanisms of affective response and trace the consequences for citizenship."
"9","Our interest lies in exploring the distinctive effects of aversion connected to threat and anxiety connected to risk. To evoke emotion, we manipulated the content of the initial story web page the participants observed. Participants were presented with an online newspaper article containing policy information that was (by random assignment) either reassuring or challenging in nature. The article outlined a fictional change in affirmative action admission policies at Oregon's state universities, a location distant from the locale of the study. The content of the story varied such that the university system was portrayed as either extending affirmative action (to a minority‐oriented open admissions policy) or eliminating affirmative action admissions. Using preferences reported in the pretest, the news story was identified as either conforming to the individual's policy preference or instead challenging the views of the participant. We expect that those who encounter opposition to their views will have more aversive reactions than those viewing policies in line with their preferences. Aversive reactions are uncommon, emerging in response to specific threats or challenges to one's beliefs (Steenbergen and Ellis 2006). Anxious reactions, however, are more common and hold more general roots. Anxiety can arise whenever people are faced with unfamiliar or uncertain circumstances, even if a policy change is in line with one's preferences.         "
"10","The study began when participants filled out a background questionnaire online a few days before the web session. On the assigned day, the participant came to a computer laboratory. Participants were instructed to explore the web site as much or as little as they wished. After receiving these instructions, participants began the session by looking at a computer screen opened up to one of the two simulated newspaper web pages, randomly assigned. Figure 2 shows a screenshot in black and white of one of the opening pages.9"
"11","                 First Web Page: Supporting Affirmative Action at Oregon Universities                      "
"12","Each story offered participants a number of links to pursue for additional reading. Three links under the photo on each page allowed participants to read more about the affirmative action policy. Each link was clearly labeled in a way that revealed the content of the page (e.g., “Why affirmative action programs must be preserved”) so that subjects could choose different types of information search. One link would take them to a page where their views would be reinforced, the second link would take them to a page where their views would be challenged, and a third link would take the subject to neutral pages which gave background information. The order of the links was randomized. Following these links led to other newspaper stories, which contained additional links to external sites, such as home pages for affiliated proaffirmative action and antiaffirmative action groups. In all, participants could select up to nine different pages related to the news story: three proaffirmative action, three opposed to affirmative action, and three pages of neutral content related to affirmative action. If participants were not interested in the affirmative action stories on the web site, they could select from a number of “distraction” pages, including a crossword puzzle, a solitaire game, movie reviews, comics, a sports page, and an advice column, or they could choose to stop exploring the web environment and go on to complete the posttest questionnaire. When they ended their session, participants completed a questionnaire eliciting their reactions to the policy they read."
"13","The benefits of such a design are several. Participants can select the kinds of news that interest them and view as much or as little information as they like. In a practical sense, the web‐based design improves on text‐based designs like information boards in that the web pages closely resemble actual news sources, with full story text and imagery. The drawback to this research design is that it limits our ability to construe the associations we observe as causal, since the research design can best be understood as a carefully controlled observational study rather than a true experiment. We did follow the logic of experimental research in that we created two groups of subjects that were randomly selected to be identical except for the treatment of an invoked emotional response. While challenging policies increase levels of negative emotions, we cannot neatly isolate the aversion versus anxiety distinction critical to our theory.10 Nonetheless, we gain a direct test of the hypothesis that the “negative” domain is not homogenous. Importantly, the nondirective character of the design enables us to see if people's own emotional reactions spur them to pursue the behaviors associated with each variant of citizenship (partisan and deliberative).         "
"14","We implemented this design in studies conducted in the spring of 2001 and the spring of 2002. Subjects were recruited from a participant pool of students in introductory American government classes at a public university in the South who received course credit for their participation.1 In all, 215 individuals participated, 122 in the first session and 93 in the second. We found no significant differences in the results when we compared the two administrations.         "
"15","Next, we measure participants' emotional responses to the policies using a question wording similar to the traditional American National Election Study questions about levels of emotional response.13 The emotional prompts we asked about were “proud,”“hopeful,”“enthusiastic,”“anxious,”“afraid,”“uneasy,”“angry,”“contempt,”“bitter,” and “disgust.” Because previous research suggests that aversion arises only in certain circumstances (Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen 2000), we use factor analysis to confirm the presence of three distinct emotional responses—anxiety, enthusiasm, and aversion. We find that a three‐factor model has a superior fit over two‐factor models of negative and positive emotions and disposition/surveillance systems, as described in Appendix C. We used these items to make three separate scales of emotional response—one of anxiety, one of enthusiasm, and one of aversion—employing an additive scale with equal weighting.14 All of the scales were reliable, with Cronbach's alpha values ranging between .74 and .93. Our focus is on disentangling the effects of negativity. As such, enthusiasm, the other emotion of the disposition system, serves as a control in the substantive models.15"
"16","We first see if people react emotionally to policy positions in our web environment by comparing reactions of those who saw disturbing versus reassuring policy change. We include three control measures to account for alternative explanations. Attitude strength is measured as a 4‐point scale of intensity of preferences about affirmative action in college admissions. News consumption reflects the number of days in a week that a person seeks news about politics and public affairs. Interest is measured with a 4‐point scale about interest in following governmental affairs. Each of these measures explores whether preexisting dispositions account for some, or all, of the observed variation in citizenship behaviors we examine. These measures are all rescaled 0–1."
"17","As Figure 3 illustrates, the experimental manipulation has a significant effect on the level of emotional response reported. Those who see that Oregon is adopting a policy in line with their preferences are much more enthusiastic, while those who see the universities' pursuing an affirmative policy inimical to their own preferences react with both heightened aversion and anxiety. Given an expectation that most people have little interest in the details of public policy, the fact that even a distant policy debate engages people emotionally is significant.         "
"18","                 Effects of Issue Challenge and Reassurance on Anxiety, Aversion, and Enthusiasm                      "
"19"," Notes: Emotional response scales are each normalized to 0–1. Differences are all significant, p < .05; one‐tailed test. N = 198.                     "
"20","The ability of the challenging stimulus to evoke emotions remains robust even controlling for other individual‐level differences. In Table 1, we find that the strength of one's priors on affirmative action policy contributes to feelings of aversion, but given that these variables are each scaled from 0 to 1, the effect is less than half the effect size produced by the challenging stimulus (compare 0.16 to 0.37). While the intensity of prior preferences fuels anger, it does not contribute to anxiety. We control for attitude strength in later models to ensure that any results we see are not simply due to existing dispositions in preference intensity, news consumption habits, or interest.16"
"21","Next, we consider whether threatening stimuli motivate people to seek out more information. We devised two measures of information search—one a behavioral response and one a subjective report. The first is a count of the affirmative‐action pages visited. We recorded the browsing patterns of each participant during the web session and summed the number of pages visited, excluding the initial page and any visited pages unrelated to affirmative action. The second measure is the subject's desire to learn more about the policy area. In the posttest questionnaire, we asked participants three items about whether they would like to learn more about proaffirmative action groups, antiaffirmative action groups, and affirmative action policies generally. We combined responses to these three questions into a 7‐point scale to capture whether study participants were intrigued by what they had read (Cronbach's alpha of .84). The observed behavior, the number of pages visited, provides direct evidence of search, but is limited by the character of the design and the tendency for participants to comply with an experimenter's demands (although subjects were instructed to view as much or as little of the web pages as they wanted). The second measure better captures motivation but cannot show whether those motivations will be pursued."
"22","Our theory suggests that anxiety generated by challenging policy stories will spur the search for more information, while aversion should inhibit information search. Table 2 presents the results. In column 1, we see that the anxiety produced by the disturbing news story generates increased searching, while aversion limits search. Those made anxious by the stimulus on average visited two more stories (2.04) on the web site than those who were not anxious. In terms of magnitudes, the difference between those made anxious and those who remained calm accounts for about half the range of search behavior. In addition, we see that aversion has a substantial and distinct effect on search behavior in the opposite direction, limiting the pursuit of additional information. In column 1, we see that aversion considerably dampens the subjects' inclination to read pages (coefficient of −1.63). When participants are faced with a policy that makes them angry, they avoid further reading. The effect of anxiety is such that those most anxious browse through more than four web pages beyond the initial stimulus page. Those who had a highly aversive response visited half as many pages. In column 3, we see the effect of anxiety on the desire to learn more about the policy, which is positive and significant. Those with the highest issue anxiety express a desire to learn more about the issue that is three times as great as those who experience minimal anxiety. This pattern confirms the affective intelligence hypothesis—by showing that the emotions of the surveillance system are central in governing political attention even after controlling for other emotional responses and individual differences in political interest.            "
"23","To confirm that these emotional reactions are the consequence of situational appraisals and not simply individual differences in emotionality, we consider the effects of emotion when people are confronted with favored outcomes. In our earlier analysis, we saw that the negative emotions of anxiety and aversion were infrequently elicited in the face of friendly policy change, and we see in column 2 that it is the positive emotion of enthusiasm that best explains information search when confronted with reassuring policy change. Those pleased with this policy change are less inclined to seek additional information. In terms of information search, the evidence is clear. The emotions of the surveillance system spur attention to novel information, while aversion suppresses the inclination to seek out new information. Moreover, these findings are not undermined by the three alternative dispositional factors. We next consider whether anxiety leads to a more balanced search for information, encouraging a reconsideration of the evidence, and whether aversion promotes a biased information search, connected to a renewed commitment to one's original position."
"24","To test bias in information search, we rely on three measures, two related to the content of the actual search patterns, and one related to the stated desire to learn more about opposing views. The first measure is a count of the number of web pages selected that conflicted with the subject's prior preferences on the issue—for instance, the number of proaffirmative action pages viewed by a person opposed to the policy. The second measure reflects the ratio of opposing pages to the total number of affirmative action pages considered, among those who engaged in any information search. The third measure reflects the motivation to learn about opponents, drawn from posttest questions about interest in learning more about the sides of the issue."
"25","We present the results of each measure as a separate column in Table 3. The first model of the number of opposing pages visited is estimated with Poisson regression, the second model reports the ratio measure regressed on the three measures of emotion, and the third model is an ordered probit model of the desire to learn more about the views of opponents.17 The overall pattern is clear: anxiety and aversion influence the amount of opposing information explored. Those made anxious by the challenging stimulus had a higher probability of visiting pages that conflicted with their prior views and expressed greater willingness to learn more about the views of opponents. Only in the case of the ratio measure of bias does anxiety fail to have a statistically discernible effect. Aversion has the opposite impact, inhibiting the search for opposition information across all three measures. When the policy change induces anger, participants are more likely to retreat to their prior attitudes and look for information that reinforces those priors. We also unexpectedly find that those who respond to challenging policies with enthusiasm are also more likely to express interest in learning more about opponents. Figure 4 graphically illustrates the difference between effects of anxiety and aversion. In the three panels, we see that those made anxious (the solid line) are more likely to seek information that might challenge their priors, while those made angry (the dashed line) turn to arguments that are familiar and agreeable. The aversion generated by a challenging policy issue provokes a resistance to outside information, while anxiety leads to a desire to learn about alternative views.            "

"28","Emotions, we now see, play an important role in the amount and type of information people gather. But policy debate is about choosing a particular outcome, so we are also interested in what emotional responses imply for policy outcomes. Can emotions influence individuals' willingness to consider competing claims in a choice situation? Given our results thus far, it appears promising that the engagement of the surveillance system may open, rather than shut, the doors for political compromise."
"29","We employ a measure of compromise that sums responses to three items. First, we consider two measures of participants' explicit inclination to compromise. Once participants completed reading the materials, we asked them to indicate what the Oregon university system should do about the policy, first from their own point of view and second, taking into account everyone's views. They could choose to expand affirmative action, eliminate it, or produce some compromise solution.18 As a third component, we consider whether participants on their own initiative voiced support for compromise. We asked study participants to write open‐ended responses to the materials they viewed, to explain their choices about what should happen in Oregon, and to comment on the principles that underlie affirmative action. We coded these essays with respect to the subjects' willingness to seek alternative solutions—rather than merely arguing for or against the Oregon affirmative action policy. When an individual offered (or expressed an explicit interest in finding) an alternative remedy other than strengthening or weakening affirmative action, we so coded their response.19 Here, less than half chose to compromise. These three nominal measures of support for compromise were summed to form a scale (Cronbach's alpha of 0.65), then modeled using ordered probit.            "
"30","In the first column of Table 4, we show compromise as a function of the three emotions: anxiety, enthusiasm, and aversion. Then, to illuminate the mechanisms by which anxiety encourages compromise, we consider whether cooperation is solely a product of the emotions raised, or a reflection of kinds of information pursued within the web environment. We use both the count measure of the number of opposition pages viewed and the ratio measure of open‐minded search in separate models. We find that emotional reactions significantly influence the desire for compromise. Those who were made anxious by the challenging stimulus were more likely to endorse compromise, while those made angry were significantly less likely to accept a middle‐ground remedy. In the unlikely case that people were enthusiastic about a challenging policy story, compromise was also welcomed. When the policy conforms to one's priors, enthusiasm limits one's willingness to compromise, but if one feels any anxiety, compromise receives greater consideration. Whether the policy is reassuring or challenging, holding strong priors about the policy issue also inhibits the consideration of compromise. However, the effects of these emotions persist even when controlling for individual differences such as attitude strength and political interest.            "
"31","To what degree is the willingness to compromise a product of the kind of information search engaged? We find that visiting opposing pages opens the door to compromise. Controlling for the kind of information search, anxiety remains a predictor of openness and the effects of aversion are moderated. In the fifth column, we find the ratio of opposing pages viewed is a significant influence on one's willingness to compromise—the more people direct their information search toward the viewpoints of the other side, the more likely they are to move from their priors to consider other options. Thus, the effects of emotion on compromise are mediated by the kinds of information search those emotions provoke. However, even controlling for the kinds of information sought, anxiety still has a significant effect on willingness to compromise. Figure 5 illustrates the dramatic effects of emotions on support for compromise. We see that rising anxiety is positively associated with a desire for compromise. And, equally, an aversive reaction leads to a rejection of compromise. Activating the surveillance system inspires not only attention to policy issues, but does so in a way that encourages consideration of alternatives and compromise.20"

"34","Our empirical tests confirm that emotions shape the ways that people acquire political information, where two different types of negative emotions—aversion and anxiety—produce distinctive response patterns. When familiar threats spur aversion, people shut down their information search, practice selective attention, and become close‐minded about alternatives. In contrast, when novel circumstances produce anxiety, people are more willing to seek new perspectives and become open to compromise."
"35","We recognize more work needs to be done. A fuller array of issues and a more heterogeneous array of subjects would help, of course. The design of the study, however, improves on extant survey‐based evidence in that we can now more closely connect people's emotional reactions with their behavior in a controlled environment. Yet important questions—beyond the scope of this study—remain about just how public policy issues generate anxiety and aversion. It is clear that our issue manipulation generates a distinct pattern of emotional response: emotional reactions are not mere reflections of people's dispositions; they also respond actively to the immediate policy environment. These emotions have consequences for the practice of citizenship—beyond that explained by prior predispositions like attitude strength and attention to politics. Having assessed the consequences, we now know that further work is needed to identify the causes—we want to better understand why people identify political situations as risky versus threatening.21"
"36","We must of course acknowledge that a variety of other factors shape the different modes of citizenship. Framing influences how people appraise issues (Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997), and how the media chooses to cover an issue can shape the voters' stances (Gilens 1999). Campaign ads, by their content and style of presentation, shape the responses of those who observe them (Brader 2006; Valentino, Hutchings, and White 2002). How citizens practice politics is also influenced by their social context (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004; Mutz 2006). Institutional settings clearly encourage, depress, and shape the form of citizenship practiced in a society. Yet as these factors function, they touch the emotions of the citizens. To understand the political meaning of framing, campaign ads, or social context, we want to know whether the mechanisms evoke anxiety or aversion, since each will have distinct consequences for the manner and quality of practiced citizenship.         "
"37","In thinking about how citizens engage in politics, it is common to distinguish different types of citizens—the politically sophisticated versus the less knowledgeable, the strong partisans versus the weakly affiliated, those who vote versus those who engage in more demanding acts like volunteering for a candidate. But rather than focus on fixed typologies, we argue that different modes of citizenship are suited to different circumstances and goals—some situations demand the commitment of partisan citizenship while other instances recommend a more deliberative engagement. The results of this study support the view that two modes of citizenship are available to citizens—deliberative (reflective consideration of available choices) and partisan (steadfast adherence to established convictions)."
"38","The way that citizens approach politics depends in part on affective appraisals that identify the political geography of the moment as either aversive or anxious. Research on motivated reasoning shows the power of prior attitudes in directing how new information is evaluated (Kunda 1990; Taber and Lodge 2006). It is clear that an inclination toward partisan citizenship reflects individual differences in sophistication and the intensity of prior preferences. Consistent with that account, we find here that those holding strong views will more likely engage anger and partisan processing. But motivated reasoning is only one strategy people can employ in the face of new policy information. In unfamiliar or uncertain terrains, the partisan biases that guide motivated reasoning can be set aside and attention turned to an open consideration of what is new. Our theory and evidence indicate that the political environment, and the emotions that it stimulates, also directs the kind of citizen behavior pursued. Both predispositions and contemporary context matter.         "
"39","That people react differently to risk and threat, via anxiety and aversion, may help illuminate some puzzles in political communication. This emotional duality could explain some of the inconsistent evidence of selective exposure (Chaffee et al. 2001; Iyengar et al. 2008; Sears and Freedman 1967), as people's desire to seek reassuring information and avoid challenges may be driven by multidimensional and contradictory emotional cues. Further, the question of negative campaigning's unpredictable impact (Lau et al. 1999; Lau, Sigelman, and Rovner 2007) might be informed by the distinction. The lack of clarity may be due to the operation of two distinct forms of negativity, one associated with conditions of risk and one associated with conditions of threat. As this study has shown, each has unique cognitive and political consequences. Ads that signal risk will produce consequences that are the opposite of those ads that signal threat.         "
"40","Finally, emotions motivate strategic action for both citizens and political elites. When in familiar circumstances, people value information primarily for its capacity to bolster their familiar habits of action, confirm their partisan orientation, and sustain partisan solidarity with like‐minded others. But when the past seems an inapt guide to current circumstances, people explore alternatives from sources foreign as well as familiar. Thus, at emotions' distinctive signal, people's information processing comports with the norms of either a partisan or a deliberative citizenship. The important implication is that contemporary information does not have universal value to citizens—its value depends on strategic requirements."
"41","It seems likely that the distinction between anxiety and aversion affects not only citizen information processing but also citizen behavior as well. Commonly, enraged partisans want to go to the streets, send in their financial support, and march to the polls. Those same activated citizens resist a social deliberation that calls for honoring others' perspectives and a cooperative search for solutions. Angry participants notoriously produce poor deliberation; worried participants might do better."
"42","Equally, elite political strategies incorporate the complexity of negative emotions. Any campaign, whether to gain victory in an election context, pursue policy change, or mobilize support to begin or end a war, confronts three distinct populations: supporters, opponents, and disinterested spectators. On the one hand, campaigns must activate their supporters and guard against the attempts of opponents to undermine loyalty: they often turn to anger and disgust as the currency of political discourse. On the other hand, campaigns often require new supporters to succeed. The spectators are an obvious target—the challenge lies in breaking their habits of inattention. Further, the large pool of opponents may be appealing if targeted communications can motivate them to abandon their stands and to consider alternative resolutions. In both cases, the anxiety of unknown risk lies at the core.22 Thus politics, even combative politics, may incorporate strategies that promote not only partisan conflict, but also the precursors of civic deliberation.

While the factor loadings of the anxiety items tend to be lower, from 0.56 to 0.95, in all, the fit of the model is good with a goodness of fit index of 0.92. More critically, the model fit of the three‐factor model of emotional response is found to be superior to alternate two‐factor conceptions of emotional response that exclude aversion as a unique dimension. As indicated by the table below, the three‐factor model has a significantly lower chi‐square than both a two‐factor positive/negative model and a two‐factor disposition/surveillance model.
