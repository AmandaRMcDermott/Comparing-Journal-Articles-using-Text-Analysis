"1","Numerous studies from the United States and Western Europe have examined gender differences in attitudes and behavior focusing on them as measures of legislators' policy priorities (see, for example, Dodson and Carroll 1991; Reingold 2000). But they often do so without explicitly distinguishing how gender might shape attitudes differently than it does behavior. Attitudes of legislators predispose them to focus on certain issues while behavior is the way in which attitudes get translated into action. Though sometimes similar, attitudes and behavior often vary. A legislator may feel that education is very important but not sponsor any education bills while in office. This may be due to time constraints, limited legislative capital, or chamber norms. For example, members of the governing party may think that certain issues are important but not sponsor bills on them because the president sponsors most of the legislation in that area. Seniority in the legislative chamber may condition behavior such that senior members work on and sponsor more important bills, restricting junior members to less potent issues. Gender discrimination may occur with men wanting to safeguard their legislative dominance and limit women's access to legislation on certain issues. In short, a range of constraints in the legislative chamber that may not be relevant when simply stating support for an issue come into play when legislators have to decide which bills to sponsor. Yet, very few studies have attempted to describe how or explain why gender differences might vary across attitudes and behavior (for an exception, see Wangnerud 2000).         "
"2","I define eight thematic categories on which to compare women's and men's attitudes and behavior: women's issues, children and family issues, education, health, the economy, agriculture, employment, and fiscal affairs.1 These categories represent some of the areas in which legislators create and debate policy, they replicate categories used in other studies (Dodson and Carroll 1991; Jones 1997; Reingold 2000; Swers 2002; Taylor‐Robinson and Heath 2003), and they represent a broader distinction between issues in “women's domain” and “men's domain” (Chaney 1979; Craske 1999; Htun 2003; Molyneux 1985; Sapiro 1981).2 Women's domain issues include women's issues, which are “feminist” issues, education and health, which are often considered “feminine” issues, and children and family issues which are both “feminist” and “feminine.”3 Men's domain includes concerns accorded to a man's traditional role as head of the household and being in the public sphere, such as the economy, agriculture, employment, and fiscal affairs. This distinction between women's domain and men's domain parallels a normative distinction sometimes made between these issues being “less important” versus “more important,” politically.         "
"3","Most of the eight categories are self‐explanatory, but two deserve clarification. Women's issues are those directly affecting women that are widely supported by feminist groups and women's organizations including concerns such as reproductive health freedoms, domestic violence protections, gender equality legislation, civil rights for women, sexual harassment policy, and equal pay for equal work. Some women's issues cross into other thematic categories, but if they target women directly (e.g., sexual harassment or reproductive health), then they are women's issues. The children and family category includes concerns such as divorce and other family contract matters, children's welfare, child sex crimes, child work restrictions, and drug prevention for minors.4"
"4","A number of existing studies examine gender differences in legislators' issue priorities only on women's domain thematic areas (Jones 1997; Swers 2002; Taylor‐Robinson and Heath 2003). However, I examine all eight thematic areas defined above because focusing on the wider range of issues permits drawing broader and more accurate conclusions from the study. For example, if I only examined women's issues, children/family issues, education, and health and found significant gender differences, I might conclude that stereotypical differences between men and women persist in Latin America. But, if I also analyzed gender's role in legislators' preferences for economic, fiscal, and agricultural issues, I might find no evidence of gender differences, which would suggest that many traditional stereotypes are no longer appropriate. This would contradict the conclusion drawn from looking at women's domain issues only. Thus, it is important to include the full range of thematic areas to compare women's and men's attitudes and behavior appropriately.         "
"5","The “supermadre” label implies that women in politics will promote feminine issues while men focus on issues traditionally in men's domain.5 Chaney writes of female politicians in Latin America, “They (and the men) almost invariably appear to consider their intervention as an extension of their family role to the area of public affairs” (1979, 20). She points out that “‘male’ issues revolve around questions of authority, power, war, arms, monopoly over resources, economic policy” while “‘female’ issues tend to relate to the family, children, and the old, food prices and inflation, peace, moral questions” (164).6 Further, her study finds that not only do women and men differ in the issues they prefer but in the tasks they perform while in office. She notes that even if women hold nonfeminine or “neutral” positions, “posts which either a man or a woman might fill,” they “are overwhelmingly engaged in feminine‐stereotyped tasks related to education, social welfare, health, and cultural fields” (133). Even though Chaney was describing women in Latin American politics in the late 1960s, she reaffirms her hypotheses for female politicians in the 1990s (Chaney 1998). Thus, if women in today's legislatures are still “supermadres,” we would expect to see women sticking to feminine issues while men focus on issues in men's domain.         "
"6","Significant changes in women's status in Latin America over the past 35 years brings into question the relevance of hypothesizing that female politicians are still “supermadres” (Craske 1999; Htun 2000). Today, women's enrollment in higher education is equal to men's in many countries, and in some countries more students are female than male. The proportion of the paid labor force that is female increased from one‐quarter in the 1950s to one‐third in the 1980s and ranged from 29% to 42% across countries in 2002 (World Development Indicators 2004). Women comprise remarkably large proportions of national legislators in several countries, as high as 35% in Costa Rica in the 2002 election, and record numbers of women have been appointed to ministerial positions—in 2003, half of the Colombian cabinet was female (Escobar‐Lemmon and Taylor‐Robinson 2005). Changes also are evident at the household level in Latin America. An increase in female‐headed households has led women to take on the role of sole economic provider in addition to traditional roles such as caregiver. At the same time, a decline in the average size of families in Latin America has made it easier for women to work outside the home and participate in political activities. Of course, highlighting these improvements in women's status obscures the fact that women and men in Latin America are still far from equal, and it obscures variation across countries. But, the changes that have occurred justify revised hypotheses about male and female legislators' attitudes and behavior.         "
"7","I argue that a legislator's gender should influence both attitudes and behavior, but its effect may vary across thematic areas and should be less salient for attitudes than behavior. In terms of attitudes, I expect that changing gender roles in Latin America mean women no longer view their political roles solely as an extension of their roles as mothers and wives, and consequently, male and female legislators' issue preferences will be the same in many thematic areas. Specifically, women and men are unlikely to differ in their self‐stated preferences for “feminine issues”—education and health—and “men's domain” issues—economics, agriculture, and employment."
"8","However, differences in preferences may emerge for women's equality and, perhaps to a lesser degree, children and family issues. Changing gender roles in Latin America, women's entry into arenas previously dominated by men, and women's experiences in the women's movements that developed during the transitions to democracy in the 1980s, have increased women's awareness of and interest in feminist issues, whether or not they accept the label of those issues as “feminist” (Jaquette and Wolchik 1998; Molyneux 1985). Thus, women are likely to be more concerned with women's issues and children/family issues than men would be.7 Yet, the differences may be in degree of preference rather than in absolute terms. Women and men may both view these issues as important, differing only in just how important they are. Even where men make up the overwhelming number of government officials, it would be difficult to find a man who would publicly speak out against women's equality even if he personally did not believe in it. As Craske writes, “Latin American governments were keen to be seen to be prioritizing women's rights as evidence of their new role as ‘modern' states” (2003, 37).         "
"9","Gender differences are likely to emerge in all of the thematic areas when legislators act on their preferences and introduce legislation. In a recent article, Heath, Schwindt‐Bayer, and Taylor‐Robinson (2005) find that male legislators in Latin America marginalize female legislators by isolating them on women's issues and social committees and keeping them off of power committees and economics/foreign affairs committees. They do so because as the “traditionally dominant group,” men feel that dominance threatened and want to protect a “scarce political resource,” committees (420). I am not arguing here that bills are a “scarce political resource,” but a similar type of marginalization may be occurring in the legislative activity of bill sponsorship. Men may feel threatened by the growing numbers of women in the public sphere and want to keep issue areas segregated. Men maintain their dominance on issues traditionally related to the public sphere and men's work, which often are the most salient political issues (e.g., neoliberal economic reforms). Women then get pressured, either indirectly or directly, to stick to “less important” women's domain issues. If the pressure is indirect, women face a tense legislative environment where men isolate women through committee assignments or exclude women from unofficial meetings on economic policy problems, making women feel isolated and feel pressured to work primarily on “women's domain” issues. More direct pressure would occur when men openly express opinions that female legislators should work on bills that they have the most experience with—bills dealing with home or family, for example.         "
"10","Several female legislators that I interviewed in Costa Rica perceived marginalization in the legislative arena. They pointed out that the political space is men's space and adding women to that has simply created two separate spaces. Female legislators in Colombia recognize the patriarchal nature of the Congress and are reluctant to discuss gender issues because it threatens men and brings out divisiveness (Zambrano 1998). Because of this marginalization, I expect significant gender differences to emerge in bill initiation behavior where they do not exist in attitudes. Women are likely to sponsor more bills on education and health and sponsor less legislation than men in areas of the economy, agriculture, and fiscal affairs. I also expect that female legislators will be more focused on women's issue and children/family bills, but the reason for this attention may be a combination of marginalization and the greater priority that women place on women's issues and children/family issues to begin with.         "
"11","In sum, I hypothesize that significant gender differences exist in attitudes toward women's issues and children/family issues but not for other thematic areas. However, when legislators move to sponsoring legislation in these other thematic areas, traditional divisions between men and women are likely to reemerge as male legislators place pressure on female legislators to stick to areas in which they have “expertise”—education and health in addition to women's issues and children/family issues—while men maintain their dominance in areas of economics, agriculture, and fiscal affairs."
"12","I selected three countries that represent some of the diversity of Latin America to test hypotheses about how men and women legislate differently. Argentina, Colombia, and Costa Rica are presidential systems, as are all 19 countries in Latin America, with legislatures that play a considerable role in policymaking. The three countries provide four legislative chambers in which to test for gender differences. Costa Rica's National Assembly is unicameral while Argentina and Colombia have bicameral legislatures; however, I only examine the lower house in Argentina, the Chamber of Deputies, because the Senate was appointed up until 2001."
"13","The choice of Argentina, Colombia, and Costa Rica is important because they provide variation on legislative and socioeconomic environments, allowing a test of gender's effect across diverse settings. The proportion of women in office ranges from a low of 7% in the Colombian Senate during the 1994–98 term to 31% in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies during the 2001–2003 term. Electoral rules vary from an extremely personalistic system in Colombia to more party‐centered systems in Argentina and Costa Rica. The 2000 Gender Development Index, which estimates levels of development weighted by gender inequality, gives Argentina the highest rating of the three countries, 0.836, with Costa Rica in the middle, 0.814, and Colombia at the bottom, 0.767. In contrast, one of the poorest countries in Latin America, Guatemala, rates 0.617, and the United States' index value is 0.937.8"
"14","Argentina, Colombia, and Costa Rica also differ in several ways from the United States and Western Europe where the bulk of research on gender and legislative representation exists. They have strong, traditional, Catholic cultures dominated by “machismo.” They are new democracies, but all three have had their current democratic regimes for a sufficient period of time for representation norms to be ingrained—Costa Rica since 1949, Colombia since 1974, and Argentina since 1983. They have levels of economic development that are much lower than the United States and Western Europe. In 2000, GDP per capita in constant 1995 U.S. dollars was $31,730 in the United States compared to $8,174 in Argentina, $3,911 in Costa Rica, and $2,289 in Colombia (World Bank Development Indicators 2004). In sum, Argentina, Colombia, and Costa Rica provide a good setting for testing gender differences in legislative behavior, and the diversity among the cases helps to make them representative of Latin America, more broadly. By including all three countries in this study, I can test the generalizability of gender's effect across different environments and compare findings for Latin America to the developed democracies of Western Europe and the United States."
"15","In 2001–2002, I conducted a survey of legislators from the 2001–2003 congress in Argentina and the 1998–2002 congresses in Colombia and Costa Rica. For Colombia and Costa Rica, legislators were in their last year of a four‐year term, giving them considerable experience as representatives even if this was their first term in office. Argentine deputies were more than halfway finished with the 2001–2003 congressional session. They are elected to four‐year terms, but half of the deputies are reelected every two years, creating two‐year congresses. In all countries, the survey was either filled out in the presence of the legislator or, if legislators spent very little time in their offices, it was given to the legislator's staff with instructions for the legislator, not assistants, to complete it. In total, I surveyed 292 legislators across the three countries—174 in Colombia, 50 in Costa Rica, and 68 in Argentina.9"
"16","To measure legislators' attitudes toward issues in the thematic areas, I use a question from the survey that asks representatives to “Please indicate the priority of the following policy areas to your legislative work,” and among the list of policy areas are women's equality, children and family issues, education, health, the economy, agriculture, and employment. They were given five priority choices to rank each: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. I use ordered probit models to predict the likelihood that a legislator will respond in each one of the five priority categories with the seven thematic areas as separate models. Due to missing data, the analyses in this section have sample sizes between 250 and 258 legislators."
"17","Gender is the primary independent variable, coded “0” if the legislator is a man and “1” if a woman. To isolate gender's effect on attitudes, I control for personal characteristics of legislators that might influence their preferences. The survey asked legislators a series of background questions, and responses to those questions provide the basis for the control variables—age, whether or not the legislator has a college degree, whether the legislator's previous occupation was in business, education, agriculture, or a medical field, whether the legislator represents a rural (coded “0”) or urban district (coded “1”), and ideology.10 Ideology is a 5‐point ordinal scale from −1 to 1 (leftist to rightist) based on Coppedge's (1997) classification of political parties in Latin America.11 I also account for the different socioeconomic environments in the three countries with a control variable for level of development measured as logged GDP per capita in constant 1995 U.S. dollars during 2000.            "
"18"," Table 1 presents the results for each thematic area. As expected, female legislators place higher priority on women's equality and children/family issues than male legislators, and gender is not significant for education, health, or the economy. But, unexpectedly, gender does influence attitudes toward agriculture and employment with women placing less importance on those issues than men. Changes in sex roles in Latin America over the past 35 years have eliminated differences in preferences for education, health, and the economy, but not for agriculture or employment issues. This makes sense for agriculture where women's employment in agriculture is very small, as low as 0.2% in Argentina, and has barely changed since 1980 (World Development Indicators 2004). The findings are more puzzling for employment issues since women increasingly are seeking work outside the home but often struggling with informal sector economic activities rather than formal sector work.            "
"19","The ordered probit coefficients in the models do not offer a very intuitive interpretation for the substantive effect of gender so Figure 1 shows the predicted probabilities that male and female legislators will respond in each of the five categories of priority for women's equality and children/family issues.12 From one perspective, the figure shows that the gender disparity is substantively quite large for both thematic areas. Holding other variables at their mean, the first model predicts that 65% of female legislators feel that women's equality is “very important” compared to only 25% of male legislators—a 40% difference. For children and family issues, the disparity is smaller but still statistically significant at 15%. From another perspective, the figure reveals that, overall, both men and women view women's issues and children/family issues to be important. Combining the percentages of respondents in the “high priority” and “very high priority” categories shows that 94% of women are predicted to be highly supportive of women's issues but so are 68% of men. For children and family issues, a predicted 79% of women support them along with 66% of men. Clearly, differences exist between women's support and men's support, but the predictions also show that two‐thirds of male legislators view these issues as important. In fact, the models predict that only a small percentage of male legislators place “low” or “very low” priority on these issue areas (9% for women's equality and 10% for children/family issues), and they also predict that women will be in those categories (1% for women's equality and 5% for children/family issues). In sum, while women place higher priority on women's equality and children/family issues than do men, both genders do view them as important political concerns.            "
"20","                 Predicted Probabilities of Attitudes toward Women's Equality and Children/Family Issues                         "
"21","Most of the control variables in Table 1 are not strong predictors of legislators' preferences, with a few notable exceptions. First, occupation is significant in several models. Health professionals place higher priority on health than legislators with other occupational backgrounds and business professionals place greater priority on the economy and agriculture, an economic area of major importance to Latin American countries. Somewhat surprisingly, educators do not place significantly higher priority on education, though the sign of the coefficient is in the expected direction. Second, having a college degree leads legislators to place higher priority on the economy but lower priority on health issues. Third, legislators from rural districts view agriculture as more important than representatives of urban districts. This may indicate that constituency influences shape the attitudes of representatives, but it may also reflect the fact that a rural district is unlikely to elect someone who does not already prioritize agriculture. Finally, legislators in countries with higher levels of development have less preference for women's issues and agriculture. This may reflect the lower importance of agriculture to more developed economies and the higher levels of gender equality found in more developed countries. Most importantly, these control variables elucidate that the effect of gender is generalizable across legislators with different personal characteristics and across socioeconomic environments.            "
"22","The insignificance of ideology in most models may seem surprising given the importance of party and ideology in the United States and Western Europe. Studies on gender and legislators' preferences in the United States find gender differences in legislators' priorities primarily within parties, not across them. Reingold writes, “As almost every study makes clear, sex differences pale in comparison to party differences. Among political elites, party affiliation is a much stronger predictor of policy preferences than is sex” (2000, 158). Here, I do not simply control for party membership but what it is about party membership that affects the bills legislators sponsor, i.e., ideology. The findings show that gender is important across different ideologies. I also tested an interaction term between gender and ideology to see if gender has different effects within ideological tendencies (models not shown). In other words, do gender differences in preferences for women's equality, for example, only exist among leftist legislators since men and women on the right might be less inclined to support women's equality? Apparently not. The interaction between gender and ideology was not statistically significant for any of the seven thematic areas.            "
"23","This highlights an important difference between the United States and Latin America. Latin American political parties have considerably weaker ideological underpinnings than parties in the United States and Western Europe (Coppedge 1997; Rosas 2005). Despite the ideological strength of Latin American parties traditionally (e.g., the Liberals and Conservatives in Colombia in the 1800s and into the National Front, which ended in 1974), significant shifts in ideology and weakening of the major parties have occurred over the past 30 years and have contributed to a rise in the number of small parties represented in national politics. This is not to say that Latin American parties are entirely nonideological or that the weakness of ideology is constant across all countries (see Rosas 2005), but in comparison to the United States and Western Europe, significant differences do exist. Additionally, ideological differences exist within parties, which admittedly makes party a less‐than‐perfect measure of ideology in Latin America. A better measure would be something similar to Poole and Rosenthal's NOMINATE scores, but these are not available in most Latin American countries because they do not regularly record roll‐call votes.            "
"24","To be sure that gender differences in one country do not drive the results, I ran the models separately for each of the four chambers (not shown). In the disaggregated models, women still place significantly higher priority on women's equality than do men. Gender differences are weaker for children and family issues in Argentina and Costa Rica and neither agriculture nor employment shows significant gender differences in the Colombian Chamber or Senate. Some of these differences may be a result of the smaller sample sizes in the disaggregated models—they drop as low as 46 in Costa Rica where the chamber only has 57 seats. Also, some variables in the full models cannot be included in the disaggregated models. For example, Colombian senators are elected from a single nationwide district, making their constituency base the entire country. The urban/rural variable measuring district characteristics is not relevant here."
"25","In sum, the results show that female legislators consider women's issues and children/family issues to be of higher importance than do men, in general, while men place higher priority on agriculture and employment. Gender does not contribute to different attitudes toward education, health, or the economy. Do the gender differences that exist for attitudes translate into differences in the bills legislators initiate? Do dynamics of the legislative arena lead women to sponsor education and health bills more often than men even though they do not place higher importance on these concerns?"
"26","I examined all bills initiated during two congresses in Costa Rica and Colombia, 1994–98 and 1998–2002, and two years in Argentina, 1995 and 1999.13 I coded bills as to whether or not they fit into the seven thematic areas described previously. Table 2 shows the number of bills introduced in each country by thematic area. More economic bills were initiated than any others. Women's issue bills are less common, ranging from as few as nine in the 1998–2002 congress of the Colombian Chamber of Representatives to 35 in the same years in Costa Rica.            "
"27","Rules and motivations for initiating bills in Argentina, Colombia, and Costa Rica are quite similar across the three countries. Legislators can sponsor bills on any issue in any chamber, with the exception that budget bills must be introduced in the Colombian Chamber of Representatives while international relations bills must start in the Senate. In Colombia and Costa Rica, no limits exist on the number of cosponsors a bill can have, and all signers are considered equal supporters of the bill. In other words, bills do not have a primary sponsor. In Argentina, a maximum of 15 legislators can sign any one bill, and each bill has a primary sponsor with other signers listed as cosponsors. In all three countries, the executive branch has the power to introduce bills (and does so), and in Colombia, the president has the power of exclusive bill introduction in several policy areas, most notably, the national budget, some fiscal affairs issues, and treaties with foreign nations. Executives in Argentina and Colombia are more powerful than the Costa Rican president (Shugart and Carey 1992), but in all three countries, the legislature exerts a check on the executive and is the primary locus of policymaking. Legislators initiate bills for a variety of reasons, but one of the main ones is credit claiming (Crisp et al. 2004). They want to be able to take credit for bringing benefits to their district and/or votes to their political party and bill sponsorship is one way to do that.            "
"28","As in the attitudinal analyses, I include a number of control variables to isolate the effect of gender. Two are operationalized identically to those used in the issue preference models—ideology and urban district.14 I also include level of development here, but it is measured as GDP per capita in constant 1995 U.S. dollars averaged across all years in a congressional term. Additionally, I include three variables assessing a legislator's position in the legislative chamber that could influence bill sponsorship patterns. First, I control for whether the legislator is a member of the largest party in the chamber.15 The largest party can set and control the legislative agenda and is better positioned to move legislation through the policy process. Thus, legislators from the largest party might be more likely to sponsor bills in thematic areas it sees as important. Second, senior legislators have greater experience and knowledge of the workings of the chamber and may initiate more bills than junior legislators. I measure legislative experience as the total number of terms the legislator has served.16 Third, I account for committee membership to ensure that gender is not picking up the fact that women might be disproportionately situated on women's issue committees, for example, or the fact that legislators may be more likely to sponsor bills that will end up in their own committee. Committee membership is a dichotomous variable for whether or not the legislator sits on a committee dealing with bills in the thematic area of the dependent variable.17"
"29","I also control for differences in the legislative environment of each chamber, specifically, the incentives that legislators have to seek support from their constituents based on them as individuals or based on their party affiliation. This may be important because legislators operating under electoral incentives that encourage personal vote seeking may be more likely to promote women's issues as a way to distinguish themselves from other candidates or to court the women's vote. Legislators where rules encourage party‐centered vote seeking would be much less likely to do so unless the party makes women's issues one of its major policy concerns, which very few Latin American political parties do.18"
"30","Finally, I include variables that control for the percentage of bills a legislator initiates out of all bills initiated in the chamber and the number of bills initiated in each legislative chamber as a percentage of the total number of bills in the data set. Some legislators initiate many bills while others just a few, in part because legislators vary in their political clout, the size of their staff, and the resources available to them. Otto Guevara Guth, an opposition party leader in the Costa Rican Assembly sponsored 148 bills in the 1998–2002 congress when the median was only 27! For similar reasons, some chambers have more bills initiated in them than others."
"31","I analyze bill sponsorship patterns with the legislator as the unit of analysis and the dependent variable measured as the percentage of bills a legislator sponsors that fall into each thematic area. In other words, it is the number of bills that a legislator sponsors in any given thematic area divided by the total number of bills a legislator sponsors during the congressional session (or year, in Argentina) multiplied by 100. For example, a legislator who initiates no women's issue bills is coded 0%, a legislator who sponsors five women's issue bills out of the 10 bills he or she initiated during the term would be coded 50%. This measures the priority that a legislator places on each thematic area within his or her overall policy agenda.19Table 3 provides descriptive statistics on legislators' bill sponsorship patterns. The last two columns show the range and mean for the dependent variable.            "
"32","I use tobit to analyze the data because they are censored at zero—no one can initiate a negative percentage of bills no matter how much they dislike a policy—and they cluster at zero—around 80% of legislators did not sponsor any bills in the areas of women's issues, children/family issues, and health (see the first column in Table 3). The clustering makes regular OLS estimates inconsistent by underestimating the intercept and overestimating the slope of the regression line. Tobit accounts for this and produces more consistent estimates. Further, tobit answers two questions at once. First, what explains the likelihood that legislators will initiate at least one bill in the thematic area? And second, if they do, what explains the fact that, for example, Viviane Morales in the Colombian Chamber of Representatives, 1994–98, sponsored half of her 12 bills on women's issues while Juan Brenes, a deputy during the same period in Costa Rica, sponsored only one of his 50 bills (2%) on women's issues?            "
"33"," Table 4 shows that significant gender differences exist for all seven thematic areas. Women are more likely to initiate women's issues, children/family, education, and health bills, and a larger percentage of the bills women initiate are in these areas. They are significantly less likely to sponsor bills on the economy, agriculture, and fiscal affairs, and when women do sponsor those types of bills, they comprise a smaller percentage of their total bills initiated. The substantive effect of gender is more complicated to discern. Tobit coefficients cannot be interpreted like OLS estimates because the tobit model is nonlinear (Greene 1997; Sigelman and Zeng 1999). Thus, it is necessary to compute the marginal effect of gender on bill sponsorship while holding continuous variables at their mean and dichotomous variables at their mode. Table 5 shows predicted probabilities and the corresponding difference in the proportion of bills sponsored by men and women in each thematic area. In the most extreme disparity, women initiate 10.5% more women's issues bills than do men. The gender gap is smaller, though still substantial, ranging from 3.0% to 4.7% for the other thematic areas. As hypothesized, bill initiation behavior yields gender differences in areas that can be categorized along the traditional distinction between “men's domain” and “women's domain.”            "
"34","The effect of gender is strongly significant even after accounting for other influences on bill initiation patterns. The most consistently significant factor is committee assignments. Legislators who sit on a committee in the thematic area are more likely to sponsor legislation in that area. This holds for all thematic areas except economics. This may be because of the large number of economic bills that get initiated in each congress (see Table 2), far more than could be sponsored just by legislators on economy‐focused committees. Not surprisingly, representatives of rural districts initiate more agriculture bills than those from urban districts. Legislators in more developed countries sponsor more women's issue, health, economic, and fiscal bills, while sponsoring fewer education bills. This contrasts with the findings for attitudes where more developed countries were less likely to place high priority on women's issue bills and the differences for most of the other thematic areas were not significant. Finally, the two controls for the proportions of bills legislators initiate overall and the proportions in each chamber are significant in most models.20"
"35","As with attitudes, ideology does not matter in any of the bill initiation models. An interaction between ideology and gender was significant for health bills only (models not shown). It reveals that women are slightly less likely to sponsor health bills than men with the same ideological tendency, but women on the right sponsor 8% fewer health bills than women on the left. Health bills also were an anomaly for the effect of being in the largest party (Table 4). Being a member of the largest party depresses the priority legislators place on health. I tested for an interaction between gender and membership in the largest party, and it too was only significant in the health models (not shown). Among legislators in the largest party, women sponsor 6.3% more health bills than men. Gender differences in the opposition party were statistically insignificant. One reason that health bills stand out here is that sometimes they are considered a more important issue area. In Argentina, for example, the Health committee is one of the major committees in the chamber comparable to Appropriations, Foreign Affairs, and Defense, among others (Jones et al. 2002). The more important the issue, the more likely men in the largest party might be to sponsor those bills themselves.            "
"36","Gender differences in bill initiation patterns are significant after accounting for the varying socioeconomic and political environments of the countries. Again, to be sure that the cross‐national results are not driven by gender differences in just one or two countries or one of the two time periods, I disaggregated the data by chamber and congress (models not shown). The disaggregated results reveal some variation in the effect of gender across countries, as they did for attitudes. However, no one country appears to be systematically biasing the results, as even within countries, gender is more salient during some terms than others. For example, female legislators in Costa Rica prioritize children and family bills more than men did during the 1998–2002 congress but not during the 1994–98 congress. In Argentina, gender is not significant for children/family, health, or economic bills in 1995 but is significant for health and the economy in 1999. This may result from the increase in female deputies up to 19% from 14% in Costa Rica and up from 15% to 29% in Argentina.21 With more women in the chamber, male deputies may perceive a greater need to marginalize women and maintain their dominance on traditionally male issues. Fortunately, by including multiple countries, congresses, and chambers within countries in this article, the results show the effect of gender across these units rather than revealing findings based on one particular place and time.            "
"37","An important note about the data and the models in Table 4 is that they do not distinguish between primary sponsors and cosponsors. In part, this is because two of the three countries do not do so in their own congressional records, as mentioned previously. Therefore, the models assume that a legislator's decision to sign a bill is the same regardless of whether there are other sponsors or not. Yet additional factors may influence cosponsorship decisions, such as party affiliation or the gender of other signers. Legislators may be more likely to sign bills when they are the primary sponsor or sponsoring with members of their own party. Similarly, the gender of other sponsors may matter. A man may be less likely to sponsor a women's issue bill if all of the other sponsors on that bill are women. A woman may avoid getting involved in or be shunned from an economics bill when all of the sponsors are men. A full specification of the decision to cosponsor a bill and the role that gender plays in it goes far beyond this article both theoretically and because of data limitations. However, I can examine this to some degree by reconfiguring the data set and testing whether the effects of gender found previously are biased because of omitted cosponsorship variables.            "
"38","Since Colombia and Costa Rica do not distinguish primary sponsors from cosponsors, I cannot examine cosigners only. However, I can separate bills with only one sponsor from bills with multiple sponsors and analyze cosponsored bills accounting for relevant characteristics of other signers. Still, on cosponsored bills, it is impossible to make a distinction between the primary sponsor and the true cosponsors. I estimate models where the unit of analysis is a bill signature and the dependent variable is a dichotomous measure of whether or not a legislator signs onto a bill in a specific thematic area. Each legislator can be in the data set multiple times for each bill that he or she sponsors, and bills can appear repeatedly, once for each sponsor. This yields 11,660 observations. Now, I can control for two important factors missing from the previous models—party affiliation and gender of other sponsors. Table 6 shows the results of these models for the key variables discussed here, though the controls from Table 4 were in the models as well.            "
"39","Gender differences persist for women's issues, economics, agriculture, and fiscal affairs bills but are less pronounced for children and family, education, and health bills. Coefficients are in the expected direction but significance levels drop to p = 0.06, p = 0.09, and p = 0.22, respectively. The reason for this may be that fewer bills in these areas are cosponsored as compared to the number cosponsored in other thematic areas. Only 22% of children and family bills, 21% of education bills, and 30% of health bills have multiple signers compared to 33% for women's issues and economic bills, 35% for agriculture bills, and 37% for fiscal affairs. Thus, gender differences may be less significant on these cosponsored bills because cosponsorship is less common."
"40","Partisan effects emerge only for education, agriculture, and fiscal bills. A legislator is more likely to sign an education bill or fiscal affairs bill if the other sponsors are from the same party but less likely to sign an agriculture bill with copartisans than with members of other parties. The nature of agriculture policy may explain this because it generally focuses on specific regions of a country, and within multimember districts, which all three countries have, it is common to have representatives from multiple parties. These legislators are willing to cross party lines to sponsor legislation that directly targets their district.            "
"41"," Table 6 also shows that gender effects exist for economic and fiscal bills. Legislators of the same sex are more likely to initiate each type of bill. While women are less likely to sponsor economic and fiscal bills than men, they will do so when the other cosponsors are all women. Vice versa, men are more likely to sponsor these bills with other men rather than in cross‐gender groupings. This provides additional evidence that some form of gender segregation or marginalization occurs in the legislature. Men seek out other men when looking for cosponsors on economic and fiscal bills, and when female legislators want to work on those kinds of bills, they do so with other women.            "
"42","Without a fully specified model of cosponsorship and data distinguishing primary sponsors from cosponsors, these conclusions are tentative. But they do underscore the robustness of the findings that gender affects bill initiation behavior and that women sponsor more bills in “women's domain” while men focus more on issues in “men's domain.” The next step is to determine what these findings combined with those on issue preferences mean for legislative representation in Latin America."
"43","This study's findings provide answers to three important questions about women and legislative representation. First, how and why do male and female legislators differ in their attitudes and bill initiation behavior? Gender differences in attitudes exist for some issue areas but become more widespread for bill initiation behavior. Women place higher priority on women's issues and children/family issues, and they place lower priority on agriculture and employment. Some of these preferences translate into behavior as female legislators initiate more women's issues and children/family bills and initiate fewer agriculture bills. Gender differences do not exist in attitudes toward education, health, or the economy, but significant disparities emerge when legislators initiate bills in these thematic areas. These findings support the theory that women are marginalized in the legislative arena. Just as women in Latin America are isolated on traditional “women's domain” committees (Heath, Schwindt‐Bayer, and Taylor‐Robinson 2005), they also are marginalized in the kinds of legislation they sponsor. Male legislators focus on the often more important “men's domain” issues while women are pressured to stick to issues in “women's domain.”         "
"44","A second key question is whether the gender differences found in Argentina, Colombia, and Costa Rica are generalizable to Latin America and perhaps comparable to findings in the United States and Western Europe. This study is based on three diverse countries with multiple observations in each country—either in terms of chamber or congress. Further, the countries offer relatively diverse environments in Latin America in which to test for differences between male and female legislators. The statistical models control for a myriad of other influences on legislators' attitudes and behavior to increase confidence that the gender differences that emerge are in fact due to gender and not other explanations. All of this helps make the findings generalizable across Latin America. However, it will be important for future research to examine other countries and longer time frames within countries to strengthen these assertions."
"45","Comparisons to the United States and Western Europe help to determine whether gender's effects might be applicable beyond Latin America. Do commonalities exist in how women legislate across cultures, types of democracy, and levels of development? The changes in women's status in Latin America in recent years suggest that female legislators in Latin America may be similar to their counterparts in the developed world, and both are likely to face a similar degree of marginalization in the legislative arena. The most consistent finding across regions is that women are significantly more likely to prioritize women's issues and children/family concerns in both attitudes and bill initiation behavior (Dodson and Carroll 1991; Jones 1997; Norris 1996; Reingold 2000; Saldías 1982; Swers 2002; Taylor‐Robinson and Heath 2003; Thomas 1994; Thomas and Welch 1991; Wangnerud 2000; Zambrano 1998). Regardless of whether the woman is a legislator in progressive Scandinavia or traditional Latin America, she places greater priority than her male counterparts on feminist issues and concern for children and the family. It is more difficult to compare findings on social issues and on issues traditionally considered “men's domain” because of mixed findings in other studies and the limited attention given to economics, agriculture, employment, and fiscal affairs in those studies. Dodson and Carroll (1991) and Thomas (1991) find significant gender differences on attitudes toward health issues in U.S. state legislatures, but Reingold (2000) does not in her study of self‐stated policy priorities among legislators in Arizona and California. Similarly, Dodson and Carroll (1991) find no gender differences in attitudes toward education while Thomas (1991) finds differences for bill priorities. Norris (1996) finds modest differences on social issues from a survey of MP's in Great Britain. A couple of early studies of U.S. state legislatures found women less likely than men to state that budget, tax, and business/economic issues were important priorities (Dodson and Carroll 1991; Thomas and Welch 1991). Thus, while gender differences in attitudes and behavior toward women's issues are generalizable across levels of economic and political development and different cultures, it is less clear for social issues and “men's domain” issues.         "
"46","The third and biggest question that this study addresses is whether female legislators in Latin America are still “supermadres.” The findings of this study imply that the answer is no. Societal changes in sex roles in recent years have merged women's and men's issue preferences such that they now are equally likely to prioritize the feminine issues of education and health and the “men's domain” issue, the economy. That differences reemerge for bill initiation behavior in these areas at first may appear contradictory. However, this behavior is not because women prefer or dislike these issues but because unfriendly legislative environments push them into these traditional roles. Also contrary to the idea of women as “supermadres” is that they promote feminist issues (i.e., women's issues) more so than men. While many women in Latin America still shun the word “feminist,” they see feminist issues of women's equality and antidiscrimination as very important. The supermadre was more concerned with feminine issues than feminist ones. Thus, the evidence here does not support continued characterization of women in Latin American politics as supermadres."
"47","The answers to these questions have implications for the broader concern with legislative representation in Latin America. While women are entering national legislatures in larger numbers, they have not been accepted into the legislative arena on equal terms with men. Disparities in men's and women's bill initiation patterns show that women still face marginalization in their political activities, making it impossible for them to translate their political preferences into legislative action. They are unable to do their job of representing constituents and creating policy to the same extent as men. Despite many gains in the political arena, women continue to lack full representation in Latin American democracies."
