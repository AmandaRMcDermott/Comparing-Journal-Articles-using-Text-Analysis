"1","Consider a set of n≥ 2 players N={1, … , n}. They convene in periods t= 1, 2, … to divide a fixed divisible good. Thus, possible agreements are denoted by a vector x= (x1, … , xn) drawn from a set , the (n− 1)‐dimensional unit simplex in Rn.         "
"2","An agreement requires the approval of a winning coalition, C⊆N. The set of winning coalitions is determined by the underlying voting rule and is represented by a subset, , of the set of all possible subsets of N, i.e., . We assume that  is nonempty and monotonic, so that for any two coalitions A, B with A⊆B⊆N, we have . Monotonicity requires that coalitions that encompass winning coalitions are also winning coalitions.12 For our subsequent arguments, monotonicity of the voting rule ensures that a player that prefers to have a proposal rejected cannot do so by voting yes.13 Thus, the voting strategies we will specify constitute best responses with monotonic voting rules.         "
"3","Subsumed in the class of voting rules we consider are familiar quota rules, as well as the weighted majority voting rules analyzed by Snyder, Ting, and Ansolabehere (2005). Also covered are the voting rules considered by Winter (1996), McCarty (2000a,b), as well as the two versions of bicameralism analyzed by Diermeier and Myerson (1999), and Kalandrakis (2004).14 Still, these studies represent only a small fraction of the possibilities permitted by our assumptions on the voting rule .         "
"4","For any admissible voting rule, the interaction of players proceeds as follows. In each period t= 1, 2, … , prior to reaching an agreement, one of the players is recognized with probability πi to make a proposal z∈Δn. Having observed the proposal, players vote yes or no. If a winning coalition vote yes, then the game ends with z being implemented, else the game moves to the next period. Naturally, the vector of probabilities of recognition, π, is such that π∈Δn.         "
"5","Each player i∈N derives von Neuman‐Morgenstern stage utility ui(x) =xi. Players discount the future by a factor δi∈[0, 1], i∈N. Thus, the payoff of i∈N from a decision x∈Δn reached in period t≥ 1 is given by δt−1ixi. In the event of perpetual disagreement players receive zero. We denote a game with voting rule , discount factors δ∈[0, 1]n, and recognition probabilities π∈Δn, by .         "
"6","A stationary proposal strategy for player i∈N in game  is a division of the good, zi∈Δn, proposed by player i when i is recognized. A stationary voting strategy is a set Ai⊆Δn that contains the divisions of the dollar on which player i votes yes. With stationary voting strategies {Ai}i∈N, the set of acceptable divisions in each period is given by . We say that strategies {zi, Ai}i∈N involve no‐delay if zi∈A for each i∈N.         "
"7","Given stationary strategies for all players, the continuation value of i∈N, denoted by vi, is defined as the expected utility of i if the game moves in the next period. A no‐delay, pure strategy Stationary Subgame Perfect (SSP) Nash equilibrium for game  is a set of stationary strategies {zi, Ai}i∈N and a corresponding vector of continuation values v∈Δn, such that for all i∈N, we have , and zi∈ arg max{xi: x∈A}.         "
"8","In what follows we will refer to such an equilibrium simply as a pure strategy SSP equilibrium, omitting the no‐delay property. Note that we require that players vote yes if and only if they prefer the proposed agreement to their discounted continuation value, δivi. This rules out implausible SSP equilibria in which players vote in arbitrary ways on proposed agreements due to the fact they are not pivotal. Baron and Kalai (1993) refer to these refined voting strategies as stage undominated.         "
"9","We call equilibrium continuation value vi the political power of player i in game , since it corresponds to that player's ex ante expected fraction of the good. For clarity, we restate this as a formal definition:         "
"10","Definition 1   v∈Δnis a political power vector for players1, … , nin gameif it represents players' continuation values in a SSP Nash equilibrium."
"11","Existence of SSP Nash equilibrium is not an issue for game  by the arguments of Banks and Duggan (2000). We emphasize that an SSP equilibrium in this game is both Nash and Subgame Perfect. In particular, if all players other than i∈N play a stationary strategy, then i has a stationary best response: i can find a stationary strategy such that there does not exist another strategy (stationary or not) that can improve her payoff. In other words, players are allowed to contemplate deviations to nonstationary strategies, yet such strategies cannot be better responses.            "
"12","Note that we do not rule out the existence of multiple political power vectors for the same game, although uniqueness does obtain in the case of simple majority rule (Eraslan 2002). The set of possible levels of political power, v= (v1, … , vn), in game  is the set of all possible divisions of the good, Δn. In the next section we shall show that for every voting rule , and any discount factors δ∈[0, 1]n, every possible political power v∈Δn can be obtained in game  by appropriate choice of recognition probabilities π∈Δn.            "
"13","We start this section with a pair of examples in which we illustrate how prespecified levels of power can be obtained by appropriate choice of recognition probabilities. These examples pave the way for the main result of our analysis which we state toward the end of this section."
"14","We first consider a four‐player committee with a member that has veto over decisions:"
"15","Example 1 (Committee with Outside Veto)   Assume               for all                                 i∈N. Player 4 can veto decisions and a majority of the remaining players must also approve proposals. Thus"
"16","Note that the veto player receives a payoff that is exactly equal to that of the remaining players. In effect, this requires that the veto player has a smaller probability of making proposals. Next, consider a dictatorial voting rule:"
"17","Example 2 (Dictatorial Rule)   Assume               and               . Let player 1 be the dictator so that                              "
"18","In the above example we have “stacked the deck” in favor of player 1. Not only does player 1 have dictatorial voting power, but she is also more patient (δ1 > δ2=δ3) than the other two players. As a result, her bargaining power is higher, all else equal. But when all else is not equal, in particular when players 2 and 3 have significantly higher proposal‐making probability, their political power can be larger than that of the dictatorial voter.            "
"19","We could proceed to derive similar outcomes for other voting rules or sustain alternative equilibrium values in the above cases. We trust that these examples provide a stark illustration of our argument. With appropriate choice of proposal rights, even players that have no voting rights (i.e., dummy players that are superfluous in every winning coalition) such as players 2 and 3 in the last example, can have more power than a dictatorial voter."
"20","In both examples we considered, we fixed the voting rule, , discount factors, δ∈[0, 1]n, and ‘target’ political power, v*∈Δn, and sought n recognition probabilities, πi, i∈N, for the players that satisfy a set of n+ 1 linear equations. These probabilities must also satisfy n inequalities, πi≥ 0, i∈N. By adopting a formulation introduced by Nash (1951), we show that a solution to these equalities and inequalities exists for every admissible , and v*. Specifically:            "
"21","Proposition  1   Consider any nonempty, monotonic voting rule, , and any discount factorsδ∈[0, 1]n. For everyv*∈Δnthere exists a set of recognition probabilitiesπ*∈Δnsuch thatv*is the political power of gamein a SSP Nash equilibrium in pure strategies."
"22","Proof See the appendix.            "
"23","It is important to emphasize what proposition 1 does not state. First, it does not imply voting rights are irrelevant. All else constant, the voting rule does affect players' expected payoff. Similarly, the typical conclusion in sequential bargaining games regarding the effect of discounting is not threatened by proposition 1. What proposition 1 does make plain is that proposal power “trumps” these other aspects of the environment that determine players' power."
"24","The converse is not true in general, as we will now show (by example) for the case of voting rules, discount factors, and history dependent strategies that satisfy sequential rationality. First, consider a game with , and discount factors δi=δ < 1, i= 1, 2. For this game it is not possible to devise a voting rule that will sustain equilibrium value v*= (1, 0). Next, for the same example under unanimity rule , there is a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, i.e., even if we allow equilibria in which players use complex strategies, there is a unique equilibrium value . Finally, it is easy to see that in a simple majority rule game with N={1, 2, 3} and π1= 1, there is no choice of discount factors for the three players that sustains equilibrium value v*= (0, x, 1 −x), x∈[0, 1].15"
"25","We have shown that in standard bargaining models over a fixed divisible resource, the voting rule, impatience, or the use of simple strategies do not jointly restrict political power if we can manipulate proposal rights. This result quantifies the relative significance of proposal making in influencing political power in comparison to voting rights. It also highlights the importance of proposal rights as an institutional dimension with which to influence political outcomes. We spend the next few paragraphs in an attempt to anticipate objections that can be leveled to these conclusions."
"26","One objection to the significance of our result for the purposes of institutional design is that proposal prerogatives either cannot be manipulated via rules or that they empirically correlate with voting rights. We do not dispute proposal and voting rights correlate in many existing committee configurations. In theoretical studies such a correlation stems from the natural benchmark assumption to treat individual committee members symmetrically. But despite the empirical or theoretical relevance of restrictions on the assignment of proposal rights, the fact remains that proposal rights and voting rights can vary independently."
"27","Importantly, constitutions can be written to determine proposal rules in arbitrary ways. In the EU, for example, small and big countries rotate with equal frequency in the presidency of the Council of ministers, even though the voting rule is weighted according to population. Primo (2002) discusses formal institutions operating under majority rule that stipulate a unique proposer, i.e., assign all proposal power to a single individual.         "
"28","We can find similar examples when considering informal committee environments. In certain cultures, senior members are seldom interrupted when expressing opinion and, hence, enjoy privileged access to proposal making in council or committee meetings. Similarly, readers familiar with tumultuous student deliberations in amphitheaters will recognize that proposal power is markedly higher for the subset of participants that belong in the intersection of loud and eloquent speakers."
"29","Even in otherwise delineated democratic polities such as the United States, campaign finance practices imply significantly reduced political power for the poorer segments of society that otherwise have equal voting rights. This is because access to a developed media industry via monetary contributions is essential for a viable electoral campaign and subsequently for the formulation of proposals. In short, individual heterogeneity can and often does induce a divergence between de facto or de jure proposal rights and voting rights."
"30","A related objection has to do with the probabilistic nature of proposal prerogatives in our model. In particular, probabilistic recognition generates an infinite set of proposal making institutions to select from, while the choice of voting rules is effectively among a determinate number in finite committees. We deem probabilistic recognition a reasonable assumption in the absence of explicit rules that determine the identity of the proposer. The fundamental insight from the literature on proposal rights (and from our study) is that proposing in such settings is desirable. As a result it seems natural that the resolution of agent's competition for access to proposal making takes place randomly when no other rule or individual resolves this indeterminacy. For example, empirical evidence suggests that the selection of formateurs during government formation negotiations in certain multiparty parliamentary systems is probabilistic rather than deterministic in accordance to the size of the parties' parliamentary representation (Diermeier and Merlo 2004).         "
"31","But, empirical relevance aside, the question of whether probabilistic recognition is a natural assumption is not relevant from the point of view of institutional design. There are no technological constraints that would prevent the author(s) of committee rules or constitutions to stipulate the determination of the proposer via some randomization device such as the one we model. In other words, probabilistic recognition is a feasible institutional choice (even if the resultant distribution of political power is not acceptable or politically viable)."
"32","Lastly, readers may object to the idea that committee interaction follows the rules specified in our model versus some other more elaborate sequence of proposal making and voting on the part of committee members. Certainly real‐world constitutions and parliamentary rules of procedure are more complicated than what we assume. The restricted set of institutions for proposal making we consider renders our result even stronger. In particular, if we can choose from a richer class of rules and procedures for the origination of proposals compared to the one we allow, we can achieve more equilibrium power levels than those permitted under the maintained assumptions."
"33","Admittedly, the complex parliamentary rules we encounter in real legislatures exist in part in order to accommodate informational or other organizational needs (e.g., gains from exchange) emanating from the policy space. These considerations are not relevant in the policy space we study. Another important reason for the complexity of legislative rules is direct evidence in favor of our conclusion: self‐organizing legislatures adopt elaborate rules to safeguard against the abuse of proposal prerogatives exactly because proposal making can have such a significant impact on outcomes."
