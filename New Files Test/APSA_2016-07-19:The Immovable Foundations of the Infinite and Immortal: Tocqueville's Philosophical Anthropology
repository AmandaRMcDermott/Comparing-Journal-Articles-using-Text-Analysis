"1","I turn first to Tocqueville's political science. In particular, I highlight the purpose of his study of democracy, and the place of religion in his analysis. This survey of democracy and religion in Tocqueville's political science establishes the context of my inquiry into his philosophical anthropology."
"2","What distinguishes Alexis de Tocqueville's political science and his understanding of democracy, its “vices and natural advantages”? At base: his judgment that the advent of modern democracy created “a world altogether new”—and, with it, the need for “a new political science” (DAII 4.3, 643; DA, Introduction, 7). His political science, a synthesis of classical and modern constitutionalism, is comparative in method and reformative in intent (Kraynak 1987; Mansfield 2006, 81–84). By democracy, Tocqueville refers to the social state, rather than a political regime as such. His analysis, as Raymond Aron observes, takes in both social structure and political institutions: Tocqueville “note[s] certain characteristics which are related to the essence of any modern or democratic society; but he add[s] that, beyond these foundations common to all modern societies, there are many possible political regimes. Democratic societies may be liberal or despotic” (1998, 238).         "
"3","Democracy in America centers on the effect of the democratic social state on intellectual habits and sentiments as manifested in religion, politics, commerce and industry, communities, and the home (DA, Introduction, 3, 6). Tocqueville emphasizes the intellectual and moral qualities and habits of the people—rather than their geographical situation or even their laws—as fundamental (DAI 2.9, 295). His political science is most concerned, therefore, with their formation and is especially attentive to how the influences of the different spheres one encounters in daily life might work to reinforce or counter one another. “Instead of devoting himself to the formulation and derivation of principles, he immerses himself in the practice of liberty by Americans, praising, criticizing, but above all describing with marvelous verve and insight” (Mansfield 2006, 84). In sum, practice is primary in Tocqueville's accounts, and description, in turn, gives rise to theory (Mansfield 2006, 85).         "
"4","In particular, Tocqueville's purpose is to find and recommend the elements of political life that support the “manly and legitimate passion for equality” that makes men “want to be strong and esteemed”—over and against the “depraved taste for equality” that finally reduces men to shared servitude (DAI 1.3, 52). If he has any hope for the democratic future, it rests with the ability of moralists, legislators, and enlightened men to counter democracy's vices and sustain its virtues through “the gradual development of democratic institutions and mores” (DAI 2.9, 301). By mores, Tocqueville means not only “the habits of the heart,” but also the ideas and opinions that form “the habits of the mind” (DAI 2.9, 275). Tocqueville looks to democratic institutions, religion, and the family for their combined ability to shape citizens’ souls and imaginations so that they believe they have—and actually come to have—the capacity to preserve their independence (see DAI 2.9, 300–302).         "
"5","The specific mark of the democratic social state is not freedom, for “one encounters [freedom] elsewhere than in democracies” (DAII 2.1, 480). Rather, democracy's distinctive trait is equality of conditions, or, in Pierre Manent's refinement, equalization of conditions: “The original fact, it seems, is not so much equality of conditions as equalization of conditions, constant movement toward ever‐greater equality of conditions” (DA, Introduction, 3; DAII 2.1, 480; Manent 2006, 112). The final destination of this movement is, however, undefined. As democracy continues to advance, it nurtures the love of equality that is the characteristic passion of the democratic social state (DAII 2.1, 480).         "
"6","Tocqueville anticipates further equalization of conditions with apprehension. On the one hand, he affirms that it is just to dispense with the aristocratic age's fiction of human inequality, which established artificial but permanent differences “among people evidently alike” (DAI 2.10, 328; Manent 2006, 117). On the other, he fears the consequences of equalization and especially the passions it incites. He considers democracy, then, as the social condition and historical development of a people. The political regime is a separate question. And there is no guarantee that a democracy's political regime will be free. In fact, Tocqueville fears that democracy itself will lead men to relinquish their liberty (DAI 1.3, 52; DAI 2.9, 296–302; DAII 2.1; DAII 4.8, 676).         "
"7","The French aristocrat's primary concern is that citizens will no longer believe in the potential for individual greatness.4 He laments the loss of the beliefs and bonds that enable and motivate men to do great things, to render great sacrifices, and, above all, to dare “to resist in isolation the efforts of public power” (DAI 2.9, 300). Belief in individual greatness dies as men recognize the individual impotence that attends equality (DAII 2.13, 513). As Mansfield and Winthrop write, “The [democratic] social state in its completion is really an asocial state of sovereign individuals, each of them capable, according to the democratic dogma, of running his own life—while in truth, as one in a mass, powerless to do so” (2000, xlv). In short, democracy shows men they are weak and holds them apart (DAII 2.2, 483; DAII 1.7, 426). Tocqueville's fear is that a collection of isolated and impotent individuals will not be able to resist—and may even invite—the inauguration of a democratic despotism.         "
"8","Despite its leveling tendencies and in light of what he perceives as its inevitable, providential rise, Tocqueville reservedly affirms democracy for its greater justice, its mildness, and its ability to increase general well‐being and diminish general suffering (DAI 2.6, 235; DAII 2.8, 502–3; DAII 4.8). Democracy will be entirely without greatness, however, if it ends in despotism. The problem, then, is how to give people a taste for liberty and teach them the art of being free (DAII 3.26, 634). With Tocqueville's exhortations come admonitions:            "
"9","One cannot say it too often: There is nothing more prolific in marvels than the art of being free; but there is nothing harder than the apprenticeship of freedom. It is not the same with despotism. Despotism presents itself as the mender of all ills suffered. (DAI 2.6, 229)               "
"10","The “key to almost the whole work,” Tocqueville informs his reader, is to be found in the Americans’ point of departure—the ideas that birthed and formed the nation. Distinctive of America's origin is the alliance the Americans forged between the spirit of freedom and the spirit of religion (DAI 1.2, especially 43; DAII 1.1–3). Central to Democracy in America is Tocqueville's effort to show how the Americans have preserved the basic ideas that foster and guide their use of liberty. Strikingly, he emphasizes the understanding of liberty embodied in and supported by the alliance of religion and freedom. He quotes Cotton Mather:            "
"11","Nor would I have you mistake the point of your own liberty. There is a liberty of corrupt nature, which is affected both by men and beasts, to do what they list; and this liberty is inconsistent with authority, impatient of all restraint; by this liberty, Sumus Omnes Deteriores [we are all inferior]; 'tis the grand enemy of truth and peace, and all the ordinances of God are bent against it. But there is a civil, a moral, a federal liberty, which is the proper end and object of authority; it is a liberty for that only which is just and good; for this liberty you are to stand with the hazard of your very lives. (DAI 1.2, 42)               "
"12","In Tocqueville's analysis, the Americans have maintained a free democracy because religion enables them to use their political liberty, while preventing doctrines of equality from demolishing the moral order that gives meaning to human life. The alliance between the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom, the “key to almost the whole work,” compels closer examination of Tocqueville's view of human nature."
"13","Tocqueville's understanding of human nature is most clearly revealed in his analysis of religion's role in democracy. Most of his treatment of religion addresses its direct and indirect influence on politics. Indeed, he famously identifies religion as the “first of [the Americans’] political institutions” (DAI 2.9, 280). At times, however, Tocqueville speaks specifically of the soul. My purpose in this section is to introduce Tocqueville's understanding of human beings as religious, as well as political and familial, beings, and then to examine his account of the influence of equality of conditions on men's thought and action. Incidentally, my focus on the transcendent element of his philosophical anthropology is not intended to neglect the other essential dimensions of human experience, but to amplify one that is easily misunderstood or altogether overlooked.         "
"14","Two brief but revealing treatments come to the same conclusion: The human soul contains an ineradicable desire for the infinite and immortal. In these passages, Tocqueville speaks of the natural inclinations of the soul, revealing the understanding of human nature that guides his diagnosis of democracy's ambivalent potential and his prescription of remedies that strengthen and legitimate liberty."
"15","In the first passage, Tocqueville wonders at the prevalence of religion unattached to political power in America. His remarks illuminate the desires and conflict that mark the human heart. He writes, “The short space of sixty years will never confine the whole imagination of man; the incomplete joys of this world will never suffice for his heart” (DAI 2.9, 283). Distinctive among creatures, man finds this world inadequate to his longings: He is peculiarly not at home. He hungers for something more, and that hunger introduces a strange striving. “Alone among all the beings, man shows a natural disgust for existence and an immense desire to exist: he scorns life and fears nothingness” (DAI 2.9, 284). Such reflections “constantly drive his soul toward contemplation of another world, and it is religion that guides it there.” As principal support to the rising of the soul, religion is “as natural to the human heart as hope itself.”         "
"16","Many inquirers into human affairs before Tocqueville, and down to our day, expected a natural decline of religion. The secularization thesis identifies unbelief as the fruit of freedom and enlightenment. Contrast this theory with Tocqueville's own understanding of the human tension toward the divine: “Only by a kind of aberration of the intellect and with the aid of a sort of moral violence exercised on their own nature do men stray from religious beliefs; an invincible inclination leads them back to them” (DAI 2.9, 284). The difference is striking. Against those who identify religion with minds yet to be freed and enlightened, Tocqueville argues that, when not yoked to political power, religion “finds its force in the sentiments, instincts, and passions that one sees reproduced in the same manner in all periods of history” (DAI 2.9, 284–85). Appealing to experience against the prominent theory of secularization, he identifies the desire for transcendence as a “constituent principle of human nature.”         "
"17","A second of Tocqueville's reflections on the nature of the soul comes in the context of his analysis of the Americans’ anxious, agitated pursuit of material well‐being, in Volume II (DAII 2.12; see also DAI 2.9, 270). Observing occasional breakthroughs of “exalted spiritualism” among a people bound closely to earth by daily necessities and desires, Tocqueville says simply, “this should not surprise us” (DAII 2.12, 510). The reason:            "
"18","Man did not give himself the taste for the infinite and the love of what is immortal. These sublime instincts are not born of a caprice of his will: they have their immovable foundation in his nature; they exist despite his efforts. He can hinder and deform them, but not destroy them. (DAII 2.12, 510)               "
"19","Once again, Tocqueville focuses on man's inability to be satisfied with the finite and ephemeral. To say that humans cannot be satisfied with finite and ephemeral goods is not to say they will not try. They will, and all the more as equality of conditions increases. For most it is not a question of grand goals, but            "
"20","about adding a few toises to one's fields, planting an orchard, enlarging a residence, making life easier and more comfortable at each instant, preventing inconvenience, and satisfying the least needs without effort and almost without cost. (DAII 2.11, 509)               "
"21","Equality fosters a “tenacious, exclusive, universal, but contained passion” for things that, in their place, are necessary and good. The danger is that “in striving to seize [these things], one loses sight of the more precious goods that make the glory and greatness of the human species” (DAII 2.11, 509).         "
"22","Thus, Tocqueville describes the “avidity with which the American throws himself on the immense prey that fortune offers him … a passion stronger than love of life spurs him constantly” (DAI 2.9, 270). Eventually, however, even the most vigorous efforts to ignore the soul fail. Restless and busy, he cannot escape the desire for the infinite instilled in his nature, nor can he satisfy it with anything less.            "
"23","The soul has needs that must be satisfied; and whatever care one takes to distract it from itself, it soon becomes bored, restive, and agitated amidst the enjoyment of the senses. (DAII 2.12, 510)               "
"24","In one scholar's summary of Tocqueville's thought: “The heart animated by love of comfort is always uncomfortable, seeking what material enjoyment cannot provide” (Lawler 1995, 227). Conversely, Tocqueville warns that men can hinder and deform unshakable transcendent longings.         "
"25","Taken together, these passages illuminate Tocqueville's understanding of humans as creatures made for the infinite and immortal. He highlights the givenness and the ineradicable nature of man's most fundamental features. The key point here is that, in Tocqueville's account, men's most diligent attempts to satisfy their desire for the infinite with mundane diversions fail because the tension toward the divine is native to the human heart."
"26","Tocqueville writes that “opinions men receive on trust without [discussion]” are essential because they facilitate action (DAII 1.2, 407). These opinions, or dogmas, impose a “salutary servitude that permits [the man who accepts them] to make good use of his freedom” (DAII 1.2, 408). As creatures incapable of merely mundane satisfaction, made to love God and one another, humans depend on basic ideas about God and themselves to guide their thought and actions. “There is almost no human action, however particular one supposes it, that does not arise from a very general idea that men have conceived of God, of his relations with the human race, of the nature of their souls, and of their duties toward those like them” (DAII 1.5, 417).            "
"27","Human beings’ ideas about God, human nature, and their responsibilities to God and to one another orient the purpose and conduct of their lives. As Tocqueville emphasizes: “One cannot keep these ideas from being the common source from which all the rest flow” (DAII 1.5, 417). These ideas are answers to the most important human questions: Who am I? What is my purpose? To whom do I belong? What are my obligations, and to whom? What are my rights, and by whom? The answers persons give to these questions (consciously and otherwise) give meaning, purpose, and limits to their daily pursuits.            "
"28","Critically, for Tocqueville, religion helps orient human thought and action because the inclination toward the divine is fundamental to the human heart. Men need answers to primordial questions, which in turn guide their actions. “Some fixed ideas about God and human nature are indispensable to the daily practice of their lives” (DAII 1.5, 417).            "
"29","Conversely, without settled ideas on fundamental questions, men quickly find themselves disoriented: “doubt about these first points would deliver all their actions to chance and condemn them to a sort of disorder and impotence” (DAII 1.5, 417). Without basic ideas, they are “soon frightened at the aspect of this limitless independence” (DAII 1.5, 418). When humans perceive a disordered intellectual world lacking meaning, they experience exhausting frustration. “This perpetual agitation of all things makes them restive and fatigues them.”            "
"30","Tocqueville addresses the specific challenges to human self‐understanding and action that democracy introduces. He shows that equality's spread initiates a rival set of basic answers to the fundamental human questions."
"31","Tocqueville's analysis of democracy's effect on men's intellectual habits plays a key part in his political science, and therefore also in this examination of the relationship between religion and democracy. He contends that equalization changes the way people think, which in turn shapes their understanding of the world and their place in it. “Men who live in centuries of equality have much curiosity and little leisure; their life is so practical, so complicated, so agitated, so active that little time remains to them for thinking” (DAII 1.3, 414). The democratic philosophical method is Cartesian by default: “Each individual therefore withdraws narrowly into himself and claims to judge the world from there” (DAII 1.1, 404). The demands of democratic times discourage speculative studies. Tradition and custom fall into disuse and disregard (DAII 1.1, 403). A man perceives his own mind as sufficient for all relevant understanding and judgments. However, within limits, the independence of thought democracy promotes spurs a healthy initiative, especially in combination with the commercial spirit. I refrain from describing that healthy initiative here, in order to focus instead on democracy's other effects on habits of heart and mind.         "
"32","First, at a general level, equality's pressures on habits of heart and mind influence religious belief. As mentioned above, Tocqueville rejects the modernization syndrome, in which the historical forces of progress shatter belief in favor of freedom and enlightenment. He ridicules proponents of the “altogether simple” secularization thesis for their ideological failure to adequately describe reality (DAI 2.9, 282). In contrast, he maintains that belief is natural to the human heart. He explains contemporary challenges to religious belief accordingly, addressing the causes of disbelief in Europe, as well as democracy's general strain on belief.         "
"33","He says that, of all ideas, basic ideas about God, man, and their relationship encounter special difficulty. To complete his thought, quoted earlier only in part: “Some fixed ideas about God and human nature are indispensable to the daily practice of their lives, and that practice keeps them from being able to acquire them” (DAII 1.5, 417–18). While religious ideas are the most necessary (because they answer to the deepest human longings), they are also the most difficult to fix entirely on one's own. They are essential to orienting one's life and daily choices, but are preempted by the pace of one's daily pursuits.         "
"34","Second, and more specifically, Tocqueville also perceives subtler tendencies where the democratic mind is not moderated by religious thought. In brief, the pretense of intellectual autonomy has critical consequences for religious belief. The habits of mind that attend it narrow a man's field of perception and prejudice him against what he cannot explain. One consequence, in Tocqueville's analysis, is a grave blindness:            "
"35","[Men] easily conclude that everything in the world is explicable and that nothing exceeds the bounds of intelligence."
"36","Thus they willingly deny what they cannot comprehend: that gives them little faith in the extraordinary and an almost invincible distaste for the supernatural. (DAII 1.1, 404)               "
"37","Another consequence is that men are disinclined to “place the intellectual authority to which they submit outside of and above humanity” (DAII 1.1, 408). Rather, they expect to find “the sources of truth” in “themselves or in those like themselves.” The result is that men have “an instinctive incredulity about the supernatural and a very high and often much exaggerated idea of human reason” (DAII 1.2, 408).         "
"38","To summarize, democracy forms a radical intellectual individualism that redefines relevance according to the narrow sphere of individual competence, makes men suspicious of the supernatural and resistant to intellectual authority above humanity, and hinders their ability to gain basic ideas about God and themselves. Thus, for Tocqueville, there is a tension between (on the one hand) the essential nature of human beings as creatures instilled with love of the infinite and immortal, and (on the other) the habits of heart and mind, born of equality, that impede belief. As democracy forms men's minds, that tension is manifest in discord between the human heart and the democratic mind."
"39","Democracy shapes men's habits and passions, but neither satisfies nor erases their fundamental longings. Rather, democracy forms a set of basic ideas about God, human nature, and men's duties to God and one another that rivals the shared ideas that characterize the religious mind as Tocqueville portrays it (DAII 1.1; see also DAI 2.9, 278). The result is incoherence between the human heart and the democratic mind—and the symptoms are radical individualism and restive materialism.         "
"40","I want to address why, in light of Tocqueville's philosophical anthropology and his analysis of radical individualism and restive materialism, religion matters for individuals. Key to Tocqueville's political science is his insight that individualism and materialism are symptoms. Individualism and materialism are not democracy's essential features, but consequences of a set of beliefs about God and human nature instigated by equality's effects on men's intellectual and moral habits. These symptoms and their source, democracy's pressure toward unbelief, undermine what Tocqueville understands as the genuine greatness of human being. For Tocqueville, our greatness resides in human individuality and the journey that marks each person. He marvels at human beings as creatures in search of themselves.               "
"41","I have no need to travel through the heaven and earth to discover a marvelous object full of contrasts, of infinite greatness and pettiness, of profound obscurities and singular clarity, capable of giving birth at once to pity [or, piety], admiration, scorn, and terror. I have only to consider myself: man comes from nothing, traverses times, and is going to disappear forever into the bosom of God. One sees him only for a moment wandering, lost, between the limits of the two abysses. (DAII 1.17, 462)                  "
"42","Our nature is partly but incompletely revealed to us (DAII 1.17, 462–63).            "
"43","Two passages, in particular, show Tocqueville rallying to protect and bolster what makes us great. In the first, we see Tocqueville defend individuality as essential to human greatness. He contends that citizens in democracy are tempted toward the idea of unity—and for it, easily relinquish the idea of individuality (DAII 1.7, 426). Accordingly, Tocqueville fears that pantheism, which denies distinction between Creator and creation, and joins all into an undistinguished whole, will hold “secret charms for men who live in democracy” (DAII 1.7, 426). What is significant about Tocqueville's discussion of pantheism is his conclusion that it threatens human greatness because it blinds us to our nature as unique creatures with the capacity to be in relationship with the divine and one another. Thus, Tocqueville begs “all who remain enamored of the genuine greatness of man [to] unite and do combat against [pantheism]” (DAII 1.7, 426). For Tocqueville, human individuality—in contrast to both radical individualism and pantheism—is worth the fight; to abandon it is to relinquish an essential piece of who we are.            "
"44","In the second passage, we find Tocqueville's political science reminding us that the equalization of conditions exaggerates certain ideas and actions that tempt us to forget that we as humans possess, in addition to individuality and the capacity for relationship, a desire for the infinite and immortal. Because he thinks that we are indeed instilled with a desire for the divine, he addresses, in a key chapter, religion's ability to remind us of who we really are (DAII 1.15, 517–21).            "
"45","Here Tocqueville argues that the danger in democracy is that citizens tend to improve everything but degrade themselves (DAII 1.15, 518–19). Humans in democratic times must take extra care because the potential to degrade oneself enters in the process of the ordinary and legitimate pursuit of material well‐being. Democratic citizens love material pleasure. With this in mind, Tocqueville says that to concede to the doctrine of materialism—the idea that we are merely brutes with no soul—erodes the boundaries within humans who can enjoy material pleasure without being destroyed by it. Together, the pursuit of material pleasure and the doctrine of materialism, which insists that we are soulless brutes, make a “fatal circle” (DAII 1.15, 519).            "
"46","In response, Tocqueville urges: See the peril! Restrain yourself! “All honest and enlightened men,” he writes, should “apply themselves relentlessly to raising up souls and keeping them turned toward Heaven” (DAII 1.15, 519). His aim is to preserve and strengthen “a taste for the infinite, a sentiment of greatness, and a love of immaterial pleasures.”            "
"47","Elsewhere, Tocqueville writes that, as a matter of prudence, religion should attempt only to tame—not to eradicate—the taste for material well‐being (DAII 1.5, 422).               "
"48","The principal business is to purify, regulate, and restrain the too ardent and too exclusive taste for well‐being that men in times of equality feel; but I believe that they would be wrong to try to subdue it entirely and to destroy it. They will not succeed in turning men away from love of wealth; but they can still persuade them to enrich themselves only by honest means. (DAII 1.5, 422)                  "
"49","In essence, even in democratic times, humans must be allowed to live as the creatures they are—between heaven and earth—and, indeed, to bring heaven to bear on earth, the level of men's most immediate needs and desires. As Peter Lawler comments:               "
"50","It would be very unrealistic and unjust for the Americans to turn every day into Sunday—into a day of rest and contemplation…. But without a day of rest they might become so restless, disoriented, and perhaps finally deranged, that they would willingly end up surrendering their miserable and unreasonable liberty. (2010, 115)"
"51","As he considers religion's role in democracy, Tocqueville recommends that enlightened citizens fight the advance of disbelief and aim instead at the restoration of faith (DAII 2.15, 519; DAII 2.17, 524). Whatever hope he has is rooted in his conviction that faith is natural to the heart of man.            "
"52","Tocqueville sees human beings as religious creatures by nature, and they remain religious creatures, no matter how well or poorly their new democratic political environs satisfy their longing for the divine. A picture may help. Human beings are made to drink water. They may thirst or be satisfied, but they will not stop needing water. Tocqueville's concern is that democracy, untutored, presents certain impediments to fulfilling the human inclination toward the infinite and immortal. For Tocqueville, the question is not whether human beings will remain religious creatures, but how to make democracy work in light of the fact that human beings are and will remain religious creatures. Ultimately, Tocqueville says that, even in democracy, the human heart can remember both its mundane and its highest sources of satisfaction. He writes,               "
"53","One must therefore not believe that, at any time and in whatever political condition, the passion for material enjoyment and the opinions attached to it can be enough for a whole people. The human heart is vaster than one supposes; it can at once contain a taste for the goods of earth and a love of those of Heaven; sometimes it seems to give itself over to one of the two; but it is never long before it thinks of the other. (DAII 2.15, 520)                  "
"54","This matters for politics because, as Tocqueville puts it, “despotism can do without faith, but freedom cannot” (DAI 2.9, 282). Only when humans experience their liberty as meaningful, only when they live as more than merely biological beings, will they want to preserve that liberty.            "
"55","In short, and critically, for Tocqueville, religion matters for politics because it helps sustain individuality. Religion supports individuality, as he understands it, by holding humans in the tension that makes us human—the meeting of the material and the spiritual, the mundane and the transcendent."
"56","That said, it is important to note that much of Tocqueville's commentary on religion addresses the particular and peculiar expressions of Christianity he finds in America. The other main focus of Tocqueville's commentary on religion yields his grand remarks on the religious dimensions of human nature—the primary focus of this study. He does not provide a great deal in between. That is, Tocqueville does not speak to the merits of various forms or sects of religion."
"57","Now I turn to consider why, in light of Tocqueville's philosophical anthropology and his analysis of radical individualism and restive materialism, religion matters for the political community. Democracy tends to level religious and political authority. In so doing, it inflicts an existentially exhausting and disorienting “limitless independence.” The consequences, as mentioned above, include withdrawal from public life and the unbounded pursuit of wealth. For Tocqueville, democracy compels the majority to industry and entices many to frenetic enterprise; Sundays remind them that their lives are meant for more than material improvement (DAII 1.19, 468).            "
"58","Tocqueville cares about virtue and its fate in the democratic age. Throughout Democracy in America, the attentive reader finds signs of Tocqueville's concern with virtue and, more specifically, its prospects in the face of equality's spread. For example, he laments the rupture of the laws of moral analogy, and the disregard into which virtue and the light of conscience have fallen (DA, Introduction, 11, 12). For Tocqueville, the laws of moral analogy are bonds between belief and action that structure human conduct and, in turn, political society. In his native France, democracy erodes the beliefs that move humans to try, individually and socially, to be free and just. Later, he explicitly warns that individualism will destroy public virtues and eventually all virtues (DAII 2.2). He says the century of “blind devotion” (or “explicit self‐sacrifice”)5 and “instinctive virtues is already fleeing far away from us” (DAII 2.8, 503). He is especially attentive to commercial society's tendency to recast vices as virtues and virtues as vices (DAI 2.9, 272; DAII 3.18). Notably, he identifies virtue as the most beautiful of general ideas (DAI 2.6, 227). These are not incidental comments, but signposts of Tocqueville's main purpose. They point to the central task of his political science. “Such statements,” as Kraynak argues, “make abundantly clear that the demise of virtue is Tocqueville's primary concern in judging the moral character of modern democracy” (1987, 1183).            "
"59","To move beyond Tocqueville's signposts to the heart of his political science, I want to focus briefly on one of his most compelling themes: virtue as the foundation of a free political society. In the Introduction to Democracy in America, Tocqueville argues that the abolition of aristocracy also abolished the “usage and mores [that] had established boundaries for tyranny and had founded a sort of right in the very midst of force” (DA, Introduction, 8). The key point is that this “sort of right” facilitated obedience without subservience or degradation. This is significant, according to Tocqueville, because “it is not the use of power or the habit of obedience that depraves men, but the use of power that they consider illegitimate, and obedience to a power they regard as usurped and oppressive” (DA, Introduction, 8). Yet legitimate authority, based on an agreed standard of right, is essential for shared order and action. Without common ideas, men are bound by nothing but interests—or, when those fail, force (DAI 2.6, 227; DAII 1.1, 406).            "
"60","One essential task for Tocqueville's political science, then, is to find grounds for legitimating authority in a democratic age. A promising example appears in the American republics he judges to have the most integrity. He points to talents and virtues in New England, where, he argues, morality and religion gave birth to education and freedom (DAI 2.5, 191).6 In turn, and with the support of settled maxims and habits, education and freedom foster order that is neither grating nor humiliating. Specifically, the achievements of democracy in New England rest on the fact that men “have been habituated to respect intellectual and moral superiorities and to submit to them without displeasure” (DAI 2.5, 191). Thus, morality and religion support moderate democracy, in which citizens resist distinctions of wealth or birth, yet recognize and elevate quality of mind and character. The alliance of freedom and religion that structures meaningful order for individuals has broader implications for political order, to which I now turn.            "
"61","Mores, and the beliefs that support them, matter to Tocqueville because he is keenly sensitive to the fact that equality remakes not only the political world, but the moral world as well. In this section, I examine the inherently limitless character of equality's claims."
"62","Though he acknowledges the benefits of equality, Tocqueville is quick to expose those who abuse power in the name of the people. “According to some among us,” he explains, government in the name of the people is “the only one in which one must recognize the right to do everything, and which can scorn what men have respected up to the present, from the highest laws of morality to the vulgar rules of common sense” (DAI 2.10, 380). His irony recalls the Jacobin terror:            "
"63","Until our time, it had been thought that despotism was odious, whatever its forms were. But in our day it has been discovered that there are legitimate tyrannies and holy injustices in the world, provided that one exercises them in the name of the people. (DAI 2.10, 380)               "
"64","Abuses of power in the name of the people capitalize on the inherent lack of limits that marks equality elevated as the standard of right. Hancock highlights Tocqueville's critical grasp on the matter:"
"65","            "
"66","“Equality” is a bottomless concept because it implies the endless subversion of traditional human meanings with reference to which it might be judged and moderated. Tocqueville's fundamental insight is that “equality” and “absolute power” are strict correlates; either may be considered the attempted externalization of the other. It is because neither can really be externalized or concretized in a world of moral and social meaning that the rupture of the “laws of moral analogy” must be understood in the most radical sense. (2006, 56)7"
"67","Absolute, unlimited equality denies moral meaning in human affairs.8 In response, Tocqueville's political science seeks to bolster virtue as a bulwark against despotism in an age that incessantly vaunts equality as the novel, sole, and sufficient standard of right. Critically, he (and the Americans he observes) retains the tension between the political order that is, and a standard of justice to which that order and its citizens remain accountable. In his evaluation, it is the alliance of religion and liberty that allows the Americans to benefit from both the equality that energizes their politics and the moral order that structures their thought and action. In this way, religion preserves moral meaning, and so moderates for Americans the incoherence born of democracy's limitless independence.         "
"68","The alliance of the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom is a radical antidote to base and limitless equality. Two of Tocqueville's examples demonstrate how this alliance works in American political life."
"69","Its first application is to the idea of rights. Tocqueville argues that without agreement on license and tyranny—the bounds of legitimate authority—there is no means of introducing common interest but force and fear, which are decidedly inappropriate to a “union of rational and intelligent beings” (DAI 2.6, 227). The concept the Americans use to make this distinction is the idea of rights, which Tocqueville says is “nothing other than the idea of virtue introduced into the political world” (DAI 2.6, 227). Once again, it is virtue that legitimates authority, enabling cooperation that is free of degradation.            "
"70","It is with the idea of rights that men have defined what license and tyranny are. Enlightened by it, each could show himself independent without arrogance and submissive without baseness. The man who obeys violence bows and demeans himself; but when he submits to the right to command that he recognizes in someone like him, he raises himself in a way above the very one who commands him. (DAI 2.6, 227)               "
"71","The Americans’ achievement, in Tocqueville's observation, was to have maintained a language and practice that allowed them to acknowledge virtue in the political world (DAI 2.6, 227).9"
"72","The second example of the advantage of the alliance between religion and freedom comes in Tocqueville's description of the doctrine of popular sovereignty. Early in Volume I, he introduces the thought driving American life:            "
"73","In all that concerns the duties of citizens among themselves, he [the American] has therefore become a subject. In all that regards only himself, he has remained master: he is free and owes an account of his actions only to God. Hence this maxim: that the individual is the best as well as the only judge of his particular interest, and that society has the right to direct his actions only when it feels itself injured by his deed or when it needs to demand his cooperation. (DAI 1.5, 62)               "
"74","Undergirding the American maxim is the understanding that men are responsible for what concerns them, and owe account for their actions only to God. “Extended to the entirety of the nation,” this maxim “becomes the dogma of the sovereignty of the people” (DAI 2.10, 381). To Tocqueville's mind, the decisive difference is this: Whereas in Europe the claim of popular sovereignty starts from the assertion of human authority, in America it is the “last link in the chain of opinions”—a chain that begins with the recognition that Providence has given to each individual the capacity to “direct himself” with regard to his interests (DAI 2.10, 381).         "
"75","Importantly, in Tocqueville's account, it is religion that fosters the beliefs and practices that enable Americans to agree on standards of justice in the political world. Religion matters, for him, not merely as a political expedient, but because it makes ordered liberty possible by legitimating authority, thus enabling citizens to accept authority without degrading themselves."
"76","Still, Tocqueville is concerned with the precarious hold of the moral notions that ground rights and limit power (DAI 2.6, 228). In this connection, he points to the democratic rhetoric that allows Americans to acknowledge their undemocratic affections and obligations in practice without betraying the democratic rhetoric of egalitarianism and self‐sufficiency (DAII 2.8; see also Lawler 1995). Explains Lawler: “In the American context, the doctrine of interest rightly understood allows allegedly self‐sufficient, always calculating individuals to explain why they sometimes act as if they loved one another and God” (1995, 235). Tocqueville affirms the democratic rhetoric that facilitates these undemocratic, natural human inclinations. Let the Americans honor their political philosophy more than themselves; only do not let them allow themselves to comply fully with their shrunken rhetoric. For Tocqueville reminds us, as Lawler observes, “that what [the Americans] say may gradually transform who they are” (2010, 110). We hear once again Tocqueville's admonition: The desire to love God and others instilled in human nature can be hindered and deformed, but not destroyed.         "
"77","The purpose of Tocqueville's political science is not to enshrine a particular historical moment or social situation. If it were, his work would offer little of lasting worth for our own quests for order in history. Yet, in both example and substance, Tocqueville's political science can continue to provoke and illuminate our own. His aim is to move men to tutor democracy in order to secure the advantages democracy at its best offers, and to protect the human inclinations democracy at its worst denies and deforms. In Democracy in America, he does not merely suggest remedies; he shows why they matter. His philosophical anthropology sees democracy's recognition of equality before God and the law as the essence of democracy's natural advantage. At the same time, it shows the consequences of democracy's tendency to foster disbelief.         "
"78","Irreligion instigates political and personal consequences. For political society, it weakens moral meaning and shrinks grounds for agreement—the starting point of political community. For persons, it imposes an unbearable, limitless independence. The radical individualism and restive materialism that follow are not abstract concepts. They are apt diagnoses of widespread symptoms manifest in the lives of those whose functional faith is bounded by the tenets of a (more than human) penchant for personal autonomy and a (less than human) lust for material satisfaction."
"79","Tocqueville's portrayal of the alliance between the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom sheds light on contemporary concerns about exacerbated symptoms of social atomism and restless materialism. I have argued that an analysis content merely to observe Tocqueville's attention to the political utility of religion neglects an essential insight of his political science. For Tocqueville, religion matters to politics, most fundamentally, because it answers the soul's desire for the infinite and immortal, and, moreover, because it provides foundations critical for personal and political justice in the democratic social state."
"80","In short, for Tocqueville, the alliance of religion and freedom is the antidote to democracy's disorienting effects on men's hearts and minds. It is not merely a political expedient. Rather, it is effective because it directs Americans to the satisfaction of the most fundamental desires instilled in their nature. Moreover, and as a corollary, the alliance of freedom and religion fosters moral integrity. Thus, religion counters the symptoms of materialism and individualism by addressing the moral disintegration that is the common source of those ailments."
"81","In the end, Tocqueville views democracy as a more just state of affairs because it does away with aristocracy's political fictions and instead affirms fundamental human equality. For him, the task is to welcome the spread of equality without losing ourselves to the radical individualism and restive materialism it spawns. For him, it is religion that helps persons and political communities to see themselves as creatures existing between the mundane and the divine. In Tocqueville's analysis, religion matters because it guides humans in how to use their liberty, helps them to perceive moral meaning, and teaches them about the significance of their own individuality."
"82","Students of politics today need not shelve Tocqueville as obsolete: He remains a friendly and unsparing critic. In the 1978 Harvard Commencement Address, a like‐minded critic, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, gives a candid report on the symptoms Tocqueville diagnoses in Democracy in America. Like Tocqueville, Solzhenitsyn contends that the flattening of the moral world marks human relations with haste and superficiality, and a lack of mercy and sacrifice. Like Tocqueville, he warns that the deepening condition of materialism and individualism is untenable. Like Tocqueville, Solzhenitsyn urges a moderate remedy: “the voluntary nursing in ourselves of freely accepted and serene self‐restraint” (2006, 575). His call, too, points beyond human authority: “Is it true that man is above everything? Is there no Superior Spirit above him?” In the end, both Solzhenitsyn and Tocqueville's darkest fears and strongest hopes for the future rise from their shared observation that “man did not give himself the taste for the infinite and the love of what is immortal.”         "
