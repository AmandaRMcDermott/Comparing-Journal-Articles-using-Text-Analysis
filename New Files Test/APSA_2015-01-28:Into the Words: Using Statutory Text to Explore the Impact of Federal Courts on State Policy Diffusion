"1","The states have long been described as laboratories of democracy where innovative public policies can be developed. For decades, scholars have worked toward developing a better understanding of the forces that shape this process. In 1969, Walker posited that states have an important influence on each other in the process of policy innovation, resulting in a pattern of proliferation of policies across states. Since then, many scholars have presented evidence that diffusion plays a role in state policy innovation (Berry and Berry 1990; Bouché and Volden 2011; Gray 1973; Mooney and Lee 1995). Recent scholarly work has increasingly investigated the underlying mechanisms that drive observed patterns of policy diffusion, including learning, competition, socialization, and coercion (Karch 2007b; Pacheco 2012; Shipan and Volden 2008).         "
"2","The idea that political subdivisions within a federal system of government act as policy laboratories suggests that the effects of implementing different kinds of policies provide valuable information for future policy decisions in other jurisdictions (Karch 2007a; Volden 2006). While scholars have frequently opined that states learn from each other's experiences, only a handful of recent studies factor policy success or failure into empirical analysis (Gilardi and Füglister 2008; Gilardi, Füglister, and Luyet 2009; Neumayer and Plümper 2012; Volden 2006). This element is key to distinguishing between simple imitation of a policy and actual learning about which policies are successful. The mere adoption of a policy in one state may be enough to generate imitation by other states. But if states are learning from one another's experience, the influence a policy has on subsequent adoptions will depend on the extent of its success. The federal government can play a role in such a learning process by providing important signals about a particular type of policy success.         "
"3","Various branches of the federal government can exert influence over state policymaking (Berry and Berry 1990; Karch 2007b; Roh and Haider‐Markel 2003). The primary source of this influence is the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. No state has the power to pass laws that contravene either the federal constitution or federal statutes or treaties. Both the power and scope of the federal government have expanded over the course of the nation's history, with the result that today states face considerable federal restrictions on the policies they are permitted to implement (Welch and Thompson 1980, 717). Federal courts are frequently the mechanism through which the supremacy of federal law is established.         "
"4","Courts' influence is not limited to the direct impact of a court decision after a policy has been enacted, challenged, and litigated (Langer and Brace 2005, 317). There is evidence that courts play a role at the stage of policy consideration and adoption; state policy makers take into account the possibility that a policy might be struck down. Patton (2007) found evidence that policies the U.S. Supreme Court had indicated were on shaky constitutional ground were less likely to be adopted than policies the Court had not addressed at all or had ruled constitutional. Another study found evidence that state policy makers rely on knowledge about the ideological makeup of their state supreme court and the likelihood a statute will be challenged in that forum to inform their decision about whether or not to adopt a particular policy (Langer and Brace 2005, 318). I build on these studies by looking beyond courts of last resort and the binary adoption decision.         "
"5","There are good reasons why state policy makers pay attention to court rulings before enacting new laws. Judicial opinions provide important information. This is especially true in the case of federal appellate courts because each has binding authority over multiple states. Such multijurisdictional actors have the ability to provide information precisely because they include multiple jurisdictions, so a ruling in one jurisdiction is applicable in other jurisdictions as well (Karch 2012; Strebel 2011; Welch and Thompson 1980). Rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court are applicable in all states, and published opinions issued by circuit courts are binding for all future cases in that circuit (Klein 2002; Lee 2003; Lindquist and Cross 2005). After a policy has been adopted by another state in the same circuit, resulting litigation will substantially reduce the uncertainty for subsequent adopters. Moreover, published opinions from a different circuit, while not legally binding, do constitute persuasive legal authorities. As a result, litigation regarding a policy in a state from a different circuit provides some information as well.         "
"6","The information federal court rulings provide about the success (or failure) of preexisting state policies is likely to influence not only other states' decisions about whether to adopt a policy, but also how laws are drafted. I expand on previous work by analyzing the courts' impact on both of these facets of the policymaking process. Several scholars have discussed the importance of looking beyond the binary decision to adopt a policy and incorporating an evaluation of its content as well (Boehmke 2009a; Karch 2007b; Shipan and Volden 2012). Simply adopting the same kind of policy enacted in another state does not guarantee that the policy is exactly the same (Karch 2007b). Nor does it necessarily indicate that the previous adopter, , was the source of the idea or information behind the current adopter's, 's, decision (Volden, Ting, and Carpenter 2008).         "
"7","The extent to which a new law's precise phrasing overlaps with the text of an existing law provides important insight. An idea can be expressed in a nearly infinite number of ways. The appearance of the same phrases in two policies is not likely to happen coincidentally. Therefore, I use the term  to refer to such overlap in the text of two statutes. Measuring the borrowed language in a new policy helps trace the flow of ideas across different jurisdictions. This mapping is not necessarily direct. For example, when the same phrasing is present in two or more preexisting statutes, a new law using that language may have been directly influenced by a subset of those policies. Although borrowed text (like most measures) does not perfectly capture the underlying concept, studying the extent of borrowed text provides a substantial improvement over simply observing the fact of policy adoption. When a state adopts a new policy currently in place in other states, we can learn quite a bit by observing how much of the text is borrowed from each preexisting law.         "
"8","Federal courts act as gatekeepers for the many state policies that have federal constitutional implications. Whether state legislators' motivations for enacting a policy are substantive (i.e., they truly believe the policy is what is best for the state) or political (i.e., they believe supporting the policy will help get them reelected), neither goal is served very effectively if the policy is struck down by the courts. Enacting policies takes considerable expenditure of limited political resources (Boushey 2010). Therefore, legislators have an incentive to avoid adopting policies that are at a high risk of being struck down.1 In order to husband scarce resources, state policy makers are motivated to anticipate how the courts might treat a potential policy (Langer and Brace 2005, 319).         "
"9","When considering whether to invest political capital in a particular policy area, legislators call on a wide variety of information to evaluate the benefits and costs involved. Rulings handed down by federal courts on similar laws from other states provide key information about the level of risk that a policy will be declared unconstitutional. Holding all else equal, as this risk factor increases, the utility of adopting2 a policy will decrease. Even if the court strikes down only a part or particular application of a law, that is a concrete indication that policy makers' intentions and efforts were thwarted. Conversely, when a federal court upholds a statute as constitutional, the risk factor associated with adopting that type of law is considerably lower, which means adopting the policy would provide greater utility. Although constitutionality does not guarantee ultimate policy success, it does reflect a necessary precursor of such success. Put differently, constitutionality is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for policy success. As a result, I expect court rulings regarding an existing  to influence the probability that  will adopt the same type of policy in a given year t.3                        "
"10","Adoption Hypothesis:  will be more (less) likely to adopt a policy previously adopted by  when that policy has been declared constitutional (unconstitutional) by a federal appellate court.               "
"11","Once  decides to adopt a type of policy currently in place in , federal court treatments are likely to influence the text of that law as well. After deciding to adopt a policy, legislators can influence the policy's risk factor by the way they draft the language. Utilizing specific phrasing from policies upheld by federal courts or deliberately avoiding text that has been declared unconstitutional can decrease the risk that the new policy will be struck down. Since decreasing this risk factor increases policy makers' utility, I expect policy language to reflect such choices.            "
"12","Borrowing Hypothesis: When  adopts a new law already in place in ,  will borrow a larger (smaller) percentage of the text of  when that policy has been declared constitutional (unconstitutional) by a federal appellate court.               "
"13","The precedential value of information provided by court rulings varies depending on the identity of the federal court issuing the ruling. The doctrine of stare decisis differentiates between court rulings that are binding as a matter of law and those that are simply persuasive (Aldisert 1989; Schauer 2008). Judges are obligated to follow the former, but they have discretion to disregard the latter (Aldisert 1989). Court opinions that constitute binding precedent in 's jurisdiction carry greater weight because they provide higher‐quality information about the risk a future policy would be struck down. Supreme Court rulings are most informative since they are binding and supreme authority in all 50 states. If  and  are both in the same federal circuit, circuit court rulings are quite informative because they are binding (Cross 2003; Klein 2002).4 However, a ruling on a policy from a state in a different circuit would not be binding in  if  chose to adopt such a policy. Circuit court opinions carry only persuasive authority in their sister circuits (Cross 2003; Klein 2002). Consequently, such rulings are less informative than those from within the same circuit because they have less precedential value. Court rulings that provide the most information should have the greatest impact on both adoption and formation of policy.            "
"14","Precedential Value Hypothesis: The size of the hypothesized effects set forth in the Adoption Hypothesis and Borrowing Hypothesis will be largest for Supreme Court rulings, smaller for circuit rulings from the same circuit, and smallest for circuit rulings from a different circuit.               "
"15","Testing the foregoing hypotheses requires an issue that generates substantial litigation at both the circuit and Supreme Court level. Furthermore, measuring borrowed text dictates the use of individual subtopics with text that is discrete and readily identifiable (preferably composing a single statutory section or subsection). Abortion regulation meets both requirements particularly well.5 Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, abortion regulations are clearly restricted by constitutional law. A variety of legal issues related to state abortion policies are decided by federal circuit courts and either never make it to the Supreme Court or take some time getting there. The result is sufficient variability in the data to test my hypotheses.6 I use data from the following six types of legislation: (1) requirement of parental consent for a minor's abortion, (2) requirement of parental notice for a minor's abortion, (3) imposition of a waiting period between informed consent and an abortion procedure, (4) restrictions on postviability abortions, (5) ban of partial‐birth abortions, and (6) restrictions on the use of public funding for abortions. For each subtopic, I collected every applicable statute in all 50 states from 1973 to 2010. Table 1 provides the number of each type of policy enacted during the relevant time frame.         "
"16","I use a dyadic approach to examine two aspects of the policy process. The first step is looking at what drives the binary policy adoption decision. Modeling the decision of a state regarding whether to adopt a policy in a given year has been the standard approach to policy diffusion studies since Berry and Berry's watershed 1990 article analyzing the diffusion of state lotteries (Graham, Shipan, and Volden 2013; Jones and Branton 2005; Karch 2007b). In 2006, Volden expanded this approach by incorporating a dyadic method used in the study of international relations to look at pairs of states rather than just the decision of a single state. This groundbreaking approach paved the way to study policy convergence between two states while accounting for features of both states individually and their relationship (see, e.g., Boehmke 2009b; Gilardi 2010; Shipan and Volden 2010; Volden 2006). While I use a different measure of policy convergence, this dyadic framework is fundamental to my research design. My primary theoretical focus is how the success (or failure) of existing policies influences the adoption decision. Consequently, I examine adoption in terms of whether a state chooses to adopt a particular preexisting policy. Structuring the unit of analysis in these dyadic terms allows direct comparison of the decision to adopt a specific policy the courts have declared constitutional (or unconstitutional) with the decision to adopt a policy the courts have not addressed.         "
"17","Specifically, the first stage of the analysis is conducted using a pooled conditional dyadic event history model (Boehmke 2009b; Shipan and Volden 2010). The unit of analysis is the ‐ dyad in year t for subtopic s. There is an observation for every  in year t paired with every  that had a policy from subtopic s in place in year . Such dyads are included for each of the policy subtopics. I use these conditional directed7 dyads because the subject of investigation is how the success of previous legislation influences subsequent policy decisions. Including dyads in which  has not adopted a particular type of policy would speak to the impact of a state's legislative inaction, which is not the focus of this study.8 I pool data across subtopics because the data are too sparse to evaluate each separately. Iteratively excluding each subtopic from the analysis produces similar overall patterns, indicating that no one subtopic is disproportionately driving the results.9 The model also includes fixed effects for the different policy subtopics to address heterogeneity across the somewhat different types of legislation.         "
"18","The second stage of analysis examines how the content of a new policy is influenced by the success of preexisting laws. One of the key limits of diffusion studies to date has been the lack of attention to the content of legislation (Brinks and Coppedge 2006). Scholars have increasingly worked toward finding ways to incorporate more information about the nature of policies into quantitative models. Advances in computational text analysis offer the opportunity for further progress in this vein. WCopyfind is plagiarism software that quantifies the overlap in two documents (Corley 2008; Corley, Collins, and Calvin 2011). I utilize this tool to generate an outcome variable new to diffusion research, the percentage of text in a law adopted by  that is borrowed from a statute previously enacted by . The WCopyfind software provides a free, simple, and user‐friendly way to calculate the percentage of text in one document that is borrowed from another document.10 The researcher can control the precise way borrowing is calculated by changing a few parameters. These include how long a phrase has to be in order to be counted as a match, how many imperfections may be tolerated, and whether to disregard certain features of the text, such as case, numbers, and punctuation.         "
"19","My approach is to use the same parameter choices employed by previous political science research (Corley 2008; Corley, Collins, and Calvin 2011) and check alternative specifications to verify the software settings are not driving the empirical findings. First, I set the software to count all matching phrases at least six words long. Second, I allow up to two imperfections within a section of overlapping text. This allows the software to ignore minor variations due to line breaks or typographical errors. Third, I set the software to ignore case, numbers, and outer punctuation. Consequently, variations in formatting or section numbers in two different laws will not obscure the use of the same textual provisions. In order to check the first parameter choice, I also calculate borrowed text using phrases at least 10 words long and at least 4 words long. For the second choice, I use an alternative specification allowing no imperfections, and finally, I calculate borrowed text without ignoring case, numbers, and outer punctuation. The primary specification of borrowed text and all four alternative specifications generate similar empirical results.         "
"20","In this data set, the average amount of a newly adopted policy, , that is borrowed from  is 5.8%. This quantity ranges as high as 94% and is in double digits for nearly 20% of the data. To provide some context, I also compared the text of the two most common types of abortion policies across subtopic. When partial‐birth abortion policies are compared to parental consent statutes (instead of other partial‐birth laws), the average amount of borrowed text is a mere 0.49%. This indicates that the general incidence of overlapping text in two documents is very low even when the documents are both legislative in nature and even when they both address the same broad issue area.         "
"21","As in the first step of my analysis, I analyze the extent of borrowed text using a pooled dyadic model with subtopic fixed effects. The second stage of analysis includes all dyad‐year observations in which  adopted a policy in year t. Since the outcome variable in the first stage is the binary determination of whether  has taken legislative action on a policy previously adopted by , I use a probit model.11 The outcome in the second stage is the percentage of text in 's new legislation that is borrowed from the text in 's policy, so I use a linear model.12 The structure of these data raises concerns about two types of correlation in the errors that may potentially lead to deflated standard errors.         "
"22","First, a two‐stage decision‐making process sometimes raises the problem of correlated residuals between the two stages biasing the estimates at the second stage (Heckman 1979). This can occur when the analysis at the second stage is conditional upon the value of the outcome variable in the first stage. Such is the case here. The second step of analyzing borrowed text can only take place when  has chosen to adopt a new law. Estimation of the two stages in a Heckman selection model reveals a statistically significant ρ, but the correlation in the errors between the two stages of the model creates only a minuscule amount of bias. The results are virtually indistinguishable from those produced by separate probit and linear regression models. In light of this similarity, I choose to discuss the simpler models. The results of the Heckman model are available in Table A3 in the appendix.         "
"23","A second potential source of correlated errors is the dyadic structure of the data, which introduces complex interdependencies. For example, rather than 's decision to adopt a given policy in a given year appearing in the data only once (as it would in a monadic analysis), it appears each time it is paired with an existing statute.13 This repetition generates correlation in the residuals, which, if left unattended, would likely lead to deflated standard errors. In order to address this concern, I follow the example of other scholars and estimate robust standard errors clustered on  and year t (Bouchè and Volden 2011; Makse and Volden 2011).14 This technique relaxes the assumption of independence for a state legislature's decisions both within and across each policy subtopic in a given year.         "
"24","While the dyadic approach contains potential pitfalls for the unwary analyst, once these concerns are addressed, the advantages are considerable. For the second stage of analysis, the dyadic approach is necessary because the outcome variable is intrinsically dyadic—the percentage of  that is borrowed from . Investigating how 's success impacts the extent of such borrowing requires using the dyad as the unit of analysis. Additionally, this modeling approach facilitates controlling for important characteristics of both  and  as well as their relationship. For example, since federal circuits are organized into groups of contiguous states, evaluating the differing impact of same circuit and different circuit rulings would be suspect without controlling for whether the two states in the dyad are neighbors. This advantage of a dyadic model also applies to the adoption analysis. While adoption can be modeled in monadic terms, doing so eliminates meaningful variation in the data. Using ‐year as the unit of analysis requires grouping all court treatments for a policy type together and takes away the ability to control for nuances of individual policies. Finally, focusing on the same (dyadic) unit of analysis for both adoption and borrowing contributes to theoretical consistency and clarity. For the sake of comparison, Table A4 in the appendix contains the results of an analogous monadic adoption model.15"
"25","The key explanatory variables are the same for both the adoption and borrowed text models. I develop a factor variable for the treatment of  by each type of court—the Supreme Court, the same circuit as , and a different circuit from . The baseline value for each court treatment variable is that the court has not ruled on the constitutionality of . The other possible values for each type of court are “Unconstitutional” and “Constitutional,” reflecting the rulings of the relevant court within the relevant time frame.16 The treatment of  in year t is classified based on court rulings between the year  adopted the law and year .17 The value of these court treatment variables will vary for each existing  over time. When a policy is litigated, there is a period of time between its enactment and any appellate court rulings. During those years, all the court treatment variables will take on the baseline value of no treatment. The court treatment variables shed light on how a change in 's level of success (as evidenced by a court ruling on its constitutionality) influences the adoption and formation of policies in other states.         "
"26","In addition to testing the effect of federal court treatments, I control for a variety of other factors. The dyadic structure of the data makes it important to control for the number of previously adopted statutes that  has available to consider. Since I model both the initial adoption of policies and subsequent amendments, I include a control for whether  had a particular type of policy in existence in year . When Existing Statute equals 1, any legislation adopted by  in year t amends or replaces another policy. The role of direct democracy may also play a role (Boehmke 2005). Consequently, in the adoption model, I control for whether the initiative process is available in , and in the borrowed text model, I control for whether  was, in fact, adopted by means of an initiative.18"
"27","There is extensive literature addressing the impact of the internal characteristics of a state on its policy innovation. Consequently, I include controls for a number of characteristics of  (in year t), including legislative professionalism (Squire 2007), whether the state government is under Republican control,19 whether it is an election year, the state population (in millions), and its per capita income (in tens of thousands).20 In addition to these variables, I also include analogous controls for , with the exception of the election year variable. The dyadic nature of the models makes it possible to also account for the impact of important features of  and the relationship between  and . One well‐recognized factor in policy diffusion is whether two states are neighbors (Berry and Berry 1990; Gray 1973; Mooney and Lee 1995; Walker 1969). I also control for the similarity between  and  in terms of government ideology. Government ID Difference captures the absolute value of the difference between the ideology scores for the state governments of  and  (Berry et al. 1998, 2010).21 Two characteristics of a preexisting law that may affect its influence are its age and whether it was adopted through an initiative process rather than normal legislation. I control for these variables in both stages of the analysis.         "
"28","A few additional controls are only relevant to one stage of the analysis or the other. Two factors primarily related to adoption are whether a state legislature is in session in a given year and prevailing public opinion on the issue of abortion. Some state legislatures only hold regular sessions on a biennial basis. The variable In Session equals 1 for years in which  has a regular session and 0 otherwise.22 In order to control for public opinion on the issue of abortion in both  and , I utilize the measure compiled by Pacheco (2014) to reflect the proportion of a state's population that favors legalized abortion. Since this measure is quite stable over time, I extrapolate values for missing state‐years by using the chronologically nearest available value for a given state.         "
"29","The borrowed text model also contains a few additional controls. When existing laws contain overlapping text, a new policy may borrow phrasing that appears in more than one source. I address this issue by controlling for the probability of such joint overlap. The variable, Other Borrowed Text, is the sum of all text a new law has borrowed from preexisting statutes other than .23 When it equals 0, there is no overlap in borrowing, and when it is greater than 100, there must be some overlap in borrowed text.24 Overall, higher values of this variable indicate the increasing probability of joint overlap and should be positively correlated with borrowing text from .25 The measurement of the percentage of borrowed text may also be dependent on the length of both  and . Consequently, I include controls for the natural log of the word count of both documents in the second stage of the analysis.         "
"30","Table 2 shows a summary of the outcome variables and the federal court treatment variables. There are a total of 117,551 dyads in the first‐stage model.  chose to adopt the relevant policy type in 1.6% of those cases. In those 1,906 cases, the average amount of the text in the adopted policy that is borrowed from  is nearly 6%. Table 2 shows the number of cases with each type of court treatment from each type of court for the full data set used in the first stage of the model. The most common situation is for there to be no relevant court case, which occurs 82% of the time. It is also important to bear in mind that the thousands of instances where there is a relevant court opinion are all derived from a relatively small corpus of a few dozen cases.         "
"31","My analysis begins with an examination of the decision to adopt a policy already enacted in another state. The results of the adoption model are presented in Figure 1. Rulings of unconstitutionality from all three types of courts have a negative impact on the probability of adoption, but the effect is statistically significant26 only when the ruling was handed down by the Supreme Court. Furthermore, rulings of constitutionality from both the Supreme Court and a different circuit significantly increase the probability of adoption. These findings are consistent with the Adoption Hypothesis, but the nonsignificant effects for three of the six types of court rulings (including an unexpectedly negative coefficient for same‐circuit constitutional rulings) qualify the overall support for the hypothesis.         "

"34","Figure 2 provides predicted probabilities to illustrate the substantive size of the court treatment effects.27 Comparing the effect of constitutional rulings from the Supreme Court and from a different circuit reveals that the Supreme Court effect is larger, as anticipated by the Precedential Value Hypothesis, but the difference is negligible and not statistically significant.28 Nevertheless, both kinds of rulings have an important influence on the decision to adopt. The baseline probability of adoption when there are no relevant federal rulings (and all other variables are held at their median or mode) is .015. This increases to .019 with a constitutional ruling by the Supreme Court and .018 with a constitutional ruling by a different circuit. The probability of adoption decreases to .011 with a ruling of unconstitutionality by the Supreme Court. Each of these predicted probabilities is significantly different from the predicted probability of adoption when there is no relevant court treatment. Moreover, in light of the low baseline rate of adoption, these changes are substantial; for Supreme Court rulings, they represent a 27% relative increase and 28% relative decrease in the probability of adoption.         "

All other variables are held at their median or mode as applicable. A gray line indicates that the effect size is not significantly different from no treatment.                     "
"37","Results from the control variables shed light on other factors that influence states' decisions about whether to adopt legislation. Not surprisingly, a state legislature being in session significantly increases the probability of adoption. As the overall number of previous adopters increases, adoption becomes less likely. States with a Republican‐controlled government, a lower level of public support for legalized abortion, and lower per capita income are more likely to adopt a policy regulating abortion. Adoption is also more likely when the previous adopter, , has a higher per capita income, but adoption is less likely when  has a higher level of legislative professionalism.         "
"38","When  chooses to adopt legislation in the same policy area as , there is variation in the level of similarity between those two policies. Consequently, I go beyond the adoption decision to model the extent to which the text in 's policy is borrowed from the text in 's preexisting policy. The results of this model are set forth in Figure 3. Rulings of constitutionality from all three types of courts significantly increase the percentage of a new law that is borrowed from . The converse is only true for unconstitutional rulings from a different circuit, which lead to a decreased amount of borrowed text.29 These results provide substantial, but not unqualified, support for the Borrowing Hypothesis. In particular, there is good reason to conclude that court rulings declaring an existing policy constitutional do have the expected impact on policy formation.30"

"41","Figure 4 shows the predicted percentage of borrowed text for different types of court treatment. When there are no court rulings and all control variables are held at their median or mode (as applicable), the model predicts that about 3.4% of  is borrowed from . A constitutional ruling from each type of court increases the predicted usage of borrowed text by a statistically significant and substantial amount, but the relative size of the effects does not conform to the expectations in the Precedential Value Hypothesis. Instead of Supreme Court rulings having the biggest effect, the effect of same‐circuit rulings is largest by a wide margin. Such rulings increase the predicted amount of borrowed text all the way to 21.1%, whereas Supreme Court and different‐circuit rulings increase overall borrowing to 7.3% and 6.2%, respectively. Although the predictions for same‐circuit rulings are estimated somewhat imprecisely due to scarcity of data, the difference in predicted outcomes for same‐circuit constitutional rulings and those from the Supreme Court is statistically significant. This suggests that state legislators pay particular attention to the expressed opinions of their own circuit when drafting policies.         "

"44","Number of Previous Adopters is negative and statistically significant, which is consistent with the expectation that a wider range of options decreases the chance of borrowing from each individual law. Adopters are more likely to borrow from previous adopters whose state government is not controlled by the Republican Party. This likely reflects the reality that language forged in the fires of partisan compromise and negotiation ultimately has wider appeal. The wealth of , the age of , and the length of both policies also have an impact on the extent of borrowing. States with a higher per capita income have a greater tendency to borrow statutory text. Legislators are less likely to borrow text from older policies. When 's policy is longer, a smaller percentage of it is composed of borrowed text, but when  is longer, a larger percentage of  is borrowed from . Finally, Other Borrowed Text is positive and significant, which indicates that the more text  has borrowed from other previous adopters, the more text it is likely to borrow from . This pattern is likely driven by overlapping text among  and other previously adopted statutes (precisely the issue this variable is designed to address).         "
"45","Although the empirical results presented here do not fully support all proffered hypotheses, this study provides evidence that federal courts can influence the diffusion of state policies when those policies have federal constitutional implications. More importantly, it sheds light on the nuances of that influence. Looking at the decision to adopt separately from how laws are drafted reveals variation in the way federal courts influence these two aspects of state policymaking. Both the type and source of court rulings have different effects on these two decisions. First, cases ruling a previous statute constitutional and unconstitutional do not necessarily have a symmetrical impact. Second, the circuit courts and the Supreme Court appear to have differing influence on the two decisions."
"46","In both models, there is more compelling evidence that constitutional rulings have an impact than that unconstitutional rulings influence policy adoption and formation. For the adoption decision, court rulings that  is unconstitutional have a statistically significant effect only when issued by the Supreme Court, whereas only unconstitutional rulings from a different circuit show evidence of influencing the extent of borrowed text in a newly adopted policy. Moreover, even this latter significant effect is smaller than its constitutional counterpart. That is, a different circuit ruling that a law is constitutional increases the predicted amount of borrowed text by 2.71%, whereas an unconstitutional ruling from the same source decreases the predicted borrowed text by only 1.37%. A constitutional ruling has nearly twice the impact of an unconstitutional ruling. Overall, these findings suggest that court rulings affirming a law's constitutionality carry greater informational value for subsequent state lawmakers looking to take advantage of their peers' experience.         "
"47","Not surprisingly, there is broader evidence that the Supreme Court influences the decision to adopt a policy more than circuit courts. Supreme Court rulings are the most salient and informative court opinions. They have the broadest and most authoritative relevance as a matter of legal doctrine, and it is also possible that state legislators are more likely to be aware of Supreme Court opinions. Consequently, it makes sense that both constitutional and unconstitutional rulings from the Supreme Court have a substantial impact on the probability of adoption, resulting in a relative change of around 27% in both cases. The comparative effect sizes of constitutional rulings in the borrowed text model, however, are counterintuitive. As expected, constitutional rulings from a different circuit have the smallest effect on the amount of borrowed text. Yet the impact of a constitutional ruling from the same circuit is significantly larger than that from a Supreme Court ruling. These results suggest that there may not be a discrepancy between the knowledge of relevant circuit law and Supreme Court opinions. Perhaps the greater likelihood a new law will face scrutiny from the relevant circuit court (compared to the low probability of Supreme Court review) may explain policy makers' greater proclivity for incorporating text from policies that have already been declared constitutional by their own circuit."
"48","The findings from this study reveal a pattern of policy learning rather than mere imitation. State legislators do not simply rely on the fact of adoption in other jurisdictions, but critically consider a policy's success and factor that into formulating policy. Measuring borrowed text is not just important to study decisions about policy content separately from policy adoption. This measure is central to the findings here because it gets directly at the underlying theoretical mechanism of policy learning. The use of a different amount of borrowed text conditional on federal court treatment indicates that state legislators pay attention to information provided by federal courts and act based on that information. The borrowed text itself constitutes an overt manifestation of the learning process. While increased adoption of statutes that have been declared constitutional (and vice versa) certainly suggests that legislators pay attention to the fate of laws adopted by other states, such evidence is largely circumstantial. The existence of virtually identical phrasing in two laws provides concrete evidence that a state was likely both aware of, and influenced by, a particular preexisting policy. Identical phrasing appearing in separate documents might also occur when both sources obtain the text from some third source (e.g., an interest group or a different preexisting policy), but the link between court treatments and the amount of borrowed text cannot be explained by two states independently obtaining the statutory language from an outside source. Instead, the results support the conclusion that state policy makers pay attention to the results of important federal litigation and take that information into account when formulating policy."
"49","The insights provided here about the role of federal courts in state policy diffusion are made possible by utilizing and extending two important trends in the field of policy diffusion research. The first is Volden's application of dyadic analysis to the study of policy diffusion. The ability to model features of a previously adopted policy opens up a host of interesting theoretical questions. The influence of federal court treatment on how a policy affects other states' legislative choices is only one of many such questions. The second trend this article builds on is the burgeoning attention to policy content. Quantifying borrowed text provides a way the rich data available in political texts can be leveraged to address important questions, such as the role of learning in policy diffusion. Traditionally, the difficulty and high cost of quantitatively analyzing the content of legislation has created a substantial barrier. The increasing availability of computational methods of text analysis is changing the landscape. The method employed here of calculating the extent of borrowed text combined with dyadic analysis is a viable and vibrant new option for continued research exploring the mechanisms driving policy diffusion."
