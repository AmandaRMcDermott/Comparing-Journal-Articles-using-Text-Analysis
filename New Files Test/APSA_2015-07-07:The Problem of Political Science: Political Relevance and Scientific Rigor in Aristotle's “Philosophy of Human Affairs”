"1","In the midst of the preface to the Ethics (and perhaps it is the preface to the Politics, too, insofar as the latter lacks one of its own), Aristotle begins the first of three methodological statements that he delivers in the course of its first book. The first part of the preface was apparently devoted to “what we propose to do” (1095a11–13, 1094a1–b11). There—just after reminding us of the teleological character of human life and of the at least somewhat clear rank‐order of human ends (1094a1–18; Salkever 1990, 65)—Aristotle drew attention, first, to our longing for some end or goal, complete in itself, on whose account we wish for everything else and, second, to our need for knowledge of this (unqualifiedly) “good” or (merely) “best” thing (1094a18–24). And when he asked, next, what in the world it is and to which of the sciences or powers it belongs to attain it (1094a25–26), an answer suggested itself to him at once. The attainment of this end could seem (dokei), he said, to belong to the most authoritative and architectonic science or power, and this appears (phainetai), in turn, to be the political one (1094a26–28). For “the political power (or science)” (politikē)—or its apparent end, the good of the political community—legislates what one should and should not do as well as what one should and should not learn (1094a28–b10). And this is something that “we [all] see” it do (1094b2). In addition to this, insofar as the good of the political community appears to be (phainetai) “nobler and more divine” than every other good, including even the good of the individual, it appears to have a worthy claim to legislate as it does (1094b7–10). Human beings therefore belong, to begin with, to political communities that act as if they themselves constitute or otherwise determine the peak from which derives the order of rank of human ends and that appear, in addition to this, (to those who belong to them) to do so with some right. We do not come to the question of the order, of the peak or ordering principle, of human ends as “blank slates.” Given the political community's legislative activity and its apparent worthiness to carry it out, an answer to the question of “the human good” suggests itself to us at once, as soon as (or before) we (ever) raise it. For this and perhaps also other reasons (cf. 1130b26–29), Aristotle calls his inquiry into the human good “a kind of political science” (politikē) (1094b10–11; Bartlett 2008, 678).         "
"2","Still, as impressive as it may at first appear, the political community's answer to the question of the human good, the factual or hypothetical as opposed to absolute starting‐point of Aristotle's political science (1095b2–3ff.), is not free from difficulties. According to Aristotle's first methodological statement, which occupies the rest of the preface, political science (politikē) takes as its subject matter or it examines “the noble and the just things” (1094b12, 14–15). And yet these things are subject to much disagreement (diaphora) and change (planē) (1094b15–16). As for “the good things,” to which Aristotle turns next, he says they are subject only to change; which means, inasmuch as harm frequently follows from them—so that some are destroyed by their wealth, for example, others by their courage—they are not unqualifiedly good (1094b16–19). And this clarifies the situation of the noble and just things. For by identifying not only wealth, but also courage as a good thing, Aristotle suggests that the noble or just things (such as courage) appear to fall into the more universal class of things that are good but not necessarily noble or just (such as wealth) (cf. 1101b14–15). If they, too, are changeable, they are evidently changeable in the same way as the rest of the class: They are of merely qualified or circumstantial goodness. So the merely circumstantial goodness of good things generally is combined, as we can now see more clearly, in the particular case of noble or just and good things, with the further difficulty that the latter are, regardless of the circumstances, subject to much disagreement as well. And, as a result of these two difficulties, the noble or just and good things—in contrast to the indisputably good, but not noble or just, things—are held to exist “by law” or “by convention” alone and not “by nature” (1094b15–16, cf. 1133a30–31).         "
"3","Aristotle cannot deny the difficulties. The noble or just and good things are indeed both controversial and, so far as their goodness is concerned, changeable. However, for some reason—he does not actually say why—he does not draw from them the terrible conclusion that others, first and foremost the “pre‐Socratic” natural scientists, draw from them: to the effect that the noble or just things are, or are good, by convention alone and not by nature or in truth (Sophistical Refutations 173a7–16; Metaphysics 1069a25, On Generation and Corruption 314a6). He draws instead the more sober conclusion that, owing to these difficulties, speech about the noble or just and good things admits of only so much clarity and precision (1094b11–14, 23–27). To spell this out somewhat, just as we hold the sculptor in marble and the sculptor in bronze to different standards of subtlety, based on the natural limits of the material in which they work, a degree of clarity and precision is to be expected of the mathematician, for instance, whose subject matter is not so problematic, which the political scientist cannot reasonably perhaps hope to attain (1094b12–14, 1141a9–12). And here, in the first half of the methodological statement, Aristotle explicitly intends to answer the now inescapable question of how to carry out, and thus, “how to accept,” the proposed examination given the limited clarity and precision of its subject matter (1095a11–13, 1094b22–23). He says, in the event, that one must be content when it comes to speaking both about and on the basis of the noble or just and good things—which are for their part, as the difficulties that surround them suggest, only “for the most part” true—to indicate the truth only “roughly and in outline”; or, in other words, to draw conclusions that are, like their starting‐points or principles, too, only “for the most part” true (1094b19–22). That said, while the examination must be carried out in this rough‐and‐ready manner (cf. Barnes 1975, 74), surely what Aristotle indicates or concludes in the course of it has to be accepted all the same (1094b22–23). And so in this way—after stating to begin with “what we propose to do” (1094a1–b11), and then turning, in the methodological statement's first half, to the question of “how” or in what manner “what we propose to do” is to be done or accepted (1094b11–23)—Aristotle is finally driven to address the matter of “the listener” (or reader) qualified to accept the examination as it is, “warts and all” (1094b23–1095a11; 1095a11–13).         "
"4","He begins the second half of the methodological statement by observing that, in general, when it comes to accepting the speech of another, it belongs to an educated person at least to seek only so much precision as the “genus” or “nature” of the matter in question admits (1094b23–25). To judge Aristotle's proposed examination competently, rough‐and‐ready as it is, a pre‐scientific awareness or prior knowledge of its subject matter—a knowledge that is brought to the examination rather than conveyed through it—is therefore a must (1094b27–28). The requisite knowledge is acquired through experience of the moral‐political actions (praxeis) pertaining to life (1095a3–4). And it belongs to the listener who has accumulated such knowledge or experience not to be too credulous (1094b25–26), on one hand, or too fastidious or incredulous (1094b26–27), on the other, when it comes to accepting or judging speeches about the noble or just and good things. Instead, on account of his knowledge of the natural limits of “the material,” the experienced listener will be a model of moderation or sobriety in its regard (1099a22–24): His boldness of judgment, checked by his caution, will not degenerate into dogmatism, whereas his caution in judgment, checked by his boldness, will not degenerate into skepticism. He will take the proposed, rough‐and‐ready examination for exactly what it is worth—no more, no less. And for this reason, insofar as experience of moral‐political actions takes time to accumulate, the young are not qualified to listen to political science (politikē) (1095a2–4, but cf. 1094b10–11). Strange as that may sound, does it not follow from the case Aristotle makes for experience that, when it comes to judging noble or just and good things, it will tend to be “all or nothing” with the inexperienced (apeiroi)? Those who lack the experience through which we come to know that political science falls somewhere in‐between rhetoric and mathematics on the spectrum of clarity and precision will tend, as is well known, to one extreme (credulity) or the other (incredulity). Furthermore, Aristotle adds, not only age or experience, but also self‐control (enkrateia) is required of the listener. The cause of this, he rather abruptly declares, is that “the end (telos) (of the proposed examination) is not knowledge (gnōsis) but (moral‐political) action (praxis)” (1095a5–6). And, considered from the point of view of the practical purpose of the work, a listener who is incapable of resisting his passions or of making his longing comply with his reason and then acting accordingly—whether on account of his youth or a defect of his character, it makes no difference—listens pointlessly and unprofitably (1095a4–11).         "
"5","The work is addressed, in sum, to listeners who are both experienced in moral‐political actions and self‐controlled. This much is obvious. It is perhaps less obvious, however, that if experience is required in part to lower the “youthful” demand for mathematically clear and precise knowledge of the noble or just and good things, and if self‐control is required to put the rough‐and‐ready knowledge that is conveyed through Aristotle's examination of these very things into practice, we are left with a question. After all, taken together, the two requirements imply that even unclear and imprecise knowledge of noble or just and good things is sufficient for all practical purposes. And while that may well be, just how unclearly and imprecisely can we know the good for which we long and still be able to act on our knowledge of it (cf. 1094a18–24)? This question's full bearing is best gauged in connection with another, still unanswered question. For Aristotle did not actually say, near the outset of I.3, why the conclusion that was drawn, first and foremost, by the “pre‐Socratic” natural scientists, according to which the noble or just things are, or are good, by convention alone, is invalid. And yet, in order to act on what we know of the noble or just things and good things, surely our knowledge of them has to be at least clear and precise enough to enable us to reject, with good reason, the denial of their natural goodness. Or do we not even have to know clearly and precisely that—that is, why—they are good?"
"6","The preface concluded, Aristotle begins again. He does so by observing that “most people,” at any rate, “pretty much” agree that the name of the highest of all practical goods, or the good at which politics (politikē) aims, is happiness (1095a14–20). But that not exactly unanimous or even unswerving, largely verbal agreement should not blind us to the fact that the content of happiness, what is meant by the name, is subject to dispute (1095a20–26). To say nothing for now of the wise, the refined equate happiness with honor, whereas the (rest of the) many and the vulgar equate it with wealth or, “not unreasonably,” with pleasure (1095a18–23, 1095b22–23, 1095b14–17). At its peak—which is to say, when furnished with the wealth and power necessary to overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of its end's utmost fulfillment—the life devoted to pleasure entails tyrannical rule (1095b21–22, 1096a5–7). The inner core and end of honor, in contrast, is virtue (1095b22–30). What is ultimately at stake in the dispute between the many who equate happiness with pleasure, an end whose means is tyranny, and the few who equate it with honor, a means whose end is virtue, is the question of virtue's (or vice's) link to happiness or the good. The Ethics effectively begins with the fundamental question to which Aristotle drew attention, but left unanswered, in the prefatory material; to wit, are the noble and just things good by convention alone—in which case even or especially tyranny would not be intrinsically bad—or by nature (1094b14–16)? Aristotle's next step, presumably, will be to answer it. To do so, as the reference in this context to Platonism suggests, he would have to make his way to the “cause” (aition) on account of which (noble or just and good) things may be truly said to fall into the class of good things (1095a26–28). And yet, to our surprise, he does no such thing (cf. 1098a33–b3). Instead of showing why nobility and justice are intrinsically good, he digresses; and the digression, in which he delivers his second methodological statement, thus takes the place of an expected effort to answer the fundamental question of whether the noble and just things are, or are good, by nature or by convention alone (1095a30–b14). This substitution is no accident, as we will soon see.         "
"7","According to the second methodological digression, it is no longer enough for the listener to be experienced and self‐controlled; to listen adequately to the noble and just things, “and the political things generally,” he must be well brought up, too (1095b4–6). The reason for this, Aristotle says, is that those who are well brought up already have a grasp of the “what,” or the “that,” or the character of noble or just and good things. And if the “what” is sufficiently apparent, there will be no need to know the “why” or “cause” (1095b6–8, 1098a33–b4). Indeed, is it not so apparent to those of us who are well brought up (tois ethesin ēchthai kalōs) “that,” for example, a steadfast refusal to take from another is right (1120a18–20), whereas adultery, theft, and murder are wrong (1107a8–15) that we do not need to know, in addition to this, “why” a steadfast refusal to take from another is right, whereas adultery, theft, and murder are wrong? Roughly speaking, “we all entertain beliefs about justice that we hold because they seem right, not because we have deduced or inferred them from other beliefs” (Dworkin 1973, 509; Anscombe 1958, 15–17; Rawls 1999, 44). And this much knowledge, knowledge of “what” one should and should not do, or “prudence” (phronēsis), suffices for all practical purposes (cf. 1143b11–13, 21–23; Cooper 1975, 65–66; Reeve 2013, 35). The second methodological statement answers the question, then, also left over from the prefatory material, of the degree to which the end of the Ethics—to be “useful” from the point of view of moral‐political action (1095a4–11, 1098b26–33, 1094a18–24)—requires Aristotle to convey, if only as a means to that end, clear and precise knowledge of the noble or just and good things. It does so, moreover, in such a way as to preempt the necessity of answering the fundamental question whose place it was—not accidentally, as we can now begin to see—allowed to take. For the second methodological statement goes to show, to repeat, that in order to act on their knowledge, the well brought up listeners to whom Aristotle's political science is primarily addressed do not need to know the noble or just and good things so clearly and precisely as to know the “why” or cause of them as such. And what purpose would be served by showing listeners who already know “that” noble and just things are, or are good, by nature, “why” they are? Again, “the end (of the proposed examination) is not knowledge but (moral‐political) action” (1095a5–6).         "
"8","Rather than make the case for virtue over and against its opposite (pleasure or tyranny), then, Aristotle unexpectedly turns to listeners who, because they are well brought up, do not need him to make it.6 And yet he does not naively leave matters at that. It was at any rate in the context of sharply distinguishing between these two ways of carrying out the proposed examination that he took to “preaching to the choir,” as we may call it, in the first place. For prior to making the remarks we have been considering, Aristotle—like Plato before him (cf. Republic 510b4–511c2, 533b6–d4)—drew a distinction between arguments that descend to conclusions “from” (factual or hypothetical) principles (archai), principles whose validity is merely assumed, and arguments that ascend “toward,” so as to establish, (absolute) principles; i.e., “toward” clear and precise knowledge of the cause (1095a30–b1; cf. St. Thomas Aquinas Commentary, Book I, lecture 4, sec. 51–52 = Aquinas 1993, 17). And he then went on to identify the (factual or hypothetical) principle (archē) of political science in particular with the “what” of noble or just and good things (1095b4–8). Now, to say nothing more of the fact that he addresses listeners content to assume the validity of the principle, Aristotle himself has already gone so far as to say, in almost so many words, that his political science proceeds “from,” not “toward,” the noble or just and good things (1094b19–22). Taking for granted the underlying assumptions of his listeners about the human good, then, and setting aside the question of the validity of their assumptions, Aristotle draws conclusions about and on the basis of those assumptions. His political science explicitly “confines itself to an elucidation of moral phenomena as these appear to decent or honest men” (Fortin 1989, 259–60; Burnyeat 1980, 81; Tessitore 1996, 22; Simpson 1992, 509–10). And yet, if he leaves matters at that, his awareness of the more rigorous alternative suggests, this is because he freely chooses to do so.         "
"9","Despite its difficulties, then, the political community's answer to the question of the human good is not only the factual or hypothetical as opposed to absolute starting‐point of Aristotle's political science (1095b2–3ff.); it is also its self‐imposed limit and horizon. Adopting the perspective of experienced, self‐controlled, and well brought up—in a word, decent—people as such, Aristotle articulates and gives expression to that perspective as clearly and precisely as possible. He thereby sharpens (he does not establish) his listeners’ underlying, general assumptions about the human good to the point where, faced with particular circumstances, they are prepared to put them into practice; that is, to know whatever the noble or just thing may be in the situation at hand (Tessitore 1996, 22–23). All right, but still: However true it may be that knowledge of the “why” or cause is unnecessary for moral‐political action, the lines of Hesiod with which Aristotle concludes the digression imply that whoever knows the “why” or cause is superior to a “well‐bred” (esthlos) man who, not knowing it, obeys or listens to another who speaks well about “what” he should and should not do (1095b9–13). And if those who know the “why” are best of all (panaristos), better even than those who merely act well, Aristotle's choice not to ascend “toward” the “why” or cause of the noble or just and good things amounts to a willingness on his part to let his listeners remain in a relatively inferior state. Indeed, as he himself shows by speech as well as by deed, truth or knowledge is to be honored above obedience to those who are dear or one's own (1096a11–17). The second methodological statement, though it resolved the problem posed by the first, poses, in turn, a problem of its own. For what leads Aristotle, in carrying out the inquiry along lines useful from the point of view of moral‐political action, to choose to stray so far from the path that would, by his own lights, be best of all (see Cooper 1975, 71, 65–66; see also Burnyeat 1980, 71–72; Tessitore 1996, 120–21)? Or could it be that the end of the inquiry, moral‐political action, is incompatible for some reason with knowledge of the “why” or cause? In any event, by holding out the possibility of such knowledge Aristotle rouses the suspicion that clear and precise knowledge of political things is possible after all.         "
"10","Halfway through I.7, Aristotle explicitly returns to the question of the content of happiness—the very same question he raised, and in whose wake he digressed, in I.4 (compare 1097b22–24 with 1095a14–30). No progress was made on that front in the meantime, and yet something at least of what is meant by the name “happiness” was brought out. For Aristotle first made clear, in I.5, that what “we divine” of happiness—among other things, that it involves unchangeable (1095b25–26, 1100b2–3) security from destruction, suffering and misfortunes (1095b31–1096a2, 1176a33–35, 1094b18–19)—is not in fact true of any of the “obvious and manifest” (1095a22) good things with which we might be tempted to equate it. The many good things, for example, pleasure, wealth, honor, and even virtue, are not unqualifiedly good; they are of merely changeable or circumstantial goodness (1094b16–19). And in the light of this problem of happiness, Aristotle turned next, in I.6, to critique the solution to it that was offered by Platonism. According to an earlier suggestion, Platonism offered to solve the problem by having recourse to the same thing to which it appeals, also, to settle the dispute as to what things may be truly said to fall into the class of (qualifiedly) good things; namely, “the (separate) idea” (1095a26–28). However, as the most telling criticism Aristotle leveled against Platonism in I.6 would have it, even or rather precisely if there is some unqualifiedly good “idea” separate from the many qualified goods here, comforting though it may be to dream of, it cannot do anything for us, as human beings, who can neither do nor acquire it (1096b31–35, 19–20; 1095b25–26). And if it comes down to this, then, that apparently happiness cannot be both within our reach and unqualifiedly good at once, the critique goes to show more importantly that the problem Platonism offers to solve is an insoluble one; which is as much as to say, it belongs to the very essence of what we divine or believe of happiness. As Aristotle himself finally put it, in I.7, after completing the critique, “we believe” of happiness that it is both an end, complete in itself, on whose account (on the assumption that it is not above and beyond our reach) we wish for and choose everything else (1097a25–b6; 1094a18–22, 1095a14–20) and what alone, in its self‐sufficiency, makes life choiceworthy and in need of nothing (1097b6–16). And owing to the latter belief, the belief that happiness is unqualifiedly good, he could hardly avoid the consequence, which he then drew, that happiness is not numbered among the many good things here, which are for their part qualified; or rather, to put this the other way round, it is separate from them (1097b16–20). Yet is this not to relapse at least in one respect into Platonism (cf. 1095a26–28)? Insofar as it is, Aristotle indicates thereby that to conclude, as he himself does, that “happiness appears to be something complete and self‐sufficient, being the end of all our actions” (1097b20–21) is, in fact, to give expression to a problem; for so much is expected of happiness that no earthly, humanly reachable content is ready at hand to “fit the bill.” And it is here that Aristotle explicitly returns to the question, on which no progress has been made, of the content of happiness (1097b22–24). What has been brought out in the meantime, to be clear, is the “form,” as it were, of happiness or the steep, not to say heavenly, requirements that any content would have to meet to be truly worthy of the name. Aristotle then proceeds, therefore, to develop his own suggestion as to the content of happiness (1097b22–1098a20) in the shadow of the general doubts such steep requirements must arouse about the capacity of any content whatsoever to meet them. “The human good,” he famously suggests, “is an activity of soul in accord with virtue” (1098a16–17). And it is this suggestion of his—less for the light it sheds on the content of happiness, in keeping with the general doubts already aroused on that score, than for the lack of light it sheds on it—which occasions Aristotle's third and final methodological statement.         "
"11","The suggestion is no sooner made than Aristotle acknowledges that, beautiful though it may be, it merely amounts to a “sketch” or “rough outline” of the good; a sketch which, as such, contains one or more lacunae (1098a20–26). But if the suggestion is an example of Aristotle indicating the truth only “roughly and in outline” (compare 1094b19–21 with 1098a20–22), as he put it earlier, what in particular did it fail to disclose or account for precisely? To begin with, no argument was made as to why, or by virtue of what link, “an activity of soul in accord with virtue” puts an end to all our striving and satisfies our every need or constitutes an unqualifiedly complete and self‐sufficient happiness; on the contrary, it was merely asserted that it does.7 And yet, to say nothing more of the general doubts already aroused on that score (they are the focus of the rest of book one: I.8–12), Aristotle himself flatly denied, in I.5, that even the activity connected with virtue is capable of doing this (1095b31–1096a2). Besides this, and to make matters worse, his suggestion that “the human good is an activity of soul in accord with virtue” was in itself so vague or general as to be almost completely devoid of meaning. The root of the difficulty was that by “virtue” Aristotle evidently meant that which enables one to do well the naturally human activity (1097b24–25 and 1098a12–15; 1139a15–17); his failure to specify what exactly that natural activity was (cf. 1102a5–6) had the effect, therefore, of leaving the character of the virtue, or virtues (1098a17–18), dependent on it in question, too (cf. 1098b30–31, 1099b25–26).8 To be sure, in the course of making his suggestion as to the content of happiness, he further prepared the ground for the distinction, which he would eventually draw, and moreover, which the work as a whole is built around, between intellectual and moral virtue (compare 1098a3–7 with 1102b28–1103a15). The fact remains, however, that Aristotle refused to go any further than that. He refused in particular to say clearly and precisely whether the virtue he had in mind in connection with the activity that constitutes happiness and the human good was of the one kind or the other. Striking proof of this is supplied readily enough by the fact that he had to admit that his own suggestion was (so vague or general as to be) “in harmony with” what is said about happiness by the wise, on one hand, as well as the refined or the well reputed, on the other (1098b16–31)—the two parties to the dispute concerning which life, the philosophic or the moral‐political one, is best (Politics 1324a25–32, cf. 1095a20–26).9 Aristotle's studied vagueness or generality is indeed eventually removed, as he promised it would be, but only much “later” (1098a20–22): Shortly after resuming the discussion of happiness in the tenth and final book (1176a32–b2ff.), he links the activity that constitutes it with intellectual as opposed to moral virtue (1177a12–19, 1177b1–26; Striker 2006, 131). And that means what particularly occasions Aristotle's third methodological statement is his judicious refusal to disclose at the outset that the (merely) best and “happiest”—which is not to say, the (unqualifiedly) good and happy—life available to needy creatures such as we are is constituted by philosophy (1177a25) or the theoretical activity connected with intellectual virtue (1178a7–8, 1179a31; 1178b33–35, 1177a27–35; contrast 1097b6–21; cf. Tessitore 1996, 9–15).         "
"12","After acknowledging the lacuna or lacunae, Aristotle makes a number of excuses whose relation to one another is, to put it mildly, complicated. He starts, as we saw, by promising to fill them in “later” (1098a20–22). But he then gives the impression that, with time, “everyone” can advance and fully articulate the outline (1098a22–26). And if everyone can—and, as he seems to say, should—fill in the lacuna or lacunae, or if the outline is such that everyone can infer what it does not say from what it does say, why must Aristotle himself fill it in later? Does he not concede by doing so, or by needing to do so, that the lacuna or lacunae cannot be so easily filled in by everyone after all? The complication is sorted out by the fact that Aristotle quietly undercuts the impression he gives here: as the reference to the arts in this context suggests, it does not actually belong to everyone to supply what the outline lacks, but only to experts (1098a24–26). And it is surely hard to imagine everyone inferring from Aristotle's suggestion, vague or general as it was, that the human good consists in theory as opposed, for one, to moral‐political action (Cooper 1975, 146). At the same time, however unequal to the task they may be in his estimation, Aristotle encourages everyone, i.e., non‐experts, to try their hand at it. But to encourage his listeners, whose decency (rather than expertise) is a given, to fill in on their own the suggestion as to the content of happiness is to encourage them to fill it in decently. That is, given their underlying assumptions about the human good, Aristotle could count on them—as the “inclusivist” readings of today's scholars frequently attest (cf. Kraut 1989, 326 n. 17)—to take or mistake his largely meaningless suggestion to mean that (unqualified) happiness consists in doing the actions connected with moral virtue. And so in all but explicitly postponing the disclosure of moral virtue's inferiority to intellectual virtue (1096a4–5 and 1098a20–22), Aristotle refused to obtrude at the outset a perspective so different from that of his listeners, listeners whose own perspective he even tried to appear at the same time, to them at least, to express. Very well, but why?         "
"13","The problem posed by the second methodological statement has merely been recast, at the outset of the third, in starker terms. Beyond choosing to stray so far from the path that would, by his own lights, be best of all, why does Aristotle also allow the kind of (intellectual) virtue which is a condition or result of taking that path to be apparently eclipsed by the relatively inferior (moral) virtue of his listeners? To resolve the problem, Aristotle calls upon us in the first place to remember what he had said previously, in the first methodological statement, about political science's limited clarity and precision (1098a26). Precisely if we do so, however, we are bound to be struck by what happens next. In the first methodological statement, Aristotle had traced the limitation in question back to the subject matter itself. Now, though ostensibly repeating what had been said then, he slips in the following, totally new and contradictory explanation: that it is “the inquiry,” instead, which accounts for this (1098a26–29). Carpenters and geometers seek “the right” (angle) differently; that is to say, whereas the former seek only so much precision as is “useful” for their work, the latter, whose end is the contemplation of the truth, seek what (sort) it is (1098a29–32). And “in the same way,” inasmuch as it is a kind of political science, the end of Aristotle's inquiry is not the contemplation of the truth, but rather to be useful from the point of view of moral‐political action (1098a32). To spell this out somewhat, just as we hold the carpenter and the geometer to different standards of subtlety, based on their different ends, a degree of clarity and precision is to be expected of the political scientist whose end is truth or knowledge, specifically, about “the right,” which the political scientist whose end is to be useful from the point of view of moral‐political action has no need to attain (1098a32–33). The “repetition” of the first methodological statement thus deviates from the statement itself in the direction of the second methodological statement, which also traced the inquiry's limited clarity and precision back to the fact that only so much knowledge is needed for practice (1095b6–7). In doing so, finally, it confirms our suspicion—roused above all by the possibility Aristotle held out of knowledge of the “why” or cause, but also by the reference just made to the arts or experts, and by a remarkable use of the term nature (1094b25)—that clear and precise knowledge of political things is possible after all.         "
"14","Aristotle's “repetition” or modification (1098a29–33) of what he had said about clarity and precision in the first methodological statement is followed, in the second place, by a similar or similarly modified “repetition” of the second statement (1098a33–b8). The first “repetition” went to show that while precision about political things may be possible, it has no bearing on practice. If, in the same way as mathematically precise knowledge is superfluous for a carpenter, only so much knowledge is required for moral‐political action, the “repetition” of the second methodological statement, like the second statement itself, initially goes to show just how much is required. To begin with, Aristotle discourages us from demanding what he had formerly called the “why” or, as he now calls it, the “cause.” And he suggests, instead, that when it comes to the noble or just and good things one must be content to indicate beautifully the “what,” that is, the factual or hypothetical (as opposed to absolute) starting‐point or principle of political science (1098a33–b3). He thereby reaffirms, albeit in somewhat less technical language, his choice not to ascend “toward” clear and precise knowledge of the starting‐point or principle; i.e., “toward” the “why” or cause. As he puts it here, because the starting‐point or principle has weight relative to its consequences, presumably, as to how to act in particular circumstances, he chooses to define it beautifully (rather than precisely) and, so far as the question of its validity is concerned, to leave matters at that (1098b5–7). The inquiry places the greatest emphasis on the factual or hypothetical (as opposed to absolute) starting‐point, the greatest part—still, it is only a part—of the matter as a whole (1098b7–8). So far, so good. But does it do so because what remains of the whole, what is precisely true rather than useful, is superfluous to practice, as Aristotle had suggested in the “repetition” of the first methodological statement as well as in the second methodological statement? Or is clear and precise knowledge not only superfluous to moral‐political action, but also, as it gradually begins to appear, incompatible with it?"
"15","The “repetition” of the second methodological statement deviates from the statement itself in the direction of the first methodological statement just as the “repetition” of the first methodological statement deviated in the direction of the second. To say that we do not need to know the “why” so long as the “what” is sufficiently apparent, as Aristotle did in the second methodological statement, is not yet to discourage us from demanding it, as he does in “repeating” it here (compare 1098a33–b1 with 1095b6–7). And the latter, stronger statement is connected with the fact that according to what Aristotle says here a sufficiently firm grasp of the principle or the “what” is not acquired through teaching or learning; decent people do not deduce “what” they should and should not do, scientifically or philosophically, from some other principle. To the contrary, the “what” alone becomes apparent, if and when it does, through a course of habituation to which human nature is somehow, sometimes receptive (1098b3–4, 1103a14–16ff., 1105a26–b5). And, if this is how the principle has “naturally come into being” (pephuka), this is also, he says, how the inquiry must go in search of it; which is as much as to say, to come to see the noble or just and good things scientifically or philosophically, in the light of their “why” or cause, is to cease to see them as they naturally come to sight (1098b4–5). For the noble or just and good things are, or are held to be, choiceworthy for their own sake (1105a28–33, 1176b6–9; compare 1140b16–20, 1144a31–36 with 1139b1–4, 1140b6–7, and 1144a13–22; Collins 2006, 93; Cooper 1975, 77–78, 105, 114; Lear 2006, 116–17; Tessitore 1996, 22–23). As we noted in passing, however, what Aristotle formerly called the “why,” he now calls the “cause.” And were it not for this seemingly unremarkable shift in terms, the fundamental question of whether there truly is a cause to know—and hence, whether the perspective of decent people as such, which implicitly or explicitly denies that there is, is valid in the final analysis—would perhaps have been left entirely open. As things stand, however, Aristotle indicates that even if they do not and cannot know “why” they do what they do, decent people do noble or just and good things for the sake of something, some “cause,” apart from the actions themselves (1101b35–1102a4).10 Thus, since truth or knowledge of the cause is not only superfluous to, but also, in the final analysis, incompatible with moral virtue, as it naturally comes to sight, Aristotle could hardly avoid discouraging his listeners from demanding such clarity and precision about political things as is, by his own lights, possessed by those who are best of all. The purpose of the work is, after all, a practical one.         "
"16","The problem that was posed by the second methodological statement and then recast, at the outset of the third, in starker terms has been resolved. Aristotle allows intellectual virtue to be apparently eclipsed by moral virtue, while in fact the former is superior to the latter, for a combination of the two reasons to which each of the two “repetitions” have called our attention. It is neither necessary, on one hand, nor possible, on the other, to affix intellectual to moral virtue: The noble or just and good things, as they naturally come to sight, have a certain independence from that clear and precise knowledge, of the cause, in whose light they lose their luster. And, despite or because of this, Aristotle takes as the self‐imposed limit and horizon of his inquiry the perspective of moral virtue. For the inquiry's end is moral‐political action, as we will soon be told yet again, not truth or knowledge (1103b26–30)."
"17","The three methodological statements delivered in the course of the first book of the Ethics combine, on reflection, to explain and defend what was once rather shockingly referred to as Aristotle's “discovery” of moral (as distinct from intellectual) virtue (Strauss 1964, 25–27). That moral virtue needed to be discovered, that it was not something always somehow known, has its source in the fact that Plato for his part, or his Socrates, spoke of vulgar or political virtue, on one hand, whose end or cause is one's own happiness, and of genuine, philosophic virtue, on the other (Phaedo 68b2–69c3, 82a11ff., Republic 518d9–e3). For he ascended, dialectically or by removing contradictions, from the factual or hypothetical starting‐point, the noble or just and good things, “toward” the absolute one, as we learn especially from the Phaedo (100a3–8 and 101d3–102a1, cf. Republic 510b4–511c2, 533b6–d4), and he then looked down at the former from there (Sebell , chap. 7).11 Moral virtue was not even knowable or intelligible from that standpoint; or, to put this another way, all that was intelligible from that height of the starting‐point or subject matter of political science was one or another version of the Socratic paradox. As for Aristotle, it turns out he was by no means unaware of this more rigorous, Socratic path—to the contrary, by his own lights, it was the superior one—but he freely chose to resist it, at least as much as he could. The fact that what Plato called vulgar or political virtue has a certain independence from genuine, philosophic virtue permitted Aristotle to refuse, so far as he could, to look down at the former from the standpoint of the latter; it permitted him to refuse, therefore, to see the precise truth about the noble and just things or to insist on seeing them as decent people see them (1099a22–24). Aristotle thus discovered moral virtue somewhere in‐between vulgar or political virtue and genuine, philosophic virtue. And it is this discovery of his—based as it was on a generous obfuscation of or resistance to certain exact and paradoxical extremes: that nobody voluntarily does evil, for example, or that virtue is knowledge—that, more than anything else, bears witness to the moderation or sobriety for which Aristotle is so often celebrated.12"
"18","The distinction between moral and intellectual virtue comes at a cost. For, properly understood, it leaves everything “political” in a rather sorry state from the point of view of “science.” But Aristotle let sleeping dogs lie. He conceded as much as he could to those generous, active natures whose noble contempt for rigor (cf. Pangle 2011, 94) would never be overcome by their need for genuine knowledge of “why” they do what they do. To be sure, by walking this fine line between relevance and rigor, Aristotle does not truly solve the problem of political science—rather, he draws attention to its source. Yet this is bound to be of interest to those who would otherwise hope, like Hume, “that politics may be reduced to a science.”         "
