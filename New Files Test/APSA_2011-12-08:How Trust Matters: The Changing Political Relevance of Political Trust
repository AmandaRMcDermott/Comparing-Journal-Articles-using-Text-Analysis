"1","We follow most empirically minded scholars in defining political trust as the ratio of people's evaluation of government performance relative to their normative expectations of how government ought to perform (Coleman 1990; Hetherington 2005; Miller 1974; Stokes 1962). This conceptual definition squares well with findings that suggest changes in trust are most often a function of changes in perceived performance on important problems like the economy (Citrin and Green 1986; Hetherington 1998; Weatherford 1984) and the incidence of scandals (Chanley, Rudolph, and Rahn 2000; Keele 2007), although some longer‐term factors, namely social trust, have contributed to fluctuations in political trust as well (Keele 2007).         "
"2","Since the inner workings of government are opaque to most and since developing constrained belief systems is too taxing for many (e.g., Converse 1964), political trust provides people a useful decision rule. If they trust government—the entity that produces and administers public policies—they ought to be more likely to support more government involvement; if not, then less. The need for trust is particularly important when people are asked to make either material (see Hetherington 2005; Hetherington and Globetti 2002) or ideological (Rudolph 2009; Rudolph and Evans 2005; Rudolph and Popp 2009) sacrifices. When paying costs rather than receiving benefits, people must trust the government to think its programs will produce societal benefits and not waste resources.         "
"3","Although the existing evidence suggests that trust is primarily of value to domestic policy liberals (e.g., Hetherington 2005; but see Rudolph 2009; Rudolph and Popp 2009), we argue that it can benefit foreign policy conservatives as well. This is so, we contend, because the concept of political trust is more contingent than has been considered previously. When people are asked to evaluate the “government in Washington,” they do not necessarily construct an image of the entire government. Instead, they carry in their heads potentially different evaluations of the different parts of government, with the evaluation of “the government in Washington” that they express a function of what parts are salient at a particular point in time. Our thinking tracks Feldman and Zaller's (1992) theory of ambivalent preferences (see also Zaller and Feldman 1992). People can and do have more than one meaningful belief about an issue or an object, with different presentations of it unlocking different evaluations. For example, the same people who express support for racial policies when egalitarian considerations are made salient might express opposition when individualistic ones are (Kellstedt 2000). Similarly, those who think government is trustworthy in the foreign realm but not the domestic (or vice versa) ought to express more or less trust depending on when one or the other domain is salient.         "
"4","Priming, which refers to “changes in the standards that people use to make political evaluations” (Iyengar and Kinder 1987, 63), is central to understanding what parts of government people will be considering when they are asked to answer questions about the government as a whole. In reporting on any of government's many different functions, the media make salient different parts of it. These parts, in turn, become the criteria people employ when they evaluate government. Given its size and reach, people could be primed to evaluate its trustworthiness with a wide range of component departments and agencies in mind, from Health and Human Services to the Social Security Administration to the U.S. Military, just to name a few. Media emphasis on the government's social welfare role ought to make the parts of government people connect to this task salient, whereas emphasis on the government as protector of public safety ought to make very different parts salient, and so forth.         "
"5","The criteria people use to evaluate government affect evaluations. As evidence, three months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, an ABC News poll implemented a survey experiment with one half‐sample receiving the classic trust in government question prefaced by specific reference to “handling national security and the war on terrorism.” The other half‐sample received the classic trust question prefaced by specific reference to “handling social issues like the economy, health care, Social Security, and education.” The first group, which provided 69% trusting responses, was primed to evaluate government in terms of defense and foreign policy while the second group, which provided only 38% trusting responses, was primed to evaluate it in domestic policy terms.2 Both before and after 9/11, a number of other survey houses asked the classic trust question with no preface. Before the attacks, they found trust levels similar to those who received the domestic prime in the ABC News poll, but after the attacks, they found trust levels approximating those who received the national security prime (Hetherington 2005). More generally, when international issues increase in salience, political trust goes up (Hetherington and Rudolph 2008). It is worth noting that the link between the salience of international issues and political trust is not just an aggregate‐level phenomenon. In the 19 studies contained in the NES Cumulative File that included both political trust and the most important problem question, those who identified an international problem expressed 30% more trust in government than those who identified another type of issue. This regularity likely results from the fact that discussion of the military and foreign policy primes people to evaluate government based on its more popular parts.3"
"6","In observing how priming can affect how much trust people express, we are not suggesting that political trust is generally unstable at the individual level. Trust's test‐retest correlation in panel data is as strong as many other symbolic attitudes (Krosnick 1991).4 Viewed from this perspective, trust remains a meaningful attitude, even if measurable circumstances can, at times, prime people to consider a different part of government when they evaluate it. In that sense, trust is not much different from partisanship or ideology, both of which can reflect different considerations (e.g., racial issues, social issues, New Deal issues) at different times (Carmines and Stimson 1989; Stenner 2005).         "
"7","Most important for our purposes, salience also ought to affect the influence trust has on the political system. Since neither the military nor the Defense Department governs policy about race and redistribution, it makes little sense to think that people's political trust derived with foreign policy actors in mind would affect preferences for spending to assist African Americans or government‐run health care. Such trust evaluations should affect preferences in the defense domain. Similarly, when evaluations of government trustworthiness are measured when people have race and redistribution in mind, trust ought to affect preferences for government action in the race domain. In short, trust's effect on preferences in an issue domain ought to be conditional on that domain's salience."
"8","Our reasoning is consistent with the pattern of scholarly findings on trust, although the literature does not acknowledge the pattern. In the late 1980s and 1990s, when race‐targeted and redistributive programs represented the dominant party cleavage (Carmines and Stimson 1989), trust affected preferences in this policy domain (Hetherington and Globetti 2002). When health care reform became salient in 1994, political trust affected preferences in this domain (Hetherington 2005, chap. 7). When Social Security reform became salient, trust affected preferences for privatization (Rudolph and Evans 2005). When the protection of civil liberties became an issue after 9/11, political trust affected whether people were willing to trade civil liberties for enhanced safety and security (Davis and Silver 2004).         "
"9","When national security becomes salient, the effect of trust on defense and foreign policy ought to be particularly strong and wide‐ranging. Since most Americans have neither much personal experience with nor much information about the world abroad (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996), preferences tend to be more uncertain than for other domains (Hurwitz and Peffley 1987; Lavine et al. 1996). Trust is often an important commodity in overcoming uncertainty (see Yamagishi, Cook, and Watabe 1998). Moreover, the relative absence of available independent information about international conditions may widen the range of evaluations and preferences that trust affects in the foreign policy realm. Specifically, the media often cannot present interpretations of international events beyond the government's evaluation because most information is available only from the executive branch (Baker and Oneal 2001; Bennett and Paletz 1994). Hence trust may affect people's evaluations of government performance in foreign affairs in addition to their preferences for future government action. Unlike domestic concerns like the economy, very few Americans have access to information necessary to make an independent assessment of conditions in remote locations like Iraq or Afghanistan. How people judge whether the costs of military intervention there were worth the benefits must be, in part, a function of whether they trust the government to have portrayed conditions truthfully.         "
"10","We first draw on the 2000–2004 National Election Study panel survey to establish that the causal flow in our nexus of variables runs from political trust to foreign policy preferences rather than vice versa. Next, we use the 2004 NES cross‐section to show that political trust affected a wide range of foreign and defense policy preferences when foreign policy concerns were salient. Finally, we use the NES's Cumulative Data File in conjunction with media content analyses to demonstrate the conditional relationship between issue salience and the effect of political trust on defense and racial policy preferences over time."
"11","The 2004 NES includes several foreign policy items that allow us to test our hypotheses. In all, we employ six dependent variables. The survey asked respondents whether the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, respectively, were worth the cost; the degree to which they thought the war in Iraq reduced the threat from terrorism; whether spending on the war on terror ought to be increased, decreased, or kept about the same; and the importance of a strong military. Finally, the NES asked people to place themselves on a 7‐point defense spending scale.5"
"12","Although scholars once suggested that foreign policy attitudes were not firmly held and ostensibly arrived at random (see, e.g., Almond 1950; Converse 1964; Gamson and Modigliani 1966), more recent research suggests that these opinions are reasonably stable over time (Achen 1975) and are structured in predictable ways (Hurwitz and Peffley 1987). Political predispositions and general postures toward force tend to carry the most weight in explaining foreign policy preferences (Berinsky 2009). As political predispositions, we use ideology and partisanship, expecting that conservatives and Republicans will be most supportive during this period. To tap attitudes about force, we use authoritarianism (Altemeyer 1996; Hetherington and Weiler 2009; Merolla and Zechmeister 2009) and isolationism (e.g., Hurwitz and Peffley 1987; McClosky 1958). Those who score higher in authoritarianism ought to be more hawkish, whereas those who express isolationist attitudes ought to be less hawkish.         "
"13","Core values, including patriotism (e.g., Hurwitz and Peffley 1990; Rokeach 1973) and moral traditionalism (Peffley and Hurwitz 1992), are important as well. For both, those scoring higher ought to provide more hawkish responses. Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999) find that people differ in their willingness to support the use of force under different circumstances, suggesting that context matters (see also Peffley and Hurwitz 1992). Since context is difficult to measure with cross‐sectional data, we rely on people's perceptions of that context.6"
"14","Finally, scholars have found that some demographic variables affect foreign policy preferences. Those with more formal education tend to be less supportive of interventionism and military spending under most, but not all, circumstances (Bartels 1994; Gamson and Modigliani 1966). Women tend to be less supportive of the use of force than men (e.g., Shapiro and Mahajan 1986). In addition to these variables, we also include measures for race (being African American), age, and being a resident of the South.         "
"15","We must first demonstrate that our causal claim—that trust affects foreign policy preferences and evaluations rather than vice versa—is plausible. Panel data provide the best means to test causality. Since the NES surveyed the same respondents in 2000, 2002, and 2004, we can estimate models in which the dependent variables are measured in 2004 and the independent variables are measured in 2002 (or 2000 if they are unavailable in 2002). Unfortunately, the NES asked a full complement of panel respondents only two of our six dependent variables, namely whether the Afghan and Iraq wars, respectively, were worth the cost. If political trust measured in 2002 affects these evaluations measured in 2004 and evaluations of Afghanistan and Iraq measured in 2002 do not affect trust measured in 2004, then it suggests political trust is causally prior to attitudes about foreign policy."
"16","To estimate the Afghan and Iraq war models, we use the variables described in the model section above as explanatory variables, employing lagged measures when possible. To estimate the panel model for political trust, we replicate as closely as possible the model estimated by Hetherington (1998), also using lagged independent variables when possible. Because the Afghan War had begun by the time respondents were interviewed in 2002, the same question was asked both years, allowing for the estimation of traditional cross‐lagged model. Since the Iraq War had not yet begun in 2002, however, people were not asked whether they thought the war was worth the cost. Here we must substitute their preference about whether the United States should go to war, which was asked in 2002, as a lagged approximation of the dependent variable.         "
"17","The results of the first half of the panel analyses appear in Table 1 and conform to expectations. Political trust, as measured in 2002, is significant in explaining whether people thought the Afghan and Iraq wars were worth the cost in 2004, suggesting that political trust may be causally prior to foreign policy preferences. Although encouraging, it is possible that the relationship is more complicated. If the lagged war preferences are also significant in explaining political trust in 2004, it would suggest simultaneity. The results in Table 2, however, suggest that simultaneity is not a problem. Neither a preference for going to war in Iraq in 2002 nor believing the Afghan War was worth the cost in 2002 approaches statistical significance. These results suggest we can be fairly confident that trust is causally prior to foreign policy preferences and not vice versa, allowing us to estimate a wider range of models using cross‐sectional data.7"
"18","Each column in Table 3 contains a model for one of six foreign policy preferences or evaluations. Again the results conform to expectations. Political trust has a consistently positive effect on support for the government's position.8 To simulate the magnitude of political trust's effect, we fix the other variables at politically relevant values and allow trust to vary. Specifically, we simulate a non‐‐African American male who is from the South and is at the sample mean on all other characteristics. When we fixed trust at its minimum, the predicted probability that our “typical” respondent thought Iraq was worth the cost was only .33; we would classify him as not believing Iraq was worth the cost. If we increase political trust to its maximum, however, the predicted probability more than doubles to .72, a 39 percentage point increase. This is substantively important because, with trust at its maximum, our “typical” respondent believes Iraq was worth the cost.            "
"19","Trust's effect is also impressive in relative terms. We can replicate the simulation, fixing trust at its mean and allowing other variables to vary in turn across their respective ranges. Partisanship's effect is largest by far. Moving from its minimum to its maximum, the probability of seeing Iraq as worth the cost increases from .20 to .90. The effect of political trust, however, compares favorably with all the other variables. The first differences for moral traditionalism, education, and isolationism are .33, .31, and .29, respectively, about the same as political trust's."
"20","The effect of political trust is substantively very large in understanding how people thought the Iraq War affected the threat of terrorism. Replicating our simulation, we find that, with trust fixed at its minimum, the predicted probability of falling into the “increased” category is .47, the “stayed the same” category is .38, and the “decreased” category is only .15. This suggests that a very politically distrustful “typical” respondent would think that Iraq increased the threat from terrorism. But, if someone scored at the trust maximum, the predicted probability of falling into the “increased” category is just .19, while the probability of falling into both the “stayed the same” and “decreased” category is .41. Put another way, the predicted probability that our typical person sees the war in Iraq as a net harm decreases by 28 percentage points (from .47 to .19), while the predicted probability that people see Iraq as a net benefit increases by 26 percentage points (from .15 to .41)."
"21","To put this effect into perspective, consider the effect of ideology. If we fix ideology at “extremely liberal,” the predicted probability that this person would say Iraq caused an increase in the risk of terrorism is .58, compared with .33 that the threat remained the same and .09 that the treat decreased. If we fix ideology at “extremely conservative,” the respective probabilities move to .25, .42, and .33. Extreme conservatives were 34 percentage points less likely than extreme liberals to see Iraq as harming the nation's efforts to combat terrorism, and about 24 percentage points more likely to think that it helped, roughly the same effect as political trust."
"22","Trust also exerts a strong effect on preferences for spending on the war on terrorism. When we replicate the above simulations and fix trust at its minimum, the predicted probability of thinking that such spending ought to be decreased is .14, that it ought to remain about the same is .44, and that it ought to increase is .42. If we increase trust to its maximum, while holding all else constant, the predicted probability of thinking spending ought to be decreased drops to .05, that it ought to remain the same decreases to .30, and that it ought to increase surges to .66. Increasing political trust from its minimum to its maximum increases the probability of wanting to increase spending on the war on terrorism by over 20 percentage points, ceteris paribus. In this case, the effect of political trust is about the same as the effect of partisanship."
"23","Although we believe an increase in the salience of defense issues after 9/11 explains why trust affected foreign policy preferences in 2004, we have not provided direct evidence yet. As preliminary evidence, contrast the strong relationship that we have reported between defense preferences and trust in 2004 with their relationship in 2000, a period of low foreign policy salience. Trust's correlation with the 7‐point defense spending scale, the only one of the six dependent variables from our 2004 analysis that is also available in the 2000 NES, is .01. Also consistent with the issue salience hypothesis, trust's usually strong relationship with preferences in the race and redistribution domain disappeared in 2004. After 9/11 pushed other issues off the public agenda, the strongest relationship between trust and any of the four racial policy preferences included in the 2004 NES was a paltry .06.9"
"24","To provide a more systematic treatment, we use the NES Cumulative File, augmenting these data with media content analysis data. If trust's effect on foreign policy preferences is larger when foreign policy is more salient in the media, it would provide firmer evidence for the salience hypothesis. Unfortunately, potential dependent variables available to test our hypotheses are few; the NES has asked only the 7‐point defense spending scale over a long period of years. It has appeared in almost every survey between 1980 and 2004."
"25","To measure the salience of defense and foreign affairs over time, we relied on media content analysis from Baumgartner and Jones’s Policy Agendas Project (PAP), which is available at www.policyagendas.org. PAP includes a database of more than 37,000 news stories randomly sampled from the New York Times News Index from 1946 to 2005. Since the NES defense spending scale runs from 1980 to 2004, we use these years from the PAP. PAP classifies each article into one of 27 policy domains, with coding decisions cross‐checked by three coders. Among the domains, two are germane to foreign policy—“defense” and “international affairs.” We calculate the percentage of stories in specific domains each year by dividing the number of mentions in that domain by the total number of stories coded that year.10"
"26","The results of the content analysis follow the expected pattern. The defense and international issue domain was particularly salient both in the mid‐1980s and especially after 9/11, but was much less salient in the 1990s and 2000. The maximum percentage of national defense stories (31%) occurred in 2004, and the percentage was also very substantial in 1986 (29%) and 1984 (28%), with Cold War tensions running high. In contrast, the percentage of national defense stories between 1994 and 2000 never exceeded 17.5%, with the minimum occurring in 2000 (14%)."
"27","To test whether the effect of political trust is conditional on the salience of defense, we merge the yearly results of the content analysis into the NES Cumulative File. Each respondent in a given year receives a score for national defense salience corresponding to the percentage of stories in the domain that year. For example, since 31% of stories in 2004 were in this domain, each 2004 respondent receives a score of .31 for defense salience. Next, we create an interaction between defense salience and political trust. The effect of the interaction should carry a positive sign, indicating that the difference between the most and least trustful in their support for defense spending increases as the salience of national defense increases."
"28","To test our hypothesis, we replicate the defense spending model from above, adding the trust*defense salience interaction and the base variable effect for defense salience. Of the 12 right‐hand‐side variables in the 2004 model, all are available in the NES Cumulative File except perceived importance of defense spending, authoritarianism, and patriotism. Fortunately, the effect of authoritarianism was not large in our 2004 analysis, so its absence should not affect the results much.11 Moreover, the salience of defense spending, as measured by our media content analysis in the over time analysis, actually better measures context than the importance of defense spending, which we used in the 2004 cross‐section. Patriotism's effect was substantial in 2004, but, unfortunately, data limitations force us to proceed without it. Because moral traditionalism and isolationism appear in most but not all the years that the dependent variable does, we estimate a model that includes only the independent variables available in all years as well as two additional models that include moral traditionalism and isolationism. In all three models, we employ clustered standard errors on defense salience to account for the limited variation from the contextual data.12"
"29","The results of the defense spending analysis appear across three columns in Table 4 and are graphed in Figure 1. The first column includes the results of the reduced form model. The second column includes moral traditionalism, which was missing from the 1980, 1982, and 1984 studies, and the third column includes both moral traditionalism and isolationism. Regardless of specification, the results follow the same pattern. The interaction between trust and defense salience carries a positive sign and is statistically significant. The sign on political trust is negative, which might seem anomalous at first, but is, in fact, meaningless because this coefficient reflects the effect of trust when defense salience equals zero, which never occurs in practice. The main effect for the salience of national defense is positive, which is consistent with previous scholarship (Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser 1999), but not statistically significant.            "
"30","                Marginal Effects of Trust on Defense Spending Preferences"
"31","Since the model in column 1 produces estimates that are substantively the same as the others but with more years included, we interpret the conditional effects of trust based on it. When the salience of defense issues is high, as it was in 2004, the estimated effect of political trust on defense spending is substantial, −.806 + 5.521(0.31) = 0.906 with a standard error of 0.167 (t = 5.43, p < .05). Our model also suggests that the effect of political trust on defense spending was large in the mid‐1980s when the percentage of defense mentions was also high. In 1984, for example, trust's estimated effect was −.806 + 5.521(0.28) = 0.746 with a standard error of .130 (t = 5.74, p < .05). But when salience of defense was low, as was the case for most of the 1990s, the effect of political trust is statistically indistinguishable from zero. In 1996 and 1998, for example, trust's estimated effects were 0.114 (s.e. = .206, t = 0.52, p > .05) and 0.156 (s.e. = .224, t = 0.25, p > .05), respectively. In short, trust's effect on defense spending is statistically significant when the salience of national defense is high, but not when it is low.13"
"32","We attempt to replicate this result for the race and redistribution domain. Unfortunately, the PAP content analysis is not as helpful in measuring salience in this domain. Of the 27 categories that PAP coded, two capture race and redistribution directly—“social welfare” and “civil rights.” The percentage of stories coded into these two categories, however, fails to reflect the importance of this domain. The maximum percentage of such stories in a given year is only 8.8%, and most years the percentage is under five. If we expand the PAP codes to include less explicitly racial categories, such as crime and housing and community development, the percentage remains too low, suggesting the PAP data do not allow us to tap the salience of the race domain with enough precision.14"
"33","We therefore carried out an original content analysis, using Lexis‐Nexis to analyze articles published in the New York Times between January 1 and December 31 of federal election years starting in 1980, the first full year Lexis‐Nexis contains holdings, and ending in 2004. We limited the analysis to articles that appeared in Section A from the National Desk, so we captured articles that centered primarily on the United States. We counted articles across several issue domains, namely defense, the economy, race and redistribution, morality, the environment, aging, and education. Following Gilens (1999), we used “welfare,”“food stamps,”“big government,”“homeless,”“urban poor,”“public assistance,”“public housing,”“Medicaid,” and “civil rights” to tap the salience of the race and redistribution domain. We derived our measure of salience for the race and redistribution domain by dividing the number of articles containing the key words related to this domain by the total number of articles in all domains.15"
"34","The salience of race and redistribution follows the opposite pattern of defense, but with less year‐to‐year variation. Race and redistribution stories were particularly salient in the mid‐1990s, with welfare reform atop the agenda. In 1994, for example, one quarter of stories included one of our search terms, and 22% of stories fell into the race and redistribution domain in 1996. In 2004, with terrorism front and center, only 12% did. As above, we merged these data into the NES Cumulative File, with each respondent each year receiving the percentage of stories that met the search criteria for race and redistribution that year. For example, all 1994 respondents received a race and redistribution salience score of .25, and so forth. We then created an interaction between political trust and race and redistribution salience."
"35","As for dependent variables, the NES has consistently asked only one question from this issue domain since 1980, the aid to blacks 7‐point scale. We reverse the NES's coding, such that the conservative response is coded 1 and the liberal response is coded 7. A positive sign on the interaction would suggest that the difference in preferences between the most and least trustful is largest when the salience of racial issues is highest."
"36","Since only nonblacks pay the costs for these programs and do not receive direct benefits, we use only non‐‐African American respondents in our analysis (see also Hetherington 2005; Hetherington and Globetti 2002).16 We include as many of the right‐hand‐side variables as possible from Hetherington's (2005) model and make substitutes when possible. Unfortunately, neither support for equality nor racial resentment appears in the NES Cumulative File, although both have large effects on racial policy preferences. Finding a suitable proxy for support for equality proved impossible, but we substituted people's feeling thermometer score for “Blacks” in place of racial resentment. Of course, the differences between our model and those from previous scholarship suggest that we must be careful not to overinterpret the estimates. Still, if we find the same pattern of results here as we found for the salience of defense issues above, we think that it would represent strong corroborating evidence for the salience hypothesis.            "
"37","The results appear in Table 5 and graphically in Figure 2. Again they follow the expected pattern. The interaction between the salience of racial issues and political trust carries a positive sign and is statistically significant. In 2004, when the percentage of stories about race was at its minimum, the effect of political trust is −.592 + 6.465(.12) = .184 with a standard error of .190 (t = 0.97 p > .05), which is not statistically distinguishable from zero. But when the salience of race and redistribution is high, as it was in 1996, the effect of political trust is large, −.592 + 6.465(.23) = .895 with a standard error of .140 (t = 6.39, p < .05). Using a second‐issue domain, we have found evidence that issue salience conditions the effect of political trust.            "
"38","                Marginal Effects of Trust on Aid to Blacks Preferences"
"39","We provide evidence that political trust affects the public's preferences and evaluations in the foreign policy domain, suggesting that trust influences public opinion in more areas than was previously known. However, we also find trust's effects are more contingent than previously known. We find strong positive interactions between political trust and issue salience in two policy domains over time. When defense issues become salient, people are primed to evaluate government trustworthiness with defense‐based considerations in mind, which, in turn, causes trust to affect preferences in this domain. When race and redistribution become salient, people are primed to evaluate government trustworthiness with welfare state considerations in mind, which, in turn, causes trust to affect preferences in that domain. Our results imply that political trust is not only a resource for domestic policy liberals. It can provide a reservoir of public support for foreign policy conservatives as well."
"40","In fact, political trust may provide a particularly deep reservoir for foreign policy ambitions. With the country on the brink of war with Iraq in late 2002, the NES found that trust was higher than any time since the 1960s. By disposition, liberals would be the group most likely to put a brake on such a policy, yet fewer than half expressed outright opposition to the war, according to the NES. Although liberals’ trust in government usually drops after a Republican replaces a Democrat in the White House, liberals among NES panel respondents expressed, on average, the same amount of trust in 2002 as they did in 2000, despite the onset of the Bush presidency, an economy sliding into recession, and a bevy of corporate scandals. Relatively high trust among liberals appears to have been of consequence. Liberals whose political trust increased between 2000 and 2002 expressed 21 percentage points more support for war in Iraq than liberals whose trust in government remained constant or dropped. Consistent with our priming theory, liberals whose trust increased between 2000 and 2002 also rated “the military” on the NES's feeling thermometer score substantially more positively (mean = 69.54) than liberals whose trust in government remained constant or dropped (mean = 62.75)."
"41","Beyond Iraq, Republicans tend to talk about foreign policy because they “own” it while Democrats tend to talk about social welfare policy because they “own” it (Petrocik 1996). This regularity might explain why political trust has generally been higher during Republican administrations than Democratic ones (Pew Research Center 2010). When domestic issues are salient, trust will both be lower and connected to preferences in this domain, making it harder for liberals to generate public support for their favored initiatives. In contrast, trust will be both higher and connected to foreign policy preferences when foreign policy issues are salient, making it relatively easier for conservatives to generate public support for their favored initiatives.

"42","In addition, our results suggest that evaluating the effect of political trust over time requires great care because its effect on preferences is not consistent. Hetherington (2005, chap. 8) speculates that one path to increasing support for redistributive public policy is to boost political trust by refocusing the public's attention on the more popular things that government does. While our results suggest that such a strategy might increase political trust, those higher levels of trust are unlikely to affect preferences for redistributive policies. Instead, trust will be consequential in the policy domains that have been made salient. As evidence, although trust in government skyrocketed after 9/11, support for redistributive policies did not increase dramatically. Our results suggest that 9/11 severed the connection between trust and preferences in this domain because the parts of government people had in mind when asked to evaluate it had changed.         "
"43","While trust's effect in a given area might be more contingent than previously believed, our results also suggest that the menu of preferences that trust might affect could be longer than scholars presently believe. A fertile area for future research might be to examine the relationship between political trust and policy preferences in emerging issue domains like the environment or perhaps in older issue domains that are important but have received less scholarly attention. During periods when these domains have attracted significant media attention, political trust may well affect preferences in them as well. Better yet, scholars might consider creating new survey items that ask people to evaluate the trustworthiness of specific parts of the government rather than just the government in general. Such measures would provide a much more precise indication of which parts of government people like and do not like and how these potentially differing evaluations manifest in public policy preferences."
