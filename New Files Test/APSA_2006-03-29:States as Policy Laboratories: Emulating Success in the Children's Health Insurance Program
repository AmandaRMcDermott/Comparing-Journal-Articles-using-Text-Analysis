"1"," Berry and Berry (1990) introduced the state‐year EHA as a way to incorporate both internal determinants of state policy choices and cross‐state diffusion pressures into a single model. Although there are variants,1 the standard state‐year EHA approach examines whether each state in each year has or has not yet adopted a specific policy, such as a lottery adoption (Berry and Berry 1990), HMO reform (Balla 2001), or school‐choice program (Mintrom 1997). The dependent variable, therefore, typically takes a value of zero if the state has yet to adopt the policy and one in the year of adoption. Upon adoption, states are excluded in later years from the dataset, as they are no longer “at risk” of adopting the policy. Internal characteristics of the states may help explain the policy choice, as may external factors. The most commonly studied external diffusion consideration is the flow from neighbor‐to‐neighbor. Specifically, a Neighbors variable is often included, taking a value equal to the fraction of the state's neighbors that already have the policy. A positive coefficient on such a variable indicates that states with a larger percentage of their neighbors having the policy are more likely to adopt it themselves. Other diffusion variables could be incorporated in this framework, such as the similarity of states' ideological leanings (Grossback, Nicholson‐Crotty, and Peterson 2004) or other demographic and fiscal similarities (Case, Hines, and Rosen 1993).         "
"2","In short, the state‐year EHA is quite versatile, and it allows the analysis of many aspects of policy diffusion to be coupled with internal explanations. However, in at least two important ways, this approach projects only a partial image of diffusion within federal systems. First, states are not likely to simply adopt whatever policies are found among similar states. To serve as effective policy laboratories, states must emulate only the successful policies found elsewhere. But, partly due to difficulties measuring success and partly due to use of the state‐year EHA, there has been no systematic evidence to date of whether perceived success contributes to the diffusion of policies across states.         "
"3","To understand why success is difficult to incorporate into the state‐year EHA, consider an analog to the use of a Neighbors variable. Rather than capturing the proportion of neighbors with a policy, a Success variable could capture the proportion of states with a policy they have found to be successful. Unlike with the Neighbors variable, all states being examined in that year would be given the same value for Success, as the proportion of successful states does not depend on the state being examined. Often needing to include year dummies or time trends to account for changing adoption rates over time, researchers would face severe limitations in their ability to judge whether successful policies are more likely to spread.         "
"4","Second, rather than focus on whether a policy is adopted in the states, scholars may learn more about policy diffusion by focusing on which policy is adopted. Typical usage of the state‐year EHA examines whether a state has or has not adopted a specific policy. Where states have the greatest potential to serve as policy laboratories, however, is where the best solution to a particular policy problem has yet to be discovered (Kollman, Miller, and Page 2000). For example, following the 1996 welfare reforms, states experimented with welfare‐to‐work programs ranging from job training to “work first” programs, from family caps to transitional child care. Which policies were likely to be most effective at meeting programmatic and political goals could only be learned through experience. Analyzing which policy is adopted and where the idea came from will help us more fully understand policy diffusion.         "
"5","These two limitations can be overcome through the use of a directed dyad‐year event history analysis. This method of analysis is often used in studies of social networks (Burt and Minor 1983; Iacobucci, Neelamegham, and Hopkins 1999; Knoke 1990). In political science, this approach is most commonly found in international relations analyses of which dyads of countries are most likely to go to war with one another (e.g., Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman 1992; Reiter and Stam 2003).2 Here, it is used to study which dyads of states are more likely to emulate one another's policies. Rather than looking at each individual state in each year, the dyad‐year EHA therefore examines each pair of states in each year. If State A adopts a policy found in state B, the dependent variable takes a value of one; otherwise it is zero. With this simple change in focus, scholars can overcome the above problems. First, if Florida's policy is successful and Indiana's performs poorly, a Success variable would take a value of one for each state paired with Florida and zero for each state paired with Indiana. A positive coefficient would show evidence of successful policies being more likely adopted. Second, a complex array of policies could be captured in this setting. Continuing with the welfare example, a state might copy another by adjusting its welfare benefits, or by adopting or abandoning family caps, job training, and so on. Whatever dimension of the policy is altered, the dependent variable can capture which other states already had that policy aspect and which did not.         "
"6","The distinctive power of this alternative approach, however, becomes most evident when these considerations are explored together within a single analysis. For example, because multiple types of policy change are captured simultaneously, scholars of federalism can determine whether diffusion patterns for program expansions differ from those for program contractions. This will allow us to finally test Downs and Mohr's claim that “the determinants of high‐cost innovations would seem to be markedly different from those of low‐cost innovations” (1976, 702). Additionally, if some of these policy changes are made by legislators and some by bureaucrats, political scientists can test Berry's (1994) claim that policy adoptions through state administrative agencies diffuse differently than those made through the legislative process.         "
"7","As part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, Congress developed the Children's Health Insurance Program as a series of grants to the states to provide health insurance coverage to children from families with incomes above the Medicaid thresholds but below about 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL).3 The program was set up through a series of capped matching grants, with the federal government paying about 65–85% of the program's cost, giving a higher matching rate to states with lower per capita incomes. All states found the matching grants offered by the federal government through the CHIP program too attractive to pass up and sent proposals for federal funding to the Health Care Financing Administration, now renamed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees the CHIP program.         "
"8","States had a great deal of flexibility in their CHIP policies. They could adopt an expansion of their Medicaid program, set up an entirely new separate state program, or try a combination of the two approaches.4 State plans varied in their initial eligibility levels, covering up to 133% FPL in some states through 300% FPL in others.5 Health insurance benefits ranged from those offered in the Medicaid program, to those available to state employees, to those meeting other statewide benchmarks, such as the benefits of the state's largest health maintenance organization (HMO). In hopes of dissuading people from dropping their private (often employer‐sponsored) insurance and immediately enrolling their children in the CHIP program, many states imposed a waiting period from the time a family disenrolls from its private insurance to the time that the children are eligible for CHIP. States also tried various cost sharing mechanisms, including different levels of monthly premiums and copayments. Initial state policies over these six main program components are summarized in Table 1.         "
"9","As should be clear from the table, the states appeared to be experimenting with many different policies to insure the target population. Following these initial adoptions, states amended their programs many times. The more substantive of these changes were sent to CMS for approval. By the end of 2001, more than 100 state amendments had been approved by CMS. Every state except South Carolina had sent an amendment proposal to the federal government. Most adopted two or three amendments; Florida adopted seven. Forty‐eight of these amendments substantively changed the state policies listed in Table 1 and are examined here for evidence of diffusion and policy learning.6 Often these changes altered many program characteristics simultaneously, such as when Mississippi expanded its program in 1999 to 200% FPL while adding copayments.         "
"10","To explore the possibility of states serving as policy laboratories in the CHIP program, I conducted a series of semistructured interviews with CHIP administrative officials in 15 states and gathered data on how all 50 states amended their policies between 1998 and 2001.7 In this article, I discuss the quantitative aspects of the analysis, relying on the qualitative interviews to help with hypothesis construction.         "
"11","The CHIP program is important to study not only because it has provided health insurance coverage to millions of poor children, but also because it facilitates our ability to advance the study of policy diffusion as described above. In particular, this program makes clear the limits of the state‐year EHA and the benefits of the dyad‐year approach. A typical state‐year EHA would ask, which states adopted the CHIP program (or one of its aspects) in which year? Because all 50 states established their initial programs within about a year of the federal grant enactment, there is really no variance to explain. Rather, the interesting feature of CHIP, from a federalism point of view, is the variety of amendments and whether they represent learning about effective policies in other states. Such issues can be addressed in the dyad‐year EHA setting, capturing whether any amendment moves one state in a dyad toward the other, or not."
"12","Before launching into any such analysis, however, it is useful to formulate hypotheses about why state policymakers would adopt policies found elsewhere, with a particular emphasis on the role of policy success. As in all diffusion studies, policymakers in the CHIP program may have been motivated by goals of reelection, reappointment, good public policy, institutional influence, or numerous others. Facing these pressures, they may look at other states based on competition (Tiebout 1956; Volden 2002) or as a source of policy ideas. Competition in policy areas like welfare leads to fears of a race‐to‐the‐bottom (Bailey and Rom 2004; Berry, Fording, and Hanson 2003; Peterson and Rom 1990). Although unlikely to motivate recipient families to move from one state to another, politicians may perceive similar pressures over CHIP policies. While such competition likely points to a neighbor‐to‐neighbor diffusion pattern, policy learning could take place among any pair of similar states. For example, in interviews, CHIP administrators noted that they communicate with one another at national meetings once or twice a year, as well as through “CHIP‐chat,” an email service provided by the National Academy for State Health Policy, through which states could elicit advice regarding other states' experiences.         "
"13","Yet, the interviews were not conclusive regarding which states were emulated. Some officials spoke of diffusion in a parochial fashion, as did a CHIP official in Mississippi: “If I go to the legislature and I say, ‘This is kind of what we're doing, and it's also being done this way,’ if I compare ourselves to Alabama and North Carolina I'm going to be listened to a lot more than if I say, ‘We're modeling California.’”8 Others mentioned a broader learning process: “We look both within and outside our region … it's no geographic clustering necessarily … . We continue to work with Georgia … New Jersey … California. And Iowa.”9"
"14","Whether based on competition or learning, states likely emulate only successful policies. Within the CHIP program, there may be a variety of criteria for success; for example, Shi, Oliver, and Huang (2000) delineate 18 objectives that states had as they were formulating their CHIP plans. However, the most common among these, and the one mentioned universally in the interviews, was the gold standard of reduction in the uninsured rate among the target population of poor children. According to interviewees, state officials continually sought advice on program “take‐up” from policymakers in other states and feared being labeled failures on this dimension. For example, one CHIP official noted: “[We] began to get somewhat embarrassed by the low enrollment, especially compared to some neighboring states. Plus, the first year we had to give back millions in federal dollars. No politician likes that. So eventually [the governor] did recommend a change to the program.”10 Such logic leads to the following:         "
"15","                        "
"16","                      Emulation of Successes Hypothesis:                      States having policies that successfully reduce uninsurance rates among poor children are more likely to be emulated than those that do not.               "
"17","The dyad‐year approach allows an examination of whether such an emulation of successes occurs only for particular policy changes and for particular political processes. As illustrated in Table 1, the CHIP programs had many components. By examining which aspects of the policy were changed, and which states' had the policies spreading to others, we can determine whether cost saving mechanisms diffuse differently than CHIP expansions. This allows us to address Downs and Mohr's (1976) challenge of determining whether high‐cost innovations diffuse differently from low‐cost innovations. More costly CHIP programs, for example those that provide more benefits with lower premiums, will naturally enhance program take‐up. Policymakers trying to cut costs, however, face a dilemma. Which aspects of the program can they alter to save money without too great a drop in enrollment? To answer this question, policymakers may seek out low‐cost, yet effective, programs in other states. As one CHIP official noted: “If anybody comes up with some wonderful ideas to save money, they'd probably be initiated around the country.”11"
"18","                        "
"19","                      Seeking Low‐Cost Successes Hypothesis:                      In order to avoid policy failures, states will especially rely on evidence of success when contracting their program spending.               "
"20","Moreover, diffusion pathways likely differ across various political processes. Just under three‐quarters of the CHIP amendments were made through state legislatures. The rest were made through the state administrative agencies. The dyad‐year EHA can isolate these two processes, so we can test whether policy diffusion varies across state institutional structures, as Berry (1994) hypothesizes. Related to success, this process could work in one of two ways.         "
"21","                        "
"22","                      Administrators Emulating Successes Hypothesis:                      Because of their greater access to information, decisions by administrative agencies will rely heavily on evidence of success.               "
"23","                        "
"24","                      Legislators Emulating Successes Hypothesis:                      Because of their reelection considerations, decisions by legislators will rely heavily on evidence of success.               "
"25","Finally, although this project focuses mainly on the role of success in policy diffusion, it is also possible to explore the effect of state similarity in explaining how policies spread."
"26","                        "
"27","                      Similar States Hypothesis:                      Based on competition and policy learning, states are more likely to emulate their geographic neighbors and those with similar political, demographic, and budgetary characteristics.               "
"28","To test these five hypotheses, I examine all state CHIP policies from 1998 to 2001 for the six policy characteristics listed in Table 1, to discover when states emulate one another, adopting a policy change found in another state. As discussed above, I rely on the directed dyad‐year EHA. In each year I examine each pair (or dyad) of states, for a total of 9,800 observations (50 states × 49 potentially emulated states × 4 years). Each of the 50 states may adopt policies in each year that imitate the policies in place in any of the other 49 states. Each pair of states is represented twice in each year under this approach, as one should not assume that, for example, policymakers in Iowa have the same view of New York that those in New York have of Iowa. The dependent variable for this analysis captures whether State A in the dyad emulates State B. As discussed below, there are many ways one could construct a dependent variable to capture emulation. For the present analysis, I create a dichotomous dependent variable taking a value of one if State A changes toward a policy that State B already had at the start of the year of observation, and zero otherwise.12 For example, when Rhode Island raised its eligibility level from 250% to 300% FPL in 1998, it was adopting a policy already found in Connecticut and three other states (and was moving toward Tennessee's even‐higher level, and closer to Minnesota's 280% FPL). The dependent variable takes a value of one for the Rhode Island‐Connecticut dyad (and for other Rhode Island‐dyads in which State B's FPL at the start of 1998 was closer to 300% than to 250%), as a potential emulation. For 1998 Rhode Island‐dyads in which State B did not have such a high eligibility level, the dependent variable is set at zero.         "
"29","Potential imitations are also observed in the other aspects of the CHIP policy, whether they be changes in the benefits, waiting period, or other features displayed in Table 1. All of these policy aspects are captured in a single dependent variable characterizing whether a majority of the changes in any of these components moved State A toward State B.13 Unlike the analysis of conflict, in which we know with near certainty whether the two countries are at war with one another, here we are not sure whether there was any actual contact and learning between the state that adopts a policy change and the state (or states) that already has that policy. Rather, as with previous diffusion analyses, we are interested in discerning whether there are patterns, such as the adoption of policies that are present in neighboring states (or the most successful states) rather than those found randomly across the country.         "
"30","Independent variables are constructed to test the above diffusion hypotheses. These variables characterize conditions in State B that may make the emulation of that state's policies more attractive, and similarities between State A and State B that might explain diffusion patterns.14 Our main concern is testing the Emulation of Successes Hypothesis. As mentioned above, the gold standard for judging the initial success of states' CHIP programs is the degree of reduction in the uninsured rate among the target population of poor children. I therefore create an independent dummy variable Success. Construction of this variable involved several stages. First, I generated an intermediate variable capturing the percent decrease in the uninsured rate among children from families below 200% FPL between 1997 and the current year of the data, for each state and year. Second, to control for the effect of different eligibility standards on this percent decrease and its variance over time, I conducted linear regressions for each year, with this percent decrease measure as the dependent variable and the state's eligibility standards (truncated at 200% FPL for states with higher eligibility) as the explanatory variable. Finally, if State B exceeded its predicted value, Success took a value of one for each dyad with this state as the potentially emulated state; otherwise, it took a value of zero. If states with successful policies are more likely to be emulated, the coefficient on this variable should be positive.15"
"31","Beyond successes, the baseline model is able to test the Similar States Hypothesis. Independent variables are constructed to capture whether the two states in the dyad are geographically proximate or otherwise similar, based on the idea that neighboring and similar states may compete with each other and learn from one another. The first of these independent variables is a Geographic Neighbor dummy variable, taking a value of one for dyads comprised of geographic neighbors, and zero otherwise.16 If states are emulating policies that are more prevalent in their neighboring states than in all states nationwide, this variable will have a positive coefficient.         "
"32","I include three independent variables to test whether policies diffuse to states with similar political characteristics. The first, Same Unified Republican Government, is a dummy variable taking a value of one if the governor, house, and senate are all controlled by Republicans in both states in the dyad. Same Unified Democratic Government is similarly constructed based on Democratic control.17 A positive coefficient is expected on each of these variables. Absolute Difference in Government Ideology, is constructed following the work of Berry et al. (1998). They develop a measure of the government's ideology in each state, based on partisan control in the state legislature, voting patterns of congressional representatives, and other ideological measures. Absolute Difference in Government Ideology is the absolute difference between the government's ideology score in the two states in the dyad. If both states are quite moderate, both are conservative, or both are liberal, this variable will take a low value. A negative coefficient would support the idea of diffusion to states with similar ideologies.         "
"33","Four independent variables can help test the possibility of diffusion to states with similar demographic characteristics. The first, Population Ratio, simply focuses on the size of the population of the two states in the dyad. This variable takes the ratio of the larger of these two states to the smaller. A comparison of Texas to New York, or of North Dakota to Vermont, will produce a value close to one for this independent variable, while Oregon compared to California will produce a value of about 10. If states tend to emulate those of approximately the same size, the coefficient on this variable will be negative.18Absolute Difference in Minority Population captures the absolute difference between the two states in the dyad in the percent of their populations comprised of minorities.19 If state governments are shaping their CHIP policies around those in states with similar racial population bases, this variable should have a negative coefficient. The third variable related to demographics included here is Absolute Difference in Per Capita Income. If states with similar poverty or wealth are more likely to emulate one another, this variable's coefficient should be negative. The fourth demographic variable is specific to the policy area of health care. Absolute Difference in HMO Penetration captures the absolute difference between the two states in the dyad in the percent of their populations enrolled in health maintenance organizations. If states are more likely to imitate those with similar health care structures serving their populations, this variable should have a negative coefficient.         "
"34","Budget constraints may affect the innovativeness and policy adoptions of governments and organizations (Mohr 1969). Two variables are used to test whether budgetary similarities are important to policy diffusion. The first, Absolute Difference in Percent Change in Revenue, captures the relative direction of states' fiscal health. This variable is the absolute difference between the two states in the dyad in the percent change in state government revenues between the current year and the previous year. States with growing revenues will look similar to others with growing revenues, thus taking a low value for this variable. Likewise, two states facing dropping revenues will look quite similar on this front. The second independent variable in this area is Absolute Difference in Percent Spent on Health and Hospitals. This budgetary consideration is specific to the policy area being examined and is functionally the absolute difference between the two states in the dyad in the percent of the budget dedicated to health and hospitals. States with comparable fiscal commitments in this area will have low values for this variable. Negative coefficients on these variables will show support for budgetary similarities accounting for diffusion patterns.         "
"35","Additional variables serve as necessary controls, consistent with some states taking the lead in developing policy ideas that are subsequently more likely to be emulated. Early work on policy innovations focused on these lead states. Walker (1969), for example, examined leader states through factor analysis. Prior to that work, Crain (1966) found that leader cities in the use of fluoridation tended to be larger and richer than others. Grupp and Richards (1975) pointed to the emulation of “esteemed states.” These works, in combination with those across many fields of study (Rogers 1995), find early innovator states and organizations to be those that are larger and wealthier—with others emulating them later on. The CHIP program may be no exception, where state officials often mentioned looking at the policies of California, Florida, Texas, and New York. Three such controls are included. First, because larger states may be more likely to be emulated, Log of Population in State B is included.20 Second, Per Capita Income, expressed in thousands of dollars, captures the wealth of State B.21 Third, HMO Penetration is the percent of State B's population enrolled in HMOs. If states that are larger, wealthier, and more involved in managed care are seen as leaders to be emulated, we should expect positive coefficients on these three variables. These variables are similar to those above exploring demographic similarities. They are incorporated in this manner to explore nonlinearities in these relations, with State A emulating states that are similar and/or leaders on these dimensions.22"
"36","The baseline model thus tests whether successful and similar states are more likely to be emulated. Tests of the other three hypotheses, related to program costs and political processes, are discussed below. All variable descriptions, sources, and summary statistics are given in the appendix.         "
"37","To test the Emulation of Successes Hypothesis and the Similar States Hypothesis regarding CHIP policies, a number of econometric models were examined. Using the directed dyad‐year event history analysis approach, 2,450 dyads are observed in each of four years. As described above, the dependent variable is a dummy for whether State A adopts a policy change moving it on average toward State B's CHIP policy. Given the dichotomous nature of this variable, the analysis is conducted using logit models.23 Scholars have recently taken an interest in the potential dependence across observations in cross‐section time‐series models such as those presented here. For instance, Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998) introduce a method to control for temporal dependence in models with a dichotomous dependent variable. Unfortunately, their method is inappropriate for models with a small number of time periods. Instead, I make three adjustments to the standard logit model to address these concerns. First, I incorporate year dummies into the model to account for different hazard rates over time. Second, I include a Number of Prior Emulations variable that captures the number of previous times State A adopted a policy that State B had. Third, I cluster the data by dyad and rely on Huber/White robust standard errors. Because each pair of states is included twice in each year (New York may emulate California or vice versa), there may be concern about whether these observations are truly independent. By clustering both such pairs together, this potential dependence is addressed, following the directed dyad approach of Reiter and Stam (2003).24 The robust standard errors also are used to address the possibility of heteroskedasticity. Multicollinearity does not appear to be a problem, given the low level of correlation across the independent variables.25 Outliers appear to have little effect on the outcomes reported here. Further robustness checks are noted below. All analyses were carried out using Stata 8.            "
"38","Model 1 in Table 2 shows the results of the baseline analysis with variables capturing the role of policy success and of similarities across states. Coefficients and their standard errors are reported along with the point estimate of the percent change in the odds ratio that accompanies a one‐unit change in each independent variable. Most important to the function of states as policy laboratories is the emulation of policies that have been successful in other states. The Success variable captures whether State B was especially effective in lowering its uninsured rate among poor children. Its coefficient is positive and statistically different from zero. Its effect is sizable. Dyads in which State B was successful have nearly a 20% greater odds of State A abandoning its policy in favor of that in State B, when compared to dyads in which State B was unsuccessful. This provides strong initial support for the Emulation of Successes Hypothesis.            "
"39","The Similar States Hypothesis is tested in many parts, depending on the nature of the state‐to‐state similarities. As expected, the coefficient on Geographic Neighbor takes a positive value. However, it is not statistically distinct from zero at conventional levels. Political similarities appear to matter in explaining policy diffusion, with support from the Same Unified Republican Government variable and the Absolute Difference in Government Ideology variable. Both have statistically significant coefficients with the anticipated signs. The odds of the adoption of a policy moving State A toward State B are 50% greater when both states are under unified Republican control than under other political configurations. A one‐point increase in the absolute ideological distance between dyad states is associated with a 0.4% decline in the odds of a policy emulation. Given that this independent variable is a construct, it is difficult to interpret this result. Perhaps more intuitively, a one‐standard‐deviation increase in the absolute difference in ideology is associated with a 7.5% decrease in the odds of State A imitating State B. Contrary to expectations, the coefficient on Same Unified Democratic Government is negative, although it does not attain statistical significance. For cases like this where multiple independent variables capture a single concept, the best standard for comparison is a joint test. Here, a likelihood ratio test can be used to compare the full model to one in which the coefficients on these three variables are set equal to zero. The test statistic takes the form of a chi‐squared. Here, the results show strong support for political similarity affecting diffusion (χ2(3) = 22.90, p < 0.001).            "
"40","The results for the effects of demographic similarities are mixed, with only two of the four variables' coefficients taking the expected negative values. There is support for the idea that diffusion takes place among states with similar income levels. Specifically, the odds of emulation fall by 2.1% for each 1% divergence between state incomes. The other three variables show much less support, however, for the role of demographic similarities. Although the coefficient on Absolute Difference in HMO Penetration is negative, it is not significantly different from zero. Most surprising, however, is the coefficient on Absolute Difference in Minority Population, which is positive and highly significant. A 1% difference between dyad states in their percent minority is associated with more than a 1% rise in the odds of State A adopting a CHIP policy found in State B. The reasons for such an effect are unclear, but certainly are not supportive of the idea of diffusion based on similar demographics. Taken together, the two variables with anticipated signs on their coefficients offer at best modest support for the effect of demographic similarities on policy diffusion (χ2 (2) = 6.34, p = 0.042). Moreover, such support must be tempered by the unexpected finding of minority differences and the positive coefficient on Population Ratio.            "
"41","The results for the next two independent variables tend to support the idea of states imitating those confronting similar budgetary situations. States facing similar increases or decreases in their revenues over time seem more likely to emulate one another's policies. Based on the coefficient on Absolute Difference in Percent Change in Revenue, each 1% difference in the revenue change between the two states in the dyad is associated with a 2.4% decline in the odds of State B having the policy that State A is adopting. The coefficient on Absolute Difference in Percent Spent on Health and Hospitals, however, is unexpectedly positive. In sum, the Similar States Hypothesis, tested across all 10 relational variables, receives strong support (χ2 (10) = 58.32, p < 0.001), with the caveats noted above.            "
"42","There is also strong evidence of the emulation of leader states. While the coefficient on Log of Population is positive, it is not statistically significant. However, there is substantial evidence for the imitation of wealthier states and those with a greater managed care (HMO) presence. A $1,000 higher per capita income in State B is associated with 4% greater odds of State A emulating State B's policies. These odds are increased by 1.2% for each additional percent of HMO penetration in State B. Together, these results strongly suggest the policy leadership role of these esteemed states (χ2 (3) = 71.26, p < 0.001).            "
"43","Before moving beyond this initial model, it is worth mentioning one potential caveat that is particularly relevant to the state similarity findings. An alternative hypothesis to the emulation of policies of similar states is simply that similar states adopt similar policies, without necessarily relying on any learning from other states. While the findings presented here cannot fully rule out this alternative, the totality of evidence is suggestive of states acting as policy laboratories. Following the 1997 initiation of the CHIP program, each state developed its own policy. At that time, similar states could have developed similar policies. The policy changes examined here follow those initial policies and indicate convergence over time toward policies in similar states and in successful states, consistent with policy diffusion."
"44","The three models in Table 3 serve largely as robustness checks on the results of Model 1. As described above, some of the policy changes being examined here involve multiple components, such as adding a waiting period and monthly premium at the same time. The dependent variable used in Model 1 takes a value of one if the majority of these components move State A's policy toward that found in State B. Many alternative specifications of that dependent variable are possible. For example, all six components in Table 1 could be treated as independent dimensions in a six‐dimensional space, and the Euclidean distance between dyad members before and after State A's policy change could be compared to see if State A moved toward State B.26 Because these six components may not be independent, however, I conducted a factor analysis, which indicated that there are two underlying dimensions of these policy choices and thus attributed factor scores to each of the six components for each of the two dimensions. All states' policies were then placed in this two‐dimensional space, and the Euclidean distances between dyad states were compared before and after State A's policy change. When State A moved closer to State B, the dyad‐year dependent variable was given a value of one; otherwise it was zero.27 As can be seen Model 2 in Table 3, the results using this alternative specification strongly mimic those of Model 1. The emulation of best practices continues to be strongly evident. The largest difference from Model 1 in terms of similar states is that unified Democratic governments appear more likely to emulate each other under this specification. The importance of leader states is again substantiated.            "
"45","While the dyad‐based approach used here allows the incorporation of features not included in standard state‐year event history analyses, such as policy success, one shortcoming of this approach as used above is that it did not include internal determinants of change within State A. This concern is addressed in two separate ways, in Models 3 and 4. Model 3 returns to the use of the dependent variable from Model 1. However, here the dataset is restricted to only including dyads in which State A changed its policy in the current year. This results in 2,352 observations (48 policy changes × 49 potentially emulated states). The analysis therefore can be thought of as addressing the question: conditional on State A adopting a policy change, which states' policies are most likely to be imitated? With the reduction in the number of observations, the standard errors increase somewhat. However, most of the coefficients remain approximately the same as in Model 1, again lending support to the roles of success, of political and budgetary similarities, and of leader states in policy emulation. Two changes are worth noting in detail, however. First, the anomalous finding of the positive coefficient on the Absolute Difference in Minority Population is now put in check. Although the coefficient remains positive in this specification, it is not statistically discernable from zero, while the three other demographic similarity measures now have negative coefficients, two of which are statistically significant. Second, and most importantly, the coefficient on the best practices Success variable is even larger than in Model 1. Based on this coefficient size, the odds of emulating the policies of State B are 32% higher when State B is succeeding at lowering the uninsurance rate among its poor children beyond expectations than when State B is failing."
"46","Model 4 confronts the concern about omitting State A's internal determinants of policy change even more directly. This model builds on Model 1 by adding nine variables characterizing the conditions in State A for all of the variables that previously captured similarity between dyad states. The concern was that, for example, the appearance of ideologically similar states emulating one another could be caused instead by the simple fact that similar states adopt similar policies even without any sense of learning from one another. The reasons for not including such internal determinants above were: (1) standard errors on variables for State A's policy changes may be artificially low in the dyad setting, because a single adoption may appear as an emulation of anywhere from one to 49 other states; (2) given the host of different policy changes, a State A characteristic that enhances one type of change might be associated with a lower likelihood of another type of change, thus introducing heteroskedasticity; and (3) including such variables may present multicollinearity problems. To address the first of these concerns, the analysis of Model 4 clusters the observations by State A instead of by each dyad, as above. This is an essential step, but it introduces a further tradeoff. Now all observations pairing State A with any other state are treated as nonindependent—meaning that a substantial portion of the variance across dyads may be treated as a nuisance to be eliminated rather than as a crucial part of the analysis. The second and third concerns do not seem to be too problematic in the present analysis, although a moderate degree of multicollinearity exists among the ideology and unified government variables of State A and the State A‐State B dyads.            "
"47","Noting these tradeoffs is important, as future scholars using the dyad‐year EHA approach will need to decide whether to also include State A internal determinants in their analyses. For present purposes, Model 4 illustrates that their incorporation in the CHIP study has little effect on the relationships of interest. As was found in Model 1, the Emulation of Successes Hypothesis and Similar States Hypothesis continue to receive substantial support. As anticipated (because of the diversity of policy changes incorporated in the analysis), the State A variables are largely statistically insignificant. The two exceptions are that wealthier states and those with greater HMO penetration are less likely to change their policies in any direction. This is consistent with our finding of leader states—with these types of states acting as early adopters of policies that are then emulated by others. The moderate multicollinearity among unified government and ideology variables results in different political similarity variables attaining statistical significance in Model 4 as opposed to Model 1. Other than that, most of the results imitate those of Model 1. In sum, all of the models presented in Table 3 lend additional confidence to the findings of Model 1 described extensively above and further support for the Emulation of Successes Hypothesis and Similar States Hypothesis.            "
"48","Finding support for these initial two hypotheses, we now turn to a test of the Seeking Low‐Cost Successes Hypothesis, to examine whether evidence of policy success is more important for states reducing their CHIP spending than for those expanding their programs. One beneficial feature of the dyad‐year approach is that it can be used to capture differences across categories of policy change. Specifically, we can isolate financially costly innovations (e.g., increasing eligibility levels, reducing cost sharing, and easing the waiting period), from those that are financially beneficial to state budgets, from those that combine program expansion with cost containment measures, and yet incorporate them all in the same analysis."
"49","Of the 48 policy adoptions examined here, a handful were solely comprised of cost‐saving measures, with just over half of the changes clearly increasing costs, and just over a third containing a mix of components. Model 5 in Table 4 explores whether the diffusion pathways differed across these three categories, using a multinomial logit analysis. To carry out this analysis, the dependent variable from Model 1 is further broken down into additional categories. As before, where no policy change of State A toward State B in the dyad occurs, the variable continues to take a value of zero. Now, however, where State A adopts a policy found in State B and that policy change brings about a lower cost program, the dependent variable is coded as a one. Where State A adopts a policy present in State B and the cost effects are mixed, the dependent variable is coded as a two. And, it is coded as a three where State A's policy change is present in State B and it increases costs. With this categorical dependent variable, the analysis in Model 5 relies on a multinomial logit. The same controls used in Model 1 continue to be relevant here.28 The results reported in the three columns of Table 4 show the conditions of lower cost policy emulation, mixed emulation, and higher cost emulation, relative to the base category of no movement within the dyad of State A's policy toward State B's policy.            "
"50","Although the findings in the three columns of Table 4 tend to reinforce the results of Models 1–4, there are both statistical and substantive differences in the diffusion processes across the three types of policy changes.29 A Wald test that the coefficients for less costly policy changes are identical to those for more costly changes is soundly rejected (χ2 (17) = 101.43, p < 0.001), thus indicating different diffusion pathways across these types of changes. Likewise, the diffusion process for mixed policy changes differs substantially from each of these other two types. Although there are many differences in the diffusion patterns across these categories, four in particular stand out. First, for policy changes that are unambiguous in raising or lowering the cost of the state CHIP programs, unified Republican government is important both statistically and substantively. Moreover, similar unified Democratic governments across the dyad appear to be important in the diffusion of less costly policy changes, while similar ideologies help explain the diffusion of mixed or more costly policy adoptions. Thus partisan and ideological similarities are relevant to all types of policy changes in the CHIP program, with partisanship playing a stronger role for stark expansions or contractions of the program. Second, demographic similarities help explain expansion or contraction of the CHIP program, but are less relevant for mixed program changes. Third, budgetary similarities, as captured by the Absolute Difference in Percent Change in Revenue, especially mattered for policy changes that had at least one element increasing the program's costs. This is intuitive in that these changes are the ones that would make policymakers most wary about the financial implication of their actions, enhancing the likelihood that they would consider the experiences in states facing similar budget constraints.            "
"51","Finally, the role of best practices is somewhat evident in all three types of policy changes, although the coefficient on Success is statistically distinct from zero only for less costly policy changes and for those with mixed components. The coefficient sizes indicate a doubling of the odds of State A adopting a less costly policy change found in State B if State B's policy is successful, and a 54% increase for a mixed cost policy adoption. This finding provides strong support for the Seeking Low‐Cost Successes Hypothesis. It is also consistent with findings from the interviews of CHIP officials. For example, in determining how much to increase their monthly premiums, policymakers expressed awareness of other states' disenrollment experiences when costs rose too high. Said one CHIP official, “[Based on surveys and focus groups, other states] found that twenty dollars per family was really where families drew a line in the sand, having to think about whether it was affordable.”30 Rather than cutting costs without regard to enrollment effects, the interviews and regression results seem to indicate a more thoughtful approach to cost containment.            "
"52","Just as the diffusion pathways seemed to differ across policy aspects, so too may the nature of diffusion vary depending on political processes. The Administrators Emulating Success Hypothesis and Legislators Emulating Success Hypothesis raise competing views about whether state bureaucrats with their expertise and greater information or legislators with the electoral connection will be more reliant on learning about other states' successes.31 As noted above, just under three‐fourths of the policy changes examined here were adopted through the state legislatures, with the rest occurring through state‐level administrative rulemaking. Model 6 in Table 5 allows tests of whether the policy diffusion mechanism varies across these two different processes. As with the above division of the data into separate categories depending on program cost changes, this part of the analysis likewise breaks down the dependent variable in Model 1 into additional categories. As always, where no policy change of State A toward State B occurs, the variable takes a value of zero. Now, however, where State A adopts a policy present in State B and that policy change is made through an administrative decision, the dependent variable is coded as a one. And, where State A adopts a policy present in State B and that policy change is made through the legislative process, the dependent variable is coded as a two. We once again rely on a multinomial logit model. Here, the results reported in the two columns of Table 5 show the conditions of administrative‐based policy emulation and legislative‐based policy emulation, relative to the base condition of no policy emulation.            "
"53","As with Model 5, the findings continue to reinforce the results from the baseline model, but they now show differences across political processes. A Wald test that the coefficients for the administrative changes are identical to those for legislative changes is strongly rejected (χ2 (18) = 174.60, p < 0.001). As always, the coefficients on the Geographic Neighbor variable fail to attain statistical significance. Political similarities are important for both administrative and legislative policy changes, as illustrated by the negative and significant coefficient on the Absolute Difference in Government Ideology measure. However, Same Unified Republican Government was only relevant for changes made through the legislative process. This is as might be expected, with partisan similarities in unified governance being more important for legislative action. Demographic and budgetary similarities both seem to matter somewhat for administrative and legislative policy changes, especially as seen in similarities in per capita incomes and changes in state revenue.            "
"54","Most importantly for our hypothesis testing, only diffusion through legislative processes appears to be responsive to the policy successes of other states. The odds of State A changing its legislation to reflect that in State B are 24% higher when State B has a successful policy than when its track record of lowering the uninsured rate is less than stellar, providing strong support for the Legislators Emulating Successes Hypothesis. However, such possibilities of successful policies elsewhere appear to have little sway over the policies adopted through administrative processes, thus lending little support for the Administrators Emulating Successes Hypothesis. What conclusions can we draw from these findings? Perhaps the electoral connection is critical to states functioning as policy laboratories. Alternatively, perhaps the checks and balances of guiding proposals through the legislative process may help ensure that only those policies with strong evidence of success are adopted, while administrative changes are made for appearances of legitimacy instead of improved outcomes (DiMaggio and Powell 1983).32 Future work in other policy areas may shed more light on these differences across political processes.            "
"55","The idea that states may act as policy laboratories has been clear for some time; yet, the details of how this process works have remained murky. Ultimately, scholars and practitioners alike may wish to know the conditions under which decentralized policymaking serves the useful role of generating more effective policies. Such knowledge would indicate when the federal government should devolve control to the states. It would also help interested parties, such as policymakers, activists, and researchers, determine what informational and structural guidance would be most useful to state officials."
"56","This study takes major steps toward achieving these goals. Using the dyad‐year event history analysis approach, this article illustrates how diffusion studies can incorporate the role of policy success—a role that may differ across policy types and political processes—while simultaneously analyzing the multiple diffusion paths between similar states. In the CHIP program, policies appear to flow from states with unified Republican governments to other such partisan states. Although there was no strong neighborhood effect, similarities based on ideological leanings, per capita income, managed care structures, and budgetary considerations were all relevant to the diffusion process."
"57","Most significantly, the role of policy success was found to be important for policy diffusion. Within the CHIP program, there was a great degree of change from states' initial experiments to the policies that were particularly effective at addressing the needs of uninsured poor children. Evidence of success was especially relevant for policy amendments made through legislative rather than administrative changes. Moreover, perhaps because they had a greater chance of producing failures, changes that reined in the costs of the CHIP program were made in ways that emulated the cost‐saving activities of successful governments elsewhere. While tentative, these findings are highly suggestive of how states operate as policy laboratories. If future work in other policy areas leads to similar findings, we would better understand when and how information and successful innovations spread across states."
"58","Beyond the substantive findings, this study makes the methodological argument that a dyad‐year approach may be better than a state‐year EHA for many diffusion studies. Yet the state‐year approach remains more appropriate for many purposes. Where scholars are interested in whether or not a particular policy was adopted and why, the state‐year approach has the benefit of being able to fully incorporate internal determinants of policy change along with numerous diffusion pathways, without raising as many methodological concerns. Where researchers are instead interested in the choice among multiple policy options, in whether that choice depends on learning about the success of policies elsewhere, and in whether diffusion pathways differ across policy types and political processes, the dyad‐year approach is an attractive alternative. As used here, this approach uncovers a robust pattern of states acting as policy laboratories."
