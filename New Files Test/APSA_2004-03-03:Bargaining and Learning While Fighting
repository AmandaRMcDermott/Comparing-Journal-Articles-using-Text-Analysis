"1","This section presents a costly‐process model which generalizes the costly‐lottery approach. In a typical costly‐lottery game, two states, say S and D, bargain about revising the territorial status quo, q.4Figure 1(a) depicts a round of the game. S begins the game by making an offer, x∈[0, 1], to D who can accept the offer, reject it, or go to war to change the territorial status quo. Accepting ends the game with the territory divided as agreed. If D fights, the game ends and one state or the other is eliminated. More precisely, the game ends in a lottery in which both states pay a cost of fighting; D obtains all of the territory and eliminates S with probability π; and S eliminates D and thereby gains all of the territory with probability 1 −π. The parameter π represents the distribution of power. If, for example, , then each state has the same chance of winning and there is an even distribution of power. If, alternatively, π is close to one or zero, D or S has a preponderance of power. One can think of the game‐ending lottery as a fight to the finish in which either S collapses and is unable to offer further resistance with probability π or D collapses and is unable to offer further resistance with probability 1 −π. If D rejects S's offer, then S can attack or pass. Attacking again ends the game in a lottery. Passing ends the round, and another begins with S making an offer.5"

"3","In the costly‐process game, fighting only creates a risk of collapse. If neither state collapses, the bargaining and fighting can continue until the states reach agreement or until one of them eventually does collapse. Assume, more specifically, that if S and D fight in a given round, then this fighting generates a risk kS that S collapses in that round and a risk kD that D collapses. These risks are assumed to be positive but possibly very small. Fighting is also costly, and S and D pay costs s and d each time they fight.6"
"4"," Figure 1(b) illustrates a round of the game. As before, state S begins by proposing a territorial division x∈[0, 1]. D can accept this offer, reject it, or fight. If D accepts, the game ends with D and S in control of x and 1 − x, respectively. If D fights, the states pay costs s and d, respectively, and the game ends with probability k≡ 1 − (1 −kD)(1 −kS), which is the probability that one or both of the states collapse. If only S collapses, D obtains all of the territory. If D alone collapses, S gets everything. If both collapse, the territorial status quo q remains in place. Finally, if neither state collapses, the current round ends, and the next begins. If D rejects S's offer without fighting, then S has the option of fighting or not. Not fighting ends the round and the next begins. If S fights, one or both states collapse with probability k and the game ends. If neither state collapses, the round ends and the next starts with a new offer from S.         "
"5","It will be useful to define the distribution of power in the costly‐process game. The distribution of power π in the costly‐lottery formulation is the probability that D prevails in a fight to the finish (which is the only kind of fight that can happen in that model). But there is another equivalent way of interpreting π: It is the expected territorial division resulting from a fight to the finish. That is, π also equals D's expected share of the territory, i.e., π= (1)π+ 0(1 −π) where, recall, D obtains all of the territory with probability π and loses everything with probability 1 −π. Paralleling this, define the distribution of powerpin the costly‐process model to be D's expected territorial division resulting from a fight to the finish. This is:            "
"6","The payoffs in the game are defined formally in the appendix. Suppose, less formally, that the states agree at time a to territorial division x after fighting at times f1, f2, … , fn. The expected payoff to this outcome is the payoff if the game ends when the states fight at f1 weighed by the probability that the game ends at that time, plus the payoff if the game ends at time f2 weighted by the probability that the game ends at that time, and so on through the n‐th time that the states fight, plus the payoff to agreeing to x at time a weighted by the probability that the states did not collapse at times f1, … , fn.         "
"7","Finally, the model assumes one‐sided incomplete information. S is uncertain either about D's cost of fighting, d, or about D's probability of collapse, kD. Because p is strictly decreasing in kD, uncertainty over kD is equivalent to uncertainty over the distribution of power p (and working with uncertainty over the former is much easier). Although S is uncertain of D's cost or of the distribution of power, S believes that D is dissatisfied, i.e., D prefers fighting to the finish to living with the status quo.7"
"8","Recent work has relaxed the costly‐lottery assumption in several different ways that highlight complimentary aspects of the underlying process and reflect different modeling trade offs.8 The present formulation is closest to Wagner (2000). He also bases his analysis on a model in which rejecting an offer generates a risk that the game will end in that round because one state or the other collapses. Wagner, however, does not formally derive the equilibria of the game when there is asymmetric information, and, as will be discussed more fully below, some of his conjectures about the equilibrium dynamics are only partially correct.         "
"9"," Smith and Stam (2003) model the costly process differently, emphasizing the way that the probability of ultimate success in a fight to the finish can shift back and forth with the tide of battle. Building on Smith (1998a), they assume that two states, say S and D, are bargaining and that there are n“forts” which are initially divided between the states. S begins the game by making an offer to D who can accept or reject. Accepting ends the game on the agreed terms. If D rejects, the states fight with D winning a fort with probability η and losing a fort with probability 1 −η. The game continues in this way with S making all of the offers until the states reach agreement or until a state collapses because it no longer controls any forts.         "
"10","The states also disagree about the probability η. This disagreement is not due to differences in the states' information about, say, their respective military capabilities but to a more basic subjective difference about the balance of power. Formally, Smith and Stam assume that the states have complete information but heterogeneous priors. This formulation contrasts with the informational approach generally taken in economics and in the existing formal work on war. (Smith and Stam is the only exception.) In this approach, actors are assumed to share a common prior and any differences in their beliefs are attributed to informational differences.9"
"11"," Slantchev (2003) also uses Smith's (1998a) basic model of warfare but allows for alternating offers in the context of one‐sided uncertainty about the distribution of power η. Following the informational approach, he attributes the differences in the states' beliefs about the distribution of power to informational differences. In this case, one has state has private information about its military capability.         "
"12"," Filson and Werner (2002a,b) underscore the resource constraint states face when fighting. In their formulation, the game begins with each state in control of a limited amount of resources. As in Smith and Stam and Slantchev, the states fight a battle whenever an offer is rejected with D wining with probability ψ and losing with probability 1 −ψ. Fighting a battle also consumes resources (although the amounts may differ depending on whether a state wins or loses), and a state collapses when it runs out of resources. Thus, the bargaining continues until the states reach agreement or until one of the states runs out of resources. There is also one‐sided uncertainty about ψ.         "
"13","These formalizations of fighting embody different modeling trade offs. The costly process in Filson and Werner (2002a) is the only one that explicitly models the idea that resources are limited and consumed by fighting. However, their treatment of bargaining is the simplest and most restrictive: D can be one of only two possible types (i.e., S is unsure whether D's probability of prevailing in a battle, ψ, is high or low), and the states' resources are so constrained that there can be no more than two battles.10Smith and Stam (2003) and Slantchev (2003) trade a somewhat simpler formulation of the costly process for a richer treatment of the dynamics of bargaining. They abstract away from the resource constraint but do not impose exogenous limits on the number of offers. Slantchev's alternating‐offer formulation also allows him to study signaling, albeit in a limited setting where D is one of only three possible types.11 The costly process in the present formulation is the simplest, abstracting away from both the effects of the ebb and flow of battle and from any resource constraints. But the analysis places fewer restrictions on S's uncertainty about D, and this allows for a more general treatment of the learning and updating that occurs while fighting.12 And, as will be seen below, the model can be readily extended to allow for multiple offers between battles.         "
"14","A satisfied state in a costly‐lottery game faces a trade off when deciding what to offer the dissatisfied state. The more the satisfied state concedes, the better the chances of a settlement but the worse the terms of that settlement. The optimal offer that resolves this trade off typically entails some risk that the dissatisfied state will reject the offer and go to war."
"15","In the costly‐process game, the satisfied state confronts the same trade off when making its first offer, and the optimal offer usually entails some risk of rejection and fighting. But this fighting generally does not end the game. With probability 1 −k, neither state collapses during the first round of fighting, and the bargaining continues. The satisfied state updates its beliefs based on the facts that (i) the dissatisfied state rejected the opening offer and that (ii) the dissatisfied state fought one round without collapsing. In light of these updated beliefs, the satisfied state makes a second offer which, like the first, usually carries some risk of rejection. The bargaining continues in this way until the dissatisfied state accepts an offer; one of the states collapses; or there is so little uncertainty left that S's optimal offer is to concede enough to buy D off and thereby end the bargaining.         "
"16","These offers define the basic screening process that characterizes the equilibrium, and this process is the same regardless of the source of uncertainty. When there is uncertainty over D's cost of fighting, high‐cost types accept smaller offers and settle earlier than do low‐cost types who hang on longer and run greater risks of collapse in order to obtain larger concessions. More specifically, S's offers x1 < x2 < x3 < ⋯ < xn induce a set of cut points  such that the dissatisfied state counters all of the satisfied state's offers by fighting until it accepts xj (assuming that neither of the states has already collapsed) if its actual cost of fighting d is between  and . Similarly, S's concessions when there is uncertainty over the distribution of power induces a set of cut points  such that the dissatisfied state counters the satisfied state's offers by fighting until accepting xj if the dissatisfied state's probability of collapse kD is between . Stating the results more formally:         "
"17","Proposition 1.   Suppose that               S               is satisfied, Dis dissatisfied, and thatS'sbeliefs aboutD'scost of fighting satisfy the technical assumptions specified in the appendix. Then there is a generically unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium. In it, S makes a finite number of offers which are strictly increasing. D responds to these concessions by fighting until ultimately accepting an offer. The lowerD'scostd, the longerDfights and the better terms it obtains, i.e., dfights at least as long asd′ifd < d′.            "
"18","Proposition 2.   Suppose that               S               is satisfied, Dis dissatisfied, and thatS's beliefs aboutD's probability of collapse satisfy the technical assumptions specified in the appendix. Then there is a generically unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium. In it, S makes finitely many offers which are strictly increasing. Dresponds to these concessions by fighting until ultimately accepting an offer. The more powerfulD, the longer it fights and the better terms it obtains, i.e., kDfights at least as long askD′ifkD < kD′.            "
"19","The demonstration of these results is extremely tedious. The appendix outlines the basic logic of the overall argument and proves key lemmas. Powell (2003) provides a more complete analysis.            "
"20","Although the screening processes are broadly similar regardless of the source of uncertainty, there are subtle differences in the learning processes underlying them. Wagner (2000) argues that the bargaining and learning that take place when there is uncertainty over the distribution of power are different and simpler than they are in standard economic models of bargaining in which, say, a buyer has private information about how much he is willing to pay for an object for sale.            "
"21","                              "
"22","In the standard bargaining models used in economics, private information explains why agreement is not immediate, but the only way that bargainers have to reveal their private information is by temporarily refusing to agree. Since they determine whether and how long they will hold out, they have an incentive to use this decision to misrepresent their private information. As a result, the signals they give by deciding whether to hold out or not are noisy and can be interpreted only by taking into account the strategic incentives of the bargainers …"
"23","                              "
"24","Bargaining in the context of war is different, in that fighting is a source of information that is much less subject to manipulation by adversaries (2000, 478)."
"25","To the extent that Wagner's argument holds, it goes beyond the economic models of bargaining. It also applies to costly‐process models of war in which states have private information over the cost of fighting as in the model above. (See Kim 2002 for another example.) The only way that states can signal their costs in these models, as in the standard bargaining models in economics, is by refusing to agree.            "
"26","However, the analysis underlying Proposition 2 shows that Wagner is only partially correct. When there is asymmetric information about the distribution of power, fighting does convey some information that, in a certain sense, is less subject to strategic manipulation. But this less manipulable channel does not replace the more manipulable channel present in the standard models. Both channels are present."
"27","In asymmetric‐information models, one actor learns about another actor or, more specifically, about another actor's type by watching how that actor behaves and then updating its beliefs about that actor's type in light of the observed behavior. Suppose, for example, that a seller makes an offer that one type of buyer, say b, is more likely to reject than type b′ is. If the buyer subsequently does reject this offer, then the seller reasons backwards from this behavior and, applying Bayes' law, becomes more confident that it is facing type b who was more likely to reject the offer.            "
"28","In what Wagner calls the standard model, learning depends on different types behaving differently. If two types behave identically, their behavior does not reveal anything that helps another actor distinguish between them. Suppose, for instance, that b and b′ are equally likely to reject an offer that is ultimately rejected. The seller learns nothing about the relative likelihood of these two types from this rejection because both types would have behaved in the same way.            "
"29","In contrast to the standard models, fighting when there is uncertainty over the distribution of power does convey information about types even if they behave in the same way. Suppose, for example, that the satisfied state is trying to distinguish between types kD and kD′ where kD is less likely to collapse than kD′ (kD < kD′) and therefore is more powerful. At the outset of the game, S believes that D's probability of collapse is distributed according to Θ with density θ. Consequently, the odds that S is facing kD rather than kD′ are given by the ratio θ(kD)/θ(kD′). Assume further that in equilibrium both of these types reject S's initial offer. In a standard model, the odds of facing kD or kD′ would remain θ(kD)/θ(kD′) because both types behave in the same way. But the fact that both types fought and did not collapse reveals information about them even though they behaved identically.            "
"30","To see that this is the case, observe that the chances that D's probability of collapse is kD given that it fought once and did not collapse is the probability of not collapsing, (1 −kD), times the prior θ(kD). Consequently, the odds of kD versus kD′ given that D did not collapse in the first round of fighting are (1 −kD)θ(kD)/[(1 −kD′)θ(kD′)]. These updated odds are greater than the initial odds θ(kD)/θ(kD′) because kD < kD′. Thus, the satisfied state becomes more confident that it is facing the more powerful type kD relative to kD′ even though both types behaved identically. Indeed, the odds of facing kD increase with each round of fighting. If these types have fought r times without collapsing, the odds rise to (1 −kD)rθ(kD)/[(1 −kD′)rθ(kD′)]. This is the sense in which fighting conveys information that is less subject to strategic manipulation.            "
"31","Fighting, however, is only one of the ways that information is conveyed when there is asymmetric information. Dissatisfied types also have an incentive to misrepresent their types by delaying an agreement in order to appear “tougher” just as they do in standard models. To verify this, consider S's beliefs about D when making the r+ 1‐st offer, xr+1. The proof of Proposition 2 shows that these beliefs depend on the prior Θ(kD) updated in light of the facts that D fought r times without collapsing and that kD must be no more than kr (otherwise D would have accepted a previous offer).            "
"32","To formalize this updating, define the posterior distribution Θr(kD) to be the prior distribution Θ given that D has fought r times without collapsing. This updated distribution is . Then, S's beliefs when making the r+ 1‐st offer are given by Θr conditional on kD < kr, i.e., by Θr(kD)/Θr(kr).            "
"33","The fact that S's beliefs depend on both the distribution Θr and the cut point kr means that information is conveyed through two channels when there is uncertainty over the distribution of power. Θr reflects the first channel. It depends solely on the prior Θ and the number of previous rounds of fighting. The cut point kr captures the effects of the second channel. This cut point is the type that is indifferent between accepting the r‐th offer and fighting one round before accepting the next offer. But, S's next offer depends on its beliefs when making that offer, and these beliefs depend on the cut point kr. Hence, which types hold on for the next offer and what S offers next are strategically interdependent. This means that the signals dissatisfied types send “by deciding whether to hold out or not are noisy and can be interpreted only by taking into account the strategic incentives of the bargainers” (Wagner 2000, 478) even when there is uncertainty about the distribution of power.            "
"34","In sum, bargaining while fighting when there is uncertainty or, more precisely, asymmetric information about the distribution of power does not substitute one channel of conveying information which is less manipulable for another. This type of bargaining combines both channels."
"35","The preceding suggests that it may be quite difficult empirically to distinguish conflicts that arise because of uncertainty over costs or from those due to uncertainty over the distribution of power. Propositions 1 and 2 show that the basic screening processes are the same in the model regardless of the source of uncertainty and, consequently, cannot be used to differentiate between these sources.13 Although the learning processes are subtly different, it seems doubtful that this difference could provide a basis for distinguishing between these sources given the limitations of the data that generally exist in international relations. This section proposes one way of differentiating between these two sources of uncertainty based on the idea that states can often make offers much more quickly than they can prepare for battle.14 The analysis also demonstrates that the bargaining environment in informational explanations of war may play a critical role in shaping the dynamics of conflict, e.g., the duration of the fighting. The potential significance of these effects suggests that empirical studies need to take these effects into account.         "
"36","To modify the model to allow for multiple offers between battles, suppose that S can make m offers between battles. That is, the states pay “mobilization” or “preparation” costs if the dissatisfied state “fights” in Figure 1(b) in response to the first m− 1 offers by preparing to fight. (The substantive interpretation of these costs and their relation to the cost of fighting in the one‐offer‐per‐battle game are discussed below.) But the states do not actually fight and therefore run no risk of collapse. If, however, the dissatisfied state fights in response to the m‐th offer, the states do run a risk of collapse.         "
"37","The ability to make multiple offers before having to run the risk of collapse affects the screening processes differently. If there is uncertainty over costs and if the number of offers between battles, m, is sufficiently large, then the states settle before they ever fight. If, by contrast, the states are uncertain about the distribution of power, screening requires that there must be some chance that the states fight regardless of the number of offers per battle. This suggests that crises driven by uncertainty over costs will frequently settle short of large scale fighting while those driven by uncertainty over the distribution of power are more likely to entail significant fighting.         "
"38","More formally, suppose there are m offers per battle where the time between offers is Δ≡ 1/m (and, therefore, the total time between battles is mΔ= 1 as it is in the one‐offer‐per‐battle game above). S begins the game by making an offer which D can accept or counter by fighting or waiting. If D waits, S decides whether to fight or wait after which the round ends. If either state decides to fight, S and D pay costs sm and dm, but there is no risk of collapse. The game continues in this way through m − 1 offers. If, however, the states fight in the m‐th round, then S and D collapse with probabilities kS and kD, respectively. If neither collapses, there is no further risk of collapse until S makes the 2m‐th offer. The game continues this way until the states agree on a settlement or one of them collapses. Finally, the discount factor and the states' payoffs are adjusted in order to make the games comparable regardless of the number of offers between battles.15"
"39","Now consider the equilibrium screening process in the m‐offer game in which S is uncertain of D's cost. Because D pays this cost whether or not the states generate any risk of collapse, S, not surprisingly, can still use its offers to screen the dissatisfied state even when rejecting those offers entails no risk of collapse. Furthermore, Proposition 3 shows that the bargaining satisfies the Coase conjecture which posits that the outcome of the bargaining will be efficient, i.e., the bargaining is virtually certain to end almost immediately if the time between offers is small enough (or, equivalently, if the number of offers m is large enough).16"
"40","Proposition 3.   For any               ɛ > 0, there exists anMsuch that the probability that the bargaining ends by time ɛ is greater than1 −ɛwhenever the number of offers‐per‐battle is at leastM.            "
"41","Proof:  See the appendix for a sketch.            "
"42","The screening dynamics are different if S is uncertain of the distribution of power. If there is any bargaining at all, then there must be some chance that the states fight at least one battle. If, that is, S does not initially offer enough to buy off the toughest type  (and, therefore, any other type), then there must be a positive probability that the states actually fight a battle. (The appendix also establishes a condition sufficient to ensure that S does not immediately end the game by offering enough to buy  off at the outset of the game.)            "
"43","Proposition 4.   Suppose               S               is uncertain of the distribution of power in the               m‐offer game. Then the game either ends immediately withS's offering enough to buy off the toughest type it might be facing, namely, or there is a positive probability that the states fight at least one battle.            "
"44","See the appendix for a formal discussion of this result. To sketch the basic argument, suppose S's first offer is x1 and  strictly prefers waiting for a subsequent offer, say xj, that S makes no later than round m, i.e., before any fighting takes place. This leads to a contradiction. Because all types kD pay the same cost dm and do not have to run any risk of collapse in order to obtain xj, the payoff to accepting x1 or waiting for xj is the same for all types. Hence, all kD are sure to reject S's initial offer x1 and wait for xj because  strictly prefers waiting for xj. But this is a contradiction as it is straightforward to show that S never makes an offer in equilibrium which is sure to be rejected because S could do better by simply skipping that offer.17"
"45","Two conclusions follow from these results. First, to the extent that asymmetric information is the underlying cause, crises due to uncertainty over the distribution of power seem likely to last longer and entail more fighting than those growing out of uncertainty over costs.18 Indeed, there may be little or no fighting in the latter case if states can make offers quickly.            "
"46","The second, broader conclusion is that the bargaining environment through which actors convey information may play a critical role in informational accounts of war and, especially, of prolonged conflict. Costly‐lottery models obscure this role, and its importance has heretofore not been fully appreciated in either theoretical or empirical work on war. For example, existing empirical studies of duration (e.g., Bennett and Stam 1996) tend to focus on factors like the states' total military capabilities and the distribution of power and do not consider the bargaining environment in which the underlying conflicts play out. But the results above show that features of the bargaining environment such as how fast states can make offers can swamp the effects that factors like the distribution of power have on the duration of war."
"47","This second conclusion requires elaboration for it depends on a careful interpretation of “costs” and, more subtly, of the relation between formal results and their substantive meaning. In the one‐offer‐per‐battle model, s and d conflate the economic costs of mobilizing and preparing for war with the costs of actually fighting, the loss of life and physical destruction. This is also true of other costly‐process models (e.g., Filson and Werner 2002; Slantchev 2003; Smith and Stam 2003) and the costly‐lottery models.            "
"48","The multiple‐offer model makes it possible, indeed requires, that these costs be separated. Let dp be D's per‐period cost of preparing to fight and df be its cost of fighting. Then the total cost of preparing for and fighting a battle, which is simply s in the one‐offer game, can be broken down into the total cost of mobilizing in m− 1 rounds plus the cost of fighting in the m‐th round. In symbols,  where δm=δ1/m is the comparable discount rate for the m‐offer game (see footnote 15).            "
"49","The discussion above assumed that dp and df were equal, i.e., dp=df=dm. If, alternatively, these costs are unequal but directly related to each other with higher mobilization costs associated with higher costs of fighting, then S can still screen D during the mobilization phase (i.e., during the m− 1 offers preceding a battle) because continuing to mobilize in order to secure a better offer costs different types different amounts. Proposition 3, therefore, continues to hold.            "
"50","Suppose, however, that dp and df are completely unrelated and that the mobilization costs are the same for every type of D, i.e., what distinguishes different types of D are their costs of fighting df. If so, then S can no longer use dp to screen D during the mobilization phase and results analogous to those in Proposition 4 obtain: There must be some chance of fighting if the game does not end immediately.19"
"51","All of this underscores the potential sensitivity of informational accounts of war to the bargaining environment—to the sources of uncertainty and the ability to resolve that uncertainty.20 This sensitivity means that future informational efforts should either include some robustness checks for a particular formalization of the bargaining environment or they should ground that formalization empirically. For example, a satisfactory explanation of prolonged fighting that only holds if the states cannot make offers quickly must also explain in an empirically convincing way why the states cannot make offers quickly.            "
"52","Modeling war as a game‐ending move has proved enormously useful both theoretically and empirically. But this simplification necessarily limits the scope of the analysis to the origins of war. Investigating the strategic interaction inherent in the conduct of war requires more explicit models of the process of fighting."
"53","The present study sees war as a process during which the states can continue to bargain while facing a risk of military collapse. The model also allows for uncertainty over the costs of fighting or over the distribution of power. In equilibrium, the satisfied state, regardless of the source of uncertainty, makes a series of ever more attractive offers. These offers screen the dissatisfied state with tougher types (i.e., stronger or low‐cost types) fighting longer in order to secure a better agreement but at the cost of running a greater risk of military collapse. There are, however, subtle differences in the underlying learning processes associated with each source of uncertainty. When there is uncertainty over the distribution of power, fighting itself conveys information even about types that behave identically."
"54","To distinguish between conflicts arising from these different sources, the analysis made an identifying assumption: States can make offers more quickly than they can prepare for and fight battles. In these circumstances, crises arising from uncertainty over costs are likely to be shorter and entail less fighting (and in the limit no fighting). By contrast, crises resulting from uncertainty over the distribution of power are likely to be longer and entail significant fighting."
"55","Finally, the critical role that the bargaining environment plays in the present analysis and is likely to play in other informational accounts of war poses a challenge for future work. Future efforts to explain conflict, especially prolonged conflict, in terms of informational problems must give detailed attention to and a plausible empirical account of the mechanism through which the bargainers can and cannot convey information."
"56","Some preliminaries are needed before sketching the arguments. Recall that the distribution of power, p=kS(1 −τ)/k+qkSτ/k, is D's expected territorial share resulting from a fight to the finish. (For expositional ease, it will be convenient to use the simpler notation τ instead of kD to represent D's probability of collapse where .) The distribution of power can be interpreted in another way which will be useful in specifying the states' payoffs. Suppose the game is in a round, say m, and ends in that round because one or both of the states collapses in that round. Then, the distribution of power is also equivalent to the expected territorial division resulting from that collapse. To establish this, note that the probability that S alone collapses given that one of the states collapses is kS(1 −τ)/k, and the probability that S and D collapse given that one of them does is kSτ/k. Hence, the first term in the expression for p is the total territory (i.e., one) weighted by the conditional probability that S alone collapses, and the second term is D's status quo share q times the conditional probability that both states collapse. Thus, p is D's expected territorial share conditional on the game's ending in a specific round because one or both states collapses in that round.            "
"57","To formalize the payoffs, suppose that the states agree at time a to territorial division x after fighting at times f1, f2, … , fn. The probability that the game ends when the states fight for the m‐th time in period fm is the probability that the states do not collapse during their first m− 1 fights and then do.

Equation (A1) immediately implies that Wn+1|r(y|τ) is strictly increasing in τ. The continuity of W*n and  also ensures that Wn+1|r(y|τ) is continuous in y.

"80","To see that  is nonincreasing, let τ′ > τ. Since offering y induces the same cut point regardless of whether the current state is τ′ or τ (see Equation A1), Wn+1|r(y|τ′) −Wn+1|r(y|τ) = (1 −y)[Φr+1(τ′) −Φr+1(τ)]. Consequently,                  "

The expected next offer e is also a function of y since y∈γn+1|r(τ) implies y= (1 −δ)(q−d) +δkS[1 −τ(1 −q)]+δ(1 −kS)(1 −τ)e for some  and τ is a function of y.

Since  is nonincreasing, the previous inequality reduces to the contradiction . This contradiction guarantees  is nonincreasing.

"114","Since  and , the expression on the right of the previous inequality is at least as large as RΣr(τ′) (see equation A2 above). Hence, W*N|r(τ′) =M*r(τ′) ≥RΣr(τ′) which leaves RΣr(τ′) =M*r(τ′) =W*N|r(τ′).               "
"115","It follows that  is a reservation‐offer strategy. To see that (i) holds, suppose S offers y in state (τi, r), and consider any  for which . (If , there is nothing to show as  is a reservation‐offer strategy and consequently  implies .) Suppose further that the next state, τi+1, is weakly bounded above by . Then the definition of  ensures that the next state τi+2 is strictly bounded above by . Arguing now by contradiction, assume . Then, . Hence,  accepts in period i+ 1.               "
"116","Now let y′ be in the support of S's possibly mixed offer e′ made in state (τi+1, r+ 1). Then y′∈σN|r+1(τi+1) as RΣr+1(τi+1) =M*r+1(τi+1) since . This implies e′ is an element of  and bounded above by .               "
"117","A contradiction follows as . But  since  and  is nonincreasing. This gives . Type , therefore, strictly prefers accepting y in period i to fighting for e′ in period i+ 1, and this contradicts the fact that  accepts in period i+ 1. Thus, (i) holds if .               "
"118","Now suppose , and consider that case in which S offers yj+1 in state τj where  and . (Such an offer must exist as S only makes finitely many proposals before offering .) Since τj > τj+1, yj+1 is accepted with positive probability. Hence, yj+1 > y where, recall, y is what S offered in state τi. Repeating the argument above again yields a contradiction. Hence, (i) holds for .               "
"119","Turning to (ii), let τi and τi+1 be the current and subsequent cut points. Take a  and y such that  and . To see that , assume the contrary. That  implies RΣr+1(τi+1) =M*r+1(τi+1) and, therefore, that S offers a y′∈σN|r+1(τi+1) in state τi+1. Hence, S's expected offer in state τi+1, e′, satisfies . This leaves . Since this inequality is strict, there exists a ζ > 0 such that  and all  strictly prefer fighting for e′ to accepting y. But, this contradicts the assumption that τi+1 is the state in period i+ 1 because  implies that  are still in the game in period i and prefer not to settle in period i. This contradiction means (ii) holds.               "
"120","Thus,  is a reservation‐offer strategy. Repeating the argument shows that  is a reservation‐offer strategy where . Since ɛ > 0, further repetition eventually ensures that  is a reservation‐offer strategy.     ▪               "
"121","In sum, Lemmas 10 and 11 show that a set of offers and states is a PBE path of the game if and only if it solves . Lemmas 5, 6, and 8 ensure that S's offers are finite, strictly decreasing, and deterministic. This yields the stronger version of Proposition 2:               "
"122","Proposition 2a.   Suppose that                  S                  is satisfied, Dis dissatisfied, and thatS's beliefs aboutD's probability of collapse satisfy the technical assumptions discussed above. Then, there exists a smallestN≥ 0such thatσN|0(τ) =σN+j|0(τ)for allj≥ 0and. Ndefines the set of PBEs:S's initial offer in any PBE is an element of. S's subsequent offers are a function ofS's initial offer, strictly decreasing, and deterministic.               "
"123","Turning to the m‐offer‐per‐battle game, define FDm(i) for 1 ≤i≤m to be D's expected payoff to fighting to the finish given i offers to go before the first battle. Then D's payoff to fighting to the finish from the outset of the game when there are m offers before the first battle is . If there are fewer than m offers until the first battle (i < m), then D rejects i offers before fighting and then rejects m offers before fighting again. Consequently, D's expected payoff is .            "
"124","A type is dissatisfied in the m‐offer game as in the 1‐offer game, if its expected payoff to fighting to the finish from the outset is strictly larger than the payoff to living with the status quo. Thus, dm is dissatisfied if FDm(m) > qm/(1 −δm). Rewriting this expression in terms of q, d, and δ shows that D is dissatisfied in the m‐offer game if and only if it is dissatisfied in the 1‐offer game, i.e., if and only if δk(p−q) −d(1 −δ) > 0. Note that the closer a dissatisfied type is to fighting, the higher its payoff to fighting to the finish: FDm(i′) > FDm(i) for 1 ≤i′ < i≤m.            "
"125","Now consider an m‐offer game in which S is uncertain of D's cost but believes it to be distributed according to Gm(dm) ≡G(dm(1 −δ)/(1 −δm)). If m is sufficiently large, agreement is reached almost immediately with no fighting and Proposition 3 as stated above holds. The proof is a very tedious extension of a standard argument. (See Fudenberg and Tirole (1999, 411‐12) for a discussion.) The basic idea is to show that if Proposition 3 does not hold, then S can increase its payoff by skipping an offer and speeding up the bargaining.            "
"126","Proposition 4 shows that if S is uncertain of the distribution of power, then there is a positive probability of fighting whenever there is any bargaining. The proposition also establishes a condition sufficient to ensure that there is some delay.            "
"127","Proposition 4.   Suppose that                  S                  is uncertain about the distribution of power in the                  m‐offer‐per‐battle game. In equilibrium, eitherSinitially offersand the game ends immediately, orstrictly prefers to wait until after the first battle to accept an offer in which case there is a positive probability that the states fight at least one battle. Suppose, further, that; thatis the type that is indifferent between acceptingx*and fighting one battle forin the one‐offer‐per‐battle game; and thatfor any. Then there is always delay in equilibrium.               "
"128","Proof:  The argument for the first claim is sketched above in the text. The key to the second claim is to consider an xm that if offered on the eve of battle in the m‐offer game induces the same cut point that  would induce in a one‐offer‐per‐battle game.     ▪               "
