"1","The following is a review of the theoretical framework in Fair (1978), modified slightly to be able to deal with House elections at the end of this section. Consider a presidential election. Assume that there are only two political parties, Democratic (D) and Republican (R), and consider a presidential election held at time t. (An election held at time t will be referred to as election t.) Let UDit denote voter i's expected future utility if the Democratic candidate is elected, and let URit denote the same thing if the Republican candidate is elected. These expectations should be considered as being made at time t. Let Vit be a variable that is equal to 1 if voter i votes for the Democratic candidate and to 0 if voter i votes for the Republican candidate. The first main postulate of the model is that               "
"2","Let td1 denote the last election from t back that the Democratic party was in power; let td2 denote the second‐to‐last election from t back that the Democratic party was in power; let tr1 and tr2 denote the same things for the Republican party; and let Mj denote some measure of economic performance of the party in power during the four years1 prior to election j. If the Democratic party was in power at time t, then td1 is equal to t; otherwise tr1 is equal to t. Also, let DPERDt be equal to 1 if a Democratic incumbent is running again and 0 otherwise, and let DPERRt be equal to 1 if a Republican incumbent is running again and 0 otherwise. Finally, let DURDt denote a duration variable that is 1 if the Democratic party has been in power for two consecutive terms, 1 +k if three consecutive terms, 1 +2k if four consecutive terms, and so on, and 0 otherwise, and let DURRt denote the similar variable for the Republican party. k is chosen in the empirical work on best‐fitting grounds. The value chosen was 0.25, although the results are not sensitive to alternative values like 0.00 and 0.50. The second main postulate of the model is that               "
"3"," Equations (2) and (3) determine how expectations are formed, and, as discussed in Fair (1978), they are general enough to incorporate the theories of Downs (1957), Kramer (1971), and Stigler (1973). Kramer's theory is a special case, where ρ=∞ and β1=β3. In Stigler's theory voters weight both recent and past periods, but recent periods more, which corresponds to a positive (but not infinite) value of ρ. Downs's theory is probably best characterized as one in which voters acquire more information than Kramer assumes, but less than Stigler assumes. Thus, for example, β2 and β4 might be zero for Downs but not for Stigler.            "
"4","The DPER and DUR variables in equations (2) and (3) are picking up opposite effects. The duration variable says that expected future utility under an incumbent party is lower, other things being equal, the longer the party has been in power. The person variable says that expected future utility under an incumbent party is higher, other things being equal, if the president himself (himself so far) is running again. In the first case a lack of variety decreases utility—a party wears out its welcome—and in the second case it increases it—a president himself is a familiar figure, and this may add to expected future utility. It will be seen that both of these variables are significant in the presidential vote equation, with opposite signs.            "
"5","Three further “aggregation” assumptions are needed to allow an aggregate voting equation to be estimated. The first is that the coefficients β1, β2, β3, β4, γ1, γ2, and ρ in equations (2) and (3) are the same for all voters and that all voters use the same measure of performance and the same value of M*. Differences across voters are reflected only in the ξDit and ξRit variables. Let               "
"6","The second aggregation assumption is that ψit is evenly distributed across voters in each election between a+δt and b+δt, where a < 0 and b > 0. δt is specific to election t, but a and b are constant across all elections. The third aggregation assumption is that there are an infinite number of voters in each election. The last two assumptions imply that ψt is uniformly distributed between a+δt and b+δt, where the i subscript is now dropped from ψit. The probability density function for ψt, denoted f(ψt), is               "
"7","Let Vt denote the Democratic share of the two‐party vote in election t. From the above assumptions, Vt is equal to the probability that ψt is less than or equal to qt. The probability that ψt is less than or equal to qt is merely the cumulative distribution function evaluated at qt, so that2"
"8","                "
"9","To review the theory, ψit in equation (4) is the Republican “bias,” positive or negative, for voter i for election t. qt in equation (5) is the difference in expected future utility for each voter between the Democratic and Republican candidates from the economic measures and the DPER and DUR variables. Equation (6) says that voter i votes for the Democratic candidate if qt exceeds ψit and for the Republican candidate otherwise. Equation (7) then states how the Republican bias is distributed across voters in election t. If, for example, δt is randomly distributed across elections, then the bias is randomly distributed across elections. The bias is zero for election t if a=−b and δt= 0.            "
"10","Note that the right‐hand side variables in equations (2) and (3) are meant to be causal—to directly affect expected future utility. They are not simply meant to be correlated with expected future utility. For example, a survey of voters asking them how they think the president is doing or how they plan to vote is likely to be correlated with their expected future utility under each party, but it is not that their answers directly affect their expected future utility. Their answers are just reflecting it. Survey variables are thus not appropriate for the theory.3"
"11","In the empirical work in Fair (1978), which considered only presidential elections, the hypothesis that β1=β3 was tested and not rejected. In addition, the estimates of ρ were very large, and for practical purposes they were infinite. The results thus supported Kramer's (1971) theory over those of Downs (1957) and Stigler (1973). If β1=β3 and ρ is infinite, equation (11) becomes4"
"12","Finally, nothing precludes there being more than one measure of performance. Assume that Mt is a linear function of three economic variables:               "
"13","The term α6It in equation (14) requires some explanation. This term is in the equation because the “normal” or “neutral” values M*1, M*2, and M*3 are not necessarily zero. If they were all zero, then It would not appear in the equation. It is a party dummy variable, which is 1 if the Democrats are in power at the time of the election and −1 if the Republicans are in power. It could be, although not derived from the above theory, that It has a direct effect on Vt—that, other things being equal, Vt is larger when the Democrats are in power than when the Republicans are, or vice versa. This possibility cannot be tested because, as just noted, It appears in the equation for another reason. But it could be in the estimation that It is picking up in part a direct party effect.            "
"14","Consider first the on‐term House elections. If it is the case that voters praise or blame the party in power in the White House for the economy, then the above theory can with one exception carry over directly to the on‐term House elections, where the “party in power” means the party in the White House. The exception is the question of how to incorporate the possibility that a party's vote share in the previous House election has an effect on its vote share in the current House election."
"15","One way to do this is to assume that δt depends on the previous vote share:               "
"16","Without considering the lagged vote share variable and under the assumptions that β1=β3 and that ρ is infinite, equation (14) is relevant for the on‐term House elections, where the left‐hand‐side variable is the Democratic share of the two‐party on‐term House vote. In the theory, just realize that “candidate” means candidate for representative rather than for president and that all voters in the country are included in the distribution of the Republican bias variable, ψit. Postulating that δt is determined as in equation (15) has the effect of simply adding Vcct−2 to the right‐hand side of equation (14). Since εt=−δt/(b−a), equation (15) can be solved for εt and this expression substituted into equation (14). Equation (14) is the same except that the constant term is now α0−θ0/(b−a) + 50θ1/(b−a), the coefficient on Vcct−2 is −θ1/(b−a), and the error term is −ηt/(b−a). Since θ1 is negative, the coefficient on Vcct−2 is positive. Equation (14) as so modified is the equation that is estimated in the next section for the on‐term House elections.            "
"17","Consider now the midterm House elections. Again, if it is the case that voters praise or blame the party in power in the White House for the economy, then the above theory can be carried over, although the time period for the measure of performance is different. For presidential and on‐term House elections the time period is the 15 quarters prior to the election, whereas for midterm House elections the time period since the new (or reelected) president has taken over is only seven quarters.6 Also, the variable DPER is not relevant because there is no presidential election at the same time. Regarding possible effects of previous vote shares, if a party's vote shares in both the previous presidential election and the previous on‐term House election affect the party's vote share in the current midterm House election, this can be incorporated into the theory by assuming that               "
"18","Without considering the lagged vote share variables, equation (14) is also relevant for the midterm House elections, where the left‐hand‐side variable is the Democratic share of the two‐party midterm House vote. Also, the DPER variable is dropped, and the time period for the economic variables is just the first seven quarters of an administration, not the first 15. Postulating that δt is determined as in equation (16) has the effect of simply adding Vct−2 and Vpt−2 to the right‐hand side of equation (14). Again, since εt=−δt/(b−a), equation (16) can be solved for εt and this expression substituted into equation (14). Equation (14) is the same except that the constant term is now α0−φ0/(b−a) + 50φ1/(b−a) + 50φ2/(b−a), the coefficient on Vcct−2 is −φ1/(b−a), the coefficient on Vpt−2 is −φ2/(b−a), and the error term is −μt/(b−a). Since φ1 is negative, the coefficient on Vct−2 is positive, and since φ2 is positive, the coefficient on Vpt−2 is negative. Equation (14) as so modified is the equation that is estimated in the next section for the midterm House elections.            "
"19","The variables that are used in the estimation work are listed in Table 1. The coefficient estimates are presented in Table 2: there is one estimate for the presidential equation and two each for the on‐term and midterm House elections. Table 3 presents the predicted values and estimated residuals from these five regressions.            "
"20","Consider first the presidential equation. The first economic variable, G, is the growth rate (at an annual rate) of real per capita GDP in the first three quarters of the election year. The second, P, is the absolute value of the inflation rate (at an annual rate) in the first 15 quarters of the administration. The third, Z, is the number of quarters in the first 15 in which the growth rate of per capita GDP exceeded 3.2% at an annual rate. There is thus one short horizon variable, G, and two that pertain to the entire period of the administration up to the time of the election, P and Z.            "
"21","The variable Z is a “good news” variable in that it measures the number of quarters in the administration in which the growth rate was noticeably strong. There is some evidence from psychology experiments that people tend to remember extreme outcomes more than normal ones, and Z can be considered to be a measure of extreme positive growth outcomes. Like the value for k in the definition of DUR, the cutoff value of 3.2% for Z was chosen on best‐fitting grounds. As discussed below, values of 2.7 and 3.7 gave similar results. A “bad news” variable was also tried, but it was not significant in any of the specifications.            "
"22","The other explanatory variables in the presidential equation have been discussed in the second section except for WAR. The values of P and Z are unusually large for the elections of 1920, 1944, and 1948, due in large part to the world wars, and they have been zeroed out in the estimation. The values of G in the years 1920, 1944, and 1948 seemed less affected by the wars, and so G was retained for these elections. This treatment of P and Z leads to the WAR variable being an explanatory variable in equation (14). To see this, assume that in equation (13) both (M2t−M*2) and (M3t−M*3) are multiplied by (1 −WARt), where WARt is 1 in 1920, 1944, and 1948, and 0 otherwise. This then adds WARt as an explanatory variable in equation (14) with a coefficient of λ1β1ω2M*2+λ1β1ω3M*3. WARt is thus added to the equation because of M*2 and M*3.            "
"23","The estimate of the coefficient of It is −2.74, with a t‐statistic of −1.08. As discussed following equation (14) above, in the theory the coefficient of It is picking up the fact that M*1, M*2, and M*3 are not necessarily zero. In the theory there is no direct party effect, although in the estimation it could be that the estimate of the coefficient of It is in part picking up a direct party effect. This cannot be tested.            "
"24","The estimates of the presidential equation in Table 2 show that the three economic variables are significant, as are DPER and DUR. A one percentage point increase in the growth rate leads to a 0.680 percentage point increase in the vote share; a one percentage point increase in the inflation rate leads to a 0.657 decrease in the vote share, and an increase in the number of strong growth quarters by one leads to an increase in the vote share of 1.075 percentage points. If an incumbent is running again, there is an advantage of 3.30 percentage points. The estimated standard error is 2.54 percentage points. The estimated residuals in Table 3 show that for the 2004 election the Democratic share was underpredicted by 3.4 percentage points: President Bush should have done better according to the equation.            "
"25","The original specification of the presidential equation is in Fair (1978), and over the years some specification changes have been made as new observations have become available. Because of the small number of observations, data mining—spurious correlation—is a potentially serious problem in the process of searching for explanatory variables. Possible data mining issues in the present case are (1) the use of 3.2% as the cutoff for the Z variable and the use of .25 in the definition of DUR, both of which were chosen on best‐fitting grounds, (2) not counting Ford as an incumbent running again for the DPER variable, and (3) the adjustments for the two world wars regarding P and Z (but not G). There is, however, some evidence in support of the view that data mining is not a problem. First, the specification of the presidential equation has not changed since the 1992 election. The specification that was used for the estimation period through 1992 (specified in 1994) is the same one that was used for the estimation periods through 1996, 2000, and 2004. The only change since 1992 has been the reestimation of the equation through the latest data. The equation has thus been around in its present form for over 12 years.            "
"26","Second, when the equation is estimated only through 1960 (12 observations), the coefficient estimates are fairly stable.7 Both G and Z are still highly significant, and P has a t‐statistic of −1.42. Third, the coefficient estimates are fairly robust to 1) the use of 2.7 or 3.7% instead of 3.2% as the cutoff for the Z variable, 2) the use of 0.00 or 0.50 instead of 0.25 as the increment for the DUR variable, and 3) counting Ford as an incumbent running again for the DPER variable. The results are more sensitive to the treatment of the two world wars. If the adjustment for the wars is not made, the t‐statistic for the inflation variable falls in absolute value to −1.56, although both G and Z remain significant with only slightly smaller coefficient estimates. The fits are worse if the growth variable is only for the second and third quarters of the election year or for the four quarters before the election, but the growth variable always remains highly significant. The inflation variable loses its significance if only 11 quarters or only seven quarters before the election are used instead of 15, although its coefficient estimate is always negative. The presidential equation is thus fairly robust; it seems unlikely that the significance of the economic variables is spurious.            "
"27","None of the lagged‐share variables was significant when added to the presidential equation. When Vp−4− 50 was added, it had a coefficient estimate of 0.030 with a t‐statistic of 0.17. When Vc−4− 50 was added, it had a coefficient estimate of 0.177 with a t‐statistic of 1.06. When Vcc−2− 50 was added, it had a coefficient estimate of 0.036 with a t‐statistic of 0.23.            "
"28","No new explanatory variables are required for the on‐term House equation except the lagged value of the midterm House share, denoted Vcc−2 in Table 2. Two estimates are presented for this equation, one where the three economic variables are unconstrained and one where the weights on these variables are constrained to be those estimated in the presidential equation. The duration variable, DUR, was not close to being significant in any of the House regressions, and so it was dropped from the estimation for the House equations. (It has a coefficient estimate of 0.271 with a t‐statistic of 0.27 when added to equation 2a in Table 2, and it has a coefficient estimate of −0.462 with a t‐statistic of −0.45 when added to equation 3a.)            "
"29","The results for the on‐term House equation show that two of the three economic variables (G and Z) are significant when the economic variables are entered separately. The other variable, P, has the expected sign but with a t‐statistic of only −1.18. When the relative weights are imposed, the resulting index variable is highly significant, with a coefficient estimate of 0.584. The hypothesis that the restrictions are correct is not rejected. Imposing the restrictions hardly changes the fit, with an F‐value of only 0.048 and a resulting p‐value of 0.953. The DPER variable is significant, which says that when a presidential incumbent is running again, this helps his party in the House vote. The previous midterm share variable is significant, with a coefficient estimate of 0.630 in equation (2a) and a t‐statistic of 5.64.            "
"30","No other lagged‐share variable was significant when added to the on‐term House equation. When Vc−4− 50 was added to equation (2a), it had a coefficient estimate of 0.192 with a t‐statistic of 1.07. When Vp−4− 50 was added, it had a coefficient estimate of 0.027 with a t‐statistic of 0.24.            "
"31","Overall, the results for the on‐term House equation provide strong support for the view that the economy affects on‐term House elections. In terms of the theory in the second section, the significance of the previous midterm share variable suggests that the distribution of the Republican bias across voters for the House election is not random from election to election. If, say, the Republican party has done well in the last (midterm) House election in that Vcc−2 is small, then δt will be larger than otherwise. In this sense there is positive serial correlation in the bias. One explanation for this positive serial correlation is a positive incumbency effect for elected representatives. In other words, other things being equal, there may be an advantage to running as an incumbent.            "
"32","There is no evidence of a presidential coattail effect on the on‐term House vote. Tests regarding the error structure similar to those in Kramer (1971) and Ferejohn and Calvert (1984) are performed in Appendix A, and the results indicate no coattail effects. Perhaps even more compelling, when Vp, the actual presidential vote share in the election, is added to equation (2a), it is not significant, with a coefficient estimate of 0.092 and a t‐statistic of 0.52. Also, when the estimated error from the presidential equation, , is added, it is not significant, with a coefficient estimate of 0.182 and a t‐statistic of 0.85. It is true that Vp and Vc are highly positively correlated (correlation coefficient of 0.68 over the 23 elections), but this is due to the fact that both are affected by similar variables, namely the three economic variables and DPER. There is no evidence that the presidential vote directly affects the on‐term House vote.8"
"33","Regarding data mining issues for the on‐term House equation, no searching was done over the economic variables. The exact three economic variables that have been used in the presidential vote equation since 1992 were simply used in the on‐term House equation."
"34","Two new explanatory variables are needed for the midterm House equation in addition to the two lagged‐share variables, Vc−2 and Vp−2. These are Pcc and Zcc. They are the same as P and Z, respectively, except that they pertain to the first seven quarters of the administration rather than the first 15. For comparison purposes, Zcc is multiplied by  to give it the same order of magnitude as Z.            "
"35","It turned out that G was never close to being significant in the midterm House equation, and so it was dropped. For example, when it is added to equation (3a) in Table 2, it has a coefficient estimate of 0.022 with a t‐statistic of 0.27. Table 2 shows that when the other two economic variables are included separately, Pcc has a t‐statistic of −2.27 and Zcc has a t‐statistic of 1.84. When the weights on these two variables are constrained to be those estimated in the presidential equation, the resulting index variable is significant, with a coefficient estimate of 0.528. The hypothesis that the restrictions are correct is not rejected. The F‐value is 0.656 and the resulting p‐value is 0.430.            "
"36","The two lagged‐share variables are significant. In equation (3a) in Table 2 the coefficient estimate for the previous (on‐term) House vote share is 0.748 with a t‐statistic of 4.63 and the coefficient estimate for the previous presidential vote share is −0.355 with a t‐statistic of −2.67. The theoretical explanation for the positive coefficient for the previous (on‐term) House vote share is the same as that above for the positive coefficient for the previous (midterm) House vote share in the on‐term House equation. The coefficient in this case is slightly larger: 0.748 versus 0.630. So again there is positive serial correlation in the bias regarding the House elections, and again one explanation for this positive serial correlation is a positive incumbency effect for elected representatives.            "
"37","The negative coefficient estimate for the previous presidential vote share in the midterm House equation is an interesting result. It says that, other things being equal, an increase in the previous presidential vote share of 1 percentage point decreases the current (midterm) House vote share by 0.355 percentage points. This is a robust result. For example, when the estimated error from the presidential equation, , is added to equation (3a), it is not significant, with a coefficient estimate of −0.267 and a t‐statistic of −1.07. Vp−2− 50 is still significant, with a coefficient estimate of −0.346 and a t‐statistic of −2.61. Also, when Vcc−4− 50 is added to equation (3a), it is not significant (coefficient estimate of −0.158 and t‐statistic of −0.88) and Vp−2− 50 is still significant, with a coefficient estimate of −0.415 and a t‐statistic of −2.76.            "
"38","An important question is why this negative presidential vote effect? In the theory in the second section this means that the Republican bias for the midterm election depends positively on the size of the previous Democratic presidential vote share. The larger the Democratic share, the more the bias in favor of the Republicans. But a deeper question is why is this the case? It can't be from a reversal of a positive coattail effect in the previous election because there is no evidence of a coattail effect in the first place. It also can't simply be a vote against the party in the White House at the time of the midterm election because it is the size of the previous presidential vote share that matters, not which party controls the White House.9 For example, if the Democrats get 42% in one presidential election and 48% in another, losing both times, the midterm equation says that the Democrats will still get more midterm House votes in the first case than in the second, other things being equal. Note also that since there are economic variables in the midterm House equation, effects of a good or bad economy have already been taken into account. Also, there is not a reversion to the mean, other things being equal, but the opposite: the previous on‐term House vote share has a positive effect on the midterm House vote share.            "
"39","One possible explanation for the negative presidential effect is a balance argument. If voters, other things being equal, don't like one party becoming too dominant, they may tend to vote more against a party in the midterm election the better the party has done in the previous presidential election. The idea of balance is stressed in Alesina and Rosenthal (1989) and Erikson (1988). Neither of these studies uses the previous presidential vote share as an explanatory variable in the House equations, instead using 0,1 incumbency dummy variables, but the balance idea can be carried over to the vote share.10"
"40"," Erikson (1990, 394), in discussing “the presidential penalty” in midterm elections, argues for a balance effect over simply voting against the party in the White House no matter what. He also argues against any economic effects: “In any case the economy is not responsible. Midterm loss results under all economic circumstances. And the severity of midterm loss is not predictable from the health of the economy” (394). The present results run counter to this and show significant economic effects in the midterm equation. There is, however, nothing inconsistent with there existing both a balance effect and economic effects, as found here. In the midterm House equation both the economic variables and the previous presidential vote share variable are significant.            "
"41","Regarding the lagged‐share variables, sometimes in the literature, following Tufte (1975), the left‐hand‐side variable in House equations is taken to be the party's current vote share minus the party's mean House vote share in the past eight elections, and sometimes it is taken to be the change in the vote share from the previous election. Neither of these specifications is consistent with the present results. First, no lagged‐share variables were found to be significant more than two years (one election) back, which argues against using the eight‐election mean share. Second, the coefficient estimates of the lagged House vote share variables are significantly less than one, which argues against using the change in the vote share and thus imposing a coefficient of one.            "
"42","As with the on‐term House equation, no searching was done for the midterm House equation regarding the economic variables. The only change was that the period of interest is the first seven quarters of an administration rather than the first 15."
"43","Finally, it should be obvious from Table 2 that the three equations are not the same. To begin with, the coefficient estimates of the Index variables are significantly different from one. But even more compelling, the equations have some different explanatory variables. The results strongly suggest that the equations should not be constrained to have the same coefficients.            "
"44"," Equations (1), (2a), and (3a) in Table 2 form a three‐equation model that can be analyzed as a complete system. Because of the lagged values in equations (2a) and (3a), the House predictions in Table 3, which are based on the actual values of the lagged variables, are not the same as those generated from a dynamic solution of the model. A dynamic solution is one in which the predicted vote share variables from the previous election are used in solving for the current election. In other words, the actual values of the lagged variables are replaced with predicted values. This process continues throughout the prediction period. For present purposes a dynamic solution was computed for the 1916–2006 period, using actual values for all the economic variables but predicted values for the lagged vote share variables. This solution has no effect on the presidential predictions already discussed because there are no lagged values in equation (1): the predicted values of Vp from the dynamic solution are the same as those in Table 3. The predicted values of Vc and Vcc are different, and these are presented in Table 4.         "
"45","The root mean squared error (RMSE) for Vc for the dynamic solution is 2.13 percentage points in Table 4, which compares to 1.80 in Table 3. For Vcc the RMSE is 2.50 versus 1.95 in Table 3. Thus, not surprisingly, the fit is somewhat worse for the dynamic solution, since this solution uses no actual values of the lagged‐share variables except the House vote share for 1914 (the initial condition).         "
"46","The three‐equation model can also be used to examine the effects over time of changing the economic variables. Since the model is linear, it does not matter in which year the change is made regarding the dynamic effects. For illustration, three experiments were run. For each experiment the estimated residuals were first added to the equations and taken to be exogenous. This means that when the model is solved using the actual values of all the exogenous variables, a perfect tracking solution results: the predicted values are equal to the actual values. For the first experiment, G was increased by 1 and the model solved. Since G is the growth rate in the first three quarters of the election year, this change is for the period between a midterm election and the next on‐term election. The difference between the predicted value of a variable and its actual values is the estimated effect of this change. The results are reported in Table 5 in percentage points.         "
"47"," Table 5 shows that the presidential vote share is 0.680 percentage points higher in the first election after the change and then the same thereafter. As noted above, there are no dynamic effects in the presidential equation, and so there is only a one‐time effect. The on‐term House vote is 0.397 higher in the first election. This value is 0.584, the coefficient estimate for Index in equation (2a) in Table 2, times 0.680. This effect is smaller than that for the presidential vote. The next midterm House vote is then larger, by 0.056 percentage points. This value is the net effect in equation (3a) of the positive effect from the larger previous on‐term House vote and the negative effect from the larger previous presidential vote. The next on‐term House election is then 0.035 larger, which is because of the larger previous midterm House vote. Then the next midterm House vote is larger, by 0.026, because of the larger previous on‐term House vote, and so on. The effects after the first election are all fairly small.         "
"48","For the second experiment Z was increased by 1—one additional quarter of strong growth. Zcc was not changed, which means that the additional quarter is in the period between a midterm election and the next on‐term election. The results are also presented in Table 5. The pattern for this experiment is the same as the pattern for the first experiment. The effects for the first election after the change are 1.075 and 0.627 percentage points, respectively, for the presidential and on‐term House vote, and then small positive effects for the House votes after that.         "
"49","For the third experiment Z was increased by 1 andZcc was increased by 1 times . This means that the additional strong growth quarter is in the period between an on‐term election and the next midterm election. The results are in Table 5. In this case the first effect is on the midterm House vote, which is larger by 1.215 percentage points. In the next on‐term election the presidential vote is larger by 1.075, which is the same as it is for the second experiment. But the on‐term House vote is now 1.393 larger rather than 0.627 larger, primarily because it is positively affected by the larger previous midterm House vote. The next midterm House vote is 0.661 larger, which again is the net effect of the positive effect of the larger previous on‐term House vote and the negative effect of the larger previous presidential vote. Then in the next on‐term election the House vote is 0.416 larger, and so on. As should be obvious, this experiment shows that the House vote is more affected by the economy if the change takes place before a midterm election than after it because of the positive serial correlation of the House vote share variables.         "
"50","To save space, experiments changing the inflation rate are not reported here, but the stories are similar except with a negative sign."
"51","Considering the three vote‐share equations together has allowed various tests to be made. The main conclusions are the following."
"52","                        "
"53","There is strong evidence that the economy affects all three vote shares. Not only that, but the relative weights on the economic variables are the same for the presidential and on‐term House elections and are the same for two of the three economic variables for the presidential and midterm House elections."
"54","There is no evidence of any presidential coattail effects on the on‐term House elections. The presidential vote share and the on‐term House vote share are highly positively correlated, but this is because they are affected by some of the same variables."
"55","There is positive serial correlation in the House vote in that the previous midterm House vote share positively affects the on‐term House vote share and the previous on‐term House vote share positively affects the midterm House vote share. One explanation for this positive serial correlation is a positive incumbency effect for elected representatives."
"56","The presidential vote share has a negative effect on the next midterm House vote share. This cannot be due to the reversal of a coattail effect, since there is no evidence of an effect in the first place. Also, it is not simply voting against the party in the White House, because the presidential variable is a vote share variable, not a 0,1 incumbency variable. It is also not a regression to the mean in that the above‐mentioned positive serial correlation in the House vote implies no such regression. The most likely explanation is a balance argument, where voters are reluctant to let one party become too dominant."
"57","On a few technical matters, first, it is obvious from Table 2 that the three equations are not the same, and so it is problematic to constrain any of the equations to be the same. Second, arguments have been presented in the third section that suggest that data mining may not be a serious issue for the current specifications. The presidential equation is robust to a number of small changes; no searching has been done for either the on‐term or midterm House equation; and the presidential equation has not been changed since 1992. Third, the maximum likelihood estimates in Appendix A are very similar to those in Table 2, and so the model is robust to the estimation method. Fourth, the equations in Table 2 are structural, or causal, in that no survey variables like presidential approval ratings and vote intentions have been used.11 The aim is to explain voting behavior, not necessarily forecast it. The equations can be used for forecasting, but only after forecasting the economic variables first. It may be the case that for pure forecasting purposes, especially a few months before an election, the use of various voter surveys produces more accurate forecasts than can be obtained using the equations in Table 2.         "
"58","The empirical results in this article have been interpreted in light of the theory in the second section, but it should be stressed that other interpretations are possible given the aggregate nature of the data. Also, the estimated standard errors in Table 2 range from 2.09 to 2.54 percentage points, and so there is clearly considerable variation left unexplained. Each election has unique features, and at best only systematic features are being picked up in Table 2.         "
"59","Note finally that no attempt has been made in this study to explain the number of House seats per party. Translating vote shares into House seats is a complicated matter, and this is beyond the scope of this study. However, if one had an equation that explained House seats as a function of vote shares, this equation could be added to the three equations in Table 2, producing a four‐equation model explaining House seats.         "
"60","The data that were used for the estimates in Table 2 are presented in Table B. Quarterly data on nominal GDP, real GDP, and population are needed to construct G, Gcc, P, Z, Pcc, and Zcc. Let GDP denote nominal GDP, let GDPR denote real GDP, and let POP denote population. Let a subscript k denote the kth quarter of the 16‐quarter period of an administration. Also, let Y=GDPR/POP, which is real per capita GDP, and let GDPD=GDP/GDPR, which is the GDP deflator. Then G, Gcc, P, and Pcc are constructed as:               "
"61","                   "
"62","The data on nominal GDP were obtained as follows. Annual data for 1929–1945 and quarterly data for 1947:1–2006:3 were obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) website on October 27, 2005. Quarterly data for 1946:1–1946:4 were obtained from the BEA website on October 30, 2002. Quarterly data for 1913:1–1945:4 are available from Balke and Gordon (1986, 789–95). The Balke and Gordon values for 1913:1–1928:4 were used exactly, but the values for 1929:1–1945:4 were adjusted to take account of the new BEA annual data. For 1929:1–1945:4 each quarterly value for a given year was multiplied by a splicing factor for that year. The splicing factor is the ratio of the BEA value for that year to the respective yearly value in Balke and Gordon (1976, 782–83).               "
"63","The data on real GDP were obtained in a similar way. Annual data for 1929–46 and quarterly data for 1947:1–2006:3 were obtained from the BEA website on October 27, 2006. Quarterly data for 1913:1–1946:4 are available from Balke and Gordon (1986, 789–95). The Balke and Gordon values were spliced to the BEA values. All the Balke and Gordon quarterly values for 1913:1–1929:4 were multiplied by the same number. This number is the ratio of the BEA value for 1929 to the 1929 value in Balke and Gordon (1976, 782). For 1930:1–1946:4 each Balke and Gordon quarterly value for a given year was multiplied by a splicing factor for that year. The splicing factor is the ratio of the BEA value for that year to the respective yearly value in Balke and Gordon (1976, 782–83).               "
"64","The data on population were obtained as follows. For 1913–28 annual data were obtained from U.S. Department of Commerce (1973, 200–201), A114 series. Each of these observations was multiplied by 1.000887, a splicing factor. The splicing factor is the ratio of the A114 value for 1929 in U.S. Department of Commerce (1973) to the value for 1929 in Table 8.2 in U.S. Department of Commerce (1992). For 1929–45 annual data were obtained from U.S. Department of Commerce (1992), Table 8.2. Quarterly observations for 1877:1–1945:4 were obtained by interpolating the annual observations using the method presented in Fair (1994), Table B.6. For 1946:1–2006:3 quarterly data were obtained from the BEA website on October 27, 2006.               "
"65","Turning now to the vote data, Vp is the Democratic vote divided by the Democratic plus Republican vote except for the 1924 election. For 1924, Vp is the Democratic vote plus .765 times the LaFollette vote divided by the Democratic plus Republican plus LaFollette vote. The presidential vote data for 1916 were obtained from U.S. Department of Commerce (1975, 1078–79). For 1920–32 the data were obtained from U.S. Department of Commerce (1988, 232), for 1936–92 the data were obtained from U.S. Department of Commerce (1997, 271), and for 1996–2000 the data were obtained from U.S. Department of Commerce (2001, 233). The vote data for the 2004 election were obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce website. Vc and Vcc are the Democratic House vote divided by the Democratic plus Republican House vote. No adjustments were made to these data. The House vote data for 1914–70 were obtained from U.S. Department of Commerce (1975, 1084).
