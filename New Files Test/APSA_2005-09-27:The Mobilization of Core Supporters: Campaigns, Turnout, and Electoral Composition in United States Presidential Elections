"1","Considerable attention has been devoted to the study of political mobilization over the years. One group of studies shows that partisan contacting increases the likelihood that individuals participate in elections (Abramson and Claggett 2001; Gerber and Green 2000a, 2000b; Goldstein and Ridout 2002; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1992; Kramer 1973; McClurg 2004; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Wielhouwer 1999, 2003; Wielhouwer and Lockerbie 1994). A second set examines how contextual indicators of mobilization, such as the impact of candidate spending and competition in House, Senate, and gubernatorial elections, contribute to voter turnout (Cox and Munger 1989; Jackson 1997, 2002; Patterson and Caldeira 1983). A third group has arisen around a lively debate about the consequences of negative advertising (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Ansolabehere, Iyengar, Simon 1999; Ansolabehere, Iyengar, Simon, and Valentino 1994; Djupe and Peterson 2002; Finkel and Geer 1998; Freedman and Goldstein 1999; Kahn and Kenny 1999; Lau et al. 1999; Sigelman and Kugler 2003; Wattenberg and Brians 1999). Still another group of studies examine the potential for campaigns to demobilize voters by activating cross‐pressures or increasing feelings of alienation (e.g., Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Converse 1962; Zipp 1985). For the most part this research supports the notion that campaign activity increases participation, with the general consensus being that this effect is achieved by reducing information costs and creating interest in the campaign.         "
"2","Nevertheless, most recent studies of presidential campaign effects have evolved separately from research on mobilization, with only a couple studies directly addressing the relationship between presidential campaigns and voter mobilization. Unfortunately, these studies have produced mixed results (Herr 2002; Jones 1998) and leave a number of questions about the relationship of campaigns to election outcomes unanswered. One issue pertains to the conditions under which campaigns can mobilize people and, concomitantly, who is mobilized. This is important because a key message of the party canvassing literature is that most efforts are directed at partisans (whose votes are relatively certain) rather than undecided voters (whose votes are less certain). A second issue is that mobilization studies fail to measure modern campaign activity consistently or comprehensively. Of particular interest is the failure to examine the potential impact of television advertising and national party transfers to the state and local committees (about two‐thirds of which is soft money) as mobilizing forces.1 This shortcoming is important because there is a tendency to focus on forms of campaigning that are vestiges of the old party system, such as campaign appearances (Cohen, Krassa, and Hamman 1991; Herr 2002; Jones 1998), while the newer research on campaigns is motivated by an interest in the broader array of activities relevant in today's political environment.         "
"3","A couple of studies acknowledge the possibility that campaigns may have effects that stem from both mobilization and persuasion, though they only indirectly examine this distinction. For instance, using National Election Study data, Finkel (1993) identifies three types of voters in the 1980 presidential election: those who were converted (change in preference), those whose predispositions were activated (undecided and misplaced partisans returning to the fold), and those who were unmoved by the campaign. Although Finkel concludes that most people were unmoved, he shows that a substantial number were activated by the campaign, a finding that strongly suggests the presence of important mobilization effects.         "
"4"," Shaw's (1999a) analysis of campaign activities in the states during the 1988, 1992, and 1996 presidential campaigns, also provides an innovative—though indirect–assessment of the mobilizing and persuasive effects of campaigns. His analysis shows that the impact of campaign activities is (among other things) conditioned on the size of the normal vote, implying that campaign effects can be larger in states with a sizeable number of partisans. However even Shaw points out that, “persuasive effects can also be captured by this variable, [so] it provides a suggestive but imperfect test of mobilization's singular effect” (1999a, 350).         "
"5","Finally, Campbell's (2000) analysis of turnout among partisan groups points to important mobilization effects. Using aggregated National Election Study data from 1952 to 1996, Campbell finds that the relative turnout of partisan groups played a key role in shaping presidential elections at the national level, although this impact was clearly secondary to that of partisan loyalty (2000, 8485). As interesting and suggestive as this finding is, Campbell did not plumb the impact of specific campaign activities on relative turnout among partisan groups.         "
"6","In sum, existing research on presidential campaigns does not adequately explore the impact of presidential campaign activity on the mobilization of different groups. And the one study that examines both persuasion and mobilization effects in earnest—Kramer's research on the 1952–64 elections—occurred before the substantial changes in presidential campaign affected by the advent of widespread television advertising and campaign finance reform. Overlooking the distinction between the two effects means that what are often interpreted as persuasive effects may in fact be the product of mobilization (see Shaw 1999a for discussion of this point). Understanding which type of effect exists is central to our substantive understanding of the electoral process. We help fill this void in existing research by offering a model of political mobilization and investigating the mobilization of core supporters in the states during the 1992, 1996, and 2000 presidential elections.         "
"7","Presidential campaign strategy revolves around the communication of information to voters (Bartels 1993; Gelman and King 1993; Holbrook 1996; Popkin 1991). Broadly speaking, campaigns use information to shape everything from the electorate's perceptions of candidate character to the importance of issues to the relevance of the election to levels of emotional engagement. While this characterization is the basis for research on how campaigns influence vote choice (e.g., Carsey 2000), our focus is on the mobilization of voters. For this task, we outline a model that conceptually links campaigns to mobilization by emphasizing which voters are most likely to receive and use campaign information prior to deciding whether to participate. We specifically argue that reception and use of campaign information is a function of three features: (1) the partisan biases of voters, (2) the expenditure of campaign resources, and (3) the preferences of other voters.         "
"8","Who You Are We begin with the assumption that there are two types of voters in the electorate—partisans and nonpartisans. The standard view of partisans is that they begin campaigns with natural affinities for one candidate and automatic disdain for the other. But they are also better informed (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996), better able to discount dissonant information surrounding campaign communications (Fischle 2000; Zaller 1992), and are consequently more likely to vote than people who are independents (Campbell et al. 1960; Miller and Shanks 1996; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993). Though partisans do not always cast ballots for candidates from their party, their predispositions make them less open to persuasion than independents. At the same time these predispositions must be activated or reactivated by the campaign so that their predispositions turn into actual support at the polls (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1944).2 Simplifying this task for campaigns is the fact that partisans are more likely to encounter and process political messages (Zaller 1992).            "
"9","Independents present different challenges to campaigns. Because they do not possess strong partisan biases, they are less likely to filter campaign communications in a consistent manner. Mobilization of independents is therefore both more difficult (i.e., costlier in resources) and riskier for campaigns. That is, independents need to be persuaded and mobilized, while partisans mainly need to be mobilized. Therefore, campaigns have strategic incentives to target their mobilization efforts on partisans out of fear that the core will stay home without the mobilization effort and that a broader canvass would bring the wrong voters to the polls (Goldstein and Ridout 2002).            "
"10","Consider, for example, an electorate that is evenly divided between Party A, Party B, and independents. Further assume that both parties have a loyalty rate of 90%, and that independents, perhaps by virtue of ideology or other considerations, lean toward Party A with 60% support. Now, suppose that Party A wants to mobilize supporters in order to ensure victory. If Party A increases turnout among its core supporters by 5 percentage points, it will gain 4.5 percentage points at the polls (.90 * 5). But if it increases turnout among independents by 5 percentage points, its yield will only be 3 percentage points at the polls (.60 * 5). To achieve the same “payoff,” Party A would have to increase turnout among independents 1.5 times more than among its own partisans. And more to the point, if Party B were to mobilize independent voters through its campaign activities, it would actually lose votes! Granted, these are hypothetical rates and loyalty among peripheral voters may be much lower than among active partisans (DeNardo 1980), but the argument we're trying to make is clearly plausible: parties run a considerable risk by trying to mobilize independents and could realize much more predictable benefits by focusing efforts on their core supporters.            "
"11","Where You Are Although partisans are more likely to be exposed and respond to campaign information, not all partisans are equally exposed to such information. As Shaw's (2003) analysis of presidential campaigns illustrates, resources are not equally distributed throughout the states. Instead, they are dispersed among states based upon strategic considerations such as the number of Electoral College votes and the competitiveness of the race in the state (Shaw 1999b). This implies that the mobilization of core voters is a function of the unequal distribution of campaign resources: states that receive greater attention from presidential campaigns should therefore have larger numbers of partisans casting ballots.            "
"12","Additionally not all campaign activities are equally targeted at partisan audiences nor do they provide equivalent information. Consider the role of two particular campaign activities highlighted in earlier research—candidate visits and television ad buys. Although campaign appearances generate considerable media attention, one of their primary effects is to place the candidate in front of sympathetic, partisan audiences. Not only does this produce the kind of good visuals campaign professionals strive for, but it allows candidates to convey information directly to core groups at rallies, fundraisers, and similar events. By contrast, advertisements purchased by presidential campaigns typically run in front of politically broader audiences on television and increasingly emphasize issues and character over explicit partisan cues (West 2001). Relative to each other, visits should influence partisan participation more than advertisements because they are targeted more directly at partisans and include more explicitly partisan cues.            "
"13","Another important activity in recent presidential campaigns is party transfers to the states, which include the oft‐criticized soft money. In part, this campaign resource differs from candidate visits and ad buys in that the campaigns do not directly control its use. So even though party transfers are spent in support of presidential candidates, they are also used to support statewide partisan efforts down the ballot. Relative to other campaign resources, we should then expect that the information produced by the expenditure of these funds is targeted at and successful in mobilizing partisans."
"14","Who Is With You Finally, it would be unreasonable to assume that campaign information that reaches the ears of partisan voters always finds an attentive audience. This is because campaign information is only one part of a broader environment in which voters decide. Among the environmental factors that might affect core voter's responsiveness to a campaign is the level of competition between the parties. Partisans living in a state where their candidate has little to no chance of winning the election—for instance, a Democrat in Utah—will not be persuaded otherwise by any amount of campaign information. Perhaps more important, presidential campaigns can only make credible requests that the participation of core supporters is crucial when the outcome of the race is in doubt.            "
"15","To examine hypotheses based on this model of mobilization, we pursue an analytic strategy that focuses on presidential campaign activities at the state level and how those activities influence measures of turnout and electoral composition in the states. The bulk of our analyses draw on information from the 1992, 1996, and 2000 campaigns.3 We focus on two categories of campaign activities in this analysis, one that is candidate based and one that is party based. Candidate‐based campaign activities are those that fall under the direct control of the candidates' campaign organizations, including the total number candidate appearances and voter ad exposure in the states.4 Candidate appearances are measured as the number of times the presidential candidate visited a state from August to November. Ad exposure is estimated with a strategy developed by Shaw (1999a) that measures audience saturation using gross rating points (GRPs). In Shaw's method, state GRPs are estimated by determining how many GRPs are bought for each media market in a state, multiplying that by the percentage of a state's voters in that market, and then summing across all of the state's markets.5 Our measure of party campaign effort is the amount of national party transfers to state and local party committees in the year of the election.6 These funds, which include soft money expenditures, are controlled by state and local party organizations and are typically spent on get‐out‐the‐vote drives, issue advertisements, and other activities intended to help the respective parties on election day (Ansolabehere and Snyder 2002; Herrnson 2000). Surprisingly, there is no academic work on the connection between party transfers and election outcomes.         "
"16","Several data sources were used for other independent and dependent variables. Data for turnout, election outcomes, and national party transfers to the states are taken from the Federal Election Commission (http://www.fec.gov). Data on the partisan composition of the electorate are taken from the Voter News Service exit polls, aggregated at the state level.7 Our measures of group composition are based on the marginal percentages for demographic and political groups in the exit polls.         "
"17","Our model suggests a number of hypotheses about state‐by‐state election patterns. First, as campaigns become more active in the states, voters (core voters in particular) become better informed, more enthused, and more motivated, subsequently leading them to go to the polls on election day. We therefore expect turnout to increase as a function of campaign activity. Second, we expect party transfers and candidate appearances to exert the strongest effect on turnout, since these activities are specifically targeted to partisan groups. Presidential advertising buys, on the other hand, are expected to reach much broader audiences including nonaligned voters as well as partisans. Finally, we expect the effect of campaign activities to be stronger in the most competitive states."
"18"," Table 1 presents the results first for a basic model of campaign effects and then for a conditional model that includes several interaction terms. The dependent variable in both models is the change in statewide voter turnout from one presidential election to the next (turnoutt− turnoutt −1). The models include measures of overall campaign activities (total candidate appearances, television expenditures, and party transfers), a poll‐based measure of pre‐election of competition,8 lagged turnout (to capture regression to the mean effects), third‐party vote (included to account for the influx of sporadic voters typically associated with third‐party efforts), a control for the potentially mobilizing impact of having a Senate race on the ballot, and controls for specific election years to capture global features of the contests. The manner in which we've specified the models provides a rigorous test for the mobilization hypothesis. By expressing the dependent variable as change in turnout, and by including a lagged measure of turnout, we are able to hold constant a whole host of long‐term determinants of voter turnout. This poses a stringent statistical test and allows us to focus much more explicitly on those short‐term forces that influence turnout in presidential elections.         "
"19","Consistent with our expectations, party transfers have a statistically significant and positive effect on voter turnout.9 According to our estimate, turnout can be expected to increase approximately .69 percentage points for every dollar per capita transferred to the state and local committees. Given that the average per capita transfer was $0.44, this effect appears to be rather meager—a change of approximately one‐third a percentage point in turnout. However, at its maximum (2.48) the effect of party transfers can be quite significant—it produces an increase of 1.7 percentage points in turnout. This positive relationship makes a great deal of sense to us, given that one of the explicit purposes of party money is to turn out the party base. In doing so, parties are also contributing to the overall level of turnout in the states.         "
"20","Contrary to our hypotheses, campaign visits and advertising purchases exhibit no effect on overall turnout in the baseline model. And the findings from the interaction model offer no additional evidence of important effects from these variables.10 Instead, it appears that the most important campaign‐based influence on turnout comes from national party transfers to the states.         "
"21","The findings from Table 1 suggest a modest but interesting role for presidential campaigns in determining patterns of voter turnout across the states. The results imply that party‐based politics embedded in the states (represented here by party transfers) are important to general levels of participation. However, the absence of strong and consistent findings for the other campaign variables suggests that overall turnout is more sensitive to the broader political context of the election and long‐term trends in the states than it is to short‐term campaign effects. For example, strong third‐party efforts appear to generate increases in turnout, and the national political environment also has an impact on turnout as revealed by a statistically significant difference between the highly contentious 1992 race and the low key 1996 race.         "
"22","Though the influence of the campaign on turnout appears substantively small, a limited focus on voter turnout may mask their most important effects, which is to shape who turns out to the polls. According to our theoretical model, presidential campaigns are most influential in shaping the partisan composition of the electorate rather than its overall size. Although the size of the electorate is not strongly responsive to campaign activities, aggregate stability may mask significant dynamics that exist below the surface (e.g., Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995, Chapter 4).         "
"23","Patterns of Change We begin with a simple question—does the political composition of state electorates change from election to election? At first glance, the answer is that they change very little. The average number of self‐identified Democrats across states exhibits little change from election to election, with roughly 38% of voters considering themselves to be Democrats in 1992, 38% again in 1996, and 37% in 2000. Similarly, the average number of Republicans in each state is roughly 35% in all three elections. The percentage of Independents is just 22% in 1992 and then rises to about 27% in 1996 and 2000.10"
"24","Despite this apparent stability, further analysis shows that substantial dynamics exist in how the electorate changes from state to state. Figure 1 plots the percentage of core voters—self‐identified Democrats and Republicans in exit polls—in each state against the percentage of that group in the preceding presidential election. We look for dynamics in two ways. First, each graph contains a solid line representing equality (meaning no change from one election to the next) and a regression line summarizing the statistically efficient relationship. If these lines have the same slope and intercept, it implies the absence of systematic change in the state electoral composition between elections. If they are different, then it indicates that the composition of state electorates changes from one election to the next. Second, we can examine the variance around the regression line as an indicator of electoral dynamics. The larger the spread of cases around the regression line—and the farther they fall from the line of equality—the larger the change in electoral composition.11"
"25","                 Scatterplots of the Partisan Composition of State Electorate, 1992–2000                         "
"26","These graphs depict the state‐by‐state relationship in the proportion of Democrats and Republicans from one election to the next."
"27","In both Democratic plots the regression slope is lower and the intercept is higher than the line of equality. This means that states with high numbers of Democrats in one year had fewer in the next year, while states that had few Democrats participating in one election on average had more in the next election. The two lines are similar in the Republican graphs, showing very little change in the underlying structure of the Republican vote. However, despite this similarity, the mean‐squared errors for the two Republican regression lines are 3.03 and 3.25, both of which are higher than the corresponding Democratic numbers (2.62 and 2.94, respectively). All in all, this graph illustrates that the partisan nature of the voting electorate shifts from election‐to‐election. The next step is to investigate whether these changes are related to presidential campaigns."
"28","Mobilization of Partisans Recognizing the presence of dynamic change in electoral composition, we postulate that campaign activities mobilize the voters who constitute a party's core to participate but that they have weak effects on political independents. To investigate partisan mobilization, we examine change in net partisan composition of the electorate from one presidential election to the next where net partisan composition is measured as the difference between self‐identified Republicans and self‐identified Democrats.12 We model underlying shifts in the partisan composition of state electorates as a function of net party differences (Republican − Democrat) in campaign effort (each party's candidate visits, campaign advertising, party transfers),13 the third‐party vote (to account for peripheral, probably nonpartisan voters attracted by strong third‐party bids), the existence of a Senate race on the ballot, a dichotomous variable for highly competitive races, a lagged measure of the dependent variable, and dummy variables to control for year‐specific influences on partisan composition. As in Table 1, we analyze the composition of the electorate first in a baseline model and then with interactions of the competition variable with the campaign measures.            "
"29","The results presented in Table 2 are similar to what we found in our analysis of voter turnout.14 As before, variables measuring campaign visits and presidential campaign advertising purchases are not statistically significant predictors of the partisan composition of the electorate in the baseline model. As implied by our theoretical model, national party transfers do have strong and stable effects on partisan composition, despite the model specification.            "
"30","The rather large substantive effect of party transfers is very interesting and requires further discussion. The average difference in party transfers (scored .01 in favor of Republicans) produces a shift of just four‐tenths of a percent in the partisan composition of the electorate. However, the effect is much larger at the extremes. The minimum value of this variable (−.72) almost produces a three‐point shift in partisanship that favors the Democrats; the maximum value (.94) produces better than a three‐and‐a‐half‐point shift in favor of the Republicans. Given that approximately 60% of the states showed partisan swings of four percentage points or less during the period studied here, the potential impact of party money (up to three‐and‐a‐half points) is not to be discounted."
"31","Mobilization of Independents Our model implies that partisan campaign activities are expected to influence the net balance of partisans who vote, but are not expected to influence participation by independents. Recall that independents are expected to encounter less campaign information, both because of their relative lack of involvement and because they are less likely to be targeted for mobilization by the campaigns. To provide a stricter test of the model, we analyze the impact of campaign activities on the independent composition of the electorate in Table 3, where the dependent variable is the change in the percent of the electorate who call themselves independents from one election to the next. The independent variables are the same as in the previous analysis, with the important exceptions that the lagged variable is now the percent who were independent in the previous election and campaign activity is measured in terms of total activity rather than net partisan differences. What we find here is rather striking: the primary engine of mobilization found in Tables 1 and 2—party money—has no discernable impact on changes in the share of the electorate that are independents.            "
"32","However, there is some evidence that presidential advertising buys, measured in thousands of GRPs, have a slight positive effect on the size of the nonpartisan portion of the electorate. According to the coefficient in the baseline model, the independent share of the electorate should increase by eight‐tenths of 1 percent for every additional 1000 GRPs bought by the campaigns. The mean value of the TV advertising variable is 6,178, which translates into a modest increase in independents of approximately .49 percentage points. But at its maximum (26,218 GRPs), TV advertising translates into an increase in independents of 2.1 percentage points. And while this contradicts our specific hypothesis, it is understandable in our theoretical terms since these advertisements reach a much broader population than do the other measures of campaign activity and are increasingly unlikely to employ partisan cues (West 2001). At the same time, we don't want to make too much of this finding, as it represents a tenuous relationship, one that becomes marginally significant in the presence of the interaction terms (second column of findings in Table 3).            "
"33","In contrast to partisans then, independents seem more affected by the presence of external stimuli such as a third‐party candidate, the presence of a Senate race, and the national context of the election, none of which had an impact on changes in the net party composition of the electorate. These differences in findings illustrate the importance of making a core‐nonpartisan distinction in studies of mobilization and campaign dynamics. Instead of the asking “do campaigns mobilize?” we should be asking “whom do campaigns mobilize?”"
"34"," Kramer's (1973) early party mobilization study postulated that the real impact of campaigns on election outcomes was to increase a party's proportion of sympathetic voters in the electorate. While the previous two sections show that the campaign is related to both voter turnout and the proportion of core voters in the electorate, the final piece of the puzzle is to show that these have a meaningful effect on electoral success.         "
"35","We therefore investigate the impact of demographic group participation, political composition, and campaign activity on the Democratic margin of victory in each state. The dependent variable in this analysis is the change in the Democratic margin of victory from the previous election, and the independent variable of primary interest is the change in net partisanship from the previous election. This variable is central to our argument that the mobilizing effects of campaign activities have important consequences for state‐level presidential election outcomes. Having demonstrated that party transfers influence the relative turnout of partisan groups, it is now necessary to demonstrate that changes in the partisan composition of the electorate have an impact on election outcome. We are not testing whether Democrats (Republicans) do better in states with more Democrats (Republicans). Instead, we are testing whether a short‐term change in the relative numbers of Democrats (Republicans) has an impact on short‐term changes in election outcomes.         "
"36","The model also includes a host of demographic variables that are used to ensure that our estimates of the impact of core voters on electoral outcomes are not subject to omitted variable bias. Among the demographic groups we examine are African Americans, low‐income voters, high‐income voters, and women, each of which is estimated from exit poll data.15 We also include controls for southern and northeastern states to account for other unmeasured demographic and political factors.16 These variables should adequately capture the main group‐based cleavages in American politics.         "
"37","The first column of results in Table 4 illustrates the impact of changes in partisanship on changes in votes. Here we see a pronounced positive and significant influence from changes in partisan composition. The coefficient for change in net partisanship suggests that for every one‐point increase in their net partisan advantage over Democrats, the Republicans can expect to increase the vote for their presidential candidate by .56 percentage points. At the mean level of change in partisan composition (.02) this coefficient does not produce much of an effect, but if you consider the range of impact from one standard deviation below the mean (−5.13) to one standard deviation above the mean (5.17), the change in Democratic margin of victory ranges from a 2.9 point vote gain to a 2.9 point loss for Democrats. Given that many states saw changes in partisan composition of the electorate outside this one‐standard deviation range, the potential impact on vote is quite substantial.         "
"38","This finding lends support to the argument that campaign activities—party transfers in particular—have important consequences for election outcomes. To the extent that these activities influence the partisan composition of the electorate through mobilization, they clearly have an important effect on votes through changes in net partisanship. But it is also possible that their effect extends beyond mobilization of partisans, meaning that they are able to mobilize sympathetic independents and perhaps also persuade voter through campaign communications. This idea is tested in the second column in Table 4, which adds the campaign variables to the first model. Here, we see some evidence of an independent effect of campaign activities on election outcomes, above and beyond those that work through partisan mobilization. As was the case in the earlier analyses, advertising and candidate visits have no impact on the dependent variable, while there is a substantial effect from party transfers. According to these findings, for every one‐dollar per capita spent in excess of Democratic expenditures, Republicans can expect to see a decrease in the Democratic margin of victory of almost 9 percentage points. Of course the parties don't usually let themselves get outspent by that margin, and the mean of the party difference in spending is very close to zero (.009). However, the range in impact from one standard deviation below the mean difference in party expenditure (−.171) and one standard deviation above the mean (.189) is from a 1.53 point gain for the Democrats to a 1.7 point gain for the Republicans. And at the extreme values of the party expenditure variable (−.72 and .94) the range in effect is from a 6.5‐point gain for the Democrats to an 8.4‐point gain for the Republicans. And this does not even include the indirect effect of party transfers as they operate through partisan composition.         "
"39","One way to interpret these results is that party transfers affect the behavior of independent voters. As state parties spend money to influence the statewide presidential contest and other races, their campaign efforts may either convert independents or simply persuade them to support their candidates. While direct mobilization efforts are most likely targeted to partisans, party advertising, mailings, and other activities could have persuasive effects on independent voters. A second possibility—and one more consistent with our theoretical model—is that these monies influence partisan loyalty rates. Throughout our analyses, we have assumed that party identifiers are relatively loyal voters. But even though they are more loyal than independents, they are not always completely loyal. Sometimes loyal partisans can be persuaded to vote for opposing party candidates, as in the case of the renowned Reagan Democrats. Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to adequately distinguish between these two possibilities, and we leave this to future research.         "
"40","Our objective has been to explore the relationship between presidential campaign activities and political mobilization in the states. Although we anticipated broader mobilization effects, we were primarily interested in the impact of campaigns on the mobilization of their core constituents and the impact this mobilization has on election outcomes. In general terms, the evidence presented here provides support for two of our key theoretical arguments: (1) mobilization is an important component of presidential elections, even in an era where campaigns have lost their local organizational roots; and, (2) these mobilization effects are most pronounced among partisans. More specifically, we find that the activities most clearly directed at partisans (party transfers) exert the strongest effect on shaping the partisan composition of the electorate. The implication is that the type of information provided by a campaign activity is especially central to understanding campaign effects. Additionally, our findings suggest candidate advertisements—which garner significant attention from the pundits and academics alike—are not nearly as important to either overall levels of turnout or to partisan mobilization, though they do influence turnout among independents."
"41","We find no clear evidence that the importance of campaigns for mobilization is dependent on competition in the states, which leads us to conclude that the competitive environment is not terribly important. This has two implications for understanding the mobilization of core supporters. First, it is possible that the main effect of political competition is on how it shapes the strategic allocation of campaign resources (Shaw 2003, 1999b; see Carmines, Huckfeldt, and Mondak 2004 for a similar finding pertaining to congressional elections). Indeed, while the correlations between the total campaign activities of the two parties and the level of competition are relatively modest, an inspection of relevant scatterplots shows little‐to‐no campaign activity in noncompetitive states and generally high levels of campaign activity in the most competitive states. Second, to the extent that mobilization is driven by the information transmitted in these campaign cues, reception and use of that information is probably more reliant on individual voter characteristics and the density of information provided and less reliant on the context in which the information is supplied.         "
"42","At its broadest level these results highlight the importance of taking mobilization into account when studying campaign effects, even if the focus of the study is on persuasion. However, our results also speak to important substantive concerns. Even though there is little academic work on party money against which we can compare our findings, our results suggest that limiting such expenditures may have very important consequences for American politics. Among the consequences suggested by our analysis are the further weakening of the American party system and a narrower foundation for citizen involvement. Even more clearly, reducing party transfers by the elimination of soft money will further limit presidential campaigns in the states. In contrast to campaign visits and campaign ad buys, almost every state in our sample received some party money. Although we are not prepared to embrace party transfers or to reject restrictions on such funds, we do believe that these findings suggest that campaign finance reformers would be well served to also consider how money is spent rather than simply regulating how much can be raised. In any case, we believe more analysis of this issue is required.         "
"43","The assumptions of our mobilization model suggest other pathways for future research. First, we assume—rather than demonstrate—that the link between campaign activity and the mobilization of core voters is based on the information transmitted by campaigns. Second, we also assume that the relationship between campaign activity and electoral composition is related to the activation of latent support. Both assumptions are themselves worthy of empirical exploration. Our results also show that party transfers influence election outcomes above their effect on electoral composition, which, as we suggested earlier, may be an indication that campaigns are important in how they influence rates of partisan loyalty."
"44","Altogether we see that mobilization plays an important role in presidential elections. Campaign effects occur not only through winning the hearts and minds of some voters, but also by getting the right people—their likely supporters—to turnout to vote. The ability of parties to change the balance of partisans in the electorate through campaign activities could pay big dividends, especially in relatively close contests."
