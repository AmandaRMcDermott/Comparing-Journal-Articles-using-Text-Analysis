"1","We presume that members of Congress are reelection seekers. We postulate that their voting is a strategic accommodation of the conflicting demands to satisfy the median voter of their reelection constituency on the one hand and the more ideological party base (and quite likely their own policy views) on the other. They attend to news about public opinion and use it to form estimates of where the political center will lie in elections to come. This parallels Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson's (1995) theory of dynamic representation. Like them, we see politicians using information about public preferences contained in public opinion and election returns to form a perceived expediency position, a position that balances policy interests with electoral security.         "
"2","In normal times the accommodation of these conflicts will produce an equilibrium voting strategy, a position along the major left‐right axis of American politics that is not too far from (probably moderate) district opinion nor so moderate as to dishearten the faithful. The “news” of a mandate is more important than routine observation of public opinion because evidence of apparent electoral impact of changing opinion carries with it a powerful signal about the relevance of opinion change. To interpret the usual signal about opinion change the politician must ask, “what is the change?” and “will it actually affect votes?” Both, but particularly the latter, require discounts for uncertainty. The policy mandate message stands apart from the norm because it is decisive, asserting both opinion change and electoral relevance in one capsule. Of equal importance is the nature of the message contained in a perceived mandate. Public preferences rarely, if ever, crystallize on specific issues (Stimson 1991; Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson 1995). Turning again to the theory of dynamic representation, the information that matters is general information, information that a sizable portion of the electorate wants more or less government activity. Perceived mandates offer such information.         "
"3","Members of Congress do not behave as if they are invulnerable to electoral defeat. Congressional scholars believe quite the contrary. They see current members as “running scared” because they subscribe to the idea that they are, to borrow Mann's (1978) phrase, “unsafe at any margin” (Erikson 1976; Jacobson 1987). This belief is attributed to the development of a more candidate‐centered electoral politics. Jacobson (1987) notes that a more candidate‐centered electorate may develop a more personal attachment to an incumbent, but it may also be more fickle. The personal hold an incumbent develops is, he argues, as easy to lose as it is to win. In short, an easy win in one year does not guarantee reelection down the road. Congressional behavior, both on the chamber floor and on the campaign trail, is strongly rooted in the electoral connection. Incumbents have taken on the responsibility of ensuring their own reelection, a responsibility that likely drives their response to the Washington community's interpretation of election results.         "
"4","The expected response of the rational politician is to rethink the equilibrium voting strategy. If politics has changed, then the assumptions about future electoral threats and opportunities must also change. And whether the politician is happy or dismayed with the election result, the change will be in the direction of the perceived mandate. Members of the disadvantaged party will find themselves likely to be further away from the center than before and therefore face new pressure to moderate. Ideological moderation is increasingly seen as a factor in shaping public opinion and voting behavior (Alesina, Londregan, and Rosenthal 1993; Zaller 1998; Mebane 2000). To those on the losing end, mandates are a strong signal that the middle may have shifted. Members of the advantaged party will be emboldened by the new evidence of electoral support for their preferred positions. The magnitude of the mandate response may be mitigated by electoral experience or by the security of an ideologically homogenous constituency, but even the most secure incumbent cannot afford to lose touch lest he or she become the victim of the next big electoral surprise.         "
"5","Along with these factors that vary between individual members, we expect change over time for all members. Response to mandates depends on perceptions of the Washington community.8 Perceptions change. Thus, if the perception of mandate and the consensus view of the Washington community are fleeting (as we will demonstrate they are), the expected response is dynamic, movement away from equilibrium at the outset of the new Congress followed by decay back to the original equilibrium. The near continual recalculation of their electorally expedient position causes the dynamics. As the consensus of a mandate erodes, the factors that produced member equilibria in the first place reassert themselves.         "
"6","The expected dynamic response is pictured in Figure 1. It shows a hypothetical member's equilibrium and our expectation of an early deviation toward a conservative mandate that eventually dissipates as the election becomes ever more distant over time.         "
"7","                 Expected Member Response to Perception of Conservative Electoral Mandate (Presuming Decaying Consensus of Mandate)                      "
"8","The literature on congressional decision making lends little guidance as to the specific question of the likelihood of mandate effects. The spatial voting literature, most recently advanced in the work of Poole and Rosenthal (1997), argues that an ideological—that is, liberal/conservative—continuum best accounts for the voting decision of members of Congress. Other scholars give more attention to electoral forces. The theories vary from Mayhew's (1974) depiction of members as “single minded seekers of reelection” to Arnold's (1990) view that reelection concerns dominate other goals such as good public policy or influence within Congress.         "
"9","Two lines of research within the congressional decision‐making literature support the idea that members respond to public opinion and electoral messages. Scholars such as Fenno (1978) and Kingdon (1981), relying on interviews with incumbents, find that members willingly express concern over the potential electoral consequences of their policy decisions. Those studying the link between constituency opinion and legislative decision making often find congruence between the two (Hill and Hurley 1999). Research into the dynamics of representation supports the idea that policy choices by members of Congress are best viewed as an attempt to reconcile constituent, global, and personal preferences with the voting decision at hand (Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson 1995; Wood and Hinton Andersson 1998). Elections are thus portrayed as a force that moves representatives toward citizens' preferences.         "
"10","Direct literature on mandates and congressional voting patterns is lacking, almost to the point of being nonexistent. The two works that address this issue are openly dismissive. Both Weinbaum and Judd (1970) and Fiorina (1989) address this general question and conclude that the policy effects occur not because members of Congress change their individual voting patterns in response to the election, but simply because of member replacement. These authors explicitly assume that the effects of the mandate will endure, aggregating the vote patterns for the entire session. In contrast, we expect that the effects will dissipate as the session moves forward.         "
"11","Now we turn to the sometimes daunting task of developing indicators for each of our concepts and selecting cases for analysis."
"12","To move from theory to test we need a means of observing when the appearance of mandate behavior is present or absent. For data, we have the roll‐call votes cast by all members of both houses of Congresses. What is needed is a means to translate a “yea” or “nay” vote into evidence of mandate influence, present or absent. The conception of the mandate state can be stated simply: a member is in a mandate state when he or she (1) deviates from personal equilibria (2) in the direction of the mandate (3) at the beginning of a session following a mandate election. That requires that we observe a sequence of votes with clear ideological content and polarity, estimate personal equilibrium positions for each member, and then observe whether a cumulated pattern of votes at the beginning of the session diverges significantly from that equilibrium or not. The result will be a sequence of binary codes in which each member is classified as in the mandate state or not as the session progresses.         "
"13","Our strategy for coding the ideological content of the votes is taken from Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson (1995). It examines each individual roll call to determine if it is ideological and in which direction by mapping the vote distribution onto member ADA scores.8 A vote is liberal, for example, if members who vote the “yea” position have higher average ADA scores than those voting “nay.” The standard employed for “higher” is that the split between “yea” and “nay” must be greater than 30, which is roughly the ADA split on a pure party vote. Where this threshold is not met, we presume that the voting alignment might be accidental with regard to ideology, the leading cause for concern being party against party votes that might have nonideological causes. Our intent in applying the ideological polarization criterion parallels Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson (1995). We want to ensure we are observing a left‐right cleavage when defection from partisanship (in the direction of the mandate) is itself along left‐right lines. A further benefit is that a small number of symbolic votes staged for effect by party leaders early in the session will have no influence at all if they do not polarize along the ideological cleavage and little influence, because they are averaged together with others, even if they do. We then select only the ideological subset of votes and aggregate them into sequences of 10, where we can observe the movement of member ideological positions, if it occurs.8"
"14","Each block of 10 votes constitutes a legislative period—albeit one that does not map uniformly onto regular units of time. We first estimate each member's personal voting equilibrium, the normal level of support for the liberal alternative in left vs. right votes, from the member's behavior at the end of the first session. We then code the member as being in a mandate state if (1) the member was in the mandate state on the previous block (or it is the first block), and (2) the member's observed liberalism for the block deviates in the direction of the mandate and (3) is more than a standard deviation from his or her equilibrium liberalism. Our goal is to classify members as under mandate influence or not. Each of these decisions serves that goal. We restrict classification of deviations from equilibria to consistent early session behavior and to movements in the correct direction. Because we wish to be sure that we are modeling the election effect only, one particularly conservative decision is that mandate states terminate with a block of normal votes, and may not resume thereafter. This rule, combined with random variation and a small N probably causes us to understate the amount of mandate behavior.            "
"15","Before we can assess deviation from the norm, we must have a means of estimating members' normal voting positions. Doing so with requisite precision is difficult. We have considered three possibilities, estimating from votes in the previous year, estimating from end of session of the current year, and estimating from the subsequent year. The first, the previous year, is an attractive fit to theory, but carries two problems; (1) it is based on a not strictly comparable legislative agenda, and (2) using these estimates leaves us unable to assess the behavior of new members, who are particularly crucial actors. The second strategy poses a circularity problem: the norm from which deviation is assessed is based on some of the same votes that are being observed. This is a conservative bias for our thesis, making the norm very slightly closer to the behavior of the mandate period than it ought to be, and therefore making it more difficult to observe mandate behavior. The third estimation strategy, using the subsequent (even numbered) year poses the noncomparable agenda issue and a possible liberal bias, the excesses of the first year of a Congress might be “corrected” by movements away from the mandate message in the second year.8 This bias could produce evidence of mandate effects where none occurred in reality. All of these estimates, though not identical, are very highly correlated. After much experimentation, we have adopted the second method, using end of same session estimates, for our analysis. The circularity issue is very minor and the direction of bias, against our hypotheses, is what good science demands. Alternative coding methods do not in any case alter substantive inferences.            "
"16","The coding of mandate behavior for individual members is best understood through examples. Figure 2 presents two examples of mandate coding. The first is based on Gary Hart's voting behavior following claims of a conservative mandate in 1980, the second Paul Tsongas' in the same session. The solid horizontal line is the end of the first‐term equilibrium, the smooth dashed curve is the one standard deviation lower bound of likely chance variation around the equilibrium, and the jagged curve is the actual vote pattern. The width of the area of likely deviation is large at the beginning of the session when there are few votes and grows smaller as evidence accumulates over the session. The vertical line denotes the vote block at which the member returns to equilibrium. In each case, the Senator begins more conservative than normal and slowly moves toward his equilibrium as the session progresses.            "
"17","                 Two Examples of Coding the Mandate State from Roll‐Call Voting Records                         "
"18","We wish to ask, “How long do mandates last?” We now have the appropriate data in hand, sequences for all individual members of the form “000111111111…” where the “0's”—standing for ten vote blocks where the mandate influence is “on”—delimit the period of mandate influence. Our task now is to look at the evidence of mandates that members would have seen."
"19","In order to find out which elections the media portrayed as signaling a shift in popular preferences, we conducted a content analysis of newspaper articles that contain references to an electoral mandate from 1960 through 1996. We look at both presidential elections and off‐year elections. A thorough comparison of media coverage across elections is limited by the availability of electronic archives. For the years 1960 through 1978, we analyzed articles from the New York Times only. The availability of electronic archives allowed us to expand the search from 1980 on to include the Associated Press, United Press International, and the Washington Post. The New York Times coverage from 1980 to 1996 is representative of the coverage from the rest of the media sources, so we do not believe that this decision biases our results for the earlier years.            "
"20","We look to the public expression of interpretations of election outcomes as a means of gauging what members were exposed to in the Washington political environment. Stories about elections vary in frequency of mandate references and in direction. For some years the issue is rarely discussed. For some it is common fodder. And when the mandate issue is raised, it often is in the context of explicit denial. Some elections provoke journalists to write many stories asserting that the election was not a mandate. Thus, we necessarily examine both how often the issue is raised and, when it is, whether the balance of commentary asserts or denies an electoral message.            "
"21"," Figure 3 presents a picture of media stories that use the word “mandate” for 1980 through 1996, the period for which we have fully comparable information about the balance of coverage. For each presidential and congressional election we count the numbers of stories asserting a mandate, from which we subtract the number asserting the contrary. The white bars above the neutral line represent the commentary supportive of mandate interpretations. Years for which the consensus is against mandate interpretations appear in black, below the line. If press coverage captures the Washington insider perspective, and we have no reason to think that it would not, then the story is simple. The elections of 1980 and 1994 are “called” as mandates. Other years in the period are not. For the years 1960 through 1978 we analyzed articles from the New York Times only. For this period our data of lesser quality clearly indicate a press consensus on one election, 1964, as carrying a message from voters.            "
"22","                 Balance of Pro‐ and Anti‐“Mandate” Press Mentions for Election Cycles of 1980–81 Through 1996–97                         "
"23","We tentatively conclude that the elections of 1964, endorsing Lyndon Johnson's “Great Society,” 1980, launching the “Reagan Revolution,” and the midterm election of 1994, the “Contract With America”—becoming a Republican Revolution in post‐election hyperbola—are the appropriate cases for our investigation of a congressional response."
"24","Our approach to classification is two‐pronged. We ask first whether the press claims a mandate and then whether we can observe the appropriate response (movement in the claimed direction of the message) in congressional voting. Thus as a further screening we assume that every election is a mandate and observe the congressional response. We ask if we went looking for the response would we find it in elections for which there is no press consensus on a message. The answer is that we do not. In no presidential election do we find unexpected numbers of members moving in the postulated direction without the signal of a mandate. As often as not the movement we observe is in the wrong direction, for example toward liberalism after 1972 and 1984.8 In others cases, for example 1988, the movement in the right (conservative) direction is a fraction of that of the cases we include. The largest of these “accidental” movements that we locate occurs after midterm congressional elections, none of which until 1994 was taken as a carrier of an electoral message.8 Thus, we are confident that we have selected the right cases (see the attachment for reviewers for an extended discussion of these results).            "
"25","Other recent research into presidential mandates strengthens our confidence in this selection. Conley (2001) approaches the selection of mandates from the perspective of the president's willingness and ability to link his electoral victory to a major policy initiative. Based on this criterion, she identifies three popular mandates in post war America: 1952, 1964, and 1980.8 She also argues against dismissing 1994 as a Republican mandate because of the turnover in control of Congress and the broad public support for many elements of the Contract With America. She concludes, “The 1994 elections illustrate that midterm elections also have the capacity to send a message” (Conley 2001, 144). Thus, multiple means of selection identify these three years as mandates.            "
"26","To test our theory we can go in two directions. Our best test is a sensitive modeling of the individual processes we postulate, member by member. We get to that next. But the theory has aggregate implications as well. Not as clean a test and denying us the opportunity to model individual variation, the aggregate approach has one great virtue. We postulate a distinctive pattern of dynamics. If we did not see it in the aggregate outcomes, it would be hard to take seriously the individual modeling to come."
"27","In each year and for each body we have a sequence of roll‐call votes, which serve to index time.8 Our procedure is to screen these votes, selecting those that fall along the main ideological divide of American politics and then create a moving average from the 1st to the nth vote. This procedure, taking no account of the content of roll calls, relies on averaging many cases to get a descriptive picture of the dynamics of mandates. In the early days of a session the small number of votes yields averages that depend largely upon how typical or atypical those vote divisions happen to be. But after the first days the numbers of cases produce a more orderly picture of the flavor of the legislative action. We initially observe the percent voting the liberal position on roll calls dividing liberals and conservatives. Then to aggregate over the three cases we reflect the data so that the scales express instead the percent voting in the direction of the mandate, whatever that is. That permits us to observe a grand average across bodies and years. Our roughly 1600 cases (3 sessions times 535 members) are displayed in Figure 4.            "
"28","                 Aggregate Mandate Effects: 89th, 97th, and 104th Congresses (Aggregated Votes Above the “Normal Voting Patter” Line Indicate Mandate Effects.)                        "
"29","In Figure 4 we observe first the initial unreliability of which we warned. And then we see the expected dynamics. Averaging across large numbers of members and roll calls, the dominant pattern is that Congress moves notably away from its normal stance (the horizontal line) in the direction of the mandate. Our purpose is to establish the descriptive fact that mandate effects exist. With two caveats, (1) the initial unreliability, and (2) that the figure is an average of six cases, only five of which individually show the same dynamics,8 the purpose is achieved. Mandate elections leave a distinctive mark on congressional votes and, we may presume, policy outcomes. Now we turn to building an individual member model of our mandate theory.            "
"30","Electoral mandates are best understood as dynamic, in the sense that it is difficult to understand their impact or effects without reference to time. If a mandate is to have an effect on policy, it must change the votes of more than a few legislators and must persist for longer than a few votes."
"31","We begin by looking at how the number of members voting in accordance with the mandate changes over time. Figure 5 graphs, by the day into the legislative session, the total number of Representatives and Senators who deviate from their normal voting pattern in favor of the given year's mandate.         "
"32","                 The Total Number of Members in the Mandate State                      "
"33","The figure demonstrates both the differences in the magnitude of the mandate effect across years and the expected impermanence of the change in individual voting behavior. The Reagan revolution of 1980 stands out as the strongest case. Well into May of 1981, fully one quarter of the members of the 97th Congress were voting more conservatively than normal. This is the strong case of mandate voting effects, many members responding and each for a lengthy period of time. The return to old assumptions and old behaviors is equally dramatic. By the end of June of that year, only 11% of the members continued to deviate from their expected voting patterns.         "
"34","Although 1995 shows a less pronounced effect than 1981, the 104th Congress still saw close to 20% of its members, including nearly a quarter of the Senate, voting more conservatively than we might expect under normal politics. The duration of the effects in 1995 is notable. Nearly 100 members of Congress continued to deviate from their normal pattern well into July. If we add to this the turnover effects brought about by the Republican take‐over of Congress, the potential for significant policy change is striking.         "
"35","The election of 1964 induced the fewest number of members to alter their voting behavior. In 1965, the potential for a mandate is clearly visible in the year's election returns, where the Democrats gained 37 seats in the House. The impact of the liberal mandate can more clearly be seen in the Senate. Although the Democrats picked up only one Senate seat in 1964, a quarter of the Senate voted in a more liberal direction through late February and 14 senators remained affected by the mandate well into May. A block of 14 senators, no matter the year, is a potentially powerful force in policy making."
"36","Having demonstrated the existence of a significant effect in each of our three cases, we turn now to the task of developing and estimating a model that can explain why politicians react for as long as they do. We estimate our model using a logit‐based discrete time‐hazard framework. As is standard with hazard frameworks, we model the probability of exiting a state. The dependent variable is “remains in mandate state” (scored 0) or “exits” (scored 1). Recall that the member stays in the mandate state when the member's observed liberalism for the voting block deviates in the direction of the mandate and is more than a standard deviation from his or her equilibrium position. We measure time as the number of days into the legislative session with members allowed to exit on the last day of each ten‐vote block. Appendix A contains the basic information on the model's functional form, our choice of a discrete‐time formulation, and the use of a fractional polynomial to account for the main effect of time. In the duration analysis we pool the three elections.8"
"37","From the evidence we have already seen we know that perceived mandates cause behavior change in Congress. And we know that these changes are substantial, capable of hugely altering the course of American public policy. What we do not yet know is the dynamics of the response, how the effect begins, runs, and then eventually disappears. That is our task here."
"38","We have seen the rough shape of the dynamic response from the aggregate evidence already presented. Several factors, other than mandates might create such aggregate effects. Strategic agenda manipulation by party leaders or new president honeymoon effects might produce similar movements for all members. In the aggregate we cannot rule out these alternatives. To be sure that we are observing mandate behavior and not these other things, we need to observe the behavior of individuals, to see cause and effect where our theory says they should be found."
"39","We want to know who changes from their typical patterns and who does not, how long lasting is the change, and what sorts of factors enhance or diminish the duration of effects. All of these questions require a model of duration, using what we can know about individual members to predict the dynamics of individual response. To set up that analysis we turn briefly to thinking about individual differences in response to the presumed mandate."
"40","Our theory to this point applies equally to all members. But it has elements that suggest that different members will react differently to the stimulus of a mandate election. We expect that members who have witnessed the most striking electoral effects in their own reelections to respond more strongly, we expect asymmetries of threat along party and ideological lines, and we expect that political experience will moderate response. We detail these expectations."
"41","Electoral effects  Incumbent members are highly sensitive to the size of their victory margins. Either in or out party members who see big differences in the mandate election result should take the evidence more seriously than those who do not. Newly elected members, lacking any such baseline, may be most inclined to (over) credit their election to the policy attitudes of voters. This will prove hard to model, but the sort of effect that we anticipate is that “out” party members who just barely survive the election after previously comfortable electoral margins should be those most likely to change their behavior in its aftermath. For them the mandate story is not just opposition rhetoric, it is a quite immediate threat to their electoral career. It is also highly relevant information about the viability of their normal voting strategy.               "
"42","This implies an asymmetric impact of changes in electoral margin. Those who do not have a change in their margin of victory should be less affected than those who suffer large losses or benefit from large gains. If the margin does not change, then there is no clear evidence that the preferences of the constituents have moved. These members can afford to be less responsive."
"43","Additionally, we expect members to respond more to losses than gains. Gains can easily be credited to the candidate. He or she simply ran a better campaign. Losses cannot be excused away as easily. Thus, we expect that those who suffer large losses will respond more than those who have large gains who in turn will respond more than those who do not see any change."
"44","Party and ideology  A perceived moving center should affect the behavior of those on both sides of it. But there is asymmetry in the nature of the threats and opportunities of the advantaged and disadvantaged parties. The disadvantaged, or simply “out,” party members sense that their current behaviors may expose them to future electorates in which their views are a disadvantage that may have fatal consequences. If the political world has changed and they are on the wrong side of the change, they should rebalance their positions in line with the now greater problem of the general election constituency. There is little cost to a bit of moderation in the new Congress. If the mandate proves ephemeral, they can revert to more comfortable positions. And if it does not, they set the stage to begin to establish a new and more viable position. (And if they are wrong about the mandate, the initial votes of the new Congress will conveniently be far from voters' recent memories at the time of the next election.)               "
"45","“In” party members will sense an opportunity for free expression of their views, now seen to be electorally advantaged. With the center seen to be moving toward their preferred position, the need to compromise is relaxed. Their threat—more apparent in the long than the short‐run—comes from run‐away ideologues on their own side who, having overinterpreted the electoral message, now demand purity and commitment of all. In party members are pulled by their primary constituencies into positions which can prove to be embarrassing if the mandate turns out not to be a permanent shift."
"46","For ideology, we do not believe which side of the mandate members are on matters. Instead, it is how far out from center the member is ideologically that shapes the impact of the mandate. Moderate members on both sides face difficult choices, often in difficult districts. They feel the full force of the claimed mandate. Facing a greater threat than others, they also have much to gain, for movements in their middling positions are likely to be noticed by the voters. Those on the ideological extremes, in contrast, often represent districts that support their strong positions and have little need to compromise. Their consistent records also would not be easily changed by a few votes early in the session. We expect that moderates are more likely to move toward the mandate and more likely to stay moved for some time."
"47","Seniority  We can think of the world as composed of electoral veterans and novices. The veterans have seen party surges come and go in the past, and as survivors of adverse times, it should be easier for them to discount the most recent case. Novices who lack such experiences seem much more likely to be moved by the claims of the moment, to believe that they have witnessed a profound change, not merely another prelude to normal politics. All of these expectations are testable, and they will structure our analyses to come.               "
"48","The consensus interpretation of the Washington community  Unlike these earlier factors that discriminate between members, all members participate in a group conversation about the meaning of political events. We postulate that members make readings of public opinion and update them on a frequent basis. While they have multiple inputs to this updating, some personal such as constituent conversations and chats with colleagues in the cloakrooms, the one public source of information (and often revisionist information) about mandates is commentary and analysis in the media. We turn to this public expression as a means to leverage the question of what information members are likely to encounter. The often‐closed circle of conversations inside the beltway insures that what is in the newspapers gets rapid circulation in the political community.               "
"49","We are ready now to test these hypotheses. Some of these lead to support or disconfirmation of our theory at the margin; they can be true or false and the theory still hold. Two are decisive. Election outcomes are the critical signal of change to the member. The flow of post‐election interpretation modulates the signal, telling members that it was more or less important than first believed. If these hypotheses fail then our theory cannot dominate other possible interpretations of aggregate voting change in the early session. We turn to the test."
"50","We now turn to estimating our model. Again, we are modeling the underlying probability of exiting the mandate state. Positive coefficients indicate an increasing likelihood of returning to normal politics or a smaller mandate effect. Negative coefficients indicate a decreasing probability of returning or a larger mandate effect. The media coverage, our measure of the content of the Washington community's perceptions of the election, should be negative—as the pro‐mandate media coverage decreases, the probability that a member will exit the mandate state increases. We expect to find that both gains and losses of victory margin lead members to lengthy deviations from their norm (producing a negative coefficient for both). Seniority should produce a positive coefficient, showing that members who are more senior quickly revert to normal behavior. Ideological extremity should be positive as should party, in‐party members less responsive. Other variables in the analysis serve to complete the specification, chamber and year dummy variables, producing no interesting prior expectations."
"51","The probability of exiting the mandate state, as seen in Table 1, is heavily influenced by the balance of the media coverage, loss in reelection margins, by ideological extremity, by party, and by chamber, and not at all influenced by seniority. Members respond to the messages they receive from both their constituents (see the coefficient of −0.82 for “Loss in Victory Margin”) and the media (−0.41). Ideologically extreme members, as expected, show short‐lived effects (0.02). The analysis does not support our expectation of greater out‐party effects. The coefficient (−0.54) is statistically significant but wrong signed. The finding that seniority does not affect the duration of the mandate effect runs counter to our expectations. These results, overall, are supportive of the core of our theory, but not all of the details and extrapolations.            "
"52","The coefficient estimates, because they are difficult to interpret, fail to depict the impact of the core substantive explanations on the length of time the members are affected. For that reason we turn to a graph of the predicted hazard rate. The effect of the explanation of interest is the shifting in the curve away from the baseline probability of exiting. As is standard with these types of graphs, the remaining independent variables need to be set to a certain value. The continuous variables are set to their mean, the year is set to 1995, and the chamber is the House. We have chosen the media scoring from 1995 to standardize the effect that varies across years. (The spikes observed in the predicted probability curve near the end of the session exist because of changes in the media depiction of the election at those points in time)."
"53"," Figure 6 indicates the impact of changes in a member's electoral margin on his or her reaction to the mandate signal. The line marked “Stable margin” indicates the predicted hazard rate for a hypothetical member of Congress whose electoral margin stayed the same. “Gain votes” and “Lose votes” are the predicted hazard rates for members who gain or lose one standard deviation over the mean change. Members whose victory margin is stable exit the most quickly. They receive no direct message from their constituents.            "
"54","                 Predicted Probability of Exiting Mandate State for Changes in Victory Margin                         "
"55","Change in victory margin induces change in behavior. Those whose margins improve—typically members of the party advantaged by the mandate—move slightly away from normal voting patterns toward the mandate. More dramatically, members threatened by declining vote shares move strongly toward adjusting behavior to fit new realities. This movement now adds important individual‐level confirmation to the mandate thesis; these are precisely the members our prior theory claims should be most likely to rethink their behavior. Thus we now know not only that a mandate message is seen in early votes, but also that the carriers of the message are those that our theory predicts should be most responsive.            "
"56","When behavior changes following an influential election, one can always invent stories to explain it. Perhaps the change is due to strategic agenda manipulation by party leaders? Or maybe the early session action is just a few votes on issues raised and settled in the election? These macro‐level interpretations are difficult to rule out. It is important in this context that the individual‐level evidence about who is affected and for how long is supportive of the mandate story and cannot be accounted for by other interpretations."
"57","The results presented so far indicate that individual members of Congress respond to perceptions of a mandate by changing how they vote on policy. It is possible that the sum of individual responses might not translate neatly into an aggregate response that can meaningfully change the final output of congressional policymaking. If, for example, only ideologically extreme members changed their votes, then the vote on a policy designed to appeal to the median ideological position within the Congress might not change. Ideologically extreme members are not often pivotal to the formation of a winning coalition. Ideologically moderate members are more often the pivotal votes. It is precisely these members who we find to exhibit the strongest response to the perceived mandate. Thus, we would expect that there would be substantial changes in the policy output of Congress, given the individual‐level results presented above."
"58","There is a relatively simple way to examine the potential for changes in policy output. Given our measure of equilibrium for each member of Congress, we can calculate the ideological position of the median member of each chamber over the course of the session. The change in the median position comes from two things. Individual members change their ideological voting over the course of the mandate dynamic. But these changes are not constant across members. The ideological ordering of members also changes as some members move back to their baseline equilibrium faster than others do. Figure 7 graphs the changes in the equilibrium of the median voter in each chamber over the course of the session. Recall, the equilibrium measure is the proportion of liberal votes cast by the member.         "
"59","                 Equilibrium of the Median Member of Each Chamber of Congress                      "
"60","While the magnitude of the change in the equilibrium of the median voter varies, the mandate response is clearly visible in each panel of the figure. In 1965, there is no systematic movement in the median voter of the House, but clear movement in the Senate. At the start of the session, the median member of the Senate takes the liberal side on four out of five votes, while at the end, the ratio is closer to five out of seven—a small, but substantively important change in the ideological composition of the Senate."
"61","The movement is greater in 1980. For both chambers, we see the expected ideological drift away from the perceived conservative mandate. Each chamber starts with the median member taking the liberal position on only one out of every five votes. The rate of change for the house is striking. By the 180th day of the session (roughly July 1), the proportion of liberal votes cast by the median member of the house has more than doubled. The movement for the Senate is smaller, but the median position moves by almost 15%.         "
"62","The 104th Congress exhibited the largest amount of change. While some of the magnitude stems from the remarkably conservative beginning (the equilibrium of the median voter in both chambers was less than 0.1), the amount of change is still striking. Unlike the 97th Congress, the greater movement was in the Senate. The median position amongst the Senators at first was to cast only one liberal vote out of 20 roll calls. By the end of the session, the median Senator was casting nearly seven out of 20 votes in the liberal direction. The changes in the Republican controlled house were large as well. The proportion of liberal votes cast by the median member more than doubled from the beginning to the end of the session.         "
"63","Taken together, these are not minor changes. We can see in these extraordinary cases that temporary changes of considerable importance do occur. Ideological positions may be relatively fixed over a long period of time, but strategic calculations respond to changing contexts. As individual members respond to the perceived mandate the ideological center of the chamber changes as well."
"64","The results reported here begin to demonstrate the importance of the policy message members of Congress take from significant election returns. While political scientists may disagree over the possibility of finding a policy mandate in a given set of election results, members of Congress seem to have little difficulty finding one. Members adjust their behavior, in the direction of the policy message. For some it is a means of insulating themselves from the changing electoral landscape. These members' responses to the mandate election are, we believe, an attempt to stave off the possibility of electoral defeat. For other members the mandate provides new opportunities to vote their ideological preferences."
"65","The changes members make in their voting behavior are predictable. Mandates, we have shown, are a temporary deviation from politics as usual; a deviation that has contributed to significant policy developments such as the Great Society, the Reagan Revolution, and the Contract with America. The effect of the mandate on the voting pattern of the entire Congress and on individual members, while significant, is short lived. This is a curious phenomenon. The electoral mandates we study are at least overstated and some would say altogether nonexistent. Be that as it may, the response to reports of mandate elections is real, and the resulting policy change is sometimes permanent. This is a curious phenomenon; the effect we study would occur whether or not the mandate interpretation is valid. Interpretations that arise from fantasy should be equally efficacious as those that reflect the real will of voters."
"66","Beyond the result that mandate elections led to changes in congressional policymaking, our research has one further implication. Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson (1995) put forth a micro‐model of member response to changes in public opinion that is based entirely on macro‐data. Members of Congress, they argue, have perceptions of what is the ideological make‐up of their constituency and alter their policy votes in anticipation of the electoral consequences. Mandate elections are the most forgiving of micro‐level test cases for these results. Ideological messages are clear and electoral consequences are plain to see. The results presented here close the loop. Stimson, Mac‐Kuen, and Erikson show member equilibria respond to changes in public opinion. We show that they additionally respond to the special surges of political change that occur in mandate elections. Their work shows aggregate effects only; this work adds individual member dynamics, the crucial missing evidence in the theory of dynamic representation.         "
"67","The representatives and Senators of this analysis, who respond both to the message of the mandate and then to the information flows that dispute and qualify the electoral message, act as if dynamic representation theory were true."
"68","The “First 100 days” is a common benchmark for the evaluation of a perceived mandate. It is a favorite of pundits and politicians alike. Given our methods for assessing the duration of the mandate response, we might ask, how long is the “First 100 days?” Our statistical technology has no straightforward approach to this question of practical import. Nevertheless, this is a fact that matters for understanding politics. Our approach to answering the question is to ask when we would locate the half‐life of estimated effects for our three cases. That is about 150 days."
"69","Event history analysis allows us to assess both the patterns and causes of change in political behavior; how the duration spent in one social state affects the probability some entity will make a transition to another social state (Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones 1997; Yamaguchi 1991). In the analysis at hand, we are interested in how the duration spent in the mandate state affects the probability that a member of Congress transitions back to his or her equilibrium voting pattern. The nature of our data led us to estimate the probability of exiting the mandate state via a discrete time‐hazard model (see Beck, Katz, and Tucker [1997] for an extended discussion of this model).8"
"70","In the data, each member of Congress has a line for each time period they are in the mandate state and one line for the period in which they exit back to their equilibrium‐voting pattern. The dependent variable is binary—whether or not the member returns to equilibrium in that period."
"71","There are two deviations from the standard logit model. First, one needs to recognize that the errors in the model will correlate within individual but across time. To account for this we use robust standard errors. The second problem is that the baseline hazard rate changes over time. That is, ignoring the dynamics of the model assumes that the baseline hazard is flat (the value of the constant in the estimation). This is likely to be false. To correct this, one needs to include some flexible estimate of the effect of time on the probability of exiting the mandate state."
"72","We will avoid two techniques, including a dummy variable for each legislative period and parameterizing the dummy variable as lying on a low‐order time polynomial. Beck (1996) discusses the limitations of these methods at length, the main weakness being that they are inflexible and may not pick up the correct pattern of duration dependence."
"73","We have chosen the method of fractional polynomials to capture the time aspect of our data. Fractional polynomials estimate a family of curves using power terms that are limited to a small, predefined, set of integer and noninteger values (Royston and Altman 1994). The method is designed to capture a rich set of curves while providing a parsimonious means of parameterizing the time effects.8 A fractional polynomial of degree m has m integer and/or fractional powers p1 < p2 < ⋯ < pm, and is of the form               "
