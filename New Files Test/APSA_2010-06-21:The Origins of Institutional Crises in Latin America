"1","In exploring why institutional instability emerges in Latin America, I concentrate on instances in which one national branch of government (executive, legislature, or judiciary) threatens the survival of another. As a result, some important instances of political instability, such as the attempted coup against Venezuela's Hugo Chávez in 2002, or the early departure of Bolivia's President Sánchez de Lozada in the midst of massive protest the following year, are necessarily excluded. Narrowing the focus, however, still encompasses the vast bulk of cases of institutional instability in contemporary Latin America and keeps the analysis theoretically tractable."
"2","To develop a systematic theory of the origins of interbranch crises, I borrow from the rational choice literature on interstate conflict. Using war as a theoretical analogue for institutional crises makes sense for a number of reasons. Similar to international relations, interbranch relations are largely self‐enforcing. Whether or not conflict or cooperation occurs in either domain largely depends on the incentives that institutional actors face. As in the international arena, there is considerable evidence that institutional actors in the domestic realm weigh carefully the costs and benefits of various strategies. Fujimori debated whether to stage a self‐coup over many months (Kenney 2004). According to his closest advisors, Correa's plan to dissolve the Ecuadorian Congress in 2008 was made well before he was elected.1 Anticipating how other institutional actors will respond and adjusting one's behavior accordingly is the very essence of strategic behavior.         "
"3","Of course, there are limits to the analogy. Impeachments are not wars. Branches do not seek territory from one another. The costs of battle in a dispute between judges and a president are less tangible, and (usually) less bloody, than in a full‐scale war. More interestingly, drawing on the crisis bargaining literature raises the fundamental question of whether interbranch crises, like wars, are also ex post inefficient. From a separation of powers perspective, for example, interbranch crises would seem to present a similar puzzle to that of war: institutional actors facing credible threats to their survival should simply adjust their behavior ex ante to avoid sanctions ex post (cf. Epstein and Knight 1998; Ferejohn and Weingast 1992). As such, we should rarely, if ever, observe sanctions against one branch being carried out against another. Yet, particularly compared to a phenomenon like war, institutional crises in Latin America are fairly widespread.         "
"4","As in the field of international relations, starting with the simplest strategic structure possible yields important insights while paving the way for more complicated models. But doing so also raises the question of whether the fundamental dyadic structure used in the international relations literature makes sense in the context of interbranch conflict. After all, to get rid of judges (at least legally), presidents must go through the legislatures. To remove presidents, legislatures sometimes have to act in concert with the judiciary. Yet, empirically interbranch attacks need not involve all three branches of government.2 Legislatures can act unilaterally to initiate impeachment proceedings against both presidents and judges. Executives may invoke extraconstitutional means to deal with recalcitrant legislatures and judges. And, at least on paper, judges enjoy fairly broad powers of investigation, which enable them to potentially threaten the survival of presidents and legislators (Rios‐Figueroa forthcoming). Thus, it makes sense to start with the simplest strategic setting first and explore fully its consequences before moving on to more complicated interactions.         "
"5","To begin to develop a strategic account of how interbranch crises emerge, I draw on the logic of the classic deterrence model (e.g., see Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman 1992). In Figure 1, there are two players, the Aggressor branch and the Target branch. Each makes a single decision. At the first node, the Aggressor decides whether or not to threaten the Target with an attack (C, ∼C). As I describe in the following section, substantively such attacks include impeachments, forced resignations, packing schemes, or the dissolution of the entire institution. While their specific form may vary, the common thread is that all of the threats entail the Target's survival. If the Aggressor does not issue a threat to attack, the game ends with the status quo (SQ) upheld. Alternatively, the Target is forced to choose between not resisting (∼R), which results in the outcome SQR, or resisting (R). If the Target chooses to resist, the outcome is Fight. The game thus contains a total of four possible actions in the game by {∼C, C, ∼R, R) and three outcomes {SQ, SQR, and Fight}.         "
"6","                 Interbranch Crisis Game                      "
"7","Following standard practice, payoffs are set to (0,0) for the status quo outcome. If a threat is waged and the Target acquiesces, then the Aggressor and Target each receive (W, −W), respectively, where W denotes the stakes of the political conflict. A president who successfully dissolves the legislature gains W by increasing control over a potential check on his power. Conversely, legislators who are removed lose –W, which are the benefits associated with their office. In the event that the Target refuses to acquiesce, both players end up fighting. At this node, the payoffs are determined by a lottery, p, representing the probability that the Aggressor will win, the stakes involved in the crisis, W, and the costs that each branch pays for engaging in an interbranch crisis, M. Here, I conceptualize M as a legitimacy cost for both actors, which each can suffer depending on the degree of legitimacy enjoyed by the opposing branch. A textbook example is the cost that Franklin Delano Roosevelt would have endured had he carried out his court‐packing plan against a relatively well‐established institution, the U.S. Supreme Court (Caldeira 1987; Friedman 2009). Given the notorious lack of public support for institutions in Latin America, it remains to be seen just how much of a constraint this parameter plays.         "
"8","Assuming that each branch knows its own payoffs and that each branch knows the other branch knows its payoffs and so forth, the solution to the game is straightforward. Here, the central intuitions hinge on each player's threshold for fighting. Working backwards, the Target's threshold for fighting is p < 2W − M/2W. Accordingly, the Target will acquiesce as long as the probability that the Aggressor will win is sufficiently high relative to M and W. Increasing the stakes effectively lowers the Target's threshold for fighting (i.e., the Target will challenge at greater levels of p). Increasing the costs, M, has the opposite effect. Note that for the Target's threshold to obtain, that is 0 < p <1, the legitimacy costs must always be equal to or lower than twice the value of stakes (M ≤ 2W). In the special case where M = 0, Targets always prefer resisting as long as W > 0."
"9","In turn, the Aggressor's attack threshold is p > W + M/2W. Provided that the Aggressor's expectations of success fall above this threshold, she will always prefer to threaten than stick with the status quo. Like the Target, increasing the stakes and lowering the costs lower the Aggressor's threshold for fighting (i.e., she will attack at lower levels of p). For the Aggressor's threshold to obtain, the key assumption is that W > 2M. Intuitively, if the stakes are not sufficiently high relative to the costs, then the Aggressor will not deviate from the status quo."
"10"," Figure 2 summarizes the thresholds for each actor in terms of the parameter p. As such, the strategy profile [∼C, R] is supported whenever p falls below the Aggressor's threshold, the strategy profile [C, ∼R] is supported whenever p falls above the Target's threshold, and the strategy profile [C, R] is supported whenever p falls in between each player's thresholds. Again, how large the parameter space is for fighting compared to the other two outcomes depends on the relative values the players attach to W and M. Higher stakes increase the fighting space; higher costs shrink it.         "
"11","                 Comparative Statics from Interbranch Crisis Game                      "
"12","Next, I graph the main predictions for each player.3Figure 3 maps the probability that the Aggressor will threaten as a function of the likelihood of success, P, and the stakes of the game, W, holding M constant. In the northeast corner of the figure, the Aggressor is most likely to fight, since both the stakes and the likelihood of success are high. Overall, increasing stakes and increasing the probability of success increases the probability of the Aggressor attacking. But, as the southeast corner shows, if the stakes are too low, a high probability of success is not sufficient to induce the Aggressor to threaten the Target. Conversely, if the Aggressor has no chance of winning, not even the highest stakes will induce him into a crisis. Figure 4 provides essentially the reverse image by showing that the probability that the Target will choose to fight is a function of the Aggressor's probability of winning in an institutional crisis and the stakes of the crisis. Here again, the figure shows that the probabilities of resistance tend to increase as the stakes increase and fall in p, but that at very high values of p and low values of w, Targets will simply acquiesce. Finally, as suggested by the foregoing discussion of each player's thresholds, Figure 5 captures the nonlinear effects of p on fighting. That is, insofar as Aggressors gain confidence in their ability to prevail, institutional battles become more likely as p increases, but only up to a certain point. For once p becomes too high, Targets will simply acquiesce.         "

"16","I operationalize interbranch crises as follows: one of the three main branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial) threatens or acts to remove, suspend, or alter fundamentally the personnel of another main branch of government. This operationalization captures (1) successful and failed attempts to impeach or remove presidents from office early, (2) successful and failed attempts to dissolve or suspend national legislatures or remove individual legislators, and (3) successful and failed attempts to impeach, remove early, or pack high courts. Similar to Pérez‐Liñán’s definition of presidential crises (2007), I exclude interbranch conflicts that either do not raise issues of survivability (e.g., policy disputes or gridlock) or institutional crises of survivability that do not emerge primarily as a result of interbranch strife (e.g., the mass demonstrations that led to Bolivian President Sanchez de Lozada resigning in 2003, or the failed military coup against Hugo Chávez in 2002). This, of course, does not rule out the fact that gridlock or protests may eventually lead into an interbranch crisis, nor that the military plays an important role in resolving interbranch crisis, as in Honduras in June 2009.            "
"17","To identify cases that meet the above criteria, I used the Latin American Weekly Report, which offers systematic coverage of significant political events in the region.4 Based on the information contained in these reports, I constructed the Institutional Crises in Latin America (ICLA) Dataset, which tracks and codes interbranch crises in 18 Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela) between 1985 and 2008. Following the theory, the unit of analysis is the interbranch dyad ordered by Aggressor‐Target (i.e., executive‐legislature, legislature‐executive, executive‐court, court‐executive, legislature‐court, court‐legislature) for each democratic country‐year. Because the main objective here is to explain why crises emerge or not, the dataset also contains “noncases” for each unit of analysis in which an interbranch crisis did not occur. The total number of observations in the dataset is 2,351.5"
"18","Each observation is classified in terms of the outcome of the crisis or noncrisis delineated in the theoretical model: status quo (SQ), acquiescence (SQR), or fight.6 Status quo cases, again, are simply cases in which no crisis involving a particular ordered dyad for a given country and year was identified using the criteria described above. The main coding rule for distinguishing among the two crisis outcomes was the following: Targets that explicitly waged counterthreats, made or attempted counterattacks, or tried otherwise to maintain their posts were coded as “fighting.” By contrast, Targets that were removed without making any of these gestures were coded as “acquiescing.”7 Thus, for example, Argentine justices facing impeachment in 2002 handed down a series of decisions overturning the government's economic policy, which, in the midst of the country's worst economic crisis in history, jeopardized the government's very survival. Thus, the outcome is coded here as “fighting.” By contrast, Rafael Correa's recent efforts to remake the Ecuadorian Supreme Court were largely met without much resistance, and thus the case is coded as “acquiesce.” Finally, my interpretations of each of the crisis case histories were then subsequently checked against a variety of primary and secondary sources to maximize their validity.8"
"19","Between 1985 and 2008 there were a total of 108 interbranch crises in Latin America. Given the structure of the ICLA dataset (ordered dyad country‐year), crises occurred in just about 5% of all observations. Unfortunately, there are no identical data for other parts of the world, so whether or not Latin America is particularly prone to this type of institutional instability we cannot say. We do know, however, that compared to other important political phenomena, the incidence of institutional instability in the region is relatively high. Post‐WWII wars occur merely 0.3% of the time (King and Zeng 2001). Institutional crises also outpace regime change in Latin America during the twentieth century. For instance, in the two decades that comprise the Third Wave, transitions to democracy occurred in 16 out of 135 regime‐years, or about 11.9% of the time (Mainwaring and Pérez‐Liñán 2005, 20). If we switch to use country‐year as our baseline, institutional crises occur about 27% of the time.            "
"20"," Figure 6 shows the distribution of interbranch crises in Latin America by country. On average, most of the countries experiencing crises have had fewer than 10; Ecuador stands out with 23 crises. Note also the rough bimodal distribution here: countries tend to experience multiple crises or none at all. Of those that are crisis prone, it is hardly surprising that the vast majority frequently head the list of Latin America's most distressed democracies: Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, Venezuela, and Argentina (cf. Hagopian and Mainwaring 2005). Likewise, the countries with the fewest interbranch conflicts include many of the region's success stories: Uruguay, Costa Rica, and, most recently, Mexico. However, Chile, often considered one of the area's strongest and most stable democracies, has experienced a relatively high number of crises.9 Meanwhile, some of the most troubled Central American democracies (e.g., Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala) appear to have some of the lowest total numbers of interbranch conflicts.10 Still, the overall picture of interbranch strife generally mirrors the scholarly consensus about variation in the quality of democracy across the region and thus lends external validity to the data.            "
"21","                 Number of Interbranch Crisis by Country, 1985–2008                         "
"22","The pattern of institutional crises across countries shown in Figure 6 also casts some doubt on the assumption that older and wealthier democracies are automatically more insulated from institutional instability. Although one of the most established democracies, Costa Rica, falls at the low end of the conflict spectrum, other similarly long‐lived democracies, such as Colombia and Venezuela, have witnessed relatively high levels of institutional conflict over the last decade. Nor does it seem that wealth makes a difference. Argentina and Chile have experienced a relatively high number of crises. But among the most impoverished countries in the region (those with per capita GDP< $5,000), institutional instability was widespread in only a little more than half of the cases (Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru), and rare in the rest (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras).            "
"23","The overall incidence of institutional instability has been remarkably stable over the last two and a half decades. Although the total number of interbranch crises between 1985 and 1989 (n = 8) is relatively low (perhaps due to the smaller sample size of fewer democratic country‐years), if we take the number of crises by five‐year increments between 1990 and 2005, the results are strikingly consistent. There were 24 crises between 1990 and 1994, 28 crises between 1995 and 1999, and 27 crises between 2000 and 2004. A total of 21 crises have occurred during the last three years of the dataset. When we consider the trends in time by country, however, some interesting differences begin to emerge. In Ecuador, Bolivia, and, to a lesser extent, Argentina and Venezuela, the number of crises has been noticeably higher in the new millennium. By contrast, most of the interbranch crises experienced by Colombia, Peru, and Chile seem to be largely confined to the 1990s."
"24","Legislatures are clearly the most aggressive of the three branches. All told, the legislative branch initiated roughly 55% of all interbranch crises (59/108), while the executive did so in only about 39% of the cases (42/108). These findings echo the familiar point that in most Latin American constitutions, legislatures simply have more institutional mechanisms for carrying out sanctions than other branches (cf. Pérez‐Liñán 2007). By contrast, courts are far more reluctant to attack. Despite whatever powers of investigation are at their disposal, it seems that lacking both the purse and the sword has its consequences. Courts acted as the main aggressor against the legislature in just 6% of all cases, and never did so against the executive. As the aggregate temporal patterns suggest, attacks against all three of the branches rose in the 1990s and have remained relatively high since 2000. In the last decade alone, courts have been targeted nearly 20 times, while legislatures and executives have been targeted a total of 14 times each.            "
"25","The distribution in the types of threats varies according to the branch being targeted. As one would expect, legislatures most frequently tend to go after executives by invoking the specter of impeachment. Specifically, 84% of such attacks involved formal impeachment proceedings against the sitting president; in the rest of the cases congress simply demanded the president's resignation or recall. Executives, in turn, tend to threaten legislatures with dissolution or purges, though occasionally they demand that individual legislators resign. The type of threat courts face is fairly evenly split between impeachment and attempts to pack or purge. 11"
"26","In this section I discuss the independent variables constructed for the purposes of capturing the three main parameters in the model—stakes, legitimacy costs, and shared expectations about the Aggressor's likelihood of success—as well as several control variables. Let me start with the measure for stakes, which I operationalize here as the imbalance of institutional powers between the Aggressor and Target branch. The underlying logic is that concentrating institutional power raises the stakes of the game, whereas dispersing power reduces them.12 Note that whereas the critique of power imbalances usually is directed purely against strong presidencies (Linz 1994), this measure allows us to explore the possibility that any skewed institutional relationship is potentially problematic. Indeed, in Peru, Fujimori ultimately sacked the legislature and rewrote the rules of the game arguably because he thought congress had too much power relative to the executive branch.13"
"27","The variable Stakes was constructed as follows. First, I combined existing measures of each branch's institutional powers and put them on a common scale. The original measure for executive powers comes from Alemán and Tsebelis's (2005) scale of legislative powers enjoyed by presidents in Latin America and is recoded to range from 0 to 16. The measure for legislative powers is simply the difference between the total score possible for a president (16) and the executive's actual score. Thus, a score of 12 on the presidential scale for a given observation would result in a score of 4 on the legislative scale. The original measure for judicial powers draws on data gathered by Ríos‐Figueroa (2009) that codes the review powers of the high court.14"
"28","I then matched each of these scores to the particular ordered dyad in a given country and year to create separate Aggressor and Target power measures for each observation in the dataset. Drawing on these two measures, the variable Stakes is based on the absolute difference between the Aggressor's score and the Target's for each observation. Using the previous example in which a particular president receives a score of 12, the score then for that particular executive‐legislative dyad would be 8. Higher scores thus reflect larger power imbalances between a given set of institutional actors. The range is 0–16 with a mean of 5.75, and the standard deviation is 3.66.            "
"29","To proxy for the legitimacy costs of waging institutional attacks against a given branch of government, I draw on public opinion data contained in the Latinobarómetro (1995–2008). Specifically, the Latinobarómetro contains a series of survey questions asking citizens how much confidence or trust they have in each of the three branches of government (“a lot,”“some,”“little,” or “none”).15 Using these data, I then generate average support scores for each institution lagged by one year and then match these to the particular Aggressor branch and Target branch for each observation in the dataset.16 Thus, the variables A_Legitimacy and T_Legitimacy effectively capture the level of public support for each Aggressor and Target, respectively.            "
"30","While the common view that institutions in Latin America are distrusted is hardly misplaced, even a casual glance at these data reveals considerable variation in public trust across different institutions, across countries, and over time. For instance, on average the percentage of people who report having “a lot” or “some” trust in the executive branch is about 36% and ranges from just 7% in Argentina in 2002 in the midst of one of the country's most severe economic crises to 71% in Peru in 1995 during Fujimori's successful bid for a second term. On average only about 27% of Latin Americans have a positive perception of Congress. But again the range is considerable, from just 6% reporting trust in the legislature in Ecuador during 2003, 2006, and 2007 compared to 58% in Uruguay in 2005. The image of courts is slightly better, with about 32% of citizens reporting some or a lot of confidence in the judiciary. Here again, though, there are enormous differences across countries, from a low of 8% in Ecuador in 2003 to a high of 60% in Costa Rica in 1998."
"31","Perhaps the most challenging parameter to measure empirically is each branch's expectations about the likelihood of winning an institutional battle.17 Here, I exploit the time‐series nature of the dataset making using of each Target's recent history of crises. The measure TLossRate draws on information about the number of crises that a particular Target has been involved in previously and the outcome of those crises. The variable then serves as a kind of moving batting average, which is constituted by mutually shared information about the Target's vulnerability.18 Specifically, I assign a score of 0 to Targets that have never been the object of attack, −1 to Targets that have previously been attacked but the Target won, and 1 to Targets that have previously been attacked and lost. Thus, larger scores indicate more vulnerable Targets and provide a plausible measure of shared expectations for both players.            "
"32","The remaining variables allow me to control for a host of other factors that may potentially affect the likelihood of institutional instability. Here I consider three types of controls in particular. First, as noted above, a widespread contention in the literature is that divided government necessarily increases the perils of presidentialism (Linz 1994; Mainwaring 1993; Mainwaring and Shugart 1997; but also see Cheibub 2002). Although divided government has mainly been applied to explain regime instability, including the measure LHpercent, which is based on the percentage of lower house seats controlled by the president's party, enables me to assess the effects of divided government on interbranch crises. Second, I include the variable Democracy for the amount of time since the country's transition to democracy. This allows me to systematically explore whether newer or more established democracies are more or less prone to institutional crises.19 Finally, to address the possibility that poverty and adverse economic conditions trigger interbranch crises, I include the lagged measures GDP and Growth."
"33","In this section, I use the ICLA dataset to explore the various hypotheses that emerge from the strategic account. I begin with a logit analysis and then replicate the analysis using the QRE estimator developed by Signorino (1999). Whereas starting with an off‐the‐shelf estimator allows me to begin to explore both the simple monotonic and nonmonotonic relationships between the variables, arguably it does not fully capture the strategic interaction between the two players. Remarking on the classic deterrence model, which is virtually identical to the model used here, Signorino and Yilmaz (2003) demonstrate that the failure to statistically model the purported interdependence in decision making contained in the theoretical model potentially results in misspecification. Specifically, by failing to model statistically the theoretical supposition that the Aggressor conditions her decision on the Target's probability of resisting, we run the risk of omitted variable bias. Nevertheless, logit is routinely used in comparative politics to test strategic models and offers a good starting line. As it happens, both estimators yield a substantively similar set of results.20"
"34","Models 1 and 2 contained in Table 1 assess the effects of the variables for stakes, legitimacy, and expectations of success on the likelihood of the Fight outcome versus both the Status Quo outcome and the SQR outcome.21 Leaving aside for a moment the more complex relationships uncovered in Figures 2–5, here we focus on testing the basic claims that increasing stakes and decreasing legitimacy costs have a monotonic positive effect on the probability of fighting, whereas p, captured here by the variables TLossRate and , has a nonmonotonic effect on fighting.22 That is, while increasing p up to a certain point (i.e., past the Aggressor's threshold) increases the likelihood of the Aggressor threatening the Target, raising p beyond a certain point (i.e., past the Target's threshold) should decrease the probability of fighting and increase the probability that the Target will simply acquiesce.         "
"35","The variable Stakes is positive in the expected direction and significant at the .10 level in the first model and just shy of significance in the second. The variable T_Legitimacy is also in the expected direction, in this case, negative, and is significant at the .10 level in both models.23 A simulated expected probability that an institutional crisis will occur in a low‐stakes environment, holding all other variables at their mean, high is just 5%. Change the scenario to a high‐stakes environment and the probability increases to 11%. Likewise, holding all other variables at their mean, decreasing the Target's legitimacy from the highest level to the lowest level raises the probability of crisis from 3% to 13%. Switch simultaneously the scenario from low stakes and high legitimacy to a scenario of high stakes and low legitimacy and the probability jumps from 2% to 21%.         "
"36","In both logit models we capture nonlinear effects of the parameter p with TLossRate and its square. Note that the predicted inverted U‐shaped effect is present only if both the sign of the coefficient for TLossRate is positive and the sign for  is negative. Although both coefficients are in the expected direction in Model 1, neither is statistically significant. Adding in the controls in Model 2 changes the signs, though neither is significant.         "
"37","To assess why some of the predicted relationships hold while others do not, I delve more deeply into the strategic interaction between the Aggressor and Target using Signorino's (1999) QRE estimator. Following Carter (2007), to estimate the statistical model I normalize an outcome for each actor to zero for each player's information set or decision node.24"
"38","Unlike standard regression tables, all of the columns in Table 2 are estimated simultaneously as part of a unified model.25 Thus, SQ serves as the baseline for interpreting the Aggressor's utility to threatening, UA (Fight) in column 2. SQR serves as the baseline for the Target's utility for Resisting, UT (Fight), in column 3. The non–status quo outcomes serve as the baseline for the control variables in column 1. Here, we see in a more nuanced way the relationships suggested by the logit model. Starting with the Aggressor, each and every coefficient associated with the strategic model performs in the expected direction. The variables for Stakes and T_Legitimacy remain significant at the level of .10 or greater. Note that the coefficient for TLossrate is now also positive, as we would expect for the Aggressor, and statistically significant at the .01 level. When we turn to the results for the Target, all of the coefficients are also in the expected direction (negative for both TLossrate and A_Legitimacy), but here only the variable for Stakes is statistically significant. Overall, then, these results are roughly consistent with the fact that in the logit model stakes and legitimacy had a monotonic effect on the probability of interbranch crises. But, they also provide some clues about why p did not have the expected nonmonotonic effect on the likelihood of interbranch fighting.         "
"39","To further elaborate what is happening, Figures 7–9 directly compare the previous theoretical predictions graphed above (here shown again on the left) to the empirical results from the QRE model (graphed here on the right) for each of the players. Figure 7 shows that, as in the theoretical model, the Aggressor's probability is increasing in both expectations of success and stakes in the empirical model as well. The only real difference is that the empirical relationship between these two parameters is somewhat less conditional than the theory led us to expect. Empirically, Aggressors are likely to challenge even when stakes are low as long as their expectations of success are sufficiently large.         "
"40","                 Theoretical Results Compared to Empirical Results for Aggressor Challenging                      "
"41","                 Theoretical Results Compared to Empirical Results for Target Resisting                      "
"42","                 Theoretical Results Compared to Empirical Results for Fighting                      "
"43","In Figure 8 the main difference, of course, is that empirically the Target's probability of resisting is less sensitive to changes in p when stakes are high than the theory predicted. The fact that the Target is less affected by expectations of winning or losing at high levels of stakes, in turn, leads to a much flatter and more monotonic picture of the joint effects of expectations and stakes on the probability of fighting. Thus, the right‐hand graph in Figure 9 looks considerably more like Figure 2 than like Figure 3 (shown again here on the left). But, given the negative sign for TLossRate for the Target, note that increasing expectations of success certainly has a less positive effect on the probability of fighting than it does on the Aggressor's initial decision to challenge.26"
"44","Taken together, the empirical analysis suggests the power of using a simple strategic model, but also points to some important limits. Perhaps most importantly, the results hinted at in the logit model and captured more explicitly in the QRE model raise the larger question of why the Aggressor's calculus appears to be better captured by the strategic model than the Target’s. Put differently, if Aggressors are driven into institutional crises by a combination of carefully weighed factors, why are the stakes of the game apparently the only relevant factor for Targets? One possibility, of course, is that branches that are targeted are forced to respond in the heat of the moment, which leaves them little room for the kind of calculation of trade‐offs afforded to Aggressors."
"45","Another possibility takes us back to the comparative statics provided by the model. Recall that the Target's threshold P < 2W−M/2W means that the decision to resist largely hinges on the value of M. Where M = 0, Targets will simply always choose to fight as long as p < 1. Thus, if it is the case that institutional actors with lower levels of legitimacy are themselves more likely to initiate crises, then the parameter space for fighting increases, just not in the particular way we have modeled. Indeed, perhaps the reason that we do not uncover the effects of M on the Target is precisely because they are occurring earlier in the game as part of the Aggressor's decision to select themselves into crises."
"46","Although a complete analysis of such a selection effect is beyond the scope of this article, a quick glance at the mean legitimacy scores for Aggressors provides some initial support for this supposition. Overall, if we look at the percentages of respondents who report having a lot or some confidence in the Aggressor branch, we find a difference of roughly 5 percentage points between those who threaten and those who do not. While all institutional actors who stick with the status quo tend to enjoy greater legitimacy, the differences are particularly stark for presidents: on average only 29% of presidents who initiate crises enjoy the public's trust, compared to 39% for presidents who do not launch such attacks. While such a difference may not entirely account for the Target's behavior, it certainly increases the parameter space in which fighting strictly dominates acquiescence."
"47","This article provides the first systematic description and explanation of interbranch crises in Latin America, and the developing world more generally. While certainly numerous other scholars of the region have pointed out that institutional actors are strategic, this article is the first to consider how a strategic framework can explain why, when, and how institutional crises emerge and evolve. Borrowing from the theoretical and methodological literature in the subfield of international relations, the article develops a unified theory and test of the calculus of institutional instability. Here, I discuss the broader substantive implications and suggest several directions for future research."
"48","Starting with the article's main empirical results, there is consistent support for the theoretical propositions regarding the Aggressor's initial decision to launch an attack. Using two different statistical methods, I showed that deviations from the status quo are influenced by a combination of the stakes of the game, the Target's public support, and the Aggressor's expectations of success. Yet, less intuitively, I also found that branches that are targeted generally preferred to fight regardless of the costs attached to resistance or expectations about success. This, in turn, led me to speculate that if branches with less legitimacy were themselves more prone to initiate crises, then resistance on the part of the Target would be virtually costless once threats are made."
"49","Whereas this proposition fits within the current theoretical framework and can be tested fairly easily with a revised selection model, a potentially more interesting—albeit complicated—set of questions emerges if we instead think about interbranch crises as a repeated game in which actors' decisions endogenously affect both their own and their opponent's legitimacy. Indeed, as the basic patterns in the data suggest, we already know that crises tend to repeat in particular countries and institutions—think Ecuadorian presidents or Argentine judges. Similar to the idea of a “coup trap” (Londregan and Poole 1990), it seems that countries become mired in an institutional instability trap. Thus far, we have only begun to capture this by looking at how the Target's past history shapes expectations of success. In the current model, however, institutional legitimacy is treated purely as an exogeneous parameter. But, if staging institutional crises also can lower or raise an actor's legitimacy or their opponent’s, then the calculus for both actors is considerably more complicated.         "
"50","In addition, by showing generally that an uneven distribution of power among branches increases the potential for conflict, the article provides both a new arena for and a new twist to the familiar “perils of presidentialism” argument. Simply put, the article suggests that stripping all power from the presidency may be just as dangerous as concentrating all power in the executive branch. Likewise, imbuing judges and legislators with considerable power may strengthen horizontal accountability, but it also potentially raises the incentives executives face to try to capture and control such institutions. If these conclusions are correct, they hint at a more fundamental commitment problem, which institutions create, not solve. As such, another fruitful avenue for future research would be to explore whether more complicated models of commitment problems gleaned from the formal theory literature on war (Powell 1999) or from the literature on regime transitions (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006) improve our inferences about the origins of institutional instability.         "
"51","Last but not least, although the main objective here has been to explain why crises emerge, the dataset paves the way for a more rigorous analysis of the consequences of institutional instability than heretofore possible. As noted above, most scholars of Latin America have widely scorned institutional instability, treating it as part and parcel of the problems of democratic consolidation. Yet, it may be that it is precisely the recourse to mechanisms of last resort, such as impeachment, that allows democratic regimes in presidential systems to survive (cf. Pérez‐Liñán 2005). Exploring in a systematic fashion how such institutional crises affect democratic stability and economic development is now possible with the data at hand.         "
