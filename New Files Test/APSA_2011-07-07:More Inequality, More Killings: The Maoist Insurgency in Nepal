"1","Although Nepal is a small country, the lessons from its attempts at economic and political emergence are anything but small. The Nepal experience provides a classic setting for understanding why other emerging countries have hesitated to experiment with political liberalizations. Never since its unification in 1768 has Nepal experienced such a violent division within its own rank and file. Ganguly and Shoup (2005) provide an account of experiments with democracy, their failure to improve the average citizen's livelihood, and the rise of the Maoists.         "
"2","The birth of democracy in Nepal can be traced to the 1950s when the prominent freedom fighter B. P. Koirala made his group's prodemocracy stance vocally and actively felt. They succeeded in pushing the monarchy, at the time led by King Mahendra, into making political parties legal and allowing elections. An overwhelming electoral victory in 1959 brought Koirala's party, the Nepali Congress (NC), to power, only to see the monarchy wrest it back and ban political parties. Mahendra's son Birendra assumed the monarchy in 1972. In the face of a people's revolt—the “jana andolan”—in 1990, he lifted the ban on political parties. The andolan was a watershed: by enabling key figures of the Maoist movement, heretofore a banned underground movement, to legitimately participate politically it initiated a multiparty system.         "
"3","The democratic reforms implemented under the 1990 constitution were illusory to the majority. They failed to address fundamental problems facing Nepalese citizens—great inequality and widespread poverty were reflected in high infant mortality, lack of basic amenities like power and clean water, and importantly, a palpable rural‐urban divide. These shortcomings were dire in the countryside. Upper‐caste Hindu‐led parties pursued interests distant from the median voter. The median voter was illiterate and had stronger ties to his ethnic community than to the nation. The conditions were ripe for a violent revolt pitting Maoists against the monarchy and its supporting elites."
"4","In 1991, the communist United People's Front (UPF) was the third largest political party in the lower house of Parliament. In 1994, a militant faction broke away from the UPF parent, ran a parallel party, boycotted the midterm elections, and threatened to start a violent campaign. On February 13, 1996, the splinter party started the People's War. It began with simultaneous attacks on three remotely stationed police outposts, a bank branch, a soft‐drinks bottling plant, a liquor factory, and a private house. A guerilla strategy of establishing bases in the rural and remote areas fared the insurgents well in redistributing captured land from absentee landlords to the locals, who could farm the land under a system of cooperatives. Police brutalization of Maoist sympathizers triggered widespread support of the rural population to the Maoist cause. What started as an isolated incident in 1996 triggered a devastating 10‐year conflict that claimed more than 13,000 lives and displaced more than 200,000 people."
"5","Nepal's vacillating transition may be viewed usefully through the lens of Bueno de Mesquita and colleagues' (2003) selectorate theory. Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2009) posit that regimes of resource‐poor countries like Nepal are more likely to share power than are regimes in resource‐rich countries. True to that prediction, Nepal's monarchy acceded to Koirala's nascent movement that formed the Nepali Congress party. The monarchy then coopted NC party elites into the selectorate, expanding the grabbing hands of the selectorate, but not the franchise. Once Maoist party leaders understood the NC elites were compromised by the monarchy, their options narrowed down to either seizing power or backing down (perhaps for generations). Emboldened by the experience of the andolan, a militant splinter‐group threw down the glove.         "
"6","Did Maoist leaders expect the spark they lit in 1996 to ignite a decade‐long war? Intended, probably; expected, probably not. The festering generations‐long cleavages had created the preconditions for revolt in each village. A rural “third estate,” not unlike that in prerevolution France, existed.5 However, it is hard to imagine the decade‐long war was centrally coordinated. More likely, once cracks and weaknesses in the system became exposed, individuals and close‐knit groups independently updated their personal beliefs. Villages with cohesive groups joined the 1996 call to arms. As their numbers swelled, the rebellion spread to other villages and the guerilla movement sustained.6"
"7","A move by Parliament to abolish the monarchy, initiated in 1996, came into force in 2008. The problem with this nascent democracy is that underlying problems remain, with the Maoist movement never far from taking up arms to solve the problems they perceive to persist. There exists an uneasy peace after the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord between the Nepalese government and the Maoists on November 21, 2006. The likelihood that another outbreak catapults out of control over an extended period remains, as long as its underlying causes remain unresolved."
"8","Economic inequality as the primary driver of conflict is at the crux of theories advanced by Boix (2003) and Acemoglu and Robinson (2005) about how political regimes evolve. Nepal in many ways exemplifies the Boix‐Acemoglu‐Robinson mechanics. Their logic of the emergence of democracy is this. In democracies, the poor are able to impose higher taxes on the rich, and therefore redistribute to themselves a higher share of GDP than they can in nondemocracies. As a result, the poor are prodemocracy, while the elites strongly oppose it. In nondemocracies, excluding the poor from political power poses the threat of revolution. To prevent this from becoming reality, the elite redistribute just sufficiently to prevent revolution. But since such redistribution is not guaranteed into the future, the prevention of revolution is temporary. Permanently circumventing the threat of revolution requires that the elites currently in power credibly commit to sufficient future redistributions. This is accomplished by a cooperative regime change in which, for example, voting rights are granted. The birth of democracy, however, does not make redistribution permanent, since elites have the incentive and ability to take power by force, for example, by coup d’état. On their part, the poor correctly understand that agreeing to a low level of future taxation makes democracy more palatable to elites and prevents them from reverting to autocracy. If the commitment to low taxes is not credible about future levels of taxation, when taxes become high coups become likely.         "
"9","That is why inequality matters.7 Unequal societies fluctuate in and out of democracy because they are unable to resolve the conflict between the elites and the poor about the acceptable level of redistribution through taxation. When the poor are in power, they enforce a high level of redistribution that would create circumstances for seizing power back.         "
"10","The threat of anarchy or revolution in the Boix‐Acemoglu‐Robinson mechanism often remains latent. But, what circumstances compel anarchy to materialize? This central question motivates us. We find answers in well‐developed, but separate, literatures. The three main ingredients in our theory are, in sequence:"
"11","            "
"12","Long‐lived inequality"
"13","Overcoming the collective action problem"
"14","Determinants of a sustained anarchy"
"15","We take these, in turn."
"16","Sociologists like Gurr (1970) have attributed “relative deprivation” to long‐lived inequality. It is a feeling capable of uniting the underclass for rebellion if they are given the means to rebel. Why inequality persists in many countries but erodes in others is a central theme of dynastic models of intergenerational utility (see, e.g., Piketty 2000). Low intergenerational mobility rates are the prime cause of persistent inequality in these models.8 Among the reasons advanced for why intergenerational mobility rates are especially low in developing countries, Banerjee and Newman's (1993) theory is popular. They attribute it to the unavailability of credit to the poor, who are unable to furnish collateral against their borrowing. Banerjee and Newman's model produces “mobility traps.” A large mass of poor workers produces a low initial wage equilibrium (credit constraints ensure their nonparticipation in capital markets). This persists over generations as the large demand for capital produces even higher interest rates, preventing the poor from borrowing and participating in wealth creation through capital markets. The rich can and do participate in high‐yielding projects requiring large investments. As they grow richer, the dual economy becomes increasingly unequal and the economic cleavage deepens.            "
"17","In a number of poor countries, the initial distribution of land ownership has perpetuated low mobility traps through this mechanism.9Behrman, Gaviria, and Székely (2001) show that unequal access to educational opportunities is a source of low mobility traps: in Brazil, the likelihood of a white‐collar occupation is 2.6 times higher if one's father had a similar occupation than if he had a blue‐collar occupation. The numbers are 3.5 for Mexico, 2.8 for Peru, but only 1.5 for the United States. It is probably worse in Nepal: while the share of agriculture in the national income is only one‐third, 75% of the Nepalese population is engaged in this sector. Land ownership is highly unequal in agriculture, especially in districts with the most cultivable land (Macours 2006; Thapa and Sijapati 2003).            "
"18","While redistribution as a consequence of inequality has been featured in recent models,10 violent redistribution requires a distinctly different calculus. How the problem of collective action, which leads to collective violence, is solved is central to this calculus. Overcoming the collective action problem requires a personal assessment by each potential participant, of the probability of success and failure if they took up arms, and its rewards or consequences. The personal assessment depends crucially on whether other individuals participate as well. Otherwise inequality produces a dormant force, perhaps a social movement, but not a militant revolt.            "
"19","“Horizontal” or intergroup inequality is beginning to be seen as the more powerful driver of violent conflict than “vertical” inequality among individuals (Stewart 2002). Our theory provides a simple explanation: horizontal inequality solves the problem of collective action naturally. Common identity—tribal, religious, or caste—bonds each group (Akerlof and Kranton 2000). Inequality separates these groups, and more inequality polarizes them. The greater their polarization, the greater is the potential for violent intergroup conflict (Montalvo and Reynal‐Querol 2005).            "
"20","Transitions to democracy provide numerous opportunistic triggers that can spur violent collective action. By exposing weakness in the state's institutional muscle used for suppressing discontent, such transitions trigger collective movements. Cracks in the status quo create a once‐in‐many‐generations opportunity for the repressed to take control of institutions for redistribution. The 1990 andolan was such an event for the Maoists because it exposed deficiencies in the monarchy's control over the state's resources. As the rural classes updated their chances of success, they grew restive in villages across the country.            "
"21","Once revolts start, they can be short‐lived or they can be long and indecisive. What determines whether revolts are put down or become drawn out? Revolts can transition a stable (authoritarian) system to another stable system or a similar one. What stable system lies at the end?Hirshleifer's (1995) theory answers these questions.11 Two groups (Maoists (M) and Government (G)) divide their available resources between productive efforts EM and EG, which produce income, and fighting efforts FM and FG, which are used to forcibly acquire resources or protect from such acquisition. The relative amount of fighting resources FM/FG determines the relative proportion pM/pG in which the total country's resources get shared, but via “decisiveness” parameters mM and mG. If both m's are low, they favor entrenchment in which defense wins, while high m's produce large payoffs to fighting effort and yield rapid results. In winner‐take‐all systems, therefore, m is high for at least one group, leading that group to expend a high F and win. In pre‐1959 Nepal, high mG prevailed in the winner‐take‐all monarchy. By forcing the monarchy to recognize the NC party, Koirala's movement effectively lowered mG. That is, the same fighting effort by the monarchy now brought fewer rewards. The 1990 andolan lowered mG even further as a third (Maoist) party was allowed to emerge.            "
"22","The first prediction from Hirshleifer's model (1995, 33) is that sufficiently low m sustains an anarchic system: the two groups embark upon a prolonged and indecisive conflict. It is a fairly accurate theoretical portrayal of Nepal's People's War.12"
"23","To sum up, long‐lived inequality polarized Nepal's society into two groups, breeding animus that fueled Hirshleifer's anarchy mechanism. Before the polarized underclass in Nepal became united at the national level, they were more closely bonded within their villages. The collective action problem was more easily resolved at that micro level. The trigger that set in motion Maoist killings was a combination of the andolan that exposed vulnerability in the opposition, and the breakdown of power‐sharing negotiations with the elites in the nascent democracy. Knowledge that the elites had failed to stamp out the first (isolated) wave of Maoist violence in 1996 only affirmed the weakness of the elites. These incidents lowered private assessments of mG sufficiently to galvanize revolt in more villages, beginning a long period of killings across Nepal's villages in the People's War. We state our main hypothesis, as:            "
"24","               "
"25","H1: Greater inequality causes more killings.                     "
"26","A second prediction from the model (Hirshleifer 1995, 33) is that unless a minimum equilibrium income ensues, anarchy breaks down into an order in which the richer party dominates. Thus, where poverty levels are high, we should see no conflict, for it is not viable. Sen (1992, chap. 7) stresses the view of poverty as a deprivation condition beyond the income space, as a failure of basic capabilities. Failure to possess minimum acceptable capabilities only reinforces Hirshleifer's prediction. Our second hypothesis is thus:            "
"27","               "
"28","H2: Poverty prevents people from engaging in conflict due to a destitution constraint. Thus, poverty is associated with no killings or fewer killings.                     "
"29","Hypothesis 2 is relevant to the greed versus grievance debate initiated by Collier and Hoeffler (2004) and Fearon and Laitin (2003). They find opportunities for rebellion to be the greater force behind civil wars, not inequality. Our results contradict their findings—grievance is the major driver of civil conflict, and the dimension of grievance that is important for civil conflict is inequality. In Murshed and Tadjoeddin's (2009) view, violent conflict is fundamentally due to the breakdown of institutions. Poverty and growth failure due to this breakdown simply accelerates the degradation of the social contract. While we agree, we add that unequal societies are much more likely to violently react to the degradation.            "
"30","The hypotheses motivate empirically explaining violent conflict in Nepalese villages as:             "
"31","Greater inequality is hypothesized to cause more killings. The sign on POVERTY is predicted to be zero or negative; villages are simply too poor to mount an organized force and are bound by a destitution constraint. However, it could be positive if poverty is a cause espoused by those able and willing to seek redistribution by force on behalf of those in poverty. Whether it is the former or the latter case should be of interest in understanding Maoist strategy."
"32","Nepal is administratively divided into 75 districts and over 3,900 village development committees (VDCs) or villages. Our sample covers over 95% of the Nepalese villages. The finer village‐level detail distinguishes our study from the Do‐Iyer, Acharya, and Murshed‐Gates studies. The dependent variable KILLINGS is the total number of persons killed in each village by Maoists during the period 1996–2003. The conflict data are drawn from annual reports of the Informal Sector Services Center (INSEC), a nonprofit national human rights organization. The annual reports contain details such as the date of each event that resulted in human casualties, the circumstances surrounding the event, and the number of deaths. Based on these reports, the casualty data are summed for the eight‐year period. Since time‐series data on inequality, polarization, and poverty are nonexistent at the village level, we use the village cross‐section to make inferences. Heterogeneity at the district level is controlled using fixed effects.13 Since the period over which the dependent variable is measured leads other variables, it reduces (but does not eliminate) concerns about endogeneity.         "
"33","We use two main measures of economic inequality, the Gini and a polarization measure. The Gini measures vertical inequality, while the polarization measure quantifies horizontal inequality. The construction of these measures requires consumption expenditures at the household level, covering all villages in Nepal. We combine two sources of information in order to obtain household consumption expenditures. The 2001 Nepal Population Census administered a long form to one in every eight households in Nepal, covering over 500,000 households. While the long form elicited information on a number of household and community characteristics, it did not ask about income or expenditures. Household consumption data, however, are accurately available for a more limited number of households from the World Bank's Living Standard Measurement Survey for Nepal conducted in 1995–96 jointly with Nepal's Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS 2004, 2005), to which we refer as the Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS). The NLSS collected information on household income and expenditures plus socioeconomic and demographic characteristics from a national sample of 3,373 rural and urban households selected from 274 communities, using a probability‐proportional‐to‐size (PPS) sampling plan. Together with the NLSS community‐level survey, which collected information about characteristics of the communities in which these households resided, we have a rich set of variables that explain household expenditures. From the 3,373‐houshold NLSS data, we estimate a model predicting expenditures using covariates common to both the NLSS and the census.14 This estimated model is used to predict consumption expenditures for the half million census households. These predicted expenditures are used to construct our inequality and poverty measures.         "
"34","The Gini index for each village is computed using a variant of Deaton (2000, 139).15Esteban and Ray's (1999) concept of polarization is designed to measure rivalry among homogeneous groups (the Gini is a special case of their polarization index, where the group size is one). Three characteristics must be reflected in the polarization measure in the Nepal context: (1) in each village, the measure must partition the distribution of consumption spending into more than one group cluster, and preferably not too many; (2) there must be a high degree of intra‐group homogeneity as measured by a large mass within each partition; and (3) there must be a high degree of inter‐group heterogeneity, as measured by significant distances between the partitions. Satisfying these conditions yields a measure that may not necessarily be correlated with the Gini since it seeks to measure potential hostility or antagonism among groups, and therefore captures a horizontal dimension of inequality different from the Gini. In our case, the Esteban‐Ray economic polarization measure maps the distribution of consumption spending by households in a village into a value for the village. The higher this value, the greater is the degree of polarization within the village. The polarization index for a village is:            "
"35","While the idea of horizontal inequality (HI) (Østby 2008; Stewart 2002) is captured in the Esteban‐Ray polarization measure (Murshed and Tadjoeddin 2009), it is possible that divisions based explicitly on religion, language, and caste partition society into those who are upwardly mobile and those who are not. Were Maoist killings driven by inequality across such partitions? To see whether this was so, we construct four HI measures. Three of these are based on the measure used by Cederman, Gleditsch, and Weidmann (2010):            "
"36","Villages are likely to share the characteristics of districts to which they belong—ethnic composition, political representation, culture, and socioeconomic backgrounds are likely to be common to villages within a district. In order to account for unobserved heterogeneity, we include district‐level fixed effects for the 75 districts.18"
"37","Since the dependent variable KILLINGS is measured as count data, an appropriate econometric specification is the Negative Binomial (NB) model. It is preferred over the Poisson model for overdispersed count data (Greene 2007), which characterizes our sample.19 The conditional mean function (the “link” function) of the NB model is log‐linear, that is, the conditional mean of KILLINGS, E (KILLINGS), is modeled as log‐linear in the regressors. The models we specify below are therefore specified in terms of this link function. It also makes clear how we admit fixed effects into the NB model, an issue that the methods literature has debated and only recently agreed on this solution.20"
"38","The baseline model of killings includes an inequality measure and district fixed effects:             "
"39","Next, since KILLINGS are likely to be higher in more populous villages, we include the log of population as a regressor. There are two reasons for this. Do and Iyer, for example, scale their measure of killings by population. Since we use the count data model, we do not need to scale KILLINGS, and by including (log of) population as a regressor we do not need to constrain its coefficient to one, as implied by the Do‐Iyer scaling.             "
"40","Ignoring other relevant variables causes omitted variables bias in the parameter estimates. From a policy perspective, we may also be ignoring important variables that may help alleviate the problem that inequality poses for violence. Fortunately, we have available village‐level variables from 2001 that minimize the omitted variables problem and also allow us to explore new hypotheses. These variables are average years of schooling (EDUCATION), average months of employment (EMPLOYMENT), percent farmers in the village (FARMER), whether primary language is Nepali (NEPALI), and whether the village is primarily rural (RURAL). Our extended fixed‐effects model includes all these variables in the vector Xvd: 	             "
"41","A major concern, not treated in the literature with the gravity it deserves, is the endogeneity of the focus variables, here inequality. Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti (2004) draw attention to the fact that most studies of conflict wrongly presume that the main variable of interest causes violent conflict without even testing for the variable's exogeneity. It is likely that shocks to the error term, for instance due to a sudden outbreak of violence in a region, are correlated with similar movements in the inequality variables GINI and POLARIZATION. If, for example, there is significant out‐migration of wealthy landlords or high‐income families in response to sudden outbursts of violence, then the two inequality measures are negatively correlated with the error term, and their coefficient estimates are biased downward.            "
"42","We instrument for the endogeneity of GINI and POLARIZATION (α= 1) using three village‐level instrumental variables (IV) from the 2001 census that we believe to be uncorrelated with shocks to the error term. These are percent of households operating agricultural land (%WithAGLAND), percent of households in which women own land (%WithFEMALELAND), and the average number of big head livestock owned by women (BIGLIVESTOCK). To qualify as justifiably excluded instruments, these variables must not be themselves capable of logically explaining variation in KILLINGS. From the 1995–96 and 2003–04 Nepal Living Standard Surveys, Macours (2006) finds that land ownership was stable between those two years in Nepal, and hence household land access is largely exogenous. From the 2001 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, Allendorf (2007) finds that women's land rights empowered women and benefitted young children's health. Thus, women who owned land were likely to be empowered to have the final say in household decisions. If these instruments belonged directly in the regression, Allendorf's findings should imply that %WithFEMALELAND and BIGLIVESTOCK negatively associate with Maoist killings—villages in which women were deprived of land and assets would be ripe for revolt.21 We find the opposite to be the case.            "
"43","Whether households operate land, and in which households women own land and livestock, are determined by traditions and cultures specific to villages: Macours (2006) finds land markets in Nepal to be thin, and changes in land ownership to be determined by inheritance or intrafamily transfers. We do not have any reason to think that these long‐held customs should be affected, systematically or otherwise, by shocks to KILLINGS. They are thus exogenous. More importantly, we believe these village‐specific institutions play an important role in explaining the variation in inequality. Formal tests of overidentification restrictions demonstrating our instruments are justifiably excluded are carried out in the empirical section.            "
"44","A second requirement of instruments is that they not be weak, that is, strongly correlated with the inequality variables. Specifically, if the instruments are correlated with other independent variables—for example, RURAL or district fixed effects—then they may be incapable of explaining variation in the inequality and poverty conditional on those regressors, proving to be weak instruments. We report weak instrument diagnostics to indicate when the instruments are weak and when they are not."
"45","Finally, we emulate Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti's identification strategy by using regional rainfall data to construct a second set of instruments. Our rainfall data are five years apart for the years 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995.22 We use them to compute rainfall variance in each region as a measure of rainfall shocks, which are clearly exogenous to killings. These rare data are, however, unavailable at the village level, since they are recorded (incompletely) at 281 rainfall stations scattered across Nepal. We are able to map them into the 75 districts. Thus, rainfall variance may only be used in models without fixed effects. We report these results as well. They demonstrate the robustness of our village‐level IV results.            "
"46","Descriptive statistics for all variables used are reported in Table 1. Over the 1996–2003 period, an average of 0.682 persons per village were killed by Maoists. The Maoists' main targets were the police and army, the most striking example being the February 2002 killing of over 125, including 76 police officers and 48 soldiers (the then Royal Nepal Army owed loyalty to King Gyanendra), in the town of Mangalsen in the mountainous Achham district in Western Nepal (Popham 2002). The consumption Gini ranges between 0.03 and 0.40, with a sample mean of 0.238. Widespread poverty in the villages (44.7% are below the poverty line) keeps the Gini from worsening. The population is largely uneducated, with 3.608 years of schooling on average per resident. About 34.3% are farmers, and 50.5% speak Nepali as their primary language. Most villages in the sample are rural. Of note are the within‐district standard deviations reported in the last column. A comparison with the corresponding sample standard deviations indicates there is considerable within‐variation in the data, so that district fixed effects do not wipe out most, or even much, of the variation. Rainfall variance and inverse variance are measured only at the district level. When we use them with our village data, we drop the fixed effects.         "
"47","We begin in Table 2 with OLS results from a log‐linear model that includes district fixed effects. The dependent variable is ln(KILLINGSvd +1) so we can take logs where KILLINGS = 0. The conditional mean in the IVNB models—which we adopt—is log‐linear in the regressor, and the results are interpreted similarly. While the purpose of Table 2 is to find a model that best fits the data, the OLS results are themselves of interest if it is believed that GINI and POLARIZATION are exogenous. For example, an initial distribution of wealth determined exogenously far back in history may be principally responsible for current inequality outcomes. While empirically impossible to prove, theoretical support for the idea that initial conditions perpetuate inequality was noted in dynastic models of intergenerational utility.            "
"48","The left part of Table 2 experiments with a sparse specification that includes only the fixed effects plus poverty (as our hypotheses demand), and another that includes log population, so that we may explore the idea of Maoist expansion of their franchise. The fixed effects capture only 15% to 23% of the total variation in ln (KILLINGS), indicating the considerable within‐district variation in the data. The OLS estimate of 1.947 on GINI indicates that an increase of 0.04 in GINI (one standard deviation change) causes a 7.7% increase in expected Maoist killings, or a total of 202 additional deaths over the eight‐year period. The estimate of 3.599 on POLARIZATION (α= 1) indicates that a 0.01 increase (one s.d. change) increases expected Maoist killings by 3.6% or 95 deaths over the eight‐year period. While statistically significant, these numbers are neither large nor slight. The negative binomial model with fixed effects (NB‐FE) is better suited for explaining the count data.23 The coefficient on GINI is not statistically significant in the NB‐FE model, while the coefficient on POLARIZATION (α= 1) is larger than in the OLS model. The estimate of 11.17 indicates that a 0.01 increase in POLARIZATION (α= 1) escalates expected Maoist killings by 11.2% or 295 over the period.            "
"49","Despite the attention paid to poverty in the literature, including in the well‐known greed and grievance debate (Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Fearon and Laitin 2003; Murshed and Tadjoeddin 2009), we find that poverty did not drive Maoist killings in Nepal. Our findings accord with Hypotheses 1 and 2, affirming inequality, not poverty, drives violence. Further, horizontal or intergroup inequality (POLARIZATION) is a more compelling force than vertical or individual inequality (GINI). We reiterate the reason for this, embedded in the second component of our theory: collective action becomes a less demanding problem if a polarized underclass closely identifies with many others through a preexisting bond. This is what POLARIZATION measures. The extended models on the right include, in addition, EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, FARMER, ETHNICITY, and RURAL. They affirm the above findings: greater horizontal inequality is associated with more killings, while poverty matters not at all. The new variables contribute significant explanatory power to the model and do not confound inference about our focus inequality and poverty variables. All subsequent models are therefore based on the extended models, since the data favor their inclusion by any model selection criteria.            "
"50","Considering inequality to be exogenous, simply because it was determined in the past, would greatly understate its impact. Just because there were no killings does not imply there was no animus. Animosity and inequality coexisted through history, and the latent variable, animus, was always jointly determined with inequality. Since killings were realizations of that latent variable (once collective action was resolved), killings are correctly modeled as endogenous. Instrumental variables are therefore needed to disentangle the effect inequality had on killings."
"51","With the available data, we claimed that the village‐level instruments %WithAGLAND, %WithFEMALELAND, and BIGLIVESTOCK are justifiably excluded. Two diagnostics back this argument. Hansen's chi‐squared statistics from the log‐linear IV models in Table 3 fail to reject the null of no correlation between the instruments and the error term. It should be noted that this test itself relies on the validity of at least some of the instruments. In an auxiliary regression that includes the three instruments in the extended NB model, %WithFEMALELAND is estimated with the wrong sign (positive), and BIGLIVESTOCK with a statistically insignificant coefficient. %WithAGLAND is also estimated with a puzzling negative sign since operators (as different from owners) of land were basically bonded laborers.24 Clearly, more than one of these instruments is valid, and the Hansen statistics consequential.            "
"52","Kleibergen and Paap's (2006) weak‐identification statistic is a generalization of the first‐stage F‐statistic for the joint test that the three instruments all have coefficients equal to zero (see Appendix Table A1). Staiger and Stock's (1997) thumb‐rule, that F > 10 overcomes the weak‐instrument problem, is satisfied when instrumenting GINI and POLARIZATION (α= 1). Using Stock and Yogo's (2005) small‐sample diagnostics, we can make more precise statements. With our sample size, if Kleibergen‐Paap F > 14, the bias in the IV estimates is less than 5% of the bias in the uninstrumented OLS estimates. The large Fs in Table 3 therefore instill confidence in making causal statements about the impact of these measures on Maoist killings. The bias in the other horizontal inequality (HI) measures is larger with the village‐level instruments, but smaller with the district‐level rainfall instruments.            "
"53","The IVNB estimates on the inequality variables in Table 3 are much larger, indicating that the log‐linear models vastly understated their impact on Maoist killings. The estimate of 35.29 on GINI indicates that an increase of 0.04 in GINI (a one within‐s.d. change) is associated with a 141.2% increase in expected Maoist killings, or a total of 3,713 additional deaths over the eight‐year period. The estimate of 123.6 on POLARIZATION (α= 1) indicates that a 0.01 increase in that measure escalates expected Maoist killings by 123.6% or 3,251 deaths over the eight‐year period. Our results solidly assert the validity of Hypothesis 1 about the dire consequence of inequality on violence. With district‐level rainfall instruments (without FE), the numbers are alarming. An increase of 0.01 in POLARIZATION (α= 1) increases expected Maoist killings by 209.5% or 5,497 deaths during the period.            "
"54","POVERTY is associated with more killings in the IVNB model with GINI—a one within‐s.d. increase in POVERTY is associated with 736 additional expected Maoist killings. However, in models with POLARIZATION (α= 1), POVERTY is not statistically significant. Vertical inequality leaves some variation to be explained by poverty, but horizontal inequality swamps the impact of poverty.25 Hypothesis 2, that overwhelmingly poor villages hit a destitution constraint and are incapable of collective violence, thus continues to be supported by the IV results. While this may be taken to imply that organized Maoists did not care to feed the poor by stealing from the rich, we think the data indicate greater ambition.            "
"55","In all models with POLARIZATION (α= 1), the coefficient on ln(POPULATION) is positive.26 It supports the idea that Maoist killings were strategically directed at expanding their membership, which would serve them well later at the polls. In that sense, the Maoist movement in Nepal is distinct from grassroots rebellion in other countries. The fight for control over quasi‐institutions and the possibility of doing it at the polls led to such a calculus (also observed by Reynal‐Querol 2002). Kalyvas (2006) has rejected the hypothesis that violence is most intense in the most militarily contested areas. We agree. The finding about ln(POPULATION) implies violence is most intense in the most politically contestable areas. The Maoists desired to become a competing political party, not a fringe movement of marauders who redistribute by looting locally. The possibility of political control, in turn made possible by the presence of quasi‐democratic institutions, made the Maoist movement potent. At its height, the Maoist movement ran a parallel government in the villages, replacing dysfunctional government institutions. Styled to achieve what Mao did in 1930s China, the insurgency in Nepal is similar to Central American insurgencies and distinct from anti‐elite movements in Africa. It is a contest for control over institutions and political power, not simply wealth.            "
"56","The ETHNICITY variable (used effectively by Reynal‐Querol in a cross‐country study of conflict) captures ethnic polarization in Nepalese society. Nepali is the language spoken by the traditional ruling class, the Ranas and Shahas. Non‐Nepali‐speaking minorities perceive Nepali to be a basis for discrimination and domination over their ethnic identity (Bhattachan and Pyakuryal 1996). The strong positive coefficients on ethnicity show that identity based on ethnicity may have been the glue that solved the collective action problem in Nepal's villages. Our finding about ethnicity stands in contrast with Fearon and Laitin (2003) and Do and Iyer (2010), neither of whom finds significance for it. This source of polarization is not just relevant, but long‐lived, and takes political will even in economically advanced countries to stamp out.            "
"57","In Table 4, we explore IVNB models with horizontal inequality measures that are distinct from POLARIZATION (α= 1). Inherent in these measures are two Esteban‐Ray‐like mechanisms. Shared language, religion, or caste bonds groups of people and partitions society based on those bonds. They coexist so long as they are not polarized. But economic inequality drives some partitions further from each other until society forms into polarized groups, charged with animus. Uniting for anarchy and violence then becomes more probable.            "
"58","With both sets of instruments, the HI measures are all positive, and statistically significant, with one exception.27 The coefficient of 11.65 on HINEQUALITY (R), measuring inequality between Hindus versus others, implies that an increase of 0.17 (one within‐s.d.) in this variable would increase expected Maoist killings by 198% or 5,208 over the eight‐year period. Other inequality measures show large magnitudes as well: with one within‐s.d. increases in the caste‐based measures HINEQUALITY (C1) and HINEQUALITY (C2), expected Maoist killings increase by 191% and 76.3%, respectively. The former depicts stark two‐group polarization, whereas the latter is a more diffuse multigroup measure of polarization. Notably, the district‐level rainfall instruments produce quantitatively similar results.28"
"59","The theory is designed to demonstrate the inequality‐violence relationship and is unable to offer finer hypotheses about what variables might dampen the impact of inequality (beyond those that exacerbate collective action). Choice of policies to mitigate conflict makes such variables important. In the remainder of this section, we offer exploratory hypotheses for further theoretical development. The primary policy finding thus far is that polarization and other forms of inequality should directly be mitigated. However, inequality takes time to be permanently reduced, if at all. Might employment and education blunt inequality's destructive edge?"
"60","Table 5 indicates greater education softens the violent impact of inequality on Maoist killings. In the model with GINI, every additional year of education (per village resident) reduces ∂ln E (KILLINGS)/∂GINI by 2.145. With 10 additional years of education, the impact of (vertical) inequality can be greatly controlled.1 It is entirely possible that raising the level of education such that all children pass high school can eliminate the impact of GINI on Maoist killings. That is in fact what the model with POLARIZATION (α= 1) indicates. Twelve total years of education would reduce ∂ln E (KILLINGS)/∂ POLARIZATION (α= 1) to zero, even at current levels of polarization! Since the interactions provide concrete answers to counterfactuals (e.g., what if education were increased?), the policy lessons from Table 5 are impossible to ignore.            "
"61","Quite surprisingly, employment is not a mitigating factor. The quality of employment leaves much to be desired. Months of employment at low‐quality jobs means fewer opportunities to move out of the villages than education provides. Finally, the poverty associated with being a farmer is manifested in interactions of FARMER with inequality—the combination of FARMER and inequality always exacerbates killings. Farmers are obviously caught in a mobility trap, and the Maoist movement is evidence of their belief that their only way out is through forcible redistribution. Perhaps educating the rural population can simultaneously afford better urban jobs in Nepal or across the border, and also relieve overcrowding on rural lands. It is a political and economic agenda worth pursuing."
"62","In seeking a definitive answer to the relationship between inequality and violent conflict, we empirically investigate killings by Maoists guerillas in Nepal during 1996–2003. The empirical examination is conducted within the confines of a single country because it does not suffer, as cross‐country studies do, from the problem of vast and uncontrollable heterogeneity across countries. To a large extent, the within‐country setting keeps the heterogeneity problem under control. We extend the measurement of inequality beyond the traditional individual‐based Gini index to a group‐based economic polarization measure due to Esteban and Ray (1994, 1999). We also construct intergroup horizontal inequality measures, with groups partitioned on the basis of religion, caste, and language. Since the inequality‐conflict association likely suffers from reverse causality and other sources of endogeneity bias, we choose two sets of carefully selected instrumental variables to address the endogeneity problem, demonstrating a causal relationship. Our empirics solve a number of problems in the conflict literature enumerated in Kalyvas (2008), namely observational equivalence of variables such as poverty, the endogeneity problem, and omitted variables which are controlled using a number of observed variables plus district fixed effects.         "
"63","A theory that lays bare the mechanics of the inequality‐violence relationship guides the empirics. It stresses long‐lived inequality as a fundamental cause of polarization, which is a latent force seeking forcible redistribution. The glue for such redistributive collective action is a bond among the economically repressed, such as a shared religion, caste, or language. The collective action problem is solved when weakness is publicly exposed in the opposition (e.g., their inability to suppress revolt)."
"64","From a cross‐section of 3,857 Nepalese villages, we find strong evidence that economic inequality, measured by the Gini or Esteban‐Ray polarization, or the identity‐based HI measures, is strongly positively related to Maoist killings over the 1996–2003 period. This result is robust across a variety of models, all of which include district fixed effects to further control for possible heterogeneity across groups of villages in each district; a number of village‐level control variables (which have themselves been the focus of interest in other studies), such as education, ethnicity, and employment; and different modeling specifications. We also find, contrary to previous studies of conflict, that poverty did not necessarily influence Maoist killings. One reason may be that widespread poverty imposed a destitution constraint on a village and disabled the means to rebel. Another reason may be that poverty without inequality implies a village is uniformly poor, and there is little to gain through local redistributive activity."
"65","Inequality as a central and resilient source of conflict in Nepal, and its solution, deserves the full attention of policy makers. Our other findings have implications for policy and for future studies about what might temper the negative effect of inequality on violence. We find that education softened the impact of inequality on Maoist killings, but villages with more farmers—a proxy measure for poorly paid labor—exacerbated the impact of inequality on killings. Like other measures of horizontal inequality, ethnicity was a strong basis for violence. The Nepali language, spoken by half the Nepali people, is associated with elites dating back to Nepal's rulers from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It therefore serves to ethnically partition society. We find that villages where a greater proportion speaks Nepali as the primary language experienced greater killings."
"66","An implication of our results for future studies in the conflict area is that horizontal inequality measures like Esteban‐Ray polarization perform better than the traditional Gini in explaining violence. The polarization measures also claim to better measure noneconomic sources of conflict, and this would be a fitting context in which to test that claim."
"67","The experience of countries that have prevented their inequality from degenerating into violence may provide a partial policy answer. India, for example, has been witness to violent conflict between the government and Maoist organizations, but as of now they are local, not national incidents. A hypothesis is that redistribution by the federal government from wealthier states to poorer ones has been effective in preventing inequality from worsening beyond the limit at which collective action for violence might occur. Further research into whether this model might work for Nepal should be rewarding for several reasons. If this hypothesis is valid, it is not only consistent with our findings but also would exemplify the kind of center‐state institutions that Nepal needs in its democratic transition. It would also indicate to emerging countries that have not seen violence on this scale how to forestall widening inequality and deepening polarization in their societies, which might threaten their growing prosperity."
"68","Finally, our findings provide foundational support for the theoretical view espoused in Boix (2003) and Acemoglu and Robinson (2005) that inequality is the fundamental source of distributive pressures in a society. The Downsian model is a cornerstone of their theories—in a country with great income inequality, since the median voter strongly favors redistribution from the rich to the poor, the platform of any elected government will be redistributive. Acemoglu and Robinson recognize, in addition, that serious commitment problems on the part of both the elite and the poor prevent polarized countries from agreeing upon the future course of redistribution since the elite always want less redistribution while the poor always want more. Highly unequal countries thus vacillate between democracy and nondemocracy. A prerequisite to progressing to a liberal democracy is the moderation of that inequality. Our study empirically affirms this central link between inequality and the deterioration of a political regime and demonstrates violent revolution from below is a means to achieving that redistributive end.
