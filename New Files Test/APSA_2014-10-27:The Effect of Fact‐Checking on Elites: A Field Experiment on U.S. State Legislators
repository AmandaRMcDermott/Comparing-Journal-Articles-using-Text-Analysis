"1","While major news organizations in the United States have long sought to ensure the accuracy of the facts that they report (e.g., quoting public figures correctly), they frequently refrain from questioning the accuracy of contested claims made by public figures even when the statements are verifiable. The origins of this practice are contested. The practice has been attributed to the journalistic norm of objectivity, pressures to avoid bias accusations, and the political media's focus on horse race coverage (e.g., Cunningham 2003; Jamieson and Waldman 2002). The infrequency of fact‐checking in the contemporary era may also be linked to financial pressures (including cutbacks in media staffing and resources) and demands for more rapid production of content (e.g., Bantz, McCorkle, and Baade 1980; Fallows 1997; Jamieson and Waldman 2002; Plasser 2005). Politicians appear to exploit the media's reluctance to adjudicate competing factual claims, which enables them to publicize questionable claims with little risk of being contradicted (e.g., Fritz, Keefer, and Nyhan 2004).         "
"2","The fact‐checking movement takes a very different approach in focusing exclusively on evaluating the accuracy of claims made by politicians and political elites. Fact‐checking by the three elite fact‐checkers (i.e., PolitiFact and its state affiliates, Factcheck.org, and the Washington Post Fact Checker) and other media organizations has come to play an increasingly important role in political coverage in the United States (Amazeen 2013; Graves and Glaisyer 2012) and is now beginning to expand abroad (Adair 2013; Alcorn 2013). This movement represents a potentially radical change in how journalism is practiced, with significant consequences for political accountability and democratic discourse. Rather than limiting themselves to the “he said, she said” coverage and horse race analysis that dominate traditional political news, the fact‐checkers devote their energies and resources to scrutinizing what politicians say and rendering public judgments about the correctness of their claims.         "
"3","What effect does fact‐checking have on politicians? This question has not been examined systematically, but previous research suggests that legislators may be sensitive to media scrutiny of the sort that fact‐checkers provide. The literature on legislative behavior shows that elected officials are concerned about reelection and engage in risk‐averse behavior to minimize potential electoral or reputational threats (Fenno 2002; Mayhew 1974). State legislators have been described as wary of career risks in domains ranging from running for higher office (Berkman and Eisenstein 1999) to redistricting (Schaffner, Wagner, and Winburn 2004).         "
"4","One potential threat that elected officials may be especially concerned about is critical media coverage. While state legislators receive relatively little coverage (e.g., Kaplan, Goldstein, and Hale 2003; Lynch 2000), many members of Congress receive quite modest levels of coverage as well. Nonetheless, the variation in media scrutiny that has been observed (e.g., Arnold 2004; Fogarty 2008; Schaffner 2006), including at the state level (Campante and Do 2014; Carpini, Keeter, and Kennamer 1994), seems to be consequential. It has been shown that coverage of legislators at both the state and federal level can have significant consequences for citizen political knowledge (Carpini, Keeter, and Kennamer 1994), the incumbency advantage in elections (Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson 2011; Prior 2006; Schulhofer‐Wohl and Garrido 2013), legislator behavior in office (Hogan n.d.; Snyder and Strömberg 2010), and state‐level corruption (Campante and Do 2014). We argue that the threat of fact‐checking has the potential to create career risks for politicians by generating negative coverage that could damage their reputation and credibility and thereby harm their prospects for reelection, entering party leadership, or seeking higher office.2 Anecdotal evidence suggests that some candidates and political operatives seek to avoid the negative ratings given out by fact‐checkers or alter claims that come under fire, though others disavow such concerns (Gottfried et al. 2013; Graves 2013).3"
"5","Observational analyses of the effects of fact‐checking on politician behavior could easily lead to incorrect conclusions. For instance, fact‐checks may be more widely used in states that already had stronger accuracy norms in public discourse, a confound that might falsely suggest that fact‐checking reduced inaccuracy in those states. Alternatively, fact‐checking may spread in areas where accuracy norms are particularly weak, which could falsely make fact‐checks seem ineffective if legislators in those areas frequently make questionable statements despite receiving negative ratings. In either case, we cannot determine which legislators are not making false statements because of the presence of fact‐checkers using observational data alone.         "
"6","To overcome these inferential difficulties, we conducted a field experiment in fall 2012 in nine U.S. states in which PolitiFact affiliates were operating (Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin), excluding only the two states where the authors were based at the time of the study (Georgia and New Hampshire) due to concerns about treatment effect heterogeneity. (See the supporting information [SI] for the distribution of legislators across states.) Because we could not randomize the activities of fact‐checking organizations, we instead employed randomized correspondence, which has frequently been used in previous field experimental studies of elite political behavior (Bergan 2009; Broockman 2013; Butler and Broockman 2011; Butler, Karpowitz, and Pope 2012; Butler and Nickerson 2011; Loewen and MacKenzie n.d.; Loewen and Rubenson 2011; McClendon n.d.). In this case, we randomized whether legislators were sent a series of letters about the reputational or electoral consequences of receiving a negative rating from a fact‐checking organization.         "
"7","We chose to conduct our study with state legislators for several reasons. First, we could assemble a very large sample—far larger than would be possible in the U.S. Congress. Second, theory suggests that state legislators should be more sensitive to an individual fact‐check than a member of Congress because they are covered by the media less frequently, which means that a single bad story or negative rating will be a larger proportion of their total coverage. State legislators also have more limited financial resources and thus cannot rely on televised advertising or direct mail to the same extent as members of Congress. By targeting a lower‐level politician in this way, we increase the effect of our treatment. Finally, it was more feasible to reach state legislators through correspondence than members of Congress, who typically have much larger offices and more professional staff and interns. In a congressional office, for instance, it would be rare for a legislator to directly open and read incoming mail, which is primarily handled by staff whose primary responsibility is constituent correspondence. Our mailings would therefore be less likely to have a direct effect on congressional behavior. However, state legislators often have few or no professional staff, substantially increasing the likelihood that they would encounter and read our mailings."
"8","While the scope of our study is constrained by the availability of PolitiFact affiliates,4 we believe our results have substantial external validity. The states in our sample offer substantial political, institutional, and regional diversity. Though they are not necessarily representative of the country as a whole, the nine states in question include presidential battleground states as well as solidly Republican and Democratic states, vary significantly in their levels of legislative professionalism (Squire 2007), and include one or more states from each of the four Census regions. We therefore have no a priori theoretical reason to expect that our results would vary if PolitiFact affiliates were operating in a different set of states.         "
"9","Our experiment randomized whether state legislators were sent a series of letters about the reputational or electoral consequences of fact‐checking. A total of 1,169 legislators from the nine states in our sample5 were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a treatment condition in which legislators were sent letters reminding them of the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements, a placebo (Hawthorne) condition in which legislators were sent letters stating that we were monitoring campaign accuracy, and a control condition. While legislators of course vary in the likelihood that they will make misleading or inaccurate statements or be the target of fact‐checking, this randomization procedure (which is described further below) ensures that these individual‐level differences are independent of treatment assignment, which allows us to obtain an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect.            "
"10","Specifically, legislators in the treatment and placebo (Hawthorne) conditions were sent three separate mailings (mail dates: August 23, September 18, and October 12, 2012), whereas those in the control condition were not contacted. Because the state legislatures in question were out of session during our study, we sent a copy of each mailing to legislators' capitol and district addresses (see the SI for details). By conducting the study when all of the states were out of legislative session, we minimized the possibility of treatment spillovers. When legislators are not interacting closely on a daily basis, there are fewer opportunities for information about the treatments to spread from treated to untreated legislators. Second, we avoid possible treatment effect heterogeneity from treating legislators when some are in session but not others.6 Finally, we conducted the study during election season — a time when legislators may be particularly sensitive to threats to their reputation.            "
"11","In the treatment condition, legislators were sent a series of letters that emphasized the risks of having misleading or inaccurate statements exposed by fact‐checkers. The treatment mailing to legislators had several key elements: (1) a reminder of the presence of a PolitiFact affiliate in their state to establish the credibility of the threat of being fact‐checked, (2) a description of the potential electoral and reputational consequences of negative fact‐check ratings, and (3) two sample PolitiFact “pants on fire” fact‐checks (balanced by party) to heighten legislators' concerns about being fact‐checked from one of the states excluded from our study. (See the SI for the full text of a sample letter.)"
"12","In addition to our treatment letter, we designed a placebo letter that alerted legislators that we were conducting a study of the accuracy of statements made by politicians, but we excluded any language about fact‐checking or the consequences of inaccurate statements. We included this additional condition to account for what is known as a Hawthorne effect—the tendency for experimental participants to behave differently when they know they are being studied, which can confound treatment effect estimates (Levitt and List 2011). By including a placebo condition, we can determine whether legislators responded to the specific content of the treatment letter or the fact that they were being studied. (See the SI for the full text of a sample letter.)               "
"13","Legislators in the control condition were not sent mailings or contacted in any way."
"14","Using the R package blockTools (Moore n.d.), we block‐randomized assignment to ensure balance between conditions on state, political party, legislative chamber (state house/state senate), and whether or not a legislator had previously received a PolitiFact rating. We also used multivariate continuous blocking to maximize balance between conditions on two continuous covariates that could be related to being fact‐checked: previous vote share and fundraising (Moore 2012). In this way, we sought to minimize variance in factors other than our experimental conditions that would influence whether legislators would be fact‐checked during the study period, which increases the precision of experimental treatment effect estimates (Duflo, Glennerster, and Kremer 2007).            "
"15","This block randomization resulted in near‐perfect balance between conditions among the 1,169 legislators included in the study, as Table 1 and Figure 1 indicate.7 Importantly, this blocking also results in balance on observables that were not included in the blocking, such as being a party leader or a committee chair.8"
"16","Because it is impossible to know with certainty which legislators received the treatment, our experiment estimates the effect of being assigned to the treatment condition. As a partial indicator of which legislators read our mailings (and to further indicate the importance of the letter), we asked recipients of treatment and placebo letters to sign and return an enclosed postage‐paid acknowledgment postcard. However, those postcards cannot be used to estimate the actual effect of reading the treatment letter. First, many legislators may have read the letter but not bothered to return the postcard. In addition, the postcards themselves provide suggestive evidence that the content of the treatment letter had a significant effect—only 21% of legislators in the treatment group returned a signed postcard compared to 34% of those in the placebo condition, suggesting that it may have displeased its recipients (p < .01; see the SI). Alternatively, we could use successful delivery of the letter as an indicator of treatment receipt, but only 0.4% () of the letters we sent were returned as undeliverable, so the treatment effect estimates would be virtually identical. We therefore estimate the expected difference in outcomes resulting from assignment to the treatment condition (rather than receipt of treatment).9"
"17","In addition, we assume that outcomes are unaffected by the experimental conditions to which other legislators are assigned. A violation of this assumption would occur, for example, if a legislator who received our treatment letter showed the letter to a legislator in the control group and thereby affected the likelihood that she would make misleading or inaccurate statements. We believe this assumption is justified for two reasons. First, all of the state legislatures in our study were out of session during the study period, which should have dispersed legislators across their districts, substantially reducing the opportunity for treatment spillover. In addition, any spillover would likely bias our treatment effects toward zero, reducing the likelihood that we would find significant effects.10"
"18","Due to the complexities of language and politics, no perfectly objective measure of statement accuracy has yet been created. It was also infeasible to code every statement during the study period by all the state legislators in our data, especially since most are unobservable to researchers. As such, we examine three measures of public criticism by fact‐checkers or others who question the validity or accuracy of statements made by state legislators in our sample. Such factual criticism should be more likely as the frequency of misleading or inaccurate statements by state legislators in our sample increases."
"19","The study period in which these outcome measures were collected is defined as statements made between August 24 and November 6, 2012, which runs from the first day on which legislators could have received a letter (the day after the first mailing) to Election Day. The period before the election is the time in which the treatment should have been most salient to legislators due to the ongoing campaign, which should increase concern over potential electoral or reputational threats. It is also the period in which the effect of the treatment is most likely to be measurable due to the treatment group having recently received mailings (mail dates: August 23, September 18, and October 12) and fact‐checks being produced more frequently."
"20","The first dependent variable is whether a legislator received a negative rating from the PolitiFact affiliate in his or her state.11 PolitiFact uses a 6‐point scale to rate the accuracy of statements, ranging from “True” to “Pants on Fire.” Because our unit of analysis is the state legislator, we created a binary measure (Negative PolitiFact rating) of whether a state legislator was rated by PolitiFact as having made a misleading or inaccurate statement. This measure, which is based on PolitiFact's description of the meaning of their rating categories, takes a value of 1 if the state legislator received a rating of “half true” (“partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context”), “mostly false” (“contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression”), “false” (“not accurate”), or “pants on fire” (“not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim”) during the study period and 0 otherwise, which could include PolitiFact ratings of “true” or “mostly true” or, most commonly, whether the legislator had no statements publicly evaluated by PolitiFact (PolitiFact.com n.d.).         "
"21","One potential concern is whether PolitiFact truth ratings are consistent and accurate. The franchise training model used by PolitiFact for its state affiliates suggests that these ratings should be comparable across states (Myers 2010; Nyhan 2013a). While individual fact‐checks sometimes veer into punditry or semantic disputes (Marx 2010; Nyhan 2012, 2013b), an academic analysis of the ratings by elite fact‐checking organizations finds a very high level of agreement when they evaluate identical or similar claims (Amazeen 2012, 66–68).         "
"22","For our second dependent variable, a research assistant who was blind to the experimental randomization performed a search of LexisNexis Academic for media coverage in which the accuracy of specific claims made by a legislator was questioned. This Accuracy questioned measure is coded 1 if the research assistant found one or more articles or blog posts published during the study period in which specific factual claims made by the legislator was questioned by the author or other sources (including citations of past PolitiFact ratings) and 0 otherwise (intercoder reliability: 95% agreement, Krippendorff's alpha =.876; see the SI for further details on the search protocol, coding procedure, and types of articles found).         "
"23","The third dependent variable is a binary measure that combines the first two dependent variables. It is coded as 1 if the accuracy of a statement by the legislator was questioned by PolitiFact or in an article in LexisNexis and 0 otherwise."
"24","Even with a data set of nearly 1,200 state legislators across nine states, fact‐checks were relatively rare—only 26 state legislators in our data received ratings from PolitiFact state affiliates during the study period. Among these legislators, 18 received a rating of “half true” or worse. Even with such small numbers, however, an inspection of the marginal distributions suggests that assignment to treatment had a substantial effect, reducing the prevalence of negative ratings from 14 in the placebo and control conditions (1.8%) to 4 in the treatment condition (1.0%). Likewise, the number of legislators who had the accuracy of a claim questioned in media indexed in LexisNexis decreased from 8 in the placebo and control conditions (1.0%) to 1 in the treatment group (0.3%). There was no overlap in accuracy criticism between the measures. In all, 22 legislators in the placebo and control conditions had the accuracy of their claims questioned by PolitiFact or in LexisNexis (2.8%) compared with 5 in the treatment condition (1.3%; one‐sided Fisher's exact test p < .07)."
"25","To more formally evaluate our hypothesis, we estimated a series of weighted least squares regression models.12 We found no significant differences between the placebo and control conditions (see the SI), suggesting that the differences in behavior we observe in the treatment condition are due to the fact‐checking content in those mailings rather than a Hawthorne effect. To simplify exposition, we thus combine legislators in these conditions in the analyses below and estimate treatment effects relative to the control and placebo conditions. (All analyses are robust to estimating treatment effects relative to the placebo condition directly; see the SI for details.)         "
"26","In each model, we regressed our dependent variable on the treatment indicator using weighted least squares. Table 2 presents weighted means for the treatment and control groups as well as the results of these regression models, which estimate the average effect of being assigned to the treatment condition (the average treatment effect [ATE]) on our three dependent variables.         "
"27","Our results indicate that legislators who were sent our treatment letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative PolitiFact rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly in the study period (August 24–November 6, 2012). While the treatment effect falls short of significance for the negative PolitiFact rating, the effect is in the expected direction. For the Accuracy questioned variable, the treatment is statistically significant (p < .05, one‐sided). Finally, when we combine the two outcome measures into a broader indicator of whether the accuracy of the legislator's claims are questioned, the treatment effect is statistically significant (p < .05, one‐sided). These results are consistent in a series of robustness checks presented in the the SI (restricting the Negative PolitiFact rating measure to only take a value of 1 for “mostly false,” “false,” and “pants on fire” ratings; estimating treatment effects relative to the placebo condition; using logistic regression instead of weighted least squares; including block fixed effects; and using standard errors that are clustered by block).13"
"28","In addition to the estimated treatment effects and standard errors, Table 2 also provides two estimates of the changes in predicted probability. Because we used a least squares estimator on a binary outcome measure, the treatment effect can be directly interpreted as a difference in means. The coefficients thus tell us how much the treatment reduced the probability of a negative outcome relative to the combined placebo and control conditions. The estimated absolute risk reductions are relatively low (0.8–1.6%) due to the infrequency with which state legislators were rated by PolitiFact or had their statements questioned in media or online outlets — a base rate that almost certainly understates the proportion of politicians who make misleading or inaccurate claims.         "
"29","While the absolute decline in accuracy criticism may seem small, one way to assess the substantive magnitude of the treatment effect is to compare the observed effect with the maximum effect that we could observe relative to the placebo/control conditions. In this case, if our treatment were perfectly effective, it would reduce accuracy criticism from its current (untreated) levels down to zero. The last column of Table 2 shows our realized effect size as a proportion of this theoretical maximum. Judged by this standard, our treatments reduce accuracy criticism by 44–75% of the amount possible given their observed incidence among untreated legislators.14 Figure 2 highlights these substantively significant effects by contrasting the weighted means for our composite measure of reported inaccuracy between the treatment and placebo/control groups.         "
"30","Probability of Accuracy Criticism (PolitiFact/LexisNexis)"
"31","Effect of Reading Treatment Letter on Treated Legislators (PolitFact/Nexis)"
"32","To rule out the possibility that these effects were the result of the treatment suppressing public statements by legislators more generally, we estimated weighted least squares regression models of the probability of receiving any rating from PolitiFact, the total number of articles found for each legislator in Nexis excluding the accuracy‐related keywords used in Accuracy questioned, and the number of pages on each legislator's website when scraped approximately one week after the election (a proxy for the total volume of content provided). As Table 3 indicates, none of these results were statistically significant, suggesting that the treatment did not suppress speech, but changed it.15"
"33","Finally, it is important to reiterate that our experiment estimates the effect of assigning a legislator to the treatment condition. An important quantity of interest is the effect of actually receiving the treatment—that is, reading the letter. We cannot observe who has read the letter. However, we can compute how effect size changes as the proportion successfully treated (i.e., read the letter) also changes. As Figure 3 illustrates, the estimated effect of receiving the treatment increases as the assumed level of noncompliance increases. In other words, as fewer legislators actually read the letter, the effect is larger for those who did read it. Figure 3 provides three possible measures for the proportion successfully treated: (1) the rate at which recipients of the treatment condition signed and returned an enclosed postage‐paid acknowledgment postcard, (2) the rate at which recipients of the placebo condition signed and returned an enclosed postage‐paid acknowledgment postcard, and (3) the proportion of letters that were not returned as undeliverable.         "
"34","The magnitude of the average treatment effect on the treated is easily calculated under various assumptions about the ratio of legislators who were successfully treated (the treatment effect for all others is assumed to be zero). For instance, if 50% of legislators in the treatment group did not read the letter, the treatment effect on the combined measure for those who did read the letter is twice as large as the effect of assignment to treatment. Similarly, the effect is four times as large if 75% did not read the letter."
"35","Does external monitoring reduce inaccuracy in statements made by political elites? In the first field experiment of its kind, we find that the randomized provision of a series of letters highlighting the electoral and reputational risks of having questionable statements exposed by fact‐checkers significantly reduced the likelihood that legislators in nine U.S. states would receive a negative fact‐checking rating or have the accuracy of their claims questioned publicly. We found no evidence that these results were driven by legislators speaking less frequently or receiving less coverage, suggesting instead that they were less likely to make inaccurate statements rather than being silenced more generally."
"36","Moreover, these results, while encouraging, may understate the magnitude of the potential effects of fact‐checking on the behavior of politicians or other elites. Our experiment estimates the effect of being assigned to receive the treatment letter. It is unlikely that every state legislator to whom we sent the treatment letter received it and read it carefully. If the negative consequences of inaccurate statements were salient and accessible to all elites, the potential effects on their behavior would likely be even larger. In addition, the magnitude of the treatment effects is scaled relative to the low base rate of fact‐checking or articles questioning a legislator's accuracy, which is likely to capture only a tiny fraction of the deceptive or inaccurate statements that politicians make. If the frequency of inaccurate statements is much higher in practice, our estimates suggest that the potential effect of fact‐checking threat is sizable.         "
"37","The scope of these results should be noted, however. First, because our study is limited to states with PolitiFact affiliates, the treatment effect we estimate is the result of a salient accountability threat in states in which an affiliate is already operating, not the direct effect of the creation of a PolitiFact affiliate itself (a different question and one that would require a different research design). Second, the study provides a direct reminder to legislators that is typically not delivered by fact‐checkers. However, to the extent that the treatment highlights a genuine reputational threat, our estimates should capture the effect that salient fact‐checking can have outside of an experimental context.16 Finally, as in any experimental study, our estimate is a partial equilibrium result (Acemoglu 2010); it is possible that politicians would be less sensitive to fact‐checking if it were more common. Our theory suggests, however, that they should become more cautious in their public statements when fact‐checking is more widespread. If legislators make fewer inaccurate or questionable statements as a result of this scrutiny, the general equilibrium result would therefore likely be a pattern of behavior that is consistent with our findings (even if accountability threat reminders might have less of an effect on the margin in those cases).         "
"38","Future research should further investigate the mechanisms by which fact‐checking changes elite behavior and the extent to which they are captured in our experimental design. For instance, fact‐checkers may alter elite behavior by increasing the perceived risks of making misleading claims and/or priming normative concerns about truthfulness. Our experimental design does not allow us to evaluate potential mediators, though our treatment letter could plausibly have both effects. Another possibility is that the effects of fact‐checking may vary due to state‐level or contextual factors such as whether the legislature is in session. With only nine states in our sample (all of which were out of session during our study), we cannot answer these questions, but they are worth considering as fact‐checking continues to expand. For example, future research could examine whether there are certain time periods during which politicians are especially sensitive to fact‐checking, such as campaigns."
"39","More generally, these results indicate that fact‐checking should not be discredited by the continued prevalence of misinformation and misperceptions. While fact‐checking may be ineffective at changing public opinion, its role as a monitor of elite behavior may justify the continued investment of philanthropic and journalistic resources. Indeed, given the very small numbers of legislators whose accuracy is currently being questioned by fact‐checkers or other sources, one could argue that fact‐checking should be expanded in the United States so that it can provide more extensive and consistent monitoring to politicians at all levels of government."
