"1","To investigate the sources of ethnic identification in Africa, we employ data collected in rounds 1, 1.5, and 2 of the Afrobarometer, a multicountry survey project that employs standardized questionnaires to probe citizens' attitudes in new African democracies.5 The surveys we employ were administered between 1999 and 2004. Nationally representative samples were drawn through a multistage stratified, clustered sampling procedure, with sample sizes sufficient to yield a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.6 Our data consist of 35,505 responses from 22 separate survey rounds conducted in 10 countries: Botswana, Malawi, Mali, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. To make possible the inclusion of country fixed effects, we limit our analysis to countries for which more than one survey round is available.7"
"2","The main dependent variable we employ comes from a standard question designed to gauge the salience for respondents of different group identifications. The question wording as follows:"
"3","                        "
"4","We have spoken to many [people in this country, country X] and they have all described themselves in different ways. Some people describe themselves in terms of their language, religion, race, and others describe themselves in economic terms, such as working class, middle class, or a farmer. Besides being [a citizen of X], which specific group do you feel you belong to first and foremost?"
"5","As noted, a major advantage of the way this question was constructed is that it allows multiple answers and thus permits us to isolate the factors that are associated with attachments to different dimensions of social identity. We group respondents' answers into five categories: ethnic, religion, class/occupation, gender, and “other.”8"
"6","Before turning to the findings, several methodological issues bear mention. First, as we have stressed, the salience of any social identification—be it ethnic or otherwise—is necessarily context specific, and the Afrobarometer data only permit us to ascertain the way respondents identified themselves in the specific context in which they were surveyed. Our task is to use what we know about that context to make inferences about the factors that determine when ethnic group memberships become most salient. The context specificity of respondents' answers is not something we ignore; it is central to our research design. Since our main focus is on the timing of the survey vis‐à‐vis the most proximate presidential election, we report coefficient estimates only on the election‐related variables. However, all of our analyses are robust to the inclusion of controls for other contextual factors, including the characteristics of the interview (whether people other than the respondent were present, whether the respondent consulted other people while answering, whether, in the interviewer's judgment, other people influenced the respondent's answers, and whether the respondent seemed engaged, at ease, suspicious, or threatening) and the characteristics of the enumerator (his or her age, gender, urban‐rural background, and education). The country fixed‐effect framework we adopt also automatically controls for many other aspects of context that are correlated with the country in which the survey is taking place—its history, its diversity, its colonial heritage, its level of economic development, etc.9"
"7","Second, quite apart from the issue of the reliability of responses across contexts, the use of self‐reported identities introduces the possibility of bias. Respondents in countries where the social norm is not to talk openly about ethnicity might be less likely to confess that their most important social affiliation is with their ethnic community, which would generate a downward bias in measured ethnic salience in that country. This may be particularly likely in a context where open confessions of ethnic solidarity are frowned upon by the regime and where survey enumerators are suspected of being affiliated with the government. While this concern cannot be ruled out, it is dampened by the way the Afrobarometer survey was conducted—confidentially and in private by enumerators who were not affiliated with the government or any political party."
"8","Also, the Afrobarometer survey is not primarily about ethnicity or social identity. The question we use to construct our measure of ethnic salience is just one out of more than 175 questions asked in the standard Afrobarometer questionnaire, only a handful of which make any mention of ethnicity or social identity. Respondents are thus likely to have treated the “with which group do you identify” question as a background query rather than as the central issue around which the survey revolved. Indeed, questions about ethnic background, religious group membership, and language use are standard background questions included in most surveys conducted in Africa. We therefore expect that respondents were probably less guarded in their responses about their ethnic identities than might otherwise have been the case. In addition, to the extent that social norms against confessing the strength of one's ethnic identification vary by country, the country fixed‐effect framework that we employ should control for these differences. Similarly, to the extent that a respondent's willingness to speak freely about his or her ethnic identity depends on the characteristics of the person who is asking the questions, the robustness of our findings to the inclusion of controls for the age, gender, urban/rural background, and education of the enumerator, as well as for the presence of other people at the survey location at the time of the survey, should minimize concerns about this possible source of bias."
"9","Two additional potential concerns stem from the way the survey question was structured. A first issue is that the question explicitly bars respondents from describing themselves in terms of nationality: it ask, “Besides being [your nationality (e.g., Namibian, Zambian, etc.)], which specific group do you feel you belong to first and foremost?” We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that respondents might consider national identity as more important to them than all of the identity categories recorded in our data.10 This said, to the extent that the patterns of ethnic identification we observe are due to unobserved variation in levels of national identification, these levels plausibly vary across countries more than within them over time and, as such, should be controlled for by our inclusion of country fixed effects.         "
"10","A related issue is that the survey question provides information about the salience of the reported group membership in relative, not absolute, terms. All we are able to infer from respondents' answers is the identity that they rank first from among those identity categories explicitly mentioned in the question (and, as noted, excluding national identity). We have no way of knowing how much absolute importance respondents attach to their first‐ranked (or second‐ or third‐) group memberships. Thus to conclude on the basis of our data that ethnicity is more salient in Country A than Country B because a larger share of survey respondents in Country A ranked ethnicity first is not quite right. It is conceivable, though we think unlikely, that ethnicity might be more salient in absolute terms to people in Country B, even though a larger share of them rank some other category of identity as even more important than ethnicity.11"
"11","Finally, legitimate questions can be raised about the generalizability of our findings. Although broadly representative of Africa as a whole, the 10 countries included in our study are not a substitute for a continent‐wide sample. Our sample includes just one Francophone country (Mali), no countries that have failed to introduce at least some democratic or market reforms over the last decade (a precondition for an Afrobarometer survey), and, with the exception of Uganda, no countries involved in civil wars at the time the survey data were collected. As Table 1 indicates, per capita income in the 10 countries is about 75% higher than the African average (though this is mainly driven by the southern African cases of Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa—the other seven countries are actually poorer than the Sub‐Saharan Africa average) and rates of under‐five child mortality in our sample are slightly lower than in Africa as a whole. Rates of urbanization are roughly comparable to the regional average. Presidential elections appear to be similarly (un)competitive in our 10 sample countries as in Africa as a whole (the average margin of victory in presidential contests is 32 and 34 percentage points, respectively), but citizens in our sample enjoy slightly more extensive political rights than in the average African country (note that on the Freedom House scale, which runs from 1 to 7, lower numbers indicate greater rights).         "
"12","Our findings therefore must be interpreted with the caveat that they may not be entirely representative of Africa as a whole. This said, the fact that Bossuroy (2008) reports similar results to ours in a parallel study using comprehensive survey data from a quite different set of African countries lends confidence to the generalizability of our findings.12"
"13"," Table 2 reports the frequency distribution of responses to the “which specific group do you feel you belong to first and foremost?” question for all 22 survey rounds in our sample. Contrary to the stereotype that Africans are unidimensionally ethnic in their self‐identifications, a minority of 31% of respondents identify themselves first and foremost in ethnic terms.13 Indeed, fewer respondents choose ethnic identities than class/occupation identities, which are chosen by 36% of respondents. In addition, responses vary tremendously across countries and, perhaps even more strikingly, within countries over time—a finding consistent with theories of ethnic identification that stress contextual variability. The variation we observe across countries confirms the necessity of adopting an estimation framework that controls for country‐specific factors. The variation within countries over time is, of course, central to our identification strategy: our main interest is in ascertaining whether (or what share of) that variation can be explained by the proximity and competitiveness of the nearest presidential election.         "
"14","Since the surveys are repeated cross‐sections rather than panels of individuals, we cannot reject completely the possibility that sampling variation is behind some of the changes that we observe within countries across survey rounds. However, since the Afrobarometer employs the same sampling methodology in all survey rounds, and given the large, nationally representative sample of individuals included in each survey, we can be fairly certain that sampling variation is not primarily behind these shifts. The robustness of our findings to dropping countries one at a time also allays fears that sampling variation in a single country might be driving our results."
"15","A crucial, and slightly different, question relates to the timing of the Afrobarometer surveys, which provides the source of variation in our key proximity variable. One concern is that surveys might have been deliberately scheduled close to exciting, hotly contested elections (perhaps because they represent moments when political attitudes are particularly interesting and worth surveying) but not close to less hotly contested elections. Fortunately, there is little evidence that the timing of surveys was in any way related to electoral cycles, in part because the enormous logistical task of selecting enumeration sites and setting up field teams requires that preparations be made many months or even years in advance. Moreover, this timing would not account for the strong interaction effects between election proximity and competitiveness that we document below."
"16","To the extent that survey timing was in any way endogenous to election timing, it was through what appears to have been a conscious decision by the Afrobarometer organizers after round 1 not to schedule surveys right near elections. While this would have been a uniform (and thus unproblematic) policy change, the worry is that such a change in the timing of surveys (away from elections) might have combined with a downward secular trend in the salience of ethnic identities. This could produce a spurious correlation between electoral proximity and ethnic identity salience. We deal with this possible confounding story, as well as the possibility that changes in survey implementation14 across survey rounds might have generated changes in reported levels of ethnic identification, by including fixed effects in our regressions for each survey round (1, 1.5, 2) as well as a linear time trend.15"
"17","What, then, accounts for the variation we observe in the tendency of survey respondents to identify in ethnic terms? To answer this question, we model each individual respondent i living in country c taking part in survey round t as attaching a salience Sict to his or her ethnic identity (recall that “salience” is operationalized as the likelihood that a respondent answers the “with which group do you identify first and foremost?” question in terms of his or her membership in a tribe or language group). Using this framework, we can examine empirically the extent to which a respondent's identity function Sict is systematically related to his or her observable characteristics and his or her country's political environment. Combining observable and unobservable heterogeneity, we express the salience of ethnic identity for individual i in country c during survey round t as            "
"18"," Table 3 presents the results of four regressions of ethnic identification on our main independent variables: proximityct, competitivenessct, and proximityct× competitivenessct. All four specifications include country fixed effects and weight each observation by 1/(number of observations from that country) in order to weight each country survey round equally.18 The first three columns are logit models with standard errors clustered at the country level to account for the hierarchical nature of the data.19 These three regressions also include the survey round controls and time trend discussed above. Clustering error terms at the country level should deal appropriately with the dependence of the key independent variables for individuals in the same country and the same survey round.20 Nonetheless, as a robustness check we revisit the analysis in the fourth column in an OLS regression with data aggregated to the country‐round level (N = 22; here the dependent variable is the share of respondents in the country survey round that identified in ethnic terms, as in Table 2). The fact that all three versions of our main specification (columns 2–4) generate almost identical results speaks to the robustness of the relationship between ethnic identification and the political factors we are investigating.         "
"19","The results reported in column 1 suggest that, on average, neither the proximity of the survey to a presidential election (in months, absolute value) nor the competitiveness of that election (the margin of victory, in percentage points) has any independent impact on the likelihood that a survey respondent will identify him‐ or herself in ethnic terms. Some caution must be taken, however, in interpreting the “electoral competitiveness” term given the relatively small degree of within‐country variation we observe in our data on this variable (see the “vote margin” column in Table 1). Indeed, in four of our 10 countries, the same election serves as the most proximate contest to the two country surveys we use, so there is no variation on this term. Since all of the explanatory leverage in our specification comes from within‐country comparisons, the coefficient estimates on the “competitiveness” variable are being produced by only a subset of our (already small) set of country cases. This problem is compounded by the fact that the within‐country variation we do observe is based on relatively small differences in the margin of victory between the winning presidential candidate and the runner‐up—differences that are likely a product as much of measurement error and/or electoral fraud as of true changes in the underlying competitiveness of the contests. Given these considerations, we do not put much weight on our rather imprecise estimates on the “competitiveness” variable.21"
"20","Rather, we focus on the interaction term between proximity and competitiveness, and it is the substantial cross‐country variation in electoral competitiveness that allows us to estimate this effect. When we add such an interaction term to our initial specification (column 2), we find that the coefficients on proximity and the interaction term are statistically significant. Taken together, the interpretation of the point estimates in column 2 is that the likelihood that a person will identify him‐ or herself in ethnic terms increases by 1.8 percentage points (s.e. 0.3 percentage points) for each month closer to an election the survey is administered, but that this effect falls as the competitiveness of the election decreases, dropping all the way to zero for landslide elections with a margin between the winner and runner‐up of roughly 40 percentage points. Thus a survey respondent asked within a month of a closely fought presidential election how she identifies herself would be nearly 22 percentage points (s.e. 3.6) more likely to respond in ethnic terms than if she were asked a year earlier or a year later. However, if the election was won in a landslide, her answer would be unaffected by the proximity of the election. Given that the baseline likelihood of ethnic identification in our sample is 31%, a 22 percentage point predicted change over the course of 12 months is a very large effect indeed.         "
"21","These results are confirmed in column 3, which adds a host of individual‐level controls for respondents' age, gender, occupation, education, media exposure, and urban or rural residence (coefficients not shown), and column 4, which replicates the analysis at the country level.22 The fact that the findings are highly statistically significant using the conservative country‐round level approach in column 4, with only 22 observations, indicates that the results in columns 1 through 3 are not simply an artifact of using large samples of individual‐level data. The findings are nearly identical across all three specifications; moreover, as noted, all results are robust to dropping countries one at a time.         "
"22","The main results are presented graphically in Figure 1, where the proximity to the closest country election is presented on the x‐axis (demeaned by country, which is equivalent to our country fixed‐effects regression specification) and the extent of ethnic identification is on the y‐axis (also demeaned by country). Two plots are presented: one pattern for relatively competitive elections (cases where the electoral margin is less than the sample median of 29.5 percentage points), and one for landslide elections (when the margin is greater than the median), although the results are nearly unchanged using a lower competitive election threshold of 10 percentage points (not shown). The relationships come through clearly: the plot is strongly negative for competitive elections (meaning that ethnic identification falls sharply when surveys are conducted farther away in time from competitive elections) but is nearly flat for landslide elections. All of this is consistent with a story whereby the salience of ethnic identities is correlated with the electoral cycle, but only in settings where elections constitute meaningful contests for political power.         "
"23","                 Ethnic Identification and Electoral Proximity, by Competitiveness of National Elections                      "
"24"," Notes: More competitive elections are defined as those where electoral margin is < 29.5%, the median in our sample.                     "
"25","Our main dependent variable (based on the “with which group do you feel you belong to first and foremost?” question) permitted multiple responses. This makes it a natural fit for a multinomial discrete choice empirical framework, which can be used to explore the social identities that individuals switch out of when, in proximity to competitive elections, they embrace their ethnic identities above others. To model this process, we modify slightly the framework we introduced earlier. Instead of attaching salience to their ethnic identity Sict, we now conceive of individuals as having multiple dimensions j ∈ J to their identities (where in practice the set J includes ethnic, religious, occupation/class‐based, and gender identities, as well as other less common identities) and attaching a salience Sjict to each identity dimension j. Thus respondents who attach high salience to their ethnic identity have large values of SEthnic,ict; those who attach low salience to their gender identity have small values of SGender,ict; and so on. When asked to report the group that they feel they belong to first and foremost, respondents choose the identity dimension j with the highest salience:            "
"26","Using this framework, we can examine the extent to which the identity functions Sjict are systematically related to Xict and Zct. We can thus express the strength of social identity category j for individual i in country c during survey round t as            "
"27","Two important aspects of this econometric specification bear mention. First, the multinomial logit model cannot estimate the level of the coefficients  directly because, as noted above, the choices we observe only contain information about relative preferences. We therefore cannot distinguish absolute effects on the level of the identity strengths Sjict, only the degree to which explanatory variables make a respondent more or less likely to say that identity j is the one that they feel they belong to first and foremost. The logit model identifies coefficients of the form  or effects on identity j relative to a reference identity k. These coefficients give rise to an equivalent set of marginal effects, or impacts of the independent variables on the probabilities of choosing each of the five primary identity categories.24 The marginal effects are the results we report in Table 4 below.         "
"28","Second, the probabilities that particular social identities are chosen are not independent of one another. As the probability rises that a particular social identity is chosen, the probability of others being chosen necessarily falls since only one identity can be indicated in the survey. In particular, the marginal effects must mechanically sum to zero, because probabilities must always add to one. As we have stressed, a major advantage of our multinomial approach is that, if the salience of one dimension of social identification increases in response to a particular explanatory variable, we can simultaneously estimate which identity dimensions are becoming less salient. That is, our method estimates substitution patterns among social identities in response to changes in the characteristics of individuals and in their political environment."
"29","In the top half of Table 4, we present our estimates for the impact of proximityct, competitivenessct, and proximityct× competitivenessct on the salience respondents attach to their ethnic, class/occupational, religious, gender, and other identities.25 The results in the first (ethnicity) column are nearly identical to those reported in Table 3: the salience of ethnicity increases by 2 percentage points for every month closer a respondent is to a presidential election, with the effect declining as the election becomes less competitive. Reading across the first row of Table 4 allows us to discover which identity dimensions lose salience as elections come closer. More than half of the increased salience of ethnicity comes from substitution away from class/occupation identities, though some of it appears to come from the gender and “other” categories. The interpretation of the estimated electoral proximity coefficient in the class/occupation column is that the likelihood that a respondent will identify him‐ or herself in class/occupational terms decreases by 1.2 percentage points for every month closer he or she is to a presidential election. Effects for gender identity are also statistically significant and go in the same direction (i.e., substituting for ethnic identity), but are less than a third as large.         "
"30","For reasons described earlier, while we do not read too much into the lower‐order coefficient estimates on the competitiveness variable, the interactive effect of competitiveness and electoral proximity is informative. The negative signs on the proximity × competitiveness coefficients in the second (class/occupation) and fourth (gender) columns of Table 4 suggest that the movement out of class/occupational (and, to a lesser extent, gender) identities is heightened when elections are not just proximate but also highly competitive—a finding consistent with the increased likelihood of ethnic identification as competitiveness increases.         "
"31","Thus far, we have focused on general trends among all survey respondents; our coefficient estimates can be interpreted as applying to the “average” person. However, both the theoretical literature on ethnicity and the coverage of Africa in the popular media generate strong expectations about the kinds of respondents that should be more (or less) likely to identify themselves in ethnic terms (and, to a lesser extent, in terms of their class/occupation, religion, and gender). We test four of these expectations in the bottom panel of Table 4.         "
"32","A first hypothesis derives from the classic literature on modernization. Early modernization theorists such as Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Parsons all viewed ethnic identities as “traditional” and predicted that modernization would lead to their displacement by class/occupational identifications. If these theorists were right, we would expect to find the strongest ethnic identification (and also the weakest class/occupational identification) among people located in the traditional sector of the economy, since they have been least exposed to modern currents and, to borrow a phrase from colonial‐era anthropology, have been the least “detribalized.” Later researchers like Young (1965, 1976), Melson and Wolpe (1970), and Bates (1983) argued, conversely, that the processes of urbanization, industrialization, education, political mobilization, and competition for jobs would deepen ethnic identities as individuals exploited their ethnic group memberships as tools for political, economic, and social advancement (we refer to these latter researchers as “second generation” modernization theorists). These second‐generation theorists would therefore expect us to find the strongest ethnic attachments among those in the modern sector, since it is there that competition for scarce resources is most intense, and thus there that the incentives for people to use their ethnic identities as tools to acquire those resources should be most strong.         "
"33","To test these competing expectations, we created an indicator variable for respondents who were farmers or fishermen (27% of our sample), which we use as a rough proxy for being located in the traditional sector of the economy. In keeping with the predictions of the second‐generation modernization theorists, we find a robust negative relationship between being a farmer/fisherman and identifying in ethnic terms. Farmers and fishermen are, on average, about 4 percentage points less likely than people in the modern sector to identify themselves first and foremost in terms of their language or tribe (column 1).26 They are also more than 10 percentage points more likely than people in the modern sector to identify in class/occupational terms (column 2) and roughly 3 percentage points less likely to identify in religious terms (column 3).         "
"34","We also investigate the impact of group size on ethnic identification. Arguments developed by Posner (2005) and others lead to the expectation that respondents will be more likely to identify themselves in ethnic terms to the extent that they belong to ethnic groups that are large enough to constitute viable political coalitions. Members of small ethnic groups should have incentives either to redefine themselves as members of broader ethnic coalitions or to embrace identities along other nonethnic cleavage dimensions, such as class/occupation or religion. An alternative perspective, however, would lead us to expect members of smaller ethnic groups to be more likely to identify in ethnic terms because fears of being dominated by members of other groups will heighten their ethnic identities (Horowitz 1985; Rabushka and Shepsle 1972). To test these expectations, we created an indicator variable for membership in an ethnic group that comprises 10% or more of the national population.27 As Table 4 indicates, we find no evidence that the size of the ethnic group to which a respondent belongs affects the likelihood of identification with ethnicity—or, for that matter, with any other category of social identity.         "
"35","We next investigate the impact of partisanship. Several scholars have identified a pattern in contemporary Africa whereby multiethnic ruling parties occupy the center of the political space, where they are surrounded by ethnically defined opposition parties seeking their overthrow (e.g., Cheeseman and Ford 2007; Scarritt 2006; van de Walle 2007). To the extent that this is an accurate portrayal of African politics, we might expect to find respondents who report supporting the ruling party to have lower levels of ethnic identification than those who report supporting opposition parties. As the results presented in Table 4 indicate, however, we find no support for this conjecture. Nor does support for the ruling party appear to be associated with a greater tendency toward any other type of social identification.         "
"36","Finally, media portrayals of African ethnic conflicts as being carried out by armies of unemployed young men might lead us to expect young men to have higher than average rates of ethnic identification.28 Popular perceptions notwithstanding, we find no evidence that young men are in fact any more likely to identify in ethnic terms than other respondents.         "
"37","Thus far we have focused on “main” effects: the tendency for farmers/fishermen, members of large ethnic groups, ruling party supporters, and young men to have higher (or lower) levels of ethnic identification in general. However, the literature also generates expectations about the kinds of respondents that are likely to be more (or less) susceptible to ethnic mobilization—that is, more (or less) likely to identify themselves in ethnic terms in proximity to competitive elections. Indeed, given the focus of this article, the issue of whether young men, opposition party supporters, or members of large ethnic groups are more likely to identify themselves in ethnic terms generally is less relevant than whether members of such categories are more easily mobilized along ethnic lines in the context of a heated election campaign. Although our estimation framework is ideally suited to addressing these questions, data limitations make it impossible for us to do so in a meaningful way. We are already constrained in our main analyses by the fact that we are exploiting variation over time within just 10 countries. Using triple interactions to test the joint impact of proximity and competitiveness on particular subpopulations—young men, ruling party supporters, etc.—makes our sample limitations even more binding and, unfortunately, renders it impossible to generate meaningful results. In analyses (not shown) we did run the triple interactions between proximity, competitiveness, and the indicator variables for each of these respondent categories, and none of these effects is statistically significant at traditional confidence levels. However, limited statistical precision means we are unable to rule out even quite substantial effects.         "
"38","The robust relationship we find between ethnic salience and exposure to political competition provides strong support for instrumental understandings of ethnicity. The fact that ethnic identities become systematically more important to people at the time that competitive elections are being held suggests that ethnicity plays a role in the struggle for political power. But exactly what role does ethnicity play? And for whom?"
"39","One prominent answer in the African politics literature emphasizes the role of political elites. By this account, politicians find it advantageous to “play the ethnic card” as a means of mobilizing supporters to acquire or retain political power (e.g., Bates 1983; Ferree 2006; Posner 2005; Young 1965, 1976).29 Since elections provide the principal occasion for political power to change hands, politicians' efforts at ethnic mobilization are especially likely to take place during the period immediately preceding elections. These efforts are also likely to be particularly vigorous when the elections are close and the advantage to be gained by mobilizing supporters will be greatest. Thus, to the extent that politicians' ethnic appeals make ethnicity more salient for voters, and to the extent that, once made salient, ethnic identities take some time to return to baseline levels, we would expect to find exactly the pattern that we do: stronger ethnic attachments during the periods preceding and following competitive national elections than at other times.         "
"40","An alternative explanation for the link between political competition and ethnic identification focuses not on elites but on regular citizens—specifically, on their beliefs that jobs, favors, and public goods will be channeled disproportionately to coethnics of the person who is in a position to allocate them (Barkan 1979; Posner 2005; Throup and Hornsby 1998; van de Walle 2007; Wantchekon 2003). Since elections are the moment when the people who will control the allocation of resources are chosen, they are also the occasion when people should be most mindful of their ethnic identities and of the match between their own identity and that of the candidates vying for power. The association we find between ethnic identification and the electoral cycle is, again, consistent with this story.         "
"41","Unfortunately, our data do not permit us to adjudicate between these two explanations. To do so would require systematic information collected at different points in each country's electoral cycle about the kinds of ethnic appeals politicians make—data that the Afrobarometer surveys do not collect (and that is difficult to gather systematically in a single country, let alone in 10).30 Yet even if we had such data it is not clear that it would make sense to test one explanation against the other, for the two accounts are less competing than complementary. When politicians in the run‐up to Sierra Leone's 2007 presidential election promised that “if you help your kinsmen you will survive; we will give you jobs, opportunities and education” (Manson 2007), were they manipulating voters or simply playing to their expectations? When voters in recent elections in Kenya (Gibson and Long 2008), Malawi (Posner 1995), or South Africa (Ferree 2006) overwhelmingly supported presidential candidates from their own ethnic or racial groups, were they responding to the candidates' ethnic appeals or simply channeling their votes to the politicians who they thought would best look out for their interests? The answer is almost certainly “both.” Politicians will only invoke the need for voters to support members of their ethnic groups if they believe that such appeals will resonate, which in turn will depend on voters' beliefs about how patronage is channeled in Africa. Similarly, although most citizens do not need to be reminded that their ethnic connection with the election's winner is likely to affect the level of resources they will receive in the election's aftermath, politicians' ethnic appeals almost certainly reinforce such expectations. The result is an equilibrium in which expectations of ethnic favoritism by voters generate ethnic appeals by politicians which, in turn, reinforce voters' expectations of ethnic favoritism.31 Because this mutually reinforcing process is driven by the competition for political power, it makes perfect sense that it should cause ethnicity to become more salient in proximity to competitive elections, since this is the time when political power is most clearly at stake.         "
"42","The link between political competition and ethnic identification is characterized by a second sort of equilibrium as well. Rational politicians should target their ethnic appeals to the voters they believe will be most receptive to them. Thus if we can identify the kinds of voters that politicians should be seeking to mobilize, we should expect to find higher levels of ethnic identification among these voters than others. This was the intuition behind our test for higher levels of ethnic identification among members of large ethnic groups (since these are the groups that constitute sufficiently large voting blocs to be able to affect the outcome of the election) and among opposition party supporters (since one of the surest ways to mobilize opposition to a ruling party in Africa is to claim that the party discriminates against members of ethnic groups that are underrepresented in its leadership). The fact that we find no differences between members of these groups and others with respect to their likelihood of identifying in ethnic terms suggests either that such targeting is not taking place (which we believe is unlikely) or that, consistent with a pattern long noted by scholars of ethnic politics (e.g., Horowitz 1985), the targeting of some groups for ethnic mobilization generates a defensive countermobilization by others.32 Electoral competition would appear to give rise to a process of ethnic mobilization and countermobilization that causes ethnicity to become more important for everyone in the political system.         "
"43","Our central result is that exposure to political competition powerfully affects whether or not survey respondents identify themselves in ethnic terms. The finding—based on precisely the kind of cross‐national data that has hitherto been lacking—provides strong confirmation for situational understandings of ethnicity and for theories that link the salience of particular social identities to instrumental political mobilization. Beyond their relevance for this academic literature, the article's results also have important implications for policy makers and researchers interested in elections and ethnicity."
"44","It might be tempting to interpret our findings as suggesting that, by heightening the salience of ethnic identities, the reintroduction of multiparty elections in Africa in the 1990s—widely celebrated as a positive development—may have a conflict‐inducing downside. Kenya's 2007 presidential contest, which triggered weeks of violence that left more than 1,000 people dead and 300,000 displaced (International Crisis Group 2008), would seem to provide strong support for this thesis. Yet it would be wrong to construe our results as endorsing this position. While we do find strong evidence that ethnic identities are heightened by exposure to political mobilization, our findings do not support the proposition that political competition accounts for the baseline levels of ethnic salience that make mobilizing ethnicity so politically useful in many African countries—indeed, our fixed‐effect estimation strategy makes it impossible for us to test such a claim. Nor do our results suggest that the increasing competitiveness of African elections (Diamond 2008) will necessarily instigate ethnic violence. Our findings suggest that countries with periodic competitive elections should experience fluctuations in ethnic salience that are correlated with their electoral cycle, not that they will exhibit higher levels of ethnic identification, on average, than countries without competitive elections. The relationships we uncover would be consistent with such a pattern, but establishing such a relationship would require a different research design than the one we adopt here.         "
"45","Yet the fact that elections make ethnicity (even momentarily) more salient does suggest the need for African governments to develop policies and institutional mechanisms that are capable of dealing with ethnic divisions. Policies and institutions such as those in place in Tanzania—a country known for its efforts at nation building through the promotion of Swahili as a national language, civic education, and institutional reforms like the abolition of chiefs, as described by Miguel (2004)—might serve as a model for how Kenya and other African countries might dampen destructive ethnic divisions. Perhaps due in part to these policies, Tanzania has among the lowest degree of ethnic identity salience in one of the Afrobarometer survey rounds, at just 3%.33"
