"1","Decision‐making theories focus on how budget actors decide allocations. Actors themselves are grouped by institutional role, so the decision‐making theories focus both on institutional interactions and the cognitive capacities of the actors involved. Budget decisions are complex, and environmental constraints are too limited and conflicting to impose deterministic solutions. Consequently, the decision‐making capacities of budget actors are often critical to the choices made. Because problems are multifaceted and the time available to devote to the task limited, decision heuristics often strongly affect the patterns of choices."
"2","Budget decisions, however, are made in a complex setting of multiple actors across different institutions and agencies (Padgett 1981). In the United States, budgeting requires complex cooperation between the executive and legislative branches. Mandatory programs—those whose rules of determining payments are set by statute—require changes in law as well as budgets to change budgetary outcomes. Discretionary programs can be changed in a budget bill, but even then budget makers can face complex constraints. If agencies have signed multiyear contracts, those contracts must be factored into budget changes, which can be particularly problematic in the case of budget cuts. Agency requests for budget allocations are affected by signals from the bureaucratic hierarchy within which it is embedded, the Office of Management and Budget, the demands of congressional oversight and appropriations committees, and the actual allocations received in the previous year (Carpenter 1996; Padgett 1981).         "
"3","In the early 1960s, Aaron Wildavsky (1964) conducted a systematic study of budgeting within federal agencies, focusing on the strategies the participants used in the process. These strategies were for the most part fairly simple, and reduced to adjustments based on the existing budgetary base. Incrementalist models postulate that reasonably simple heuristic decision rules govern budgeting, and that these rules empirically can be reduced to the following maxim: “grant to an agency some fixed mean percentage of that agency's base, plus or minus some stochastic adjustment to take account of special circumstances” (Davis, Dempster, and Wildavsky 1966, 535); that is,            "
"4","We refer to Equation 1 as the basic incrementalist equation. It models process incrementalism, which in turn implies outcome incrementalism. The converse is also true: if we do not observe outcome incrementalism, process incrementalism cannot be the full story.         "
"5","Davis, Dempster, and Wildavsky (DDW; 1966) tested the basic incrementalist model repeatedly on budget requests and congressional appropriations for 53 nondefense agencies for 1947–63, using a linear regression framework. They found excellent fits, but the coefficients for the equations were not constant. In a second article, Davis, Dempster, and Wildavsky (1974) attempted to integrate external influences into the linear model, with little success. These studies were repeated by many other scholars in different settings with similar results (see Padgett 1980, 354, for a summary).         "
"6","Several scholars critiqued the DDW regression‐centered approach as leading to overestimates of incrementalism (Padgett 1980; Wanat 1974). Padgett (1980) argued for a stochastic process approach to studying budget behavior and showed that incrementalism implied a Gaussian distribution of budget changes for single, homogeneous programs, and a Student's t distribution for aggregations of programs with heterogeneous parameters. Padgett performed tests on data from a limited period; Jones, Baumgartner, and True performed more complete tests on U.S. budget authority after 1947. Their stochastic studies of Office of Management and Budget subfunctions for the full period indicated that the incremental model as a general explanation of program‐level budget change could not be sustained (Jones, Baumgartner, and True 1996; True, Jones, and Baumgartner 2007). Subsequently, numerous studies in various political settings have confirmed decisively that budget change distributions are not distributed as the incremental theory predicts (Jones et al. 2009). Padgett's serial processing model (1980, 1981) offered a strong improvement on the classic incremental models by showing a path by which the external political and policy forces could be transferred to internal budget dynamics. His model incorporated sequential incremental adjustments and an external constraint, the fiscal climate.         "
"7","As Breunig and Koski (2012, 50) note, incrementalism was developed “in a context in which budgeting decisions are removed from political and policy considerations.” Indeed, the primary distinction between decision‐making and policy process models is that the latter explicitly incorporate these forces. Policy process models incorporate policy and political considerations and, as a consequence, view the political system holistically, conceiving of inputs (information) flowing into the system, and the system responding to these flows. But the response is not proportional to the information. Rather, resistance, or friction, in the system blocks action until the political system responds by shifting quickly, resulting in a pattern of budgetary responses that are not smooth, but rather highly punctuated. Most of the time, program budgets are highly incremental, changing only marginally, but occasionally they change rapidly (a good summary is Ryu 2011).         "
"8","The implications of this have been extensively tested using stochastic process methods (Breunig and Jones 2011). Looking at program‐level data, researchers found that the distribution of budget changes is highly leptokurtic (Jones and Baumgartner 2005b; Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen 2003; Jones et al. 2009; True, Jones, and Baumgartner 2007). The general findings of the tests of the policy process models show that most programs experience only marginal adjustments most of the time. The large‐scale budget changes happen only in rare circumstances. Incremental budget adjustments are embedded in a broader system of policymaking, which can involve nonincremental punctuations (Howlett and Migone 2011).         "
"9","The broader empirical tests of the policy process models, by showing how increases in institutional friction as a policy move from proposal to enactment to budgetary allocation (Jones and Baumgartner 2005b; Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen 2003), rule out simple decision rules, including both process incrementalism and serial processing, as explanations of patterns of budgetary allocations. These rules may explain the choices of single actors, but they cannot be generalized to budgetary systems.         "
"10","Both the decision‐making and policy process models were developed to explain changes in budget allocations to programs, and they have been applied on program‐level data since the Second World War. Yet, a more general theory must also address more aggregate budgetary allocations across longer periods of time. The dynamics of long‐range budget changes may not be consistent with programmatic dynamics. So we turn to concepts more normally found in historical institutionalism: path dependency and critical junctures."
"11","The notion of path dependency is encompassing to the point of vagueness, as Page (2006) has lucidly shown. He distinguishes four distinct meanings of the term, one of which, self‐reinforcement, is generally what is meant by budgetary path dependency. In self‐reinforcement, choices put in place mechanisms that operate to sustain the choice (Baumgartner and Jones 2009; Howlett and Rayner 2006; Mahoney 2000; Pierson 2004). Institutions, including those established by enabling statutes for specific policies, budgetary routines and procedures, and informal norms, all operate to reinforce budgetary dynamics (Begg 2007; Dufour 2008; Myers 2011; Wildavsky 1964). This observation is the key to measuring the long‐term effects of budgetary path dependency. Budgetary incrementalism is a type of self‐reinforcing path dependency. If all agencies are behaving incrementally, then the full budget of a political system will obviously also be incremental; indeed, even if the agencies include disjoint behavior, the full budget will be incremental within limits, as we discuss below.         "
"12","Path dependency alone cannot account for major disjoint change, so historically centered studies of path dependency generally incorporate the concept of critical junctures (Capoccia and Kelemen 2007; Mahoney 2000; Pierson 2000, 2004). Additionally, path dependency as typically used in political science includes the concept of lock‐in (Page 2006), in which initial moves act to reinforce the policy path. It is difficult to distinguish self‐reinforcement from lock‐in in the historical and qualitative literature, but we will show that it may be combined with the notion of critical junctures to aid in the development of a more general budgetary theory.         "
"13","The general theory we develop here incorporates elements from each of the three approaches outlined above. The first element is a refurbishing of the notion of incrementalism. If we aggregate across programs (separating out only defense from domestic programs because defense allocations are more sensitive to external challenges than domestic allocations), then we expect the budget path to follow one dictated by incrementalism. The stochastic process studies eliminated pure incrementalism at the program level. Program‐level changes are not incremental, but potentially overall budget levels are. Because overall expenditures are a weighted sum of program expenditures, the Central Limit Theorem can operate to smooth out the non‐normal program data, so long as the program‐level adjustments are independent of one another.1 Because self‐reinforcing incrementalism leads to an exponential growth path in budgets, as we show below, we term this exponential incrementalism.         "
"14","The second element incorporates the role of critical junctures from the path dependency approach. Critical junctures cannot simply be defined as any significant breaks in the time‐series path. They must be historically obvious crisis ruptures. We define these as major wars and major economic disruptions, and develop an empirical method for detecting these disruptions. There is evidence in the empirical budget literature for such disruptions. Peacock and Wiseman (1961/1994) noted the presence of a “war ratchet” in British budgets early in the development of budgetary studies. Jones and Breunig (2007), in the only study of longer‐term budget dynamics in the United States, report such ratchet effects as well.         "
"15","We hypothesize that the critical junctures will consist of the Civil War, the First and Second World Wars, and the Great Depression, and this is what we find. Two types of critical junctures are possible. In the first type, the juncture ratchets up (or down) the expenditure path but does not affect the budgetary rate of return, defined as the incremental coefficient linking last year's budget to this year's. In the second type, the juncture ratchets the expenditure path, but it also shifts the budgetary rate of return, leading to a faster or slower budget growth path."
"16","The third element involves reintegrating programmatic adjustments and the punctuations implied by the policy process models. The available data do not allow us to examine programmatic budgetary adjustments; they are in effect aggregated in the summary data. Budgets grow both because new programs are added and because old ones are incremented to address new challenges. While we cannot disaggregate empirically given the limitations of the data, we hypothesize that the budget punctuations predicted both by the policy process models generated from punctuated equilibrium theory and from the serial processing decision‐making model will hold within equilibrium periods. The robustness of the stochastic process budget findings in the United States and many other countries, all done on post–World War II data, indicates that these punctuations exist. That should show up in year‐to‐year larger‐than‐Gaussian adjustments in the annual budgetary rate of change."
"17","If critical junctures are necessary for a general budget theory, calculating the frequency distributions of budget changes within equilibrium periods would yield less extreme distributions (especially measured by kurtosis) compared to the distribution for the whole 1791–2010 period. We are able to do some tests on the series that suggest this is the case in at least some periods, particularly for the post‐WWII domestic data.         "
"18","The result is a model we term disrupted exponential incrementalism. We show below that the solution to incremental budgeting, applied recursively across time, yields exponential growth. The model may be expected to hold for U.S. budget changes only within broad equilibrium periods separated by critical junctures, during which the parameters of the exponential growth model are shifted.         "
"19","In the remainder of the article, we examine empirically these three elements. Before we can do this, however, we need to lay out the implications of the theory for the extended budgetary time series we study, and the nature of the data set."
"20","Incrementalism implies that budgets grow geometrically, not linearly. That is, a constant percentage increment is added to last year's budget to get this year's. However, the incrementalists estimated the increment statistically by relating this year's budget to last year's through a linear estimating equation, which had the effect of overlooking the long‐run exponential character of the model. Jones and Baumgartner (2005a) show that DDW‐style incrementalism implies year‐to‐year percentage changes in budgets rather than year‐to‐year linear changes, which they termed “incrementalism with upward drift,” justifying using percentage changes in programmatic subfunctions in their stochastic process studies.         "
"21","Suppose we want to know not simply next year's budget, as described in Equation 1, but the budget n years after some starting year (here, that will be 1791, denoted as B0). If we expand the basic incrementalist equation (ignoring for the present the random factor), Bn = δBn–1, recursively, we get the following:            "
"22","This is a geometric series, the discrete form of exponential change (δ <>1), and it is clearly path‐dependent in the self‐reinforcing sense. Incrementalist budgeting, properly understood, implies exponential budgetary growth. It also implies an error term that is proportional to the size of the budget (see the online appendix)."
"23","Existing budgetary models apply to changes in the levels of budgetary allocations to programs, yet the size of government changes as a consequence of the addition or subtraction of entire programs as well as through allocations to existing programs. As a consequence, we assume that the parameter estimate for the growth factor, δ, is a weighted average of δs for agencies operative in the nth year. As programs are added to or subtracted from the mix of governmental responsibilities, the number of agencies over which the weighted average is taken changes.         "
"24","We define a budgetary equilibrium as a period in which the parameters for exponential incrementalism remain constant; that is, the budget grows at a constant exponential rate, and deviations from that rate return to the exponential path. Critical junctures disrupt a budgetary equilibrium, but following the critical juncture, negative feedback processes stabilize the process such that the parameters remain constant during the next budgetary era. These negative feedback processes need not, however, restore the parameters of the previous era.         "
"25","Because we expect the series to experience major destabilizations from critical junctures, we seek to isolate periods of stability within which exponential incrementalism holds in the budget data series. We isolate budgetary eras divided by critical junctures both statistically and historically, and then we examine the constancy of the parameters during the eras. Finally, we examine the residuals from our estimates for the exponential path during the equilibrium periods to see whether the deviations are smaller than those of a distribution of the full‐length budget changes. This would indicate whether critical junctures are a necessary component of a long‐run budget theory."
"26","We encountered considerable difficulties in constructing a satisfactory budget series for the U.S. government to estimate exponential incrementalism. Long‐term data for agencies or budget categories do not exist in any form, forcing investigators to rely on outlays. Two separate sources must be used to construct a series for overall outlays for the full period (one compiled by the Department of the Treasury, 1791–1970; the other by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB], 1940‐2010). These sources are consistent for overall outlays, but not for categories of spending. In the Treasury series, outlays are broken down only for domestic and defense, but the OMB series reports finer‐grained categories. Our analysis of the overlap period indicated that the two systems of categorization were not entirely consistent. As a consequence, we constructed two separate synthetic series from the two separate sources. We performed robustness tests to see whether the differences might affect our findings; we found no significant differences. The series were adjusted for inflation before analysis.2"
"27","Exponential growth in expenditures implies linear growth in the logarithm of expenditures over time (see the online appendix for details). So the estimating equation for the logarithm of the expected budget is            "
"28","The simple log‐linear growth pattern of Equation 3 would result from the fully isolated, closed budgetary system, but the simple formulation is clearly unrealistic. External factors can disrupt the internally dominated, closed incremental system. These external factors have two separate potential effects: they may ratchet expenditures up or down from the fundamental exponential path, shifting the magnitude of Ao, or they may shift the velocity, or incremental growth parameter, estimated by slope, λ, making it steeper or flatter.         "
"29","Our predictions from the general theory will be supported by the analysis if a model of exponential incrementalism holds except at critical junctures. At these critical junctures, either A0, the exponential intercept, or λ, the exponential velocity, or both may change. The periods between the critical junctures should be stable, both substantively and statistically. Minor destabilizations in which there is a reasonably rapid return to the stable exponential path are consistent with the theory. Situations in which local destabilizations occur, but the system returns to the previous exponential trend rapidly, provide evidence that the path‐dependent process is resilient, and hence are consistent with the predictions.         "
"30","The model would not be sustained if parameter shifts occur in circumstances not associated with crises (or else the term path dependency has little meaning) or if the data do not fit the exponential incrementalist model for extended periods. In particular, exponential incrementalism would be rejected in two cases: (1) if a disjoint shift in the logarithm of the budget occurs that is not associated with a critical moment or (2) if the logarithm of budgets curves upward (in which case budgets would be growing faster than exponential) or downward (in which case budgets would be growing slower). Such a pattern implies that the system is continuously adjusting off the exponential path. A self‐reinforcing path‐dependent budgetary process may be subject to destabilization in crises, but it should not be subject to ongoing, more minor cumulative destabilizations implied by the flow of information. These could be caused, however, by temporally local policy dynamics.         "
"31","In Figure 1, we plot the logarithm of real expenditures for the period 1791–2010. It is clear that the growth pattern is largely exponential, but major deviations occur. The deviations seem to be of two types. The first consists of spikes associated with major wars (the Civil War and the two world wars) and involves sharp changes associated with both mobilization and demobilization at the end of the war. Note that in every case, the level of government spending does not return to prewar levels. Rather, they stabilize at a level considerably above the previous level.         "
"32","Logarithm of U.S. Expenditures, 1791–2010"
"33","Note: The top panel depicts the full historical period, whereas the bottom panel depicts the post‐1950 period. The growth path for U.S. expenditures is exponential, but major deviations occur. Especially noteworthy are the three abrupt ratchets and the distinct curvature after 1980.                     "
"34","The second type of deviation from the strict exponential path involves changes in the exponential slope. Changes in slopes seem to occur after the wars. After the Civil War, the slope flattens out; between the two world wars, the slope sharply increases; after the Second World War, the slope decreases (and, indeed, exhibits a pronounced deceleration). A closer examination shows that this budgetary deceleration occurred in the period from around 1986 to 2001, with exponential growth resuming afterward. This was the period in which stringent budgetary “pay‐go” rules were in effect, and suggests problems with our predictions."
"35","While it is clear that the general path of U.S. expenditures has been exponential, there are a number of spikes, twists, and turns that characterize budget development. We examine the extent to which deviations from the exponential trend act as destabilizations that tend to return to the fundamental exponential path, or whether those destabilizations result in (a) permanent ratchets, (b) permanent changes in the rate of growth (slope changes), or (c) changes away from the exponential path."
"36","In analyzing the trend, we apply two distinct approaches. Method 1 is a smoothing technique applied to the budget series by taking the cumulative sum of the budget values—roughly, the numerical integration of these values—allowing us to focus on the main trends in the data. We fit least squares models to the stable periods indicated by an examination of the graphs. Method 2 is an examination of rates of change instead of budgetary levels, again seeking deviations from the hypothesized exponential path. More specifically, we analyze the logarithm of year‐to‐year change ratio, log(B(t)/B(t–1)); we refer to this as the derivative of the logarithm of the budget. We fit several least squares trend line models to the full budget series for this measure, distinguishing between them using two standard procedures: the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike information criteria (AIC).         "
"37","We use two different methods to examine two different parts of the budgetary process. Our hypothesis of exponential incrementalism requires linear growth of budget on a log‐linear scale. Figure 1 tentatively supports this theory, but we can achieve a cleaner view if we plot the log integral, or cumulative sum, of the budget, which smooths out the noise, revealing the underlying trend. This allows us to detect major periods of stable growth and isolate the effects of the hypothesized critical junctures. Method 2 assesses the derivative of the budget (in this case, annual change) and allows us to examine the fluctuations instead of the trend. Our hypothesis describes random adjustments to the exponential trend, and Method 2 allows us to assess the noise component of the budget process.         "
"38","Method 1 examines the cumulative sum of the budget values—roughly, the numerical integration of the series. If the trend is exponential, its integral will be too. (Details may be found in the online appendix.) Taking the logarithm of the budget integral would produce a linear plot, and Figure 2 does this. The figure shows the full series, along with parts of the subseries that were long enough to calculate stable least squares estimates. The approach isolates four different segments, with the break points delineated by wars, three of which were stable. The period between WWI and WWII distinctly curves upward, indicating an annual adjustment process that is not consistent with pure exponential incrementalism. The corresponding least squares estimators appear in the box at the top left of the figure. The solid lines delineate the portions of the curve for which we were able to calculate stable estimates (i.e., 1820–1860, 1867–1915, and 1947–1990).            "
"39","Log of the Total Budget Integral"
"40","Note: In this figure, the larger plotted line covers the entire historical period, whereas inset graphs depict each isolated period. Method 1 isolates four distinct historical periods for the total budget by fitting least squares segments, separated by major wars. Exponential equilibrum is indicated for three of them, but not for the period between the First and Second World Wars. The continuous upward curvature indicates budgetary growth that each year exceeds what would be predicted by stable exponential incrementalism.                        "
"41","The Civil War seems to have had two effects: it resulted in a permanent upward shift in the level of expenditure, and it led to a period of slightly slower growth in the budget (as assessed by a decline in the exponential exponents from 0.035 to 0.033). One source of this upward shift is the fiscal burden of military pensions and funds for war widows and orphans. The period from the Civil War to the First World War was a period of remarkably stable budget growth—exponential growth, but at a relatively lower rate compared to what came before and what came afterward. The First World War resulted in, again, a permanent shift in level of expenditure, and a clear upward shift in slope, associated with the New Deal response to the Great Depression. In this case, however, it was not possible to secure a stable estimate of the slope because of the continual adjustment process that results in increases that are faster than exponential after around 1930. The Second World War generated the expected upward shift in level, and a lower rate of growth (compared to the Interwar period). But the rate was greater than the 1865–1915 period, as indicated by an exponent of 0.047."
"42","Our data series allows us to analyze patterns of change for domestic and defense outlays separately. We performed the same Method 1 analyses on each that we did for the total budget, and the results are presented in Figures 3 and 4. Our analyses of the log of the budget integral for the case of defense outlays isolated five different segments, which were similar to those isolated for the total budget, with two exceptions. The 1865–1915 interval for defense decomposed into two parts, before and after 1900; there is an accelerated growth after this point. The break may be associated with President Theodore Roosevelt's expansionist foreign policy (Holmes 2006). In any case, it is hard to associate this shift in slope with any “critical juncture” in the environment, yet the shift had a considerable effect on budgetary outlays. In addition, the period between the world wars was stable and could be estimated.               "
"43","Log of Budget Integral for Defense Outlays"
"44","Note: The larger plotted line covers the entire historical period, whereas inset graphs depict each separate period. Method 1 isolates five historical periods for the defense budget, similar to the overall budget analysis of Figure 1, with two exceptions. Both are shifts in the exponential slope, one associated with President Theodore Roosevelt's military expansion around 1900, and the other with a post‐Vietnam withdrawal of military expenditures.                           "
"45","Log of Budget Integral, Domestic Outlays"
"46","Note: The larger plotted line covers the entire historical period, whereas inset graphs depict each separate period, using Method 1. There are periods in which exponential growth seems not to be exponentially stable for the domestic budget.                           "
"47","For the domestic outlays, the isolated segments in the descriptive path of the log integral of domestic outlays is not as clear, as there exist periods in which growth is not exponentially stable. The most interesting two segments are at the beginning and at the end of the 20th century. In both cases, domestic spending growth decelerated for an extended period of time. We discuss the latter deceleration later in the article. These decelerations (or accelerations) indicate difficulties with the theory, since they imply an internal adjustment process that is not abrupt and is not associated with crises or “critical moments.” However, if these changes are also associated with non‐Gaussian processes in the residuals around the exponential path, then they may be associated with programmatic punctuations found in the policy process studies."
"48","Method 2 examines rates of change instead of budgetary levels. Figure 5a displays the year‐to‐year budget change ratio (proportion change), and Figure 5b presents the logarithm of the budget change ratio for the total budget (see the online appendix for the defense and domestic data).            "
"49","Annual Budget Change Ratios"
"50","Note: Method 2 focuses on year‐to‐year budget changes instead of the absolute budget amounts of Method 1. The figure presents the general picture. We examine the logarithms of the budget ratios of one year's expenditures compared to the previous year's expenditures, as implied by our theory.                        "
"51","Using a systematic process, we fit various least squares trend line models to the full derivative of the log budget series. Specifically, we fit one, then two, then three, and so forth line segments to the data displayed in Figure 5. (Details may be found in the online appendix.) Were exponential incrementalism the only explanation for budget change, a single line segment with near‐zero slope would be satisfactory. But this is clearly not the case in Figure 5 for the total budget or for the defense and domestic budgets displayed in Figure A2 in the online appendix. As the number of lines fit to the series increases, the error in the fit decreases, so we use standard model fit criteria that adjust for the number of parameter estimates (Bayesian information and Akaike information criteria) to judge fit.            "
"52","Figure 6 shows the model fit statistics (BIC and AIC), plotted against the number of line segments fitted, for the total budget. The goodness‐of‐fit statistics help to find the optimal balance between the number of parameters and the model fit to avoid overfitting the data. We also examine points at which large drops occur in the statistics, indicating large improvements in model fit. The graph of the criteria indicates a large drop at six line segments, and again at 11, with only incremental model improvements after that. Figure 7 shows least squares estimates of the log budget derivative for 11 segments.            "
"53","The Number of Least Squares Segments Plotted Against AIC and BIC for the Total Budget"
"54","Note: Method 2 fits least squares segments to the budget change ratios in Figure 6 through an algorithm. The figure depicts changes in the model goodness‐of‐fit statistics. While the goodness‐of‐fit statistics are going down as the number of line segments increases, model fit is improving. When it levels out, no further improvement occurs.                        "
"55","Whether six or 11 line segments are fitted, the general form of the series remains similar to that fitted using the log integral method in Figure 2. Eleven segments are preferred for substantive reasons, as they capture the Civil War punctuation (see the online appendix for details). The approach isolates three periods of stability interrupted by large spikes due to war mobilization and demobilization (these are approximately the same periods as were isolated using the log of the budget integral in Figure 2). In effect, increasing the number of line segments fills in the details. These periods experienced steady growth in the budget, but the first period experienced quite high levels of year‐to‐year variability. It also detects a line segment corresponding to the interwar years and the Great Depression with a clear upward shift in slope from the pre‐WWI period. During this period, the rate of change was growing steadily—basically a longer period of nonequilibrium than the war spikes (Jánossy 1971).            "
"56","Figure 8 presents the best‐fit model estimate for Method 2 for the defense budget. The model goodness‐of‐fit statistics (AIC and BIC), presented in the online appendix, indicate a best fit of 10 segments. The results generally confirm the findings from Method 1, the log integral analysis.1 Note that the analysis isolates the Civil War shift.            "
"57","Figure 9 presents similar analyses for the domestic budget. Here the results are much clearer than in the log integral analysis of Figures 6 and 7.            "
"58","Optimal Least Squares Fit of the Derivative of the Logarithm for Domestic Expenditures, Eight Segments Fitted"
"59","Note: For the domestic budget, Method 2 isolates five historical periods, three of which are stable. During the two periods not characterized by a stable exponential slope—1865–1875 and between the First and Second World Wars—the rate of growth increases each year.                        "
"60","Five periods exist, three of which can be characterized as stable (i.e., the exponential slope is neither significantly increasing nor decreasing). There are two instable periods: during and shortly after the Civil War and during the Great Depression, in which the slope is accelerating. These continual slope accelerations are problematic for a pure form self‐reinforcing path dependency model of public expenditures."
"61","The domestic budget story consistent with our analyses goes like this. From 1791 to the U.S.‐Mexican War, the domestic budget grew at a steady exponential rate. That war brought vast new territories to the nation and was associated with a spike in the derivative—that is, a sharp upward change in the exponential rate of growth. After the Civil War, the slope increased each year—basically an annual acceleration or increase in the rate of growth, until around 1875. Then exponential stability was restored until World War I. A war spike pushed domestic spending higher; this was followed by a period of annual acceleration in the rate of growth that continued into the Great Depression. This suggests that Sparrow's (1996) insight about the development of the domestic state following World War II might be a more general phenomenon (see also Jones and Breunig 2007). The period of annual acceleration resulted in rapidly increased government domestic spending, but the changes in the slope stabilized (at the much higher level) in the early 1930s. The derivative method isolates the full period of 1930–2010 as a stable one, characterized by a higher level of growth in domestic expenditures than at any other period in the series.            "
"62","The analysis of the change of log budgets complements the log integral method, but the two approaches yield some important differences. The derivative of log budget method identifies the stable periods but is not sensitive to steady changes in the growth rate. For example, in Figure 3, in the middle section of the defense budget (1865 to WWI) there are two periods with different growth rates on the log integral graph reflecting a steady (stable) change in expenditures. The change in slope is small compared to the fluctuations, and hence it is detected as a single stable period by the derivative of log budget method (Figure 8).         "
"63","Similarly, while the derivative method lumps the period after WWII as a single era, the log integral method reveals the existence of the period of budget deceleration that occurs from 1988 to 2000. While this period of deceleration proved fleeting, its existence is important, since it indicates that internal dynamics can “bend the budget curve” through the application of budgeting procedures. These findings are problematic for our theory based on a pure path‐dependent budgetary system because it is hard to argue that the budgetary struggle of the 1980s and early 1990s was anything more than politics as usual."
"64","For both methods, we find that wars destabilize both defense and domestic budgets, but with somewhat different effects. Wars basically ratchet up defense spending and do not affect the exponential rate of growth. But they tend to affect domestic spending by altering the exponential rate of growth, with a much more muted ratchet effect. Defense budgets are affected by the mobilization needs associated with war, but demobilization also tends to occur and a new growth factor need not be built into the system. For domestic expenditures, however, statutory changes tend to perpetuate themselves, resulting in changes in the domestic spending growth slope."
"65","In general, U.S. budgets grow exponentially, disrupted by critical moments. We now turn to an examination of the behavior within the three equilibrium periods. This analysis is designed to examine the implications of the policy process approach, which operates at the program level. While we cannot examine programs with the data we present here, we are able to study within‐era annual changes, which would be impacted by policy process dynamics. We examine the residuals for each period for normality, for randomness, and for stationarity. All of these conditions would hold if we could describe our budget series by exponential incrementalism disrupted at critical moments. We cannot completely do this, leaving the door open for policy process explanations even at the macro‐level scale of our data."
"66","Using the now‐common stochastic process approach for analyzing budgetary changes, we find it easy to reject the simple linear incremental model for U.S. outlays from 1791 to 2010. For annual defense budget changes, the kurtosis is 56.9, and for the domestic budget 41.0. We could also reject exponential incrementalism, even if not so dramatically: for frequency distributions of the logarithm of budget changes, the kurtosis for the total budget is 17.3, for the defense budget 11.8, and for the domestic budget 15.6. The distribution for the total budget is shown in Figure 10; those for defense and domestic expenditures are in the online appendix.            "
"67","Histogram of the Logarithm of Budget Changes for the Full Data Series (1791–2010) for the Total Budget"
"68","Note: The figure shows budget change data (in logarithms) for the full data set. The data exhibit the clear leptokurtic pattern associated with policy process studies. If critical junctures are just part of a broader budgetary dynamic that characterizes the whole budgetary series, then we expect frequency distributions examining only the distributions for the stable periods to resemble these distributions.                        "
"69","But we have mixed equilibrium periods with critical junctures. What happens if we focus only on the residuals within the equilibrium periods? Focusing only on the three stable periods, we examined the residuals from the fitted least squares line for the derivative of the log of the budgets, with the results presented in Figure 11. The periods show different distributions clearly with different standard deviations, skewness, and kurtosis, strengthening our previous findings of different budgeting eras throughout the years. The residuals are the random adjustments to the general trends; to verify the hypothesis of exponential incrementalism, the residuals must be noise.            "
"70","Residuals from Fittings to the Derivative of Log Budget of the Stable Periods"
"71","Note: The figure displays the residuals of the least squares fits for the three stable periods, displayed as frequency distributions. The distributions are presented separately for the total, defense, and domestic budgets. Compared to the full series analysis presented in Figure 10, the histograms have fewer cases in the tails, and the kurtosis, which assesses punctuations in change data series, is reduced. This indicates a need for incorporating critical junctures into the theory. But for some periods the kurtosis remains large, indicating budget punctuations within the stable period.                        "
"72","During the first two periods, defense spending is more punctuated (i.e., with higher kurtosis), whereas domestic spending approaches normality. In the last period, after World War II, the relative roles are reversed, with domestic spending more punctuated and defense spending more normal. The destabilizations in domestic policy in the postwar period are more abrupt than in the previous periods, and they are more abrupt than defense spending. This could be a consequence of the addition of new domestic programs and subsequent cutting of them at a level unprecedented in earlier periods. The finding dovetails with policy process stochastic studies of changes in budget allocations across programs, all of which focus on the postwar period."
"73","We used the Lilliefors test to determine whether the residuals from the least squares fittings have Gaussian distributions for the stable periods. We found that total and defense budget for the last period and domestic spending for the first two series are accepted as Gaussian distributions at the 5% significance level. In Figure 10, the skewness and kurtosis of the first and second periods also support these findings.2 We then tested the independence of the three successive samples of residuals to see if they could be viewed as independently drawn and identically distributed. A Ljung‐Box test indicated the independence of the autocorrelation coefficients for the first two stable periods but not for the last period.            "
"74","The theory predicts that within the stable periods, the adjustment process is homogeneous and the random process is stationary. Figures 12 and 13 present stationarity tests for the stable periods with two different methods: moving average and standard deviation and the sum of deviations, for total expenditures. Details for the defense and domestic budgets may be found in the online appendix. The former approach indicates that the middle and last periods are stationary in a weak sense for the total budget. The domestic budget during WWII, where the large periodic oscillation appears, is an exception, but stationarity holds afterward. Interestingly, the first period seems not to be homogeneous, and both the mean and standard deviation jump up and down. At the jumps, there are smaller‐scale wars and other factors that come into play. We conclude that these situations temporarily increase the fluctuation but soon disappear, leaving no real effect on the budgeting system.            "
"75","Moving Average and Moving Standard Deviation over 6 Years for Total Budget, Derivative of Log Budget"
"76","Note: If our theory of disrupted incrementalism is empirically correct, the lines in the figure should be approximately constant, with only minor deviations, disrupted only by large deviations during critical junctures. This is true for the middle and late periods for the total budget, but not for the first period. These deviations do not seem to have effects on the total budget path.                        "
"77","Sum of Deviations for Derivative of Log Budgets for the Stable Periods: Defense during the Second Stable Period and Domestic during the Third Stable Period"
"78","Note: Our theory predicts that the sum of deviations should be flat and without large spikes within the stable periods. The figure graphs two places where there are problems: for the defense budget around 1900 and for the domestic budget after the early 1950s.                        "
"79","The sum of deviation method identifies a potential change in the mean exponential slope. We present the full graphical analysis in the online appendix (Figure A6), but we concentrate here on two aspects of the analysis that are problematic from the view of the general theory of disrupted exponential incrementalism. In general, the fluctuations are too large compared to the data length to gain clear results of changes in the mean during these stable periods. However, the method shows that the most stationary period is the middle period (for both total and domestic) but also shows that there is an unbalanced shift in the defense budget (shown in Figure 13a). This indicates a changed mean exponential slope that occurred around 1900, which is consistent with what we found using the log integral method. Historically, increasingly muscular foreign and defensive stance, represented by the actions of President Theodore Roosevelt, characterized this period.            "
"80","There are also problems for the disrupted exponential incrementalism model in the last stable period for domestic spending. Figure 13b shows a clear roof‐shape change in path of the sum of the deviations for domestic spending, hidden in the moving average method. The sum of the deviations for domestic spending grew during the post‐WWII period until around 1978, and then they began to shrink. Looking at Figure 9, we can see that the deviations were mostly in the positive direction (i.e., there were increases in the slope spending relative to the estimated mean path), and then after around 1978, there were decreases in the slope. Before that year, domestic expenditure changes exceeded the estimated pattern for the period; afterward, they were less. The pattern is consistent with historical and documentary evidence. The first part of the period was characterized by an expansion in the domestic role of the federal government (especially after 1958), which peaked during the Carter administration (1977–1981), after which a struggle to limit expenditures and balance the budget dominated the political dialogue (Grossman 2011). Note the uptick after 2000. This finding is somewhat inconsistent with a pure path dependency model broken only by critical moments. There are no clear ruptures. Rather, there is a dynamic adjustment pattern of changing mean growth weaving around the estimated path.            "
"81","We cannot strongly justify stationarity of the stable sections, so there are indications of possible changes in the stochastic processes. It is likely that some of the short‐term effects are explained by strong but localized political influences on the budgetary processes."
"82","In this article, we detailed a general theory of budgetary dynamics over long time periods. The theory is based on three elements from the current literature on the politics of the budgetary process. From decision‐making theories, we derived the implication of exponential growth in budgets. From the general notions of path dependency and critical junctures, we inferred that the parameters for the exponential growth model would be constant only for the periods between the critical junctures. From policy process theories, we drew the concept of programmatic punctuations."
"83","The basic driver of budget change in the United States over the long run is a self‐reinforcing, recursive incremental system whose solution is exponential growth, termed exponential incrementalism. Each year, the budget base is multiplied by a growth factor, the budget increment: B = Boexp(λt), where B is the budget in a given year, Bo is the starting point, λ is the constant exponent, and t is the number of years since Bo. The budget increment λ comes both from the classic incrementalist dynamic of adding to existing programs and from the addition of new programs over time.         "
"84","This model holds only for periods within historically important critical junctures: major wars and the Great Depression. Tests of this model on a newly constructed data series of U.S. expenditures since 1791 show that the model characterizes three major periods of budget stability in American history (1790–1860, 1865–1915, and 1950–2010). The critical junctures separating the equilibrium periods were characterized by changes in the budget intercept, Bo, the budget increment λ, or both.         "
"85","Some aspects of the analysis are problematic for the model. These are periods of changes in the velocity of exponential growth—basically, the acceleration is not constant. For Method 1 these are indicated by changes in linearity, and for Method 2 by changes in constancy. A clear upward‐bending curve, particularly in evidence for the total budget, occurs between the First and Second World Wars (see Figure 2). An upward bending of growth velocity occurs for domestic expenditures between 1850 and 1865, and downward‐bending curves occur between 1900 and World War I and during the 1980s and 1990s. The pattern after WWII seems to be constituted of two distinct periods. The first, from WWII to the late 1970s, was a period of aggressive government growth (recall that the rate of exponential growth was higher than in any other stable period), a result of the aggressive addition of new programs during the late 1950s to the late1970s. The second period was one of annual deceleration off the exponential path. Budgetary paths, to some extent, reflect the political dynamics of an era, and this is crystal clear here.         "
"86","When we studied the behavior of residuals within the periods of stability, we found further evidence of deviations from disrupted exponential incrementalism. This could involve “minor” wars and the challenges of integrating new territories into the nation, as was the case in the 1850s, or the conservative reaction to increased government growth beginning around 1980, or other localized but important forces."
"87","The policy process approach to budgeting, with its reliance on resistance and friction in policymaking institutions, implies that the budgetary path is disjoint and episodic, and hence annual budgetary changes would be subject to higher kurtosis values, implying leptokurtosis, whereas skewness remains within the bounds of normality. We found this to be true in important instances, particularly for domestic expenditures in the post–World War II period."
"88","We have forged a more complete budgetary theory from three fundamental elements: exponential incrementalism, critical moments, and policy dynamics. These three elements lead to a reasonably complete explanatory analysis of public budgeting in the United States."
"89","There are three “takeaways” from our analysis:            "
"90","One problematic issue for the theory involves the role of the Great Depression. It did not cause a disjoint shift in the expenditure growth rate, but it had a very large effect on domestic and total spending nevertheless. It did so by affecting the rate of growth; each year during the Depression, the rate of growth increased (see Figure 9). It is clear why this occurred: the addition of programs throughout the New Deal and the start‐up time necessary to get them to full strength. These effects are strong and consistent, and obviously do not constitute local dynamics.         "
"91","A second serious issue with our model is the somewhat open‐ended effects of temporally localized policy dynamics. We can say that local dynamics never account for the discrete shifts associated only with critical moments, but there are several different effects that can be attributed to local policy dynamics. But outside of the expected volatility in domestic expenditures after World War II, which is predicted by the stochastic process studies based on punctuated equilibrium, the other changes cannot be predicted beforehand. Yet because we have specified exactly what kinds of effects we expect from local dynamics, these aspects are not relegated to the realm of solely qualitative analysis. Both Wildavsky (1964) and Jones and Baumgartner (2005) note the inseparability of budgeting from politics, and the latter cite that as the reason for the “impossibility” of building a budgetary theory. We have shown at the macro level that it is possible to integrate politics into a theory of budgeting, but it is clear that temporally localized policy dynamics influence the course of the budget path.         "
"92","We have made considerable progress toward a much more complete budgetary theory. That has required moving to a historical time frame and thinking of the process as an exponential growth process disrupted by external challenges and internal policy dynamics. One next step could be the investigation of just which kinds of local policy dynamics lead to different intra‐equilibrium budgetary changes—in particular, bends in the curve and non‐Gaussian adjustments."
