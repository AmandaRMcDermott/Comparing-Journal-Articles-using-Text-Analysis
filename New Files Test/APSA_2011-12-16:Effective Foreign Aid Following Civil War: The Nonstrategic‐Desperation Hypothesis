"1","To prevent further human tragedy after civil war, donors typically fund vaccination programs, health clinics, water and sanitation systems, road rehabilitation, and other projects (U.S. Department of State 2010; World Bank 1998).6 Sixty percent of aid projects five years after civil wars between 1970 and 2001 were designed to improve these sorts of basic services (OECD 2010). Because such improvements appear to raise the standard of living for the majority of citizens,7 compliance with postconflict aid agreements should bring about development, and implementation of these agreements should be attractive to aid recipients.8 Since implementation is not universal, it is important to carefully analyze the incentives that aid recipients face when considering whether to implement an aid agreement. If meeting donor objectives can promote development after civil war, under what conditions would some aid recipients choose against meeting donor objectives?         "
"2","Aid recipients emerging from civil war are likely concerned with political survival because they rule with fragile institutions and because they are prone to coups.9 Coups are likely in postconflict environments because such environments offer little economic opportunity for citizens, lack democratic institutions, and have a prior history of coups.10"
"3","Coup proofing, including buying political support and strengthening defense, requires financing (Quinlivan 1999). In the aftermath of civil war, leaders urgently need access to funds, and are therefore likely to pursue the easiest sources of income. Aid recipients with access to natural resources, especially highly profitable resources that require either little labor (oil) or little technology (gold) to extract, are likely to exploit these resources immediately.         "
"4","If resource rents are not an option, the next likely source of immediate income is aid based on strategic importance to the donor. The incentive to use this aid for development is weak because aid contingency is based more on donor strategic interests than on development goals (Martens et al. 2002). Donors are likely to disburse such aid to former colonies where they may wish to maintain political interests (Alesina and Dollar 2001) or because they have military strategic interests in the recipient.11 While donor strategic interests may sometimes be intended to bolster the survival chances of a fledgling government (Carter 2009),12 on other occasions, strategic donors may be more interested in continued friendly relations with a strategically important country than with the survival of any particular postconflict leader.         "
"5","As a result, postconflict aid based on strategic importance comes with unenforceable development‐policy demands.13 In this way, postconflict aid based on strategic importance can operate like natural resources, generating an immediate source of windfall revenue for the recipient government, free of any obligation to transfer this wealth to its citizens as basic services.         "
"6","Although meeting donor development objectives might benefit their countries, postconflict aid recipients with strategic importance or high resource rents likely choose not to meet donor objectives because investing any of their wealth to benefit the poor occurs at the expense of coup proofing via security. These aid recipients benefit more from spending the wealth to serve their immediate security needs instead of disbursing the wealth widely for future development gains (Smith 2008).14 One might expect that eventually enough money would meet the security requirements to prevent a coup. However, these aid recipients with windfall income never seem to satisfy their desire to coup‐proof by spending on security. The marginal benefit of spending to protect the regime seems to outweigh the benefit from helping the population. For example, after the 2002 ceasefire, Angolan defense expenditures increased while expenditures in health and education remained low (1.9% and 2.4% of gross domestic product, respectively) despite the influx of oil revenues (IMF 2007, 65). The strategy works: resource‐rich regimes can last for a very long time (Morrison 2009; Smith 2004).         "
"7","In contrast, the incentives are quite different for aid recipients without resource rents and without strategic importance. To maintain the aid, these recipients need to generally meet donor objectives. In postconflict Mozambique, for example, where the government had little political value to most donors and lacked resource rents, the government met donor objectives by using aid to build health centers and roads, implement vaccination campaigns, and support small‐scale agriculture (Landau 1998). Donors responded by covering half of government expenditures, some of which funded security (República de Moçambique 1999).15"
"8","Can threats to withdraw aid be credible?Buchanan (1975) argues that donors receive utility from simply giving, which engenders a “Samaritan's Dilemma,” whereby donors will disburse aid even if recipients fail to meet donor objectives. According to Buchanan, overcoming the dilemma is possible if the Samaritan comprehends the “prospects open to him and begins to behave accordingly … . Vague threats or promises to cut off his charity in the absence of work on the part of the recipient … will remain empty unless there's demonstrated willingness to carry out such threats” (Buchanan 1975, 76).16 Since Buchanan's 1975 essay, evidence suggests that donors can credibly threaten to withdraw aid from nonstrategic recipients that fail to implement aid agreements.17 For example, in Angola, aid from donors who lacked strategic interests in Angola declined from $24.20 per capita to $5.82 per capita in the five years following the 2002 ceasefire (OECD 2010) because Angola refused to implement aid agreements following the ceasefire (World Bank 2007). While Angola had low strategic importance, U.S. strategic interests were high in Afghanistan following the ousting of the Taliban, so the United States was unable to threaten “or else” when calling for meaningful reform (Cooper 2009). These examples suggest the possibility of a systematic pattern in a subset of cases wherein donors have the leverage to credibly threaten to withdraw aid from recipients who fail to implement aid agreements.         "
"9","Recipients with low resource rents and low strategic importance should benefit the most from aid because they have a significant incentive to implement aid agreements: they desperately need the money, so they must meet donor goals to continue to receive the flow of vital aid. This theory implies the following nonstrategic‐desperation hypothesis."
"10","            "
"11","Hypothesis: Aid is more likely to promote development after civil war when the recipient has both low resource rents and low strategic importance to the donor.                  "
"12","According to this hypothesis, increases in aid should foster development when resource rents and strategic importance are both low (Table 1, bottom left). The hypothesis also suggests that development should not occur in relation to aid levels when either resource rents or strategic importance is high.         "
"13","The influence of aid on development after civil war is assessed using an original dataset of 1,885 observations (donor‐recipient pairs) of 29 OECD donors offering aid following 65 civil war ceasefires, 1970–96 (29 * 65 = 1,885).18 These 65 ceasefires encompass 46 countries, so in cases of multiple civil wars during the period of study, each civil war ceasefire is considered unique. Thus, the unit of analysis for hypothesis testing is the donor‐recipient pair. The nonstrategic‐desperation hypothesis is tested across six multiple regression models presented here and 30 additional multiple regression models in the Supporting Information (SI).19 Descriptive statistics are presented in Table SI‐1.         "
"14","Infant mortality captures broad‐based development more sensitively than income growth measures, which might only affect elites. Development metrics such as literacy, water quality, and health are increasingly commonplace in qualitative research, but are not suitable for quantitative analysis due to a lack of data. Infant mortality, the probability that a live‐born infant will die before reaching one year of age, is highly correlated with diverse aspects of poverty, as measured by qualitative studies of postconflict development (Ross 2006; Victora et al. 2003). The WHO released to the author a new dataset of annual infant mortality rates across postconflict countries (1970–2006). Alternative measures of development are included as robustness checks20 because the WHO is sometimes unable to measure infant mortality directly and instead offers estimates (using civil registries, censuses, and household surveys). Reductions in infant mortality rates indicate improvement, so variables promote infant well‐being when negatively correlated with infant mortality.         "
"15","Infant mortality is measured as the %change in infant mortality between the ceasefire and 10 years after the ceasefire. Because this study is interested in aid immediately following civil war, all predictor and control variables are measured for the first five years from the ceasefire, but to be sensitive to the potential latent effects of the predictor and control variables over time, infant mortality measures are extended to encompass 10 years. Results are consistent using 12‐year or 8‐year thresholds (Table SI‐4).         "
"16","The independent variables of interest are aid, strategic importance, and resource rents. Aid refers to net aid per capita transfers by OECD donors in constant 2000 U.S. dollars and comes from the OECD (2010).21 Strategic importance (Strat Imp) can be measured as the presence of one or more of four independent factors: colonial history, a military alliance between donor and aid recipient, aid agreements with a nonneutral donor during the Cold War, and troop deployments from donor to recipient.22Shared colonial history represents strategic importance because donors generally maintain political‐economic links with their former colonies (Alesina and Dollar 2001). The data come from Hensel and Mitchell (2006), with each observation coded as “1” when donor and recipient share colonial history and “0” otherwise. Two percent of donor‐recipient pairs in the sample share colonial history.         "
"17","A military alliance represents a formal agreement between donor and aid recipient for defensive action, offensive action, neutrality, nonaggression, or consultation when military conflict, or its prospect, emerges (Bermeo 2008; Leeds et al. 2002). The data come from Leeds (2005). Each observation is coded as “1” when donor and recipient share a military alliance and “0” otherwise. Six percent of the sample shares a military alliance.         "
"18","Recipients entering aid agreements with non‐neutral donors during the Cold War were likely receiving strategic aid because foreign aid disbursement was a tool used by the United States, the Soviet Union, and their allies to win support and buy loyalty (Bearce and Tirone 2010; Bermeo 2008; Dunning 2004; Stone 2010). A donor‐recipient pair is coded as “1” if the donor was not neutral during the Cold War and “0” otherwise. The Cold War period is measured as ending in 1989. Of the 1,885 pairs, 33% involved aid from a non‐neutral donor during the Cold War.         "
"19","A fourth factor of strategic importance is whether there was a donor‐troop deployment to the aid recipient emerging from war. Donors tend to send their own troops to support postconflict stabilization in countries where their political interests are at stake (Edelstein 2008). Data on troop deployments are available from Braithwaite (2009) and the Military Balance.23 The data exclude peacekeepers from the United Nations (UN) or regional organizations because these deployments are often not motivated by donor national‐security concerns (Fortna 2008). A donor‐recipient pair is coded as “1” if the donor sent the recipient at least 100 military personnel and “0” otherwise. Donors deployed troops in 2% of the donor‐recipient pairs.         "
"20","For testing the hypothesis, the recipient has low strategic importance (coded as “0”) to the donor if and only if (a) the two share no colonial history, (b) the two share no military alliance five years after the ceasefire, (c) donors were neutral during the Cold War, and (d) the donor sent no troops to the aid recipient within five years of the ceasefire.24 If the recipient has at least one of these four factors, the donor‐recipient dyad is defined as having high strategic importance (coded as “1”).25 Sixty percent of the sample is of low strategic importance.         "
"21","Resource rents (Res Rents) measures rents from natural resources that take either little labor or technology to extract. Hard minerals, such as gold, and fuel minerals, such as oil, meet this standard. Profiting from oil, for example, requires little labor, while profiting from hard minerals, such as gold, usually requires little technology. The resource rents variable refers to rents per capita in constant 2000 U.S. dollars averaged over the five years after the ceasefire. Data on rents come from the World Bank's Genuine Savings Project (Hamilton and Clemens 1999) and were updated by Ross (2008). To ensure the measure captures only aid recipients with enough resource rents to forego aid, recipients below or equal to the 66th percentile in resource rents are considered to have low resource rents (coded as “0”), while all others are considered to have high resource rents (coded as “1”). The hypothesis is supported when changing the threshold to the 63rd percentile (Table SI‐8).         "
"22","Raw score data are consistent with the nonstrategic‐desperation hypothesis. Figure 1 displays scatter plots of aid per capita and percent change in infant mortality, split high and low for resource rents and for strategic importance, resulting in four subsamples. While three of the slopes are essentially flat (1A, 1D) or indicate worsening infant mortality rates (1B), greater aid predicts declines in infant mortality only when recipients have both low resource rents and low strategic importance, indicated by the significant negative slope in Figure 1C.         "
"23","                Scatter Plots of Aid Per Capita and Infant Mortality                      "
"24","ß indicates the slope. *sig at 10%; **sig at 5%; ***sig at 1%. Reductions in infant mortality indicate development. Panel C (low strategic importance and low resource rents) has a downward slope while Panels A, B, and D do not, consistent with the hypothesis."
"25","It is important to hold constant factors that may confound the influence of aid on the percent change in infant mortality. While there is no consensus on a model of infant mortality, this analysis controls for variables typically included in studies of infant mortality and for variables associated with civil war. The analysis controls for base infant mortality (i.e., infant mortality at ceasefire). Per capita income, log(income), correlates negatively (−.70) with baseline infant mortality, and malaria ecology correlates positively (+.46) with baseline infant mortality, so these variables are included.26"
"26","The analysis controls for the global average of infant mortality because global infant mortality improves over time as a result of better technologies and advances in our understanding of human health. Because growth in per capita income is associated with increasing the means with which households can improve their access to health care, public utilities, and housing, the analysis controls for per capita income growth (Firebaugh and Beck 1994). It is important to control for the logarithm of population density of the aid recipient, from the World Bank (2006), because if citizens are dispersed, governments may be unable to offer health care and other goods to the whole population (Ross 2006). Because ethnic diversity is associated with reductions in public service provision (Habyarimana et al. 2007), I control for ethnic fractionalization using data from Fearon and Laitin (2003). Democracy appears to facilitate economic growth after civil war (Flores and Nooruddin 2009; Kang and Meernik 2005), so the analysis controls for democracy in the aid recipient. Most postconflict governments fail to qualify as democratic, but some have institutionalized executive recruitment. As a result, democracy is measured as whether executive recruitment is regulated, reported by Marshall, Jaggers, and Gurr (2009). This variable is ordered on a 3‐point scale, where higher values represent higher institutionalization.         "
"27","The analysis controls for the logarithm of war duration (in months) because the degree of hostility among combatants could hamper development efforts.27 Also, the analysis controls for decisive victory, wherein losers are too weak to restart conflict (Licklider 1995). Observations are coded as “1” if the war ends decisively and “0” otherwise. Finally, it is important to control for UN security guarantees, wherein peacekeepers threaten to punish any combatant that defects from the ceasefire (Fortna 2008; Walter 1997; Wantchekon 2004). Observations are coded as “1” if UN security guarantees are present and “0” otherwise. The data for war duration, decisive victory, and UN security guarantees come from Doyle and Sambanis (2006).28"
"28","Equation (1) presents the model:            "
"29","The influence of increasing aid per capita on postconflict development is analyzed by modeling the percent change in infant mortality after ceasefire (i) using ordinary‐least squares, with standard errors clustered by donor‐recipient to adjust for correlation within the same donor‐recipient pair. The percent change in infant mortality is measured between the ceasefire (year 0) and year 10. This change depends on aid per capita, averaged over the five years (T) following the ceasefire, and on whether the recipient has low resource rents and low strategic importance to the donor. Thus, the model includes the three‐way interaction of aid * strategic importance * resource rents (aid*strat imp*res rents). The model also includes a vector of control variables, also averaged over five years (T) following the ceasefire, and an error term (ɛ). The greatest threat to validity comes from the potential endogeneity of aid. Robustness checks to address endogeneity follow the results.         "
"30","The nonstrategic‐desperation hypothesis can be tested directly by including a three‐way interaction of aid, strategic importance, and resource rents in models predicting percent change in infant mortality. Using this multiplicative interaction approach, the hypothesis is only supported if the aid term is negative and the three‐way interaction is positive.29 Model 1 in Table 2 introduces the aid*strat imp*res rents interaction. Because the three‐way interaction reports individual independent variable predictions indexed at zero for each of the remaining interaction variables, aid is expected to have a significant negative slope, indicating that aid reduces infant mortality when resource rents and strategic importance are both low (both equal zero). The significant negative coefficient for aid on the first line of Model 1 in Table 2 supports the hypothesis in the full sample of ceasefires.         "
"31","The positive three‐way interaction in Model 1 shows that the marginal effect of aid on infant mortality differentially increases as resource rents or strategic importance go from low to high, consistent with the nonstrategic‐desperation hypothesis. Figure 2 graphically displays this three‐way interaction, revealing that only countries with low resource rents and low strategic importance show a significant negative marginal effect of aid on change in infant mortality, indicating development.30"
"32","                Marginal Effect of Aid on Infant Mortality as Resource Rents and Strategic Importance Change"
"33","This figure is based on Table 2, Model 1. The code used to generate the figure comes from Brambor, Clark, and Golder (2006). An “*” is used to indicate the 95% confidence level for the marginal effect of aid on percent change in infant mortality. Reductions in infant mortality indicate development. The marginal effect of aid on % change in infant mortality is negative and significant only when resource rents and strategic importance are both low, supporting the hypothesis.                     "
"34","The influence of aid on infant mortality is divided across four subsamples in Table 2. Consistent with the hypothesis, the influence of increasing aid on infant mortality is only negative and statistically significant when aid recipients have both low resource rents and low strategic importance (Table 2, Model 2), but not when recipients have low strategic importance and high resource rents (Table 2, Model 3), high strategic importance and low resource rents (Table 2, Model 4), or high strategic importance and high resource rents (Table 2, Model 5).         "
"35","In addition, results support the hypothesis when analyzing the percentage of nonstrategic aid (% Nonstrategic Aid) received by each recipient, demonstrating that findings are not an artifact of using donor‐recipient pairs as the unit of analysis. In Table 2, Model 6, strategic aid is the sum of aid disbursed by donors with a strategic interest in the recipient, so nonstrategic aid plus strategic aid equals 100% aid received. The significant negative slope for percent nonstrategic aid indicates that as the proportion of nonstrategic aid increases in resource‐poor states, infant mortality declines.         "
"36","Figure 3 plots the predicted percent change in infant mortality for real values of aid per capita based on the four subsample models in Table 2. Only one cell has a significant downward slope: the cell depicting the influence of aid per capita on percent change in infant mortality when strategic importance and resource rents are both low (Figure 3C, not 3A, 3B, or 3D).         "
"37","                Predicted Effect of Aid on Infant Mortality"
"38","This figure is based on Table 2, Models 2–5. ß indicates the slope. *sig at 10%; **sig at 5%; ***sig at 1%. Reductions in infant mortality indicate development. Panel C (low strategic importance and low resource rents) has a downward slope while Panels A, B, and D do not, consistent with the hypothesis.                     "
"39","Based on Models 2–5 in Table 2, increasing aid by $10 per capita in countries with low resource rents and low strategic importance reduces infant mortality by 2%, while a similar increase in aid actually increases infant mortality by 21% in recipients with high resource rents and high strategic importance and by 3% in recipients with high resource rents and low strategic importance. The decline in infant mortality is trivial (0.1%) when resource rents are high and strategic importance is low.         "
"40","Thus, the pattern for aid recipients with low resource rents and low strategic importance differs from other aid recipients in two important regards. First, the downward slope of the data in Figure 3C indicates that increasing levels of aid promotes development for these recipients. Second, and more important from a policy perspective, not much aid is needed to significantly rehabilitate countries in Figure 3C. For countries low in both resource rents and strategic importance, even (relatively) small increases in aid reduce infant mortality after civil war, while for other countries, three times as much aid fails to help.31"
"41","It is possible that the results are an artifact of the endogeneity of aid. If the causal arrows are reversed, the potential reductions or increases in infant mortality attract aid flows. To address the endogeneity problem, aid in the regressions above temporally precedes the change in development because this staggering allows us to analyze aid decisions made by donors prior to realized changes in infant mortality. However, because donors may be able to predict changes in infant mortality as they make disbursement decisions (de Ree and Nillesen 2009; Savun and Tirone 2011), an additional robustness check is useful.         "
"42","Therefore, a two‐stage least squares model is considered in Table SI‐13 for aid recipients with low resource rents and low strategic importance (Table SI‐13, Models 1 and 2), and for aid recipients with either high resource rents or high strategic importance (Table SI‐13, Models 3 and 4). In the first stage (Table SI‐13, Models 1 and 3), the instrumental variable produces an estimate of aid that should be independent of donor motivations to support certain aid recipients. The predicted values are used to estimate the effect of aid on the percent change in infant mortality in the second stage (Table SI‐13, Models 2 and 4)."
"43","The analysis introduces natural disasters within a donor as an instrument, measured as population affected due to donor country natural disasters in the five years preceding ceasefire.32 Natural disasters within a donor country is included because donor governments should be less willing to disburse aid while rehabilitating their own countries.33 The instrument satisfies the exclusion restriction because the instrument is not plausibly related to infant mortality changes in postconflict countries except through its influence on aid. The 1989 earthquake in San Francisco, for example, is unlikely to affect infant mortality rates in Mozambique, except through the earthquake's effect on aid disbursed to Mozambique. In both first‐stage regressions, natural disasters within donors have a negative and statistically significant effect on aid flows (Table SI‐13, Models 1 and 3).34 Consistent with the nonstrategic‐desperation hypothesis, increases in aid (adjusted for natural disasters) in donors only reduce infant mortality when strategic importance and resource rents are both low (Table SI‐13, Model 2), not when either strategic importance or resource rents are high (Table SI‐13, Model 4).         "
"44","Combined, these findings support the hypothesis that aid fosters development following civil war only when recipients have both low resource rents and low strategic importance because these recipients face incentives to meet aid agreements. This hypothesis is supported in the raw data and is robust to outlier exclusion; fixed effects by donor, region, or decade; alternative measures of the development, aid, resources, and strategic importance; and endogeneity of aid.35"
"45","The puzzling examples of aid fostering development following civil war require explanation. The broader aid literature tends to find that, if aid works at all, aid works when recipient institutions are strong, because strong institutions pressure aid recipients by creating incentives to promote development. But a model is needed to explain development in the absence of strong institutions following civil war. Results reveal that recipient income sources provide incentives—and disincentives—for promoting postwar development."
"46","Following civil war, aid recipients lack incentives to reach development goals when the recipient does not really need the money (high rents) or when aid is contingent on donor strategic interests more than on development goals (high strategic importance). Just as resource rents represent income without strings attached, aid is largely fungible, so recipients can spend aid on defense and on maintaining patronage networks instead of spending on development to benefit the general population (Feyzioglu, Swaroop, and Zhu 1998). All leaders seek to finance their own protection after civil war, but income sources constrain choices, particularly choices to spend on development. While the aid curse and the resource curse literatures tell us when countries fail to develop, they do not point to conditions that promote development following civil war."
"47","According to the nonstrategic‐desperation hypothesis, only postconflict aid recipients with low resource rents and low strategic importance have the incentives to meet postconflict donor development goals—because the survival of the recipient government is contingent upon continued aid flows. The findings presented here empirically demonstrate that increases in aid increase development following civil war only in cases where resource rents and strategic importance are both low. A $10 per capita increase in aid to recipients with low rents and low strategic importance reduces infant mortality by 2%, while the same increase to recipients with high rents or high strategic importance decreases infant mortality by no more than 0.1% at best, and may actually increase infant mortality."
"48","These findings have important policy implications for donors. Current policy thinking often holds that “more is better” after civil war. This is not the case. Selectivity is important to meeting donor development goals. Donors seeking to promote development after civil war cannot reasonably expect to succeed in strategically important or resource‐rich countries because recipient incentives are not compatible with meeting donor development objectives."
"49","Discipline in enforcing agreements is also important to meeting donor development goals. Buchanan cautions that, to follow through on threats to cut off charity, “the samaritan will, in actuality, suffer disutility which may be severe” (1975, 76). To overcome the Samaritan's Dilemma, donors can cut off aid when misused by the recipient (Buchanan 1975, 80; Schmidtchen 1999) while refining and enhancing aid delivery. In these cases, donors may improve development outcomes by reducing budget support while seeking other modalities for delivery of aid, such as increasing direct control over line ministries or by increasing reliance on local community‐based groups (World Bank 2011). This presents an open empirical question. Historically, however, aid only appears to be a suitable tool to promote development after civil war in the subset of resource‐poor countries that are accountable to donors primarily interested in development, where, paradoxically, donors have the least at stake.
