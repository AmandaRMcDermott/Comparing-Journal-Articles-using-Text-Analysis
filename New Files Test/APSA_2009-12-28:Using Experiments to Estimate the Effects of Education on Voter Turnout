"1","The logic underlying randomized experiments (and research designs that attempt to approximate randomized clinical trials) is often explicated in terms of a notational system that has its origins in the work of Neyman ([1923] 1990) and is sometimes termed the “Rubin Causal Model” after Rubin (1978, 1990). The advantage of this notational system lies in the fact that it illuminates the core assumptions on which causal inference depends, regardless of whether inferences are to be drawn from experimental or observational data. Using the logic of the Rubin Causal Model to explicate what Green and Gerber (2002) have termed “downstream experimentation,” we show how experiments designed to increase educational attainment can reveal the effects of educational attainment on voter turnout.         "
"2"," Definitions. The model consists of three variables. For each individual i, let Zi = 1 refer to assignment to the treatment group, and let Zi = 0 refer to assignment to the control group. Let Z be the N‐dimensional vector of random assignments with elements Zi, and let Xi(Z) denote whether an individual i graduates from high school given the random vector of treatment assignments Z. If everyone assigned to the treatment group graduates and no one from the control group graduates, Xi(Z) would equal Zi for all i. Of course, that situation is unlikely in practice because many factors beyond treatment assignment affect educational attainment.         "
"3","Just as Xi(Z) represents the potential educational outcomes associated with a set of experimental assignments, Yi(Z, X) is defined as the potential electoral participation of an individual to a vector of random assignments and educational outcomes. By imposing what is termed the “stable unit treatment value assumption” (Rubin 1978), which holds that the potential outcomes for a given person are unrelated to the treatment status of other individuals, we may write Xi(Z) as Xi(Zi) and Yi(Z, X) as Yi(Zi, Xi). Substantively, this assumption implies that the treatment of one child had no effect on the outcomes of other children, which seems plausible in our application, particularly since voting by individual i is unlikely to have been affected by the educational attainment or treatment assignment of individual j.         "
"4","For individual i, the causal effect of treatment assignment on high school graduation is Xi(Zi = 1) − Xi(Zi = 0). A basic assumption in the analysis that follows is that the expected value of this effect across the N observations is nonzero. This assumption makes intuitive sense: in order to estimate the downstream effects of a random intervention, the intervention itself must have an effect on graduation rates. We further assume what Imbens and Angrist (1994) term “monotonicity”: Xi(Zi = 1) ≥ Xi(Zi = 0) for all i, which means being assigned to the experimental treatment makes each individual more likely to graduate. In the applications described below, it is hard to imagine preschool, small classes, or college scholarships diminishing a subject's propensity to graduate from high school.         "
"5","The causal effect of primary interest is the influence of high school graduation on voter turnout. The key assumption on which the identification of this causal parameter rests is the exclusion restriction, the stipulation that the potential voting outcome is a function of graduation rates alone, and that once one takes graduation rates into account, treatment assignment exerts no direct influence on voting (i.e., Y(Z, X) =Y(X)). Substantively, this assumption means that voting is affected not by the program that induced additional schooling but rather by the schooling itself and enables us to write the causal effect of X on Y as Yi(Xi = 1) − Yi(Xi = 0). In other words, the causal effect of education on turnout is the difference between two states of the world, one in which the individual graduates and another in which he or she does not.         "
"6","When assessing the validity of this exclusion restriction, one should keep in mind that X may be a coarse proxy for educational attainment. Whether one graduates from high school is a less discriminating measure than whether one graduates from high school, college, or neither. And the highest degree obtained is a less refined measure of educational attainment than subject tests that gauge the breadth and depth of one's schooling. It should be stressed, however, that the particular X one chooses to employ in an empirical analysis primarily serves as a scaling device, so that the causal effect can be interpreted based on the units that characterize X (e.g., “This is the effect of graduating from high school.”). The instrumental variables estimator described below provides consistent estimates of causal effects even when X is measured coarsely. In effect, the exclusion restriction says that the program to which people were randomly assigned (Z) has no direct effect on voting net of one's latent level of educational attainment, for which X is a proxy."
"7","A related issue is how to regard factors such as interest in politics, which may be related to educational attainment. If interest in politics is caused by educational attainment, the model presented above will correctly recover the “total” effect of X, including the causal influence that is transmitted through interest in politics and other mediating factors. The model breaks down if political interest causes voting and the randomly assigned program Z influences interest in politics directly, not via the mediating variable of educational attainment. In this instance, our causal inference about the effects of education would be biased, as part of what we are attributing to education is really due to political interest. When reading the descriptions of the experimental interventions below, one should reflect on whether it is plausible to think that their effects were transmitted through channels other than educational attainment."
"8","Suppose that one wanted to remain as agnostic as possible about the mechanisms through which these interventions influenced outcomes. One could simply focus on the so‐called intent‐to‐treat effects, the difference between Yi(Zi = 1) and Yi(Zi = 0). As noted below, the instrumental variables estimator is simply this quantity divided by Xi(Zi = 1) − Xi(Zi = 0). In effect, the IV estimator takes the intent‐to‐treat effect and rescales it by the differences in educational attainment for the treatment and control groups.1 Ultimately, the causal inferences we draw may be traced to the intent‐to‐treat relationship, that is, the relationship between randomly assigned treatment groups and voting rates.         "
"9"," Estimation. It is impossible to observe causal effects directly, because we do not see a given person simultaneously in his or her treated and untreated states. In order to estimate causal effects, we use the fact that random assignment generates groups whose expected responses to treated and untreated states are the same. Under random assignment, the expected outcome for the untreated control group is the expected outcome that would have been obtained by the treatment group had it gone untreated; conversely, had the control group been treated, its expected outcome would be the same as the expected outcome of the (treated) treatment group.         "
"10","In our application, the parameter of interest is what is often termed a “local average treatment effect.” Here the local average treatment effect is the causal effect of high school graduation for the subset of individuals whom Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) call “compliers”—those who graduate from high school if and only if assigned to the treatment group. Just who the compliers are will depend on what the random treatment is. Thus, estimation of a local average treatment effect inevitably raises questions of external validity, because there is no guarantee that treatment effects will be the same across different populations of compliers. That is why we sought out an array of different experiments. The fact that we obtain similar results across these experiments suggests that the local average treatment effect has greater generality than might be suggested by the modifier “local.”         "
"11"," Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) prove that under the five assumptions discussed above (random assignment, stable unit treatment value, monotonicity, nonzero causal effect of Z on X, and no effect of Z on Y net of X), instrumental variables (IV) regression is a consistent estimator of the local average treatment effect of X on Y, even when X is thought to be related to unobserved causes of Y. Note that this property is what sets apart the instrumental variables approach used here from more conventional regression approaches. Ordinary least squares (OLS) will be inconsistent when educational attainment is correlated with unobserved factors, such as intelligence. Instrumental variables regression leverages random assignment to produce consistent estimates even in the presence of confounders.         "
"12","The instrumental variables estimator suggested by Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) has a very simple mathematical form, which allows for transparent presentation of results. The estimator is the ratio of two regression coefficients: the estimated effect of Z on Y (in path‐analytic terms, the “total effect” of random assignment on voting) over the estimated effect of Z on X (the apparent effect of random assignment on schooling). In the sections that follow we preview the statistical results by presenting these two simple quantities.         "
"13"," Bivariate probit. Our parameter of interest is the effect of high school graduation on voter turnout, and we seek to estimate it while allowing for the possibility that high school graduation is correlated with unobserved causes of turnout. As noted above, the proper approach involves the logic of instrumental variables, whereby random assignment (or near‐random assignment) serves as an instrumental variable predicting graduation rates. In our application, a complication arises because high school graduation and voting are both dichotomous variables, and linear models do not confine predicted probabilities of voting to the [0,1] interval. We therefore depart from the nonparametric framework of the Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) model and turn to a nonlinear estimation approach, bivariate probit (Wooldridge 2002), which has been shown to perform well in Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications involving dichotomous treatments and outcomes (Terza, Bradford, and Dismuke 2008), particularly when the analysis focuses solely on Yi, Xi, and Zi, and excludes covariates (Angrist 2001).         "
"14","The two‐equation system in our analysis includes an equation for voter turnout (Yi) and an equation for high school graduation (Xi). The model specifies a linear model of the latent propensity to vote () and to graduate () as functions of the realized outcomes of high school graduation (Xi) and random assignment (Zi).            "
"15","The main parameter of interest in the bivariate probit model is β1, the effect—in probits, or standard deviations in a standard normal distribution—of high school graduation on voter turnout. Expressed in terms of percentage‐point changes, the local average treatment effect of high school graduation on voting is calculated as , where Φ (·) refers to the cumulative normal distribution function, and  and  are maximum likelihood estimates calculated using STATA statistical software.         "
"16","In an effort to measure the downstream effects of education on voter turnout, we searched the education literature for randomized interventions that generated significant increases in schooling. The pool of extant experiments proved to be surprisingly small. As Boruch, De Moya, and Snyder (2002) point out, only 10% of the research projects funded by the Department of Education's Planning and Evaluation Services involved any form of randomized field trials, and of the 1,200 articles printed in the American Educational Research Journal since its inception in 1964, just 35 used randomized designs to study curriculum interventions. After narrowing the candidate list of experiments to those for which data were available, we were left with two randomized studies, the Perry Preschool Experiment and the Tennessee STAR experiment. We were unable to obtain data from existing quasi‐experimental studies of the “I Have a Dream” (IHAD) scholarship program, but we were able to gain the cooperation of one IHAD site, which assisted us in the collection of data on its students. This section describes the three programs and provides preliminary evidence of their causal effects.         "
"17","The High/Scope Perry Preschool program is a longitudinal evaluation of the effects of intensive preschool on graduation from high school and future life outcomes. The Perry program is widely cited as a model evaluation both for its methodology and its lasting effects on low‐income youth (Barnett 1985). The experiment's central hypothesis is that “good preschool programs can help children in poverty make a better start in their transition from home to community and thereby set more of them on paths to becoming economically self‐sufficient, socially responsible adults” (Schweinhart, Barnes, and Weikart 1993, 3).            "
"18","The study drew its participants from preschool‐age children who were expected to attend Perry Elementary School in Ypsilanti. Because the program's broader aim was fighting poverty, the subject population was drawn from a low‐income subgroup of this residential area. Researchers first identified families of low socioeconomic status using a score based on three factors: parents' educational levels, parents' occupational levels, and the number of rooms in the family household.2 Within this group of low SES families, researchers then sought to identify young children with relatively low levels of intelligence.            "
"19","Before randomly assigning the experimental groups, researchers matched students into pairs based on IQ scores from the Stanford‐Binet test.3 A member of each pair was randomly assigned into one of two unmarked groups. Next, some of these ranked pairs were swapped between groups so that both groups would have similar mean socioeconomic status, mean intellectual performance, and gender ratios. A coin flip determined which of these two groups was assigned to the program (treatment) condition and which to the no‐program (control) condition. Finally, researchers moved siblings of those students chosen for the treatment condition into this condition as well so as to eliminate spillover effects from the intervention. At the outset, 64 students were each assigned to the treatment and control groups. However, two students were subsequently moved from the treatment to control because their single mothers were employed outside of the home and thus unable to participate in the home visits and classes necessary for the treatment regimen. For purposes of analysis, we consider these two children as members of the treatment group, as placed during their original random assignment.4 In all, 100 families participated in the study, 47 in the treatment cohort and 53 in the control cohort. Four students moved away during the preschool intervention, and one other passed away shortly into the program. Thus the Schweinhart analysis focuses on the remaining 123 students who either received the preschool treatment or would have received the treatment had they been selected for the experimental cohort. The final numbers of the Schweinhart sample are 58 students in the treatment group (33 males and 25 females) and 65 students in the control group (39 males and 26 females). All subjects are African American.5"
"20","Students entered the study in five waves based on their ages beginning in 1962. Four of the waves received two years of preschool at ages 3 and 4, but the first wave received only one year of preschool because it began the program at age 4. The preschool treatment consisted of 2.5 hours in the classroom on weekday mornings as well as a weekly 90‐minute teacher visit to the mother and student at the family's place of residence during a weekday afternoon. The program began in mid‐October and lasted through May of each year. The curriculum was designed based on the ideas of Jean Piaget in that teachers emphasized “active learning” and students were encouraged to plan, carry out, and finally review the activities given to them. There was a focus on “open‐ended questions” in an effort to engage students in conversations both with adults and other students. Teachers also attempted to maintain a daily routine that promoted responsibility and independence. Following the preschool intervention, subjects entered kindergarten as scheduled by local school regulations based on date of birth. No further treatment occurred after the conclusion of the initial intervention."
"21"," Outcome measures. The principal investigators of the Perry study shared with us follow‐up data on the high school graduation status of 121 of 123 subjects for whom they have longitudinal information. Voter turnout data were gathered from public records, using data supplied by the firm Voter Contact Services, based on each participant's name, address, and birthday.6 Twenty of the original 123 subjects now live outside of Michigan in 11 different states and the District of Columbia. Ninety‐six subjects still live in Michigan, and seven are deceased.            "
"22"," Table 2 presents an overview of the Perry results. The randomly assigned groups, as noted above, had different educational outcomes. High school graduation rates were 44.4% in the control group and 65.0% in the treatment group. Consistent with the hypothesis that schooling exerts a causal influence on electoral participation, voter turnout was higher in the treatment group (18%) than the control group (13%).            "
"23","The “I Have a Dream” (IHAD) program is a comprehensive scholarship program aimed at increasing high school graduation and postsecondary matriculation rates of at‐risk youth. While IHAD began as a means of financing college education for low‐income students, it has since evolved into a wide‐ranging program, which in the words of one sponsor, “aims to provide a middle class experience” for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In addition to the promise of college scholarships, students in the program receive tutoring in various academic subjects, work with mentors on establishing and achieving educational and career‐oriented goals, and participate in extracurricular activities together from the time of their initial selection in elementary school through high school and sometimes beyond."
"24","This study focuses on a particular intervention conducted by the “I Have a Dream” Foundation of Boulder County in Colorado. At the outset of this project, the national IHAD foundation mailed a letter concerning our research to all IHAD programs that had students in tenth grade or older. The Boulder project distinguished itself from the group of interested program sites for two reasons. Their foundation was in the beginning stages of an independently undertaken project to update contact information for their participants. Second, due to its relationship with the University of Colorado, the Boulder Valley School District has a history of being amenable to educational evaluations of its students."
"25","In 1992, enrollment in IHAD was offered to and accepted by all 79 fifth‐grade students in Lafayette, Colorado, who qualified for the free or reduced lunch program at three elementary schools. Drawing upon the extensive quasi‐experimental literature evaluating IHAD's effects (Aron and Barnow 1994; Higgins et al. 1991; Kahne and Bailey 1999; Kuboyama 2000; McGrath and Hayman 1998; Shoemaker and Sims 1997; Strusinski 1997), we formed a control group consisting of those students on free or reduced lunch at the same schools but attending fourth or sixth grade in 1992. This design creates treatment and control cohorts with the similar ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic backgrounds. In contrast to the Perry study, approximately two‐thirds of the students are non‐Hispanic whites, and fewer than 5% are African Americans.            "
"26","Members of the treatment and control cohorts were contacted via a telephone survey. In order to maintain confidentiality, the school district provided names and contact information to IHAD, which coordinated the interviews.7 It should be stressed that exactly the same district‐supplied contact information was used to track the treatment and control cohorts. In order to identify which students had participated in free or reduced lunch programs as elementary students, the survey asked respondents to reminisce about their elementary and high school experiences in the Boulder Valley. Respondents were asked about their clubs and after‐school activities as well as their memories of their school lunch experiences. They were asked various questions including whether they brought their lunches from home or purchased them at school, with whom they sat at lunch, as well as whether or not they remember participating in the free and reduced lunch program. Respondents who recalled participating in the lunch program were then asked if they would be willing to participate in a follow‐up survey. This filter is intended to produce similar sampling biases for both the treatment and comparison cohorts.            "
"27","Using this methodology, our research team administered the initial survey to 246 individuals, 58 of whom acknowledged participation in the free and reduced lunch program and were willing to take the in‐depth survey.8 Given that the study comprises two sets of control group respondents (who attended fifth grade during the year preceding and following the IHAD cohort), we should expect twice as many subjects in the control versus experimental cohort. The survey numbers bear this out as 32.8% or 19 of the 58 respondents who recall participation in the free and reduced lunch program also acknowledged participation in IHAD.            "
"28","Although an earlier IHAD survey included questions concerning civic and political participation, we opted to gather verified information on turnout from registration rolls rather than rely on self‐reports and the biases they may introduce (Bernstein, Chadha, and Montjoy 2001; Brady 1999; Hyman 1944; Silver, Anderson, and Abramson 1986).9"
"29"," Table 3 reports the results of the IHAD intervention on graduation and voting rates. Consistent with previous evaluations of IHAD programs, our data show that IHAD increased the graduation rate from 61.5% to 79.0%. The IHAD intervention is also associated with increased voting rates. Voting records indicate that 42% of those receiving the IHAD treatment cast ballots, as compared to 33% of the control group.            "
"30","In 1985, the Tennessee state legislature allocated $12 million in funding over four years to statewide research concerning the effects of class size reduction on educational outcomes. The Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) experiment sought to test the effects of small classes on students in kindergarten through third grade. The study (described in detail by Achilles 1999; Word et al. 1990) represents the largest randomized experiment to test the effects of small classes on student achievement in the United States. In contrast to the Perry and IHAD studies, STAR subjects were drawn from a broad socioeconomic spectrum, with African Americans comprising approximately one‐third of the sample (Krueger 1999; Krueger and Whitmore 2001; Mosteller 1999).10 Close to half of the subjects were eligible for free or reduced lunch (Nye, Hedges, and Konstantopoulos 1999).            "
"31","Students and their teachers were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: small classes of 13–17 students, regular classes with 22–25 students, and regular classes with a full‐time teacher's aide.11 Once assigned to a particular type of classroom condition, students ostensibly remained in those conditions through the remainder of the experiment. Critics such as Hanushek (1999a, 1999b) have pointed out that approximately 108 of the 6,505 participants in the STAR database moved between experimental groups after kindergarten, apparently due to lobbying by parents seeking smaller classes. For this reason, we restrict our attention to 1,576 kindergarteners in the subset of 18 schools for which the original random assignment information is available.12 In keeping with the principle of maintaining the integrity of the original random assignments, we ignore which treatments students actually received and use only the randomly assigned class size as an instrumental variable.            "
"32"," Outcome measures. The STAR intervention lasted until fourth grade, whereupon students entered regularly sized classes. Kindergarteners who participated in Project STAR were expected to graduate from high school in 1998. Follow‐up studies indicate that subjects assigned to attend small classes subsequently exhibited higher levels of academic performance (Finn and Achilles 1999; Krueger 1999) and higher rates of high school graduation in comparison to subjects in regular‐size classes (Finn, Gerber, and Boyd‐Zaharias 2005). Subjects assigned to small classes were also more likely to have taken college entrance exams, specifically the SAT or ACT, although there were no significant differences in these scores (Krueger and Whitmore 2001).            "
"33","In the data available to us, the only long‐term measure of educational attainment is graduation from high school. A subject is coded as a one if records indicate that she graduated and zero otherwise.13 Unfortunately, due to STAR researchers' budget constraints, this follow‐up information was gathered for approximately 40% of the observations in the study (Pate‐Bain, Fulton, and Boyd‐Zaharias 1999). Restricting analysis to those for whom we have both the original kindergarten assignment and high school graduation data reduces the N to 811.14 Fortunately, the analysis presented below shows the results to be robust across different sample definitions: all STAR data with known random assignments and the subset with nonmissing graduation data.            "
"34","The Project STAR database contains no data on voter participation. We contracted with the firm Polimetrix, an independent polling firm that maintained a compilation of all state voter files, to determine voter registration and turnout. Polimetrix matched the names and birth dates of the Project STAR subjects to their national list of registered voters. Our information, however, was sometimes insufficient to generate a unique match. To differentiate among multiple matches, the search process also considered the locations to which subjects were likely to move. For example, individuals born in Tennessee have a higher probability of moving to Kentucky or Missouri than to Connecticut or North Dakota. Using this information, and blind to the treatment or control status of the subjects, Polimetrix searched for each subject in their national voter database and compiled a list of likely matches. A hit was determined by name, date of birth, and state of residence, in that order, and assigned a score indicating the likelihood of a correct match."
"35","Before taking the scores into account, this process found at least one hit for 1,455 out of the 1,576 subjects in our dataset.15 There was at least one hit for each of the 811 subjects for whom we have high school graduation data. Using this list of hits, we construct the voter turnout variable matching the most likely individual out of the possible hits. We also create a more restrictive voter turnout variable requiring that each individual meets a minimum match score.            "
"36","The turnout variable is coded one for individuals who voted in any one of the following elections: the 2000 primary, the 2000 general, the 2002 primary, or the 2002 general election. The broad turnout variable is coded as a zero for subjects whose best hit did not vote in any of the aforementioned elections. The restricted turnout variable constrains hits to a minimum level match such that any subject whose best hit is below a particular threshold (indicating an unlikely match according to Polimetrix programmers) is considered to be unregistered and thus a nonvoter."
"37"," Table 4 shows the relationship between random assignment and education and voting outcomes. The right‐hand panel of Table 4 compares graduation rates among those subjects for whom data are available. Students randomly assigned to the treatment group graduated at a rate of 90.1%, as compared to 85.0% among those in the control group. Regardless of whether we restrict our attention to students with graduation data or examine the entire sample, and regardless of whether we use lax or restrictive criteria for determining whether a name was matched to the voter file, we find higher voting rates among the treatment group than the control group. Evidently, random or near‐random inducements that increase educational attainment also increase voter turnout rates. The next section estimates the magnitude and statistical significance of this relationship.            "
"38","From Tables 2, 3, and 4, we know that the intent‐to‐treat effects are found to be positive in all three studies. We also know that the treatment group in each study had a higher graduation rate than its control group counterpart. The task remaining is to put these two pieces of information together, using bivariate probit to estimate the causal effect of graduating from high school and the statistical uncertainty associated with this estimate.         "
"39"," Table 5 reports the results of bivariate probit regressions applied to each dataset. The estimates of most interest are those in the middle of the table, indicating the local average treatment effect of high school graduation on voter turnout.16 In all three datasets, this coefficient is positive and large, although it achieves statistical significance only in the STAR study. High school graduation increases turnout by 1.1 probits in the Perry dataset, 1.1 probits in the IHAD dataset, and 1.9 probits in the STAR dataset. To put these figures into perspective, bear in mind that one probit is the equivalent of moving one standard deviation in a normal distribution; e.g., moving from a 50% probability of voting to an 84% probability. Not surprisingly given the small sample sizes involved, each estimate is associated with a fair amount of sampling variability. Since none of the estimates is significantly different from one another,17 it makes sense to pool the results together.         "
"40","In order to calculate the pooled estimate, we follow standard meta‐analytic practice and computed a precision‐weighted average, that is, an average in which each estimate is weighted by the inverse of its squared standard error.18 The resulting estimate is 1.40 with a standard error of 0.54, which implies a z‐ratio of 2.59 (p = .005). Translated into percentage point terms, this probit estimate indicates that a high school dropout with a 15.6% chance of voting would have a 65.2% chance of turnout if randomly induced to graduate from high school. A 90% confidence interval surrounding the estimate of 1.4 ranges from .51 to 2.29. Even the low end of this interval still suggests an important effect: again translating into percentage terms, a high school dropout with a 15.6% chance of voting would have a 30.9% chance of voting if randomly induced to graduate from high school.         "
"41","Naturally, this estimate is subject to the usual caveats about local average treatment effects estimated from special populations. We do not know the effect of education among those who could not be induced to graduate as a function of the three interventions, nor can we be certain that the three studies' subjects are as responsive to educational attainment as the general population in the United States or other times or places. It may well be the case that the low SES students who make up the bulk of these experimental samples are especially responsive to exogenous interventions that lead to higher graduation rates. Nevertheless, one can still be impressed by the sheer magnitude of the effect we observe in all three studies and the fact that the pattern of results looks similar across three demographically distinct sets of subjects."
"42","Prior to undertaking this project, the authors expressed skepticism about the causal claim that education increases voter turnout (Green 2005; Sondheimer 2006). The data presented here have led to a reversal of this assessment. Although each of the three studies is small and idiosyncratic, the pattern of evidence is convincing. Under the null hypothesis of no causal effect, the joint probability of obtaining three bivariate probit coefficients as large as the ones we observe is small. More work remains to be done, as the downstream consequences of recent randomized interventions such as school choice (Hastings, Kane, and Staiger 2005) remain to be investigated. The experimental evidence at hand, however, indicates that educational attainment profoundly affects voter turnout.         "
"43","It is tempting but mistaken to dismiss these findings as merely confirming what scholars have long known about education's effects. As Gerber, Green, and Kaplan (2004) point out, observational findings confront two sources of uncertainty: sampling error, which diminishes as the number of studies and observations mounts, and specification error, which persists so long as the biases associated with observational research designs remain unclear. The accumulation of hundreds of observational studies has reduced sampling uncertainty to a quantity very close to zero. Yet model uncertainty has remained considerable, leading scholars to wonder whether what if any part of the observed correlation is causal. The experimental and quasi‐experimental studies reported here represent an important turning point in a literature that has for decades found itself mired in uncertainty about whether to attach a causal interpretation to the correlation between education and political participation. The results suggest that the true causal relationship is profound and warrants renewed theoretical discussion on schooling and democratic citizenship and empirical investigation into possible causal linkages.         "
"44","By what mechanism does education induce higher rates of voting? The extensive literature on education and turnout has proposed several possible mediating factors.19 One hypothesis is that education imparts the skills to negotiate bureaucratic hurdles associated with voting (Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980). This argument is sometimes adduced to explain why education is less influential in countries such as Britain, where voter registration is automatic (Milligan, Moretti, and Oreopoulos 2004), but it runs into a number of empirical problems. One finds a steep education gradient in voting even in states such as North Dakota, where there is no voter registration, or in states where voters can register on Election Day (Middleton 2007). Conversely, one finds no diminution in the relationship between education and turnout over time, despite the easing of registration requirements. Our experimental datasets provide tentative support for the bureaucratic competence hypothesis. Registration was measured in both the Perry and IHAD studies, and in both cases the assigned treatment group registered at higher rates than the assigned control group (22.9% vs. 17.0% for Perry; 42.1% vs. 41.0% for IHAD), although the results fall well short of statistical significance.         "
"45","A second possibility is that education increases one's general interest in and knowledge of politics (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Hyman, Wright, and Reed 1975). Further analysis of the IHAD data provides evidence of a causal relationship between education and political interest. Subjects in the IHAD treatment group scored approximately 1.3 points higher on average than the control group on a 0–7 point index measuring political interest. This interest in politics dovetails with findings concerning the independent relationship between education and internal political efficacy, an individual's belief in her own ability to participate in politics (Sondheimer 2006). Perhaps, then, schooling cultivates a sense of citizenship and efficacy that promotes political involvement, a proposition that demands much more attention from experimental researchers.         "
"46","Third, it is possible that increased educational attainment expands one's social network and thus likelihood of participating in community and political endeavors. Educated individuals are more likely to have politically involved people in their network of friends and coworkers and are also more likely to receive attention from political campaigns (Rolfe 2004). Thus, education may set in motion not only changes in outlook but also changes in the way that one is engaged by one's social and political environment. Again, surveys of the Perry and IHAD subjects provide some suggestive evidence in favor of this hypothesis, as treatment subjects were more likely to report belonging to community organizations (34.6% vs. 33.9% for Perry; 52.6% vs. 31.6% for IHAD).         "
"47","These three explanations by no means exhaust the list of potential causal pathways connecting educational attainment to voting. Other possibilities include voters' increased sense of efficacy (Abramson and Aldrich 1982) or strength of partisan attachment (Shaffer 1981) or simply education‐induced affluence and accompanying economic interests (Doherty, Gerber, and Green 2006; Sears and Citrin 1982). In sum, the list of potential mediators is long, and the fact that these mediators may be correlated with unobserved causes of voting and with one another makes the empirical task of explaining the relationship between education and turnout particularly daunting (Judd and Kenny 1981).         "
"48","The challenge for researchers seeking to assess systematically the mediating role of each of the complementary explanations is to devise experiments (or uncover natural experiments) in which the intervention targets a single pathway. For example, if education increases voting by expanding the range of one's social network, the content of education is largely irrelevant; an intervention that increases educational attainment through an enhanced science or performing arts curricula would be expected to increase turnout. Conversely, if education increases turnout by imparting civic knowledge and political interest, the random assignment of civics coursework should increase political participation. And if education transmits its influence by making people more affluent, randomly assigned transfer programs alone should increase turnout."
"49","One aim of this article is to set in motion a line of research that begins by using experiments to identify the effects of education and then employs ever more refined experimental designs in order to answer questions about causal pathways. Another aim is to use experiments in order to determine which, if any, macrolevel trends stand in need of explanation. Based on our experimental results, it appears that the anomaly that Brody (1978) identified is real. If schooling indeed generates higher rates of electoral participation, why have turnout rates fallen since the nineteenth century, and why have they not increased since the 1960s? A full treatment of this question clearly goes beyond the scope of this article, but the leading hypotheses fall into two interrelated categories, environmental factors and changes in voters' attributes. Environmental factors include institutional changes and trends in the way that campaigns interact with voters. The institutional changes by and large have encouraged participation by eliminating poll taxes, easing registration requirements, and extending the length of time that voters may cast ballots. On the other hand, the decline in the number and vitality of civic organizations coupled with the political parties' increasing reliance on mass media and other impersonal campaign tactics have arguably diminished voters' level of civic engagement and voter turnout (Putnam 2000). Although countries outside the United States tend not to have its web of nonparty political organizations, there is growing evidence that implicates increasingly centralized and media‐centered campaigns in the apparent trend toward lower turnout observed comparatively (Smith 2006).         "
"50","In light of the findings presented here, hypotheses about turnout‐depressing trends at the macropolitical level warrant renewed attention. Efforts to link aggregate trends in voter turnout to corresponding trends in voters' sense of efficacy or partisan attachment (Abramson and Aldrich 1982; Cassel and Luskin 1988) have stalled in the wake of methodological disputes about the microlevel causal relationship between these variables and voter turnout. That dispute is not unlike the methodological deadlock that has long beset the analysis of education and voter turnout, and the way forward is arguably the same. In order to ascertain whether variables such as political efficacy or organizational involvement influence turnout, we must obtain experimental or near‐experimental data in which these factors are changed exogenously through some type of intervention. And in order to ascertain whether education influences efficacy or involvement, we must continue to investigate the consequences of exogenous changes to educational attainment.         "
