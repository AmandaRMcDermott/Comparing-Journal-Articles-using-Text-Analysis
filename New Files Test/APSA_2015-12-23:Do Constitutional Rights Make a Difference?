"1","There is long‐standing skepticism about whether constitutional bills of rights make a difference in practice. This skepticism traces back at least to James Madison, who famously postulated that constitutional rights in the United States would constitute mere “parchment barriers.” Madison's skepticism is not without cause. As an empirical matter, countries have notoriously unreliable records of upholding their own constitutional rights commitments (Keith, 2012, 194; Law and Versteeg 2013).         "
"2","In this article, we take up the question that has troubled constitution writers since James Madison: Do constitutional rights actually improve respect for rights in practice, or are they mere parchment barriers? We theorize that not all rights are equally effective. Specifically, we suggest that rights that establish organizations that can act strategically to protect a given right (most notably, the right to form political parties and the right to unionize) are more likely to be effective than those rights that are typically practiced on an individual basis only (e.g., the freedom of expression and the freedom of movement). The distinctive feature of organizational rights is that they do not merely represent a substantive policy preference for a particular right, but they also aid the establishment of organizations that have the incentives to safeguard the right, as well as the means to act strategically to protect it from government repression. To illustrate, government encroachments on the rights to form political parties and to unionize can be countered by political parties’ and trade unions’ political mobilization to safeguard those rights, thereby rendering them self‐enforcing."
"3","Our empirical analysis explores the impact of six political rights—that is, rights that empower individuals to take actions that allow them to partake in the civil and political life of the state. We specifically focus on (1) the right to form political parties, (2) the right to unionize (3) the freedom of association, (4) the freedom of religion, (5) the freedom of expression, and (6) the freedom of movement. To estimate the causal relationship between these six de jure constitutional rights and the de facto protection of the same rights, we use matching and postmatching regression analysis. We also explore whether our results are robust to a range of alternative estimation strategies—including using a variation of an identification strategy that was recently developed to test the effectiveness of human rights treaties (Lupu 2013a, 2013b, 2015), regressions designed to avoid the possibility of posttreatment bias, and a series of alternative matching and regression models.         "
"4","The results support our theory. We find that certain constitutional rights are surprisingly effective: The rights to establish political parties and to unionize have a robust and statistically significant positive impact on government respect for these rights. By contrast, adoption of the two individual rights—the freedom of movement and the freedom of expression—does not improve government respect for those rights. We also find less robust evidence that the freedoms of association and religion positively impact government respect for those rights. We posit that these two rights fall into an intermediate category of rights that are neither purely organizational nor fully individual. Taken together, our findings suggest that where rights facilitate the establishment of organizations with the incentives and means to protect their own interests, they can become self‐enforcing."
"5","Several previous studies have explored the relationship between de jure constitutional rights protections and de facto respect for these rights (Boli‐Bennet 1976; Cross 1999; Davenport 1996; Fox and Flores 2009; Keith 2002, 2012; Keith, Tate, and Poe 2009; Melton 2014; Pritchard 1986). Most of those studies, however, have several common limitations. First, most of the earlier studies are based on small samples, often only a cross‐section of countries (Cross 1999; Davenport 1996; Pritchard 1986). Second, almost all of the existing studies consider the effect of constitutional rights on aggregate indicators of government repression (Davenport 1996; Keith 2002; Keith, Tate, and Poe 2009; Pritchard 1986). Third, most existing studies do not adequately address the fact that constitutional rights are not randomly assigned, which poses a threat to valid causal inference. The two studies that address selection issues and do not merely use aggregate indicators of government repression produce findings different from our own. Melton (2014) finds no aggregate effect of six constitutional rights provisions, but finds that some rights matter when enforced by an independent judiciary. Keith (2012) finds an aggregate effect of the freedom of expression and some nonrobust evidence of the freedoms of association and religion. Notably, neither of these studies focuses on the difference between individual and organizational rights. As a result, a great deal remains unknown about whether constitutional rights make a difference in practice.         "
"6","While our knowledge on the effectiveness of constitutional rights is still limited, two recent insights from the literature on government repression suggest that constitutional rights protections could be particularly important in reducing government repression. First, while this literature has consistently found that democracy reduces government violence (e.g., Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2005; Davenport 1999; Gartner and Regan 1996; Hafner‐Burton, Hyde, and Jablonski 2014; Poe and Tate 1994; Richards 1999), studies have also found that democracy is less effective in reducing restrictions on political and civil liberties (Davenport 2007a). If democratic, or majoritarian, constraints do not reduce restrictions on civil and political liberties, counter‐majoritarian constraints might be called upon to fill this void. Indeed, one of the core purposes of constitutions is to protect against the tyranny of the majority (Elster 1984).         "
"7","Second, there is a growing consensus within the literature on human rights treaty effectiveness that such treaties matter most when they are enforced within the domestic legal system, through mechanisms such as judicial independence and judicial review (Lupu 2013a, 2015; Powell and Staton 2009; Simmons 2009), the direct availability of international law in domestic courts (Sandholtz 2012), the mobilization of domestic groups (Htun and Weldon 2012; Simmons 2009), and the possibility of domestic and international human rights prosecutions (Dancy and Michel 2015; Dancy and Sikkink 2012; Kim and Sikkink 2010; Sikkink 2011). If treaty rights are most effective through the domestic political and legal system, we would expect constitutional rights to be even more effective since their enforcement mechanisms are exclusively domestic in nature. Indeed, one recent study systematically exploring the predictive value of all possible determinants of state repression finds that constitutional rights are more impactful than most of the “usual suspect” determinants, such as civil war or democracy (Hill and Jones 2014). It concludes that the comparative constitutional design literature “deserves more attention” in the study of government repression (Hill and Jones 2014). Our study takes up this task and systematically explores the impact of various constitutional rights protections on different types of government repression.         "
"8","Skepticism over the effectiveness of constitutional rights has long troubled constitution makers. James Madison famously opposed a bill of rights for the United States because he believed that rights could not constrain popular majorities, unless they are somehow made self‐enforcing (Madison , 529). Madison instead believed in institutional solutions: The creation and empowerment of different government departments with competing incentives would facilitate rights protection because “ambition” would “counteract ambition” (Hamilton, Madison, and Jay , 319).         "
"9","In keeping with the Madisonian tradition, a modern body of social science literature has shown that when political choices create organizations with the incentives and means to protect these choices, they are more likely to endure and become self‐enforcing (see Levinson 2011 for an overview). For example, although President Roosevelt contemplated a second, socioeconomically oriented bill of rights, his social welfare agenda ultimately became self‐enforcing because he established an administrative apparatus that would enforce his New Deal agenda even after his term ended. It was the administrative state, not the substantive commitment to redistribute wealth itself, that allowed for the New Deal's effective enforcement for decades to come (McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast ). The same logic applies to other organizations, such as central banks that enforce a commitment to monetary stability (Rogoff 1985), democratically elected parliaments that enforce commitments by ruling elites to adhere to majority preferences (Acemoglu and Robinson 2000), and independent courts that guard precommitments to various constitutional rights or policies (Hirschl 2004).         "
"10","Commitments to rights likewise have the potential to become self‐enforcing. Some rights establish organizations that have incentives and the means to guard and protect these rights. We refer to these rights as organizational rights. In their most characteristic form, these are the right to form political parties and the right to unionize. Both of these rights establish independent organizations capable of protecting the substantive rights commitments. Just like administrative agencies, central banks, and judiciaries, political parties and trade unions can protect their own interests. To a lesser extent, the same might be true for a range of associations that can guard the freedom of association and for churches that can guard the freedom of religion. In all these cases, it is the creation of organizations with incentives to preserve these rights, and the capacity to strategically act and mobilize against the government, that can make these rights self‐enforcing.         "
"11","More formally, at the time of constitution writing, organizational rights are placed into a constitution. This is time 0. At this time, rights could be adopted for different reasons. Yet, a recent body of literature suggests that writing a bill of rights is often less deliberative than constitutional theory has traditionally suggested (Law and Versteeg ; Tushnet , 1285–1301). Specifically, constitution makers often select from a limited number of standardized rights templates, drawn, for example, from international human rights law. In doing so, they presumably select the model that most closely matches their preferences, but they rarely write a bill of rights from scratch. Indeed, the tendency to rely on standardized models might explain why the autocracies in our sample are just as likely to adopt political rights as democracies.2"
"12","Even when constitution writers put little thought into rights adoption, these rights might still become meaningful if a window of opportunity exists for new organizations to form. This is time 1. Because constitutions are usually written in times of transition, when political power is fluctuating and citizens are more optimistic about the future, the period after the adoption of the constitution might present an opening for new organizations to get off the ground (Elster , 370).         "
"13","Whether new organizations will be established at time 1 is not self‐evident. Mancur Olson (1965) has argued that even special interest groups are plagued by collective action problems, as rational individuals are insufficiently incentivized to incur the costs of organizing, given that the benefits typically diffuse among all members of the resulting group. Organizations will form only if they can offer “selective incentives”—that is, benefits for those who establish the organization and from which nonfounders can be excluded (Olson 1965). The literatures on collective action and social mobilization have found that political entrepreneurs establish organizations to protect group interests when they are driven by career or reputational benefits (Hardin 1982; Jenkins 1983, 530; McCarthy and Zald 1973; Tilly 1978). These career and reputational benefits, in turn, depend on the projected future success of the organization (McCarthy and Zald 1973, ).         "
"14","The constitution, in various ways, can facilitate political organization by lowering the cost of organizing and increasing the projected future success of the organization. Both of these facilitate the establishment of organizations."
"15","First, when a constitution protects certain kinds of organizations, it becomes easier to establish these organizations. At the most general level, this comports with Douglas North's (1993, 1) basic insight that “institutions (i.e., the formal and informal ‘constraints that human beings impose on human interaction,’ including constitutions) crucially define opportunities for the “establishment of organizations.” More specifically, it is possible that the constitutional protection of a specific organization can serve as a focal point for coordination among those interested in establishing an organization (Hardin 2013). Because entrepreneurs can point at the constitution, it might be easier for them to coordinate their actions, which thus reduces the costs of organizing collectively.         "
"16","Second, the constitutional protection of an organization increases the projected future success of this organization and thus the career benefits associated with establishing it. The reason is that the constitution offers a range of mechanisms that enable the organization to protect itself from government intervention, such as the availability of judicial review and the ability to act collectively against a government that represses constitutional rights (Weingast 1997). The availability of these mechanisms inspires confidence in the future of the organization and therefore increases the likelihood that entrepreneurial individuals will incur the costs of establishing it. Moreover, as the organization gets up and running, these individuals will continue to invest resources and acquire skills, which further strengthens the organization and might entice investment by others.         "
"17","Over time, governments may renege on their constitutional promises by moving to repress the rights that were constitutionalized at time 0. This is time 2. In mature democracies, the impulse to repress might surface in the face of emergencies, such as terror threats, warfare, or violent dissent (Davenport, Moore, and Armstrong 2007). In fledgling democracies, parties with authoritarian tendencies might gain power and turn to repression. Finally, in autocracies, the urge to repress might grow stronger when the regime attempts to retain power in the face of growing opposition (Davenport 1995, 703; Davenport 2007b, 500; Poe 2004, 23). Regardless of why governments renege, it is at time 2 that organizational rights turn out to be better protected than individual rights.         "
"18","When governments decide to crack down on organizational rights, they must confront organizations that use a range of strategies to mobilize against rights encroachment. Political parties and unions, in particular, comprise experienced social and political activists, who routinely mobilize to protect their members’ interests. These activists will likely also mobilize to protect the organization itself, as they have invested substantial resources that are “asset‐specific,” meaning they cannot simply be transferred to other organizations (Williamson 1981, 555). Examples include investments in skills, relationships with individuals and other organizations that help overcome coordination problems, and the development of organizational and political identities (Pierson 2004, 35). As several studies have shown, such asset‐specific investments tie investors to the organization and give them a stake in preserving it (Alt et al. 1996, 696; 144–45; Pierson 2004, 147; Pierson and Trowbridge 2002, 12). Thus, when the organization becomes threatened by certain government actors, organizational investors will not simply take their resources elsewhere but will seek to protect the organization.         "
"19","Within the existing constitutional and political framework, organizations can act both preemptively, in response to proposed rights violations, and reactively, in response to actual rights violations. As an example of preemptive action, unions can mobilize against proposed anti‐union legislation and use a variety of techniques to pressure legislators to vote against such laws. In this case, they effectively act as additional veto players within the political system (Davenport 2007a; Tsebelis 2002).2 When rights are violated, organizations can react by bringing cases to the constitutional court and seeking invalidation of laws and regulations that violate the organization's rights. Organizations can also play outside the existing constitutional and political framework entirely by staging protests, rallying against the government, or threatening revolution.         "
"20","It might be politically easier to suppress individual rights. Our framework suggests that individual rights are less likely to be accompanied by organizations that have the incentives and means to protect these rights against government encroachment. First, the lack of constitutional protection of the organizations themselves might make it harder for individuals to coordinate and establish an organization. Second, the potential career benefits for those establishing organizations might be lower, as the lack of constitutional protections for the organizations deprives them of a range of mechanisms to guard against rights encroachment. Relatedly, individual rights can also be practiced without an organization, which reduces the organization's perceived need and thus further decreases potential career benefits for those establishing the organization. To illustrate, while it is impossible to exercise the right to unionize without a (would‐be) union, one can exercise the freedom of movement without an organization that protects free travel."
"21","We recognize, however, that in practice constituencies often do organize to protect individual constitutional rights (Epp 1998; Simmons 2009). There are various conditions under which this might happen. One conjecture is that such groups form when a strong civil society exists. Another is that they form when rights are actually being violated. The literature on social mobilization suggests that actual grievances might provide an important impetus for mobilization (Gurr 1970). In both cases, however, such groups only form under certain circumstances or at certain times, making it less likely that we will find aggregate effects for individual rights. We believe that the interplay between individual constitutional rights and organizations established to protect these rights is an important question for future research.         "
"22","The defining feature of organizational rights is that they create rights‐protecting organizations, thereby rendering those rights self‐enforcing. On theoretical grounds, we conceptualize political rights as placed along a continuum, with rights that establish and empower distinct organizations on one end and rights that are individually practiced on the other (see Figure 1).         "
"23","On one end of the continuum, we find the rights to establish political parties and unionize. What distinguishes these from other political rights is that they constitutionally empower specific groups to strategically protect their interests. For political parties, these interests include the development and promotion of their parties in a system of free and fair elections. For trade unions, these interests include the protection of organized workers and allowing these workers to protect their own interests through collective bargaining with their employers. In order to achieve these goals, political parties and trade unions routinely mobilize their constituents and act strategically in the political arena."
"24","Next on the continuum is the right to association. Although this right empowers organizations, it is less clear what kinds of groups are empowered by this right or what type of interests these groups seek to protect. Indeed, it is likely that the associations empowered by the freedom of association are diverse in nature. Associations could be small and private, rather than large and public, and are not necessarily politically active in the same way as political parties and trade unions. As a result, it is harder to predict a priori whether and to what extent these groups will be able to mobilize against rights encroachment."
"25","Further on the continuum is the freedom of religion. The freedom of religion is an individual right because its exercise does not depend on the existence of religious organizations. In its essence, it allows every individual to practice his or her own religion. Yet, unlike other individual rights, this right is commonly practiced in groups. When people practice their religion together, enduring religious organizations—like churches, synagogues, or mosques—are created. Once established, these organizations can also become political players with their own political agendas. For example, one recent study shows how the Protestant church played a crucial role in the spread of religious liberty, mass education, mass printing, and voluntary organizations, as well as propagated colonial reform in many parts of the world, ultimately facilitating the emergence of democracy (Woodberry 2012). Likewise, the literature on social mobilization has long emphasized the importance of churches in social mobilization (Zirakzedeh 2006, 11). Religious organizations might therefore possess an arsenal of strategies similar to political parties or trade unions, empowering them to act collectively to guard religious freedom. The right to religious freedom, therefore, constitutes an intermediate category.         "
"26","On the other end of the continuum are political rights that are practiced on an individual basis. Our analysis is limited to the freedom of expression and the freedom of movement, but many other individual political rights are similar in nature. The right to a fair trial, to habeas corpus, to counsel, and to vote, among others, all empower individuals to participate in civil and political national affairs. Importantly, the exercise of these rights do not require individuals to organize collectively in groups, which might make it less likely that organizations will form to protect these rights. But we also note that the small set of truly individual rights in our analysis limits our ability to make general claims about individual rights’ effectiveness. Future research is needed to explore the conditions under which individual rights can become self‐enforcing."
"27","To analyze the effect of constitutional rights on de facto respect for rights in practice, we rely on original data on constitutional rights based on the hand‐coding of all the written constitutions in place from 1946 to 2012 for 186 countries. Each constitution was coded for the presence of rights and their enforcement. The data set was introduced and explained in Goderis and Versteeg ().            "
"28","From this data set, we selected six political rights: (1) to establish political parties (Political Parties), (2) to unionize and/or strike (Unionize), (3) to associate and/or assemble (Association), (4) freedom of religion (Religion), (5) freedom of expression and/or the press (Expression), and (6) freedom of movement (Movement).3 We selected these rights because they are political rights for which corresponding de facto rights indicators were also available. From the same data set, we also select 81 other constitutional rights variables that we use to incorporate information on countries’ other constitutional commitments into our analysis.4"
"29","We link each of the six political rights to corresponding data on de facto respect for those rights. Our data on de facto human rights practices come from the Cingranelli and Richards (2010) “CIRI” data set and cover 195 countries from 1981 to 2010. These data are commonly used in the empirical human rights literature and are based on quantitative coding of the annual U.S. State Department country reports (Hill 2010; Lupu 2013a, 2013b, 2015).5 We therefore use the CIRI coding on (1) the existence of free and fair elections to estimate the effect of Political Parties, (2) the protection of workers’ right to unionize and/or strike to estimate the effect of Unionize, (3) the freedom of assembly and association to estimate the effect of Association, (4) the freedom of religion to estimate the effect of Religion, (5) the freedom of the press and expression to estimate the effect of Expression, and (6) the freedom of movement to estimate the effect of Movement. For each of these six political rights, CIRI grades countries on a 3‐point scale. A country that severely restricts a right receives a score of 0; a country that moderately restricts a right receives a score of 1; and a country that practically never restricts a right receives a score of 2.6"
"30","A descriptive exploration of the data reveals that most constitutional rights are associated with increased de facto rights protection after their adoption. Figure 2 depicts this graphically for a subset of countries that added the right to their constitution during the period for which we have de facto data. It depicts the average de facto human rights score for each of the five years before and after the constitutional right was adopted. While we cannot simply attribute these increases in de facto rights protections to the constitution, Figure 2 suggests that constitutional rights could improve respect for rights in practice.            "
"31","Estimating the effect of constitutional rights is a difficult task because there may be factors that influence both the decision to constitutionally incorporate the right and the later protection of that right. Although there have been few efforts to address these selection effects in the comparative law literature, substantial progress has been made in a related literature on human rights treaty effectiveness. Over the last decade, there has been a growing body of empirical research examining whether a state's decision to ratify an international rights agreement changes its rights practices (Hafner‐Burton 2012; Simmons 2010). This literature has had to confront a selection problem that mirrors the one confronting scholars studying the effectiveness of constitutions—that is, the decision whether to ratify an agreement is related to the state's rights preferences and practices.            "
"32","Scholars studying the effectiveness of human rights treaties have used a number of increasingly sophisticated techniques to address this selection problem, such as Heckman selection models (Keith 2012; Neumayer 2005) and instrumental variable regressions (Simmons 2009). One method that is increasingly used by scholars studying compliance with international agreements is matching (Hill 2010; Lupu 2013a, 2013b, 2015; Nielsen and Simmons 2014; Simmons and Hopkins 2005). The problem that matching tries to solve is that with observational data, there are often significant differences between groups that researchers are interested in studying. As a result, observed differences in outcomes between the groups may be due to those underlying differences and not the key explanatory variable of interest. Matching mitigates this problem by pairing observations together that are as similar in as many relevant ways as possible except that one has received a particular treatment (i.e., adopted a constitutional right), whereas the other has not. The intuition is that if the observations are similar along all relevant dimensions except that one has received the treatment, then observed differences in the dependent variable can be attributed to the treatment. Although matching methods certainly have their own drawbacks, we follow recent insights from the literature on treaty effectiveness and use matching to study the impact of constitutional rights adoption.            "
"33","We use a two‐stage process for our analysis. In the first stage, we match country‐year observations that include the relevant constitutional right to country‐year observations that do not include the right. Our matching procedure uses a number of observable variables that have previously been identified as “usual suspects” (Hill and Jones 2014, 661; Keith, Tate, and Poe 2009, 648). First, because studies have consistently found a link between democracy and government violence, we match on democracy using the polity2 variable from the Polity IV data set. Second, because wealthier countries tend to be less repressive (Poe and Tate 1994), we match on the natural log of a country's GDP per capita, taken from the World Development Indicators. Third, because larger countries tend to commit more violations (Poe and Tate 1994), we match on the natural log of a country's population size, taken from the World Development Indicators. Fourth, because engagement in civil and international conflict tends to increase human rights violations (Hill and Jones 2014), we also match on two variables that capture whether a country is engaged in international or civil war, both taken from the Correlates of War database.            "
"34","In addition to these usual suspect variables, we match on two variables that are arguably of particular importance for constitutional rights: judicial independence and the number of international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) (Keith 2012). Independent judiciaries are important for enforcing rights de facto (Lupu 2013a; Simmons 2009), but they may also affect whether constitutional rights are adopted in the first place (Cross 1999; Keith 2012). To capture judicial independence, we use a variable from the CIRI data set that rates judicial independence on a 3‐point scale. We include INGOs because these organizations have the ability to prevent rights abuses in practice through naming and shaming and activism, but they might also be able to press for constitutional rights adoption (Keith 2012, 206–7). This was taken from Hafner‐Burton and Tsutsui (2005).            "
"35","Although there are many matching methods available (Honaker, King, and Blackwell 2011), we decided to use propensity score matching.7 Specifically, we use nearest neighbor matching with a caliper of 0.5 to ensure that the matched pairs improve the sample. Using this approach, we created six different matched data sets—one for each of the six political rights that we study. As Table 1 shows, matching improves the balance for each of our six matched samples.8"
"36","In the second stage of our analysis, we use multivariable regression to test the effect of constitutional rights on the de facto protection of these rights for each of our six data sets. If a matched sample is perfectly balanced, it is possible to estimate a treatment effect by simply comparing the outcome variable for the two groups (Ho et al. 2007). Where there is remaining imbalance, however, it is standard practice to use regression analysis while including control variables that are likely to influence rights practices. Our regression model includes all the variables that we matched on, as well as a set of year fixed effects (Lupu 2013a, 2013b, 2015). We address any potential serial correlation by calculating robust standard errors clustered at the country level. Since our dependent variables are categorical, we estimate an ordered logit model for each of the matched data sets.            "
"37","Although our data on constitutional rights and rights practices have relatively few missing values, there is missing data among our control variables. Dropping these observations via listwise deletion, however, risks biasing our results because the missing observations are likely nonrandom (Honaker and King 2010). To account for this source of bias, we imputed values for the missing observations using the Amelia II package for R (Honaker, King, and Blackwell 2011). Doing so is consistent with the practice of other recent scholarship in the human rights literature (Hill 2010; Lupu 2013a, 2013b, 2015).9"
"38","Table 2 presents our primary results. It shows that the adoption of the political rights on the far organizational end of our continuum—that is, the right to establish Political Parties and to Unionize—have a statistically significant and positive effect on respect for these rights in practice. These findings support our theory on organizational rights. As we will show in the next section, these findings are robust to a range of alternative specifications.            "
"39","Table 2 also reveals that the two rights next on the continuum—Association and Religion—have a positive effect on government respect for these rights in practice. The effect for Religion is statistically significant. The effect of Association, however, falls short of conventional levels of significance (the p‐value is .08) in our baseline model but is significant in some of our robustness checks. By contrast, the rights at the individual end of the continuum—Expression and Movement—fail to achieve statistical significance in the baseline model (p‐values of .19 and .64, respectively) as well as in virtually all robustness checks.            "
"40","Figure 3 presents the marginal effects for the organizational rights. The marginal effects calculation estimates the impact that constitutional rights adoption has on the percentage point increase in the probability of a country placing severe restrictions on rights (value 0 on the dependent variable) or displaying full respect for rights (value 2 on the dependent variable).            "
"41","Figure 3 shows that upon adoption of the right to Political Parties, the probability of a country placing severe restrictions on this right decreases by 4.5 percentage points, whereas the probability of fully respecting this right increases by 4.6 percentage points. Upon the adoption of Unionize, Association, and Religion, the probability of placing severe restrictions on these rights decreases by 10.3, 11.2, and 26.3 percentage points, respectively, whereas the probability of fully respecting these rights increases by 8.2, 8.4, and 24.6 percentage points, respectively.            "
"42","To appreciate the size of this effect, these numbers can be evaluated against a baseline probability of adoption—that is, the probability of falling in each of these categories in the absence of constitutional rights adoption. For example, without the constitutional right to form Political Parties, the probability that a country places severe restrictions on rights is 31.5%, whereas the probability that a country places no restrictions on rights is 41.0%. Upon adopting the right, the probability of severe restrictions decreases from 31.5 to 27.0%, whereas the probability of no restrictions increases from 41.0 to 45.6%. For Unionize, Association, and Religion, the baseline probability of placing severe restrictions are 42.8, 29.8, and 57.9%, respectively, whereas the probability of placing no restrictions is 22.2, 8.4, and 19.1%, respectively.            "
"43","It deserves mentioning that Religion, while not robust in all robustness checks, appears to have the largest effect. This could in part be the result of the relatively small number of observations in the matched samples for Religion. But it also suggests that religious organizations are potentially very important in protecting the freedom of religion, a finding that might merit further investigation by the repression literature.            "
"44","A shortcoming of matching is that it exclusively relies on observable variables. Thus, it is possible that there are unobserved variables that influence both the treatment and outcome, thereby biasing the matching results. In the literature on human rights treaty effectiveness, Lupu (2013b) has argued that a major unobserved variable is states’ preferences for treaty commitments. To address this problem, Lupu (2013a, 2013b, 2015) developed a method to directly measure each state's preferences treaty commitments. Specifically, Lupu (2013a, 2013b, 2015) uses a method developed to explain the ideological preferences of legislators—the W‐NOMINATE algorithm (Poole and Rosenthal 1997)—to calculate the probability that a state would have ratified a particular human rights agreement. He next uses this probability as a variable, along with the standard control variables, in both matching and postmatching regressions.            "
"45","There are reasons to believe that the same justifications offered by Lupu for incorporating data on treaty commitments into empirical models assessing treaty effectiveness should lead researchers to incorporate data on constitutional commitments into empirical models assessing constitutional rights effectiveness. First, just as any state is free to ratify a universal treaty, it is free to include any right within its constitution. Second, the rights that states elect to enshrine in their constitution are arguably a source of information about their preferences for constitutional commitments in the same way that their prior treaty ratification decisions are an important source of information about their preferences for treaty commitments. Third, a body of research has demonstrated that it is possible to directly code the rights that states have included in their constitution in a way that makes cross‐national comparisons possible."
"46","We incorporate information on countries’ prior constitutional commitments in two ways. First, we directly follow Lupu (2013b) by using W‐NOMINATE on our data set of 87 constitutional rights to estimate annual probabilities that a country would have enshrined a specific right into its constitution. We then incorporate this probability into our matching and postmatching regressions. When doing so, the effect for Political Parties, Unionize, and Religion remains positive and statistically significant, whereas the other three constitutional variables are not statistically significant.10 Second, we modify Lupu's approach by directly including scores from a principal component analysis (PCA) into both the matching algorithm and the postmatching regressions. We conducted PCA on our matrix of 87 constitutional rights because this is a mathematically sound approach for binary variables (Gower 1966), and it allows us to incorporate information on states’ other constitutional rights commitments into our analysis without the strong assumptions required by a spatial preferences model like W‐NOMINATE. For each of the six rights, we conducted PCA on the other 86 rights and included the scores for the first two components in our matching and regression analysis. When using this approach, we found results similar to our baseline model.11"
"47","Additional robustness checks suggest that our findings are not driven by (1) failure to include lagged dependent variables in our matching procedure or regressions (2) posttreatment bias, (3) other possible omitted variable bias, (4) the specifics of our matching procedure, (5) the decision to use matching in the first place, or (6) differences in the size of our matched samples."
"48","First, our results are robust to including lagged versions of the dependent variable in our matching procedure and postmatching regressions. Research studies using time‐series data to examine human rights have commonly included lagged versions of the dependent variable in their analysis. We elected not to do so, though, because this introduces posttreatment bias into the regressions. When we introduce two years of lagged dependent variables into both matching and postmatching regressions, however, our findings for Political Parties, Unionize, and Religion remain positive and statistically significant.12"
"49","Second, our results are not driven by posttreatment bias. Although we did not include lagged dependent variables in our analysis because of this concern, all of the other controls we included were still measured after the “treatment” (in our case, the adoption of a constitutional right), which means that their values could be influenced by the treatment itself and thus bias our results. We therefore estimated a series of models that attempt to account for the possibility of posttreatment bias. These include estimating (1) models with a reduced set of variables that are unlikely to be affected by constitutional rights adoption; (2) models with a subset of data that only include observations from countries where a given constitutional right was adopted after we have data for our dependent variables (i.e., 1980), and in which our control variables are adjusted so that they take the value of the year prior to adoption of a given right in all postadoption years; and (3) models that build on (2) by including an adjusted dependent variable measured in the two years prior to the adoption of the constitutional right. In all cases, our findings are generally consistent with our baseline results,14 which suggests that it is unlikely that our results are driven by posttreatment bias.13"
"50","Third, our results are robust when attempting to account for unobservable variables that are correlated with both constitutional rights adoption and actual rights practices. Specifically, we estimated a random‐effects ordered logit model that calculates country‐specific intercepts absorbing unexplained cross‐country heterogeneity and hence reduces the potential for omitted variable bias caused by time‐invariant omitted variables. The results from this model reveal that the effects for four of the rights—Political Parties, Unionize, Association, and Religion—remain positive and statistically significant. Somewhat surprising is that Expression becomes statistically significant in this model, although this happens only once in all of the models we estimated.15"
"51","Fourth, our results are robust to alternative matching procedures. We specifically estimated alternative models that (1) matched observations using calipers of 0.25, 0.75, and 1.00;17 and (2) matched observations using the Mahalanobis distance. These results are substantively similar to our baseline results, suggesting that our results are not dependent on the matching method we elected to use.16"
"52","Fifth, our results are robust to not preprocessing our data with matching at all. To test this, we estimated a regression identical to our baseline model, but without preprocessing the data with matching. The results are substantively the same as our baseline results.18"
"53","Sixth, we do not believe our results are driven by the fact that the number of observations in the matched samples for the right to establish Political Parties and the right to Unionize are substantially larger than the samples for the other rights. Obviously, the larger samples raise the concern that the results for these two rights would not be statistically significant if those samples were smaller. To address this concern, we estimated what the effects would be if the samples for Political Parties and Unionize were equivalent to the matched sample for the freedom of Expression. Specifically, we randomly sampled 335 treatment observations and 335 control observations from the matched sample for Political Parties and Unionize, estimated our primary regression model, and saved the coefficient. We then repeated this procedure 1,000 times. The results show that, for Political Parties, the mean coefficient was 0.518 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.095 to 0.942. For Unionize, the mean coefficient was 0.805 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.454 to 1.157. Thus, both results are nearly identical to our baseline results.19"
"54","The question of whether writing bills of rights actually makes a difference in practice has troubled constitution makers ever since James Madison. It is a question that remains of great practical importance today, as many countries keep rewriting their founding documents (Elkins, Ginsburg, and Melton 2009). In this article, we explored the effect of enshrining six political rights in the constitution. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of political rights adoption depends on the kind of right at issue. Rights that establish organizations with the incentives and means to protect the rights obtain a self‐enforcing quality that makes them more effective than rights that do not establish such organizations.         "
"55","Our analysis also reveals important questions for future study. First, our findings suggest that further research is required to examine the potentially self‐enforcing qualities of individual rights. While it appears that individual rights are less effective than organizational rights, we have explored the impact of only a limited set of individual rights. Exploration of a wider set of rights would shed light on whether our findings generalize to all individual rights, or whether they are particular to the freedoms of expression and movement. Second, we only tested our theory with CIRI data, and since prior research has suggested that this data might be biased (Fariss 2014), it is important to test this theory with other data sets going forward. Third, our analysis also does not explore the circumstances under which organizations might form to protect individual rights. Though individual rights can be exercised without organizations, it is possible that organizations do form to protect individual rights. One recent study, for example, shows how victims and their human rights lawyers in Latin America and Europe have been able to create legal accountability structures for state‐sanctioned violations of individual rights (Dancy and Michel 2015). We believe that understanding how constituencies can form to protect individual rights thus is an important area for future research.         "
