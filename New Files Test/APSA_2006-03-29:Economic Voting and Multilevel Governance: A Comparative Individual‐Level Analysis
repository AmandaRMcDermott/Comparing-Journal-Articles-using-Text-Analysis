"1","In its earliest elaborations, the economic voting model posited that governments are punished (rewarded) for bad (good) economic conditions at election time (Kramer 1971). The literature on economic voting has moved well beyond initial formulations of a simple reward and punishment calculus.1 As the field of economic voting developed, significant cross‐national variation in the extent of economic voting was found and a variety of theories have been tested to account for this (Anderson 1995, 2000; Lewis‐Beck 1988; Pacek and Radcliff 1995; Paldam 1991; Powell and Whitten 1993). One of the most important developments in the field dealt with the “clarity of responsibility” in different political and institutional contexts.         "
"2"," Powell and Whitten (1993) published the first major article on this topic and showed that clarity of responsibility within the national governing institutions significantly alters economic effects on electoral support for incumbent parties. The concept of clarity of responsibility refers to the characteristics of domestic political context which shape the ability of citizens to apportion responsibility for economic or policy decisions to particular institutions, parties or actors within the national government. Clarity of responsibility was measured in terms of the number of parties in government, the presence of a bicameral opposition, presence of a strong committee system, minority governments, and party cohesion (Powell and Whitten 1993). They found that where clarity within the national government was strongest, national economic factors had the greatest impact upon voting for the incumbent government. Conversely, where clarity was weakest, economic conditions had much less effect on electoral support for the government. The initial findings have since been confirmed and updated (Anderson 1995, 2000; Chappell and Veiga 2000; Lewis‐Beck and Paldam 2000; Nadeau, Niemi, and Yoshinaka 2002; Whitten and Palmer 1999). Together, these findings suggest that the nature of clarity of responsibility within the national government has significant effects on the extent to which citizens hold national governments responsible for national economic conditions.         "
"3","A surprising omission in the comparative literature has been consideration of the effects of multilevel governance on economic voting. The processes and institutional results of multilevel governance are most commonly associated with the European Union, but the concept is one that travels beyond the confines of the EU.2 It reflects a belief that the traditional nation‐state has become both too small and too large to be the most effective body of public decision making for all major policy decisions (Watts 1999). At its most basic, the concept of multilevel governance describes the dispersion of political authority across multiple levels of government (Hooghe and Marks 2001). From a positivist perspective, multilevel governance is a term that captures the objective reality of the reallocation of political authority away from the central state government to both supranational institutions as well as subnational levels of government (Hooghe and Marks 2001). From a normative vantage point, the concept of multilevel governance raises questions about the direction and purposes of institutional change (Hooghe and Marks 2003). From this perspective, the concept of multilevel governance reflects a concern with designing institutions to best address new and emerging policy challenges.         "
"4","There are a number of reasons to think that the presence of multilevel governance weakens clarity of responsibility to the national government for national economic conditions. Multilevel governance introduces information costs that make it harder for citizens to attribute clear responsibility to the national legislature for economic conditions (Cutler 2001, 2004). In the first instance, information demands can be heightened in cases where citizens are unclear as to the actual division of powers between multiple levels of government (Bryzinski, Lancaster, and Tuschhoff 1999a). Secondly, the presence of multilevel governance creates situations in which citizens are confronted with the challenge of tracking different levels of government and attempting to effectively and accurately judge their performance in achieving favourable political and economic outcomes (Tuschhoff 1999). Moreover, as Downs (1999) argues, multiple levels of government entail multiple elections and this alone may increase the likelihood of voter fatigue. For these reasons, the effort required of the voting citizen to gain the knowledge and information necessary to make accurate attributions of responsibility is likely to undermine the effects of economic evaluations on incumbent voting.         "
"5","In addition to the myriad information demands put upon citizens by multilevel governance, the actions of multiple levels of governments themselves can undermine clear responsibility linkages for economic conditions. In particular, multilevel institutions can encourage governments to engage in blame shifting and credit taking for economic conditions as well as more political outcomes (Bryzinski, Lancaster, and Tuschhoff 1999b; Downs 1999; Tuschhoff 1999). In this sense, the existence of multilevel institutions can create rational incentives for governments in a multilevel system to act in ways that camouflage responsibility for political and economic decisions as well as outcomes.         "
"6","According to a responsibility‐centred rationale, governments should only be evaluated on the basis of those economic outcomes that pertain to a level of aggregation consistent with their jurisdiction (Anderson 2005; Atkeson and Partin 1995; Orth 2001). Because national governments, not subnational ones, control the major levers of macroeconomic policy, national economic conditions should only influence support for the national incumbent. Subnational incumbents should not be evaluated on the basis of national conditions that they have no authority to control (Anderson 2005; Atkeson and Partin 1995; Orth 2001).3 Conversely, incumbent support at the respective subnational level should only be affected by subnational economic conditions, whether regional or local (Anderson 2005; Atkeson and Partin 1995; Orth 2001). However, national incumbents may rightly be evaluated on the basis of subnational economic conditions because macroeconomic policy will affect subnational conditions. To the extent that multilevel governance blurs responsibility, though, the effects of national economic conditions on support for the incumbent national government are likely to be muted, and so are the effects of subnational conditions on subnational (and national) governments.         "
"7","This may help to explain why the burgeoning literature on the effect of regional or subnational economic conditions on support for the respective subnational governments has produced such mixed findings. Studies in Canada (Anderson 2005), Spain (Diaz and Riba 1999), and the United States (Atkeson and Partin 1995; Carsey and Wright, 1998; Hansen 1999; Niemi, Stanley, and Vogel 1995; Partin 1995; Squire and Fastnow 1994) have found that subnational economic conditions do influence the electoral support of subnational governments. By contrast, other studies in Argentina (Remmer and Gelineau 2003), Canada (Belanger and Gelineau 2004) and the United States (Crew and Weiher 1996; Kone and Winters 1993; Peltzman 1987) have found that national, not subnational, economic conditions influence subnational government support. The few country‐specific studies that have considered the effects of subnational economic conditions on national incumbent support have produced similarly contradictory findings. While studies in Canada (Anderson 2005; Belanger and Gelineau 2004) find that subnational economic conditions have no effect on national incumbent support, one study in the United States indicates that subnational economic conditions can influence support for the American President (Orth 2001).         "
"8","What is needed now is a systematic cross‐national test of the extent to which multilevel governance influences the impact of economic conditions on incumbent support. Given the lack of any cross‐national data set that includes perceptions of subnational economic conditions, this article focuses solely on the effects of national conditions on voting for the national incumbent government."
"9","In examining the effects of multilevel governance on economic voting, the article shifts the analytical focus to what might usefully be termed the “vertical dimension of clarity of responsibility.”4 Where prior research has considered the effect of “horizontal clarity,” or the degree of clarity of responsibility within a national government, the research presented here assesses the extent to which multiple levels of government and/or significant decentralization to subnational levels of government clouds responsibility attributions. Past research shows that lack of horizontal clarity weakens economic voting. This article tests the proposition that a lack of vertical clarity similarly attenuates the extent to which national economic conditions influence incumbent support in elections for national legislatures.         "
"10","The central proposition is tested using individual‐level data contained in module one of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). The CSES data are the result of a cross‐national collaboration in which election studies in 33 countries asked an identical bank of questions. This data set is well suited for this study for a variety of reasons. In the first instance, the countries included vary in both the extent and nature of multilevel governance. Secondly, the dataset includes questions regarding vote choice (under the conditions of an actual election), sociodemographics as well as party identification. Finally, the CSES data set includes responses to questions about national economic conditions.5 A sociotropic retrospective economic evaluation question was asked. Sociotropic evaluations tap respondents' perceptions of national economic conditions as opposed to their individual or household situation, while retrospective evaluations relate to the past, usually the previous 12 months, as opposed to respondents' perceptions of what is likely to happen in the near or long‐term future. Previous work on economic voting shows that sociotropic retrospective evaluations typically have a greater impact on incumbent vote choice than either prospective or egocentric variations (Lewis‐Beck and Paldam 2000).         "
"11","The 16 countries in the CSES module one that qualify as advanced industrial democracies are included in the analysis. The countries (with election year) are: Australia (1996), Belgium (1999), Canada (1997), Denmark (1998), Germany (1998), Iceland (1999), Japan (1996), Netherlands (1998), New Zealand (1996), Norway (1997), Portugal (2002), Spain (2000), Sweden (1998), Switzerland (1999), Great Britain (1997), and the United States (1996)."
"12","Controls for incumbent party identification and identification with a party other than an incumbent are included. Coding party identification in this manner leaves as the reference category respondents who have no party identification. All models include the direct effects of sociotropic retrospective perceptions of economic change.6"
"13","All models also include country dummies (with Sweden serving as the reference case). These country dummies are included for a number of reasons. In the first instance, the political context within a country at election time may be strongly shaped by domestic (or international) political, economic, or other factors that either increase or decrease the general levels of support for the incumbent. In addition, political, economic or other factors may inordinately influence the effects of other variables known to affect vote choice. The inclusion of country dummies allows for a generalized control of such country‐specific stochastic variation. Country dummy coefficients (and odds ratios) have no substantive interpretation and only influence the value of the constant term."
"14","Additionally, all models include an interaction term for horizontal clarity of responsibility. The interaction term is composed of sociotropic retrospective perceptions of economic change and the nature of horizontal clarity within the national government. As Powell and Whitten originally developed this concept, the clarity of responsibility measure codes all cases on the basis of five factors that are theorized to affect clarity (as discussed above). Each country is coded 1 (for the presence of the factor) or 0 (the absence of the factor). To create an index of clarity, these values are added together. The result is a “clarity of responsibility” index in which a value of 0 denotes the most clear political context and a value of 5 indicates lowest clarity.7 Following Powell and Whitten, these clarity measures were dummied into low clarity (=1) (countries with a value of 2 or greater) and high clarity (=0) (cases with a value of 0 or 1). An interaction term was created through multiplying the dummied clarity of responsibility variable by the economic evaluation variable. The creation of an interaction term allows for consideration of the effect of economic evaluations within political contexts of varying horizontal clarity. Based on previous studies (Anderson 1995, 2000; Powell and Whitten 1993; Nadeau, Niemi, and Yoshinaka 2002; Whitten and Palmer 1999), economic voting should be less as horizontal clarity decreases.         "
"15","The independent variables of most theoretical interest are formed through the interaction of the sociotropic retrospective perceptions of economic change and the various indicators of multilevel governance. This article develops seven different indicators of multilevel governance: existence of a federal constitution; presence of elections to regional levels of government; extent of territorial autonomy; and four types of fiscal decentralization. Following the lead of Powell and Whitten (1993) in the case of horizontal clarity, the continuous vertical clarity measures are recoded into dummy variables.         "
"16","While institutional (federalism, regional elections, and territorial autonomy) indicators provide a general picture of the nature of multilevel governance within a system, these measures alone are less able to capture more subtle degrees of decentralization between countries. The concept of multilevel governance not only refers to the existence of multiple levels of government but also to the nature and extent of decentralization within a country (Garman, Haggard, and Willis 2001; Hooghe and Marks 2003; Rodden 2004; Watts 1999, 2002). For example, while country A and B may both be coded as federal and have regional elections, the nature of subnational government authority may be very different between the two countries. As such, the use of fiscal indicators provides greater nuance to the comparison of multilevel governance across cases.         "
"17","The existence of a federal constitution is an obvious indicator of multilevel governance.8 Federalism can be defined as a political system “in which neither the federal nor the constituent units of government are constitutionally subordinate to the other (i.e., each has sovereign powers derived from the constitution rather than another level of government), each is empowered to deal directly with its citizens in the exercise of its legislative, executive and taxing powers and each is directly elected by its citizens” (Watts 1999, 7). To the extent that the presence of a federal constitution undermines vertical clarity, economic voting should be weaker in federal states.         "
"18","The second indicator of multilevel governance is the presence of regional elections. While this indicator may be conceptually related to federalism (i.e., having a directly elected subnational government is a part of the definition of federalism), not all countries that have regional elections are federal states (e.g., France). It is proposed that the existence of regional elections attenuates the extent of vertical clarity and thereby weakens economic voting. This is plausible not only for the reasons already outlined but also because the presence of an elected regional government provides that order of government greater democratic legitimacy to act regardless of how limited the jurisdiction may be."
"19","A third indicator of multilevel governance considers the territorial organization of a polity in terms of other units of governance than the central government. The coding of territorial autonomy is based on Woldendorp, Keman, and Budge (2001). Countries are scored on the basis of the presence of noncentral tiers of government and the rights constitutionally given to these subnational orders of government. Similar to the distinction between federal systems and regional elections, this is a measure of the nature of constitutional rights provided to subnational governments (both regional and local) that is not necessarily captured by the federal‐unitary distinction. Following Woldendorp, Keman, and Budge (2001), cases are given a value of “2” where specific rights are constitutionally entrenched, a value of “1” where subnational units have some independent rights and a value of “0” for all other cases.         "
"20","The other indicators of multilevel governance rely on a variety of fiscal measures to determine the extent of political decentralization.9 Perhaps the most common method of assessing decentralization through fiscal measures is to draw on Government Finance Statistics published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and/or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Many previous studies have either explicitly used these sources or incorporated them for verification of existing indices (Lane and Ersson 1999; Lijphart 1999; Rodden 2004; Woldendorp, Keman, and Budge 2001). One variation has been to consider the percentage of total government expenditures that occur at the subnational level. However, this measure provides no information about the source of fiscal resources that compose the expenditure amount. A better indication of the fiscal power of subnational units can be obtained by calculating the percent of total tax revenue (from all levels of government) that is collected by subnational governments (either regional or local). The distribution of these values across countries ranges from 6% (Belgium) to 47% (Canada), and there is a noticeable gap between countries that are below 22% of total tax revenues and those that are above 32% total tax revenues. To reflect this characteristic of the distribution, countries with subnational revenues comprising 32% or greater of all tax revenues coded as “high fiscal decentralization” (=1) and all countries in which 22% or less of all tax revenues were collected by subnational governments were coded as “not high fiscal decentralization” (=0).         "
"21","While these indicators have been regularly used to indicate the extent of fiscal decentralization, this method of assessing fiscal decentralization fails to consider differences in subnational governments' fiscal autonomy. Because central governments can and often do limit the fiscal autonomy of subnational governments through providing conditional grants or creating programs that subnational governments pay for, larger subnational shares of tax revenue or expenditure may not actually indicate greater fiscal independence of those subunits (OECD 1999). Consequently, subnational governments may not have control over those revenues/expenditures that are reported as theirs. A recent volume published by the OECD provides information not only on the amount of tax revenues collected by different orders of subnational governments (which was previously available) but also considers the degree of discretion that subnational governments have over these tax revenues. Specifically, this study reveals the relative tax autonomy of subnational units by considering the ability to determine the tax base and set the taxation rates. Implications for considering degrees of decentralization are significant. For example, subnational units of government in Germany collect about 29% of the total tax revenue collected in Germany (OECD 1999). Of that 29%, subnational governments have the ability to set the rate of taxation for roughly 3.5% and to determine the tax base for well under 1%. Considered in the overall picture of German taxation, subnational governments have the ability to set the rate of taxation for under 1% of total tax revenues and the tax base and rate for less than 0.02% of all tax revenues.         "
"22","Consistent with other measures, dummy variables are created. In the case of ability to determine the rate of taxation, there exists a clear difference between six countries that all exhibited over 17% of total tax revenue (coded as “high decentralization”= 1) and the remaining nine countries that have values of less than 6% of total tax revenues (coded as “not high decentralization”= 0).10 For the ability to set both the rate and base of taxation, the distribution reflected a low of 0% of all tax revenues and a high 29.9%. In this case, a noticeable gap exists between three countries where subnational governments have the ability to set the rate and base of taxation for over 11% of all tax revenue (coded as “high autonomy”= 1) and the remainder of the cases where none had the ability to set the rate and base of taxation for more than 5% (coded as “not high autonomy”= 0).         "
"23","A final measure of decentralization considers the ability of subnational governments to borrow. An index of borrowing autonomy is established drawing on a framework developed by the Inter‐American Development Bank (1997).11 This borrowing autonomy index is constructed according to four criteria: the ability of subnational governments to borrow at all, the nature of central government authorization for subnational borrowing, the nature and extent of constraints on borrowing and, finally, limitations on the use of borrowed money.12 Information regarding subnational borrowing practices is taken from Ter‐Minassian and Craig (1997).13 The resulting index runs from 0 to 2 (where a value of “2” denotes high subnational government borrowing autonomy). While the vast majority of countries receive a value of 1 or lower on this index, there are five cases with values of 1.5 or greater that stand out as exhibiting noticeably higher levels of subnational borrowing autonomy.14 As a result, index values of 1.5 or greater were coded as “high borrowing autonomy” (=1) and 1 or less as exhibiting “not high borrowing autonomy” (=0).         "
"24","The interaction terms are created using each of these indicators of multilevel governance are added in turn to a baseline model that tested only the effects of horizontal clarity. Separate models are estimated for each indicator. To the extent that multilevel governance decreases vertical clarity, economic voting should be weakest where multilevel governance is strongest. The models take the following form:"
"25"," Model 1 (with Horizontal Clarity)                        "
"26"," Models 2–8 (adding Vertical Clarity)                        "
"27","All analyses are conducted using logistic regression because the dependent is dichotomous (“voted for any incumbent party”= 1 or “did not vote for incumbent”= 0).16 All models are run using a demographic weight controlling for country specific selection bias. Additionally, countries are weighted such that each contributes an equal number of respondents to the overall analysis. Because all respondents from each country have the same values for aggregate level variables (e.g., federal state or not), it is likely that the error terms violate an assumption of regression analysis that they are independent. As a result, standard errors may be underestimated. To avoid this problem, robust standard errors are estimated for each model by clustering on each country (Rogers 1993).17"
"28","Model 1 in Table 1 shows that the party identification variables exert relatively equal but opposite effects on incumbent vote choice: identification with a (non) governing party (decreases) increases the likelihood of voting for the incumbent. As expected, positive economic evaluations increase support for the incumbent party(ies). As indicated by the significant horizontal clarity‐economic change interaction term, lower horizontal clarity decreases the effects of economic evaluations on incumbent vote choice. This is consistent with the findings of Powell and Whitten (1993) and others (Anderson 2000; Nadeau, Niemi, and Yoshinaka 2002; Whitten and Palmer 1999). Where responsibility for economic outcomes within the national government is least clear, the economic effects are less than in those cases where clarity is greater.         "
"29","Models 2 through 4 in Table 1 show the independent effects of institutional measures of vertical clarity when controlling for the prior effects of clarity within the central government. With the inclusion of these measures, the horizontal clarity interaction remains statistically significant. In addition, the magnitude of the horizontal clarity coefficient remains relatively stable across models 2 through 4.         "
"30","In contrast to the consistent effects of horizontal clarity, the institutional measures of vertical clarity perform less well. In none of the three models does the interaction term achieve statistical significance. While it cannot be concluded that the independent impact of any of these variables is significantly different from zero, the coefficient for each of the three interaction terms, while small, is negative, which is in the expected direction. This implies that there may be some effect of these institutional manifestations of multilevel governance that weakens the effects of economic evaluations in voting for the incumbent national government."
"31"," Table 2 presents results for logistic regressions that include fiscal measures of vertical clarity. Again, regardless of the specific measure of vertical clarity introduced, the interaction term of horizontal clarity and economic change shows consistent and expected effects: the lower the clarity, the less the effect of perceptions of economic change on incumbent vote choice. In contrast to Table 1, however, all but one of the fiscal measures of vertical clarity also exhibit strong effects.         "
"32","Results from Model 5 indicate that economic voting decreases as subnational units receive greater shares of tax revenue as a percentage of the total tax revenue of all governments in that country. Stated differently, as subcentral governments generate more of their income from their own source tax revenues the effects of economic conditions on incumbent vote choice at the national level decreases by 22% (based on the odds ratio). Therefore, based on the commonly used fiscal measure of subnational share of total tax revenue, as subnational governments become more fiscally autonomous economic effects for national government vote choice become correspondingly weaker."
"33","Models 6 and 7 consider effects of the ability to set rates of taxation (Model 6) and both the base and rates of taxation (Model 7), as drawn from the OECD study of tax autonomy of state and local governments. Defined by the extent of tax revenue over which regional and local government's have ability to set the rate of taxation, economic effects in the most decentralized countries are not significantly different from countries that are fiscally centralized. Nonetheless, the direction of the coefficient is consistent with expectations."
"34","Notwithstanding this nonfinding, the extent of subnational government ability to set both the base and rate of taxation exerts a significant impact on the effect of economic evaluations on incumbent vote choice. Indeed, Model 7 shows that the interaction of economic conditions and ability to set the base and rate of taxation is both highly significant and larger than the ability to set the rate of taxation only. Using this measure of multilevel governance, economic voting in the most decentralized cases is reduced by 28%."
"35","Finally, Model 8 presents the results of the last indicator of fiscal decentralization, the ability of subnational governments to borrow. As in all previous models, the horizontal clarity of responsibility interaction term still exerts a negative, and expected, impact on economic effects: where clarity is lower, economic effects are lower. In this last model, results show that the borrowing autonomy of subnational governments has a statistically significant effect on economic voting. In short, in those cases where subnational units are most free to borrow money, the effects of economic perceptions on central government incumbent vote choice are reduced by 26%. Taken together and individually, the results are powerful testimony to the effect of fiscal decentralization on economic voting."
"36","To aid in the interpretation of the findings, linear combinations can be developed that show the magnitude of economic effects under different conditions of horizontal and vertical clarity.18 It is expected that economic voting will be greatest in the most horizontally and vertically clear cases. By extension, economic voting should be weakest in the least horizontally and vertically clear cases. Finally, relative to these extremes, the level of economic voting should be moderate when one of the two dimensions of clarity is attenuated and the other is not.         "
"37"," Table 3 shows results of linear combinations developed as functions of the models estimated in Table 2 that were statistically significant. For example, linear combinations developed using the base and rate autonomy measure from Model 7 indicate that positive economic perceptions increase the likelihood of incumbent support in the most horizontally and vertically clear cases by 103%. Using the same fiscal measure and model, in conditions of high vertical clarity but low horizontal clarity positive economic perceptions only increase the likelihood of supporting the incumbent by 33%. Similarly, under conditions of low vertical clarity and high horizontal clarity favourable economic evaluations increase the chances of voting for a governing party by 46%. Finally, where clarity is lowest on both dimensions, positive economic evaluations have no statistically significant effect on the likelihood of supporting the incumbent. Results for the other statistically significant fiscal measures from Table 2 indicate similar patterns.19"
"38","Further, the linear combinations provide an ability to consider the relative strength of horizontal versus vertical clarity in the reduction of economic voting. In brief, results indicate that horizontal clarity reduces economic voting more than vertical clarity measures. For example, using the revenue measure from Model 5, economic effects in cases of low vertical clarity combined with high horizontal clarity increase the likelihood of voting for the incumbent by 61%. By contrast, the opposite conditions of clarity result in only a 44% increase in the likelihood of supporting the incumbent government. Results for the other measures of vertical decentralization are similar. The implication is that horizontal clarity matters more than vertical clarity in reducing economic effects. However, when chi‐squared tests comparing the odds ratios for each of the possible pairs of linear combinations were performed, the results indicate that the difference in odds ratio magnitude between the two mixed categories of clarity is not statistically significant (p < .1). These findings hold for the other fiscal measures as well. As such, it cannot be concluded with any certainty that horizontal clarity matters more than vertical clarity in minimizing the effects of positive economic perceptions on incumbent vote choice."
"39","The central proposition of this article is that multilevel governance undermines clarity of responsibility to national governments for national economic conditions. This proposition was tested using the theoretical and methodological insights of the economic voting literature and a range of plausible indicators of multilevel governance. Results indicate that economic effects in elections to national parliaments are weakened by the presence of multilevel governance."
"40","The implications of these findings are significant. Since Whitten and Powell's (1993) path‐breaking research regarding the effects of political context and clarity of responsibility on economic voting, research in the political context vein has continued to pursue and “fine‐tune” these initial findings (for example, Anderson 1995, 2000; Nadeau, Niemi, and Yoshinaka 2002; Nishizawa 2003; Whitten and Palmer 1999). Results presented in this article indicate that an important component of political context and clarity of responsibility, namely the vertical dimension of multilevel governance, has been overlooked. Indeed, when taking into account the extent of multilevel governance within domestic contexts (either institutional or fiscal), economic effects are weakened in the most decentralized cases. When considering the linear combination of economic variables from various models, vertical decentralization weakens economic voting. In addition, where clarity is lowest on both the horizontal and vertical dimension the economic effects virtually disappear. Taken together, these results suggest that the current literature on economic voting in advanced industrial democracies has consistently missed an important piece of the puzzle that aids in explaining cross‐national variation in the effect of economic perception on vote choice. As a result, future research on economic voting must take these findings into account.         "
"41","Secondly, the results reveal which indicators of multilevel governance have significant effects on economic voting. While all indicators produce effects in the expected (negative or weakening) direction, as seen in Table 1, none of the institutional indicators exert a statistically significant impact on the effects of economic perceptions. By contrast, all but one of the fiscal measures achieves a reasonable level of significance. These observations are indicative of the nature of multilevel governance that seems to have the greatest effect on economic voting. The mere presence of multilevel institutions is seemingly not enough to minimize the effects of economic perceptions on vote choice. Rather, it is the somewhat more subtle conditions created by degrees of fiscal decentralization that is a more accurate measure of the blurring effects of multilevel governance on economic voting. This finding may not be overly surprising given that one can speak of highly centralized federations as well as highly decentralized unitary states. It is the indicators of fiscal capacity that provide a better cross‐national comparison. These findings should serve as a guide to future research on the effects of multilevel governance on economic voting.         "
"42","A final implication of the findings concerns democratic accountability as considered in the context of multilevel governance. The dispersion of political authority downward to subnational institutions has been lauded for a variety of reasons. Historically, the drafting of multilevel constitutions has been widely seen as an effective means of coping with domestic diversity along ethnic, linguistic, or regional lines (Hechter 2000; Horowitz 2000; Lijphart 1999; McGarry and O'Leary 1993). More recently, advocates of multilevel institutions contend that more effective and efficient governance will result through the wise and intelligent dispersion of political authority (Downs 1999; Hooghe and Marks 2001; Majone 1998; Weingast 1995). However, an understudied area in the literature on multilevel governance centers on the potentially deleterious effects for democratic accountability that multiple loci of political authority may present (but see Schmidt 2002). To the extent that economic voting can be used as a means of operationalizing democratic accountability, the results of the analyses presented here strongly suggest that as political decentralization increases, the ability of citizens to hold the central government accountable for economic (and political) outcomes decreases. As governance around the world becomes both more decentralized and multilayered, issues of democratic accountability and the ability of citizens to cope with these increasing challenges become more pressing, not less.20"
"43","It may be suggested that these findings are to be expected because under increasingly decentralized conditions central governments have less authority and less independent ability to govern.21 It follows from this that central governments should be held less accountable in these conditions. However, this study has considered the effect of perceptions of national economic conditions on incumbent support in national elections. To the extent that national economic conditions should influence national incumbent support, the evidence is clear that multilevel governance and fiscal decentralization weaken this relationship. Indeed, following the logic of a responsibility‐centred model, the comparative study of economic voting for increasingly powerful subnational governments constitutes a fruitful direction for future research in the economic voting field.         "
"44","Finally, as discussed, there are important implications because it is fiscal and not institutional measures of multilevel governance that contribute to weakened economic effects. This is significant when assessed in light of discussion regarding institutional reforms designed to enhance clarity of governmental responsibility and roles. This being the case, it may be, as suggested by the results, that it is not federal institutions or regional elections per se that weaken clarity of responsibility but rather the more nuanced (and less easily reformed) extent of fiscal decentralization. If this implication is correct, the problem of clarity of responsibility, multilevel governance and democratic accountability lies not in multiple institutions of government but rather in dealing with clarifying roles in increasingly decentralized states."
"45","The variable is constructed using a framework previously developed by the Inter‐American Development Bank (1997). An index is created according to four criteria as applied to the most prominent level of sub‐national government. The first is the ability to borrow at all. If sub‐national governments cannot borrow, 2 points are given. The second component considers the authorization required for sub‐national governments to borrow. If borrowing by sub‐national government requires central government approval, 1 point is awarded. If no sub‐national borrowing requires approval, zero points. If the authorization constraints only apply to certain kinds or borrowing or if approval is not always enforced, a score between zero and one is given according to the level of constraint. The third aspect looks at borrowing constraints. If there are numerical constraints on borrowing, such as maximum debt service/revenue ratios, 0.5 points are given, according to the extent of constraint. Finally, does the central government limit the use of debt? If debt may not be used for current expenditures, 0.5 points is awarded. The final value of this variable is determined by subtracting from 2 the additive value of the points awarded to each country. Thus, for example, Canada has a score of 2 (2 – 0 = 2) because there are no restrictions imposed by the central government on provincial borrowing. By contrast, Japan has a value of 0 (2 – 2 = 0) because there are a variety of restraints that the central government places on local government borrowing.               "
