"1","As articulated by Key (1966) and applied by Kramer (1971), the reward‐punishment model of economic voting portrays a naïve electorate who administers electoral sanctions on the basis of economic fluctuations. Voters are expected to reward the incumbent governing party when economic conditions have improved and punish it when they have worsened. In its most basic form the naïve theory of retrospective voting posits an automatic sanctioning process in which voters “mechanically endorse or oppose the ticket headed by the incumbent president whenever the perceived financial trend has improved or deteriorated” (Klorman 1978, 42). In other words, the president is presumptively responsible for the economy and is automatically held accountable for its condition. Far from depicting a reflective and deliberative electorate, the classical reward‐punishment model portrays voters as myopic automatons whose support for the president's party rises and falls with economic performance.         "
"2","The idea of an automatic and homogeneous sanctioning process in the American electorate has been challenged on several fronts. Numerous studies have proposed a heterogeneous sanctioning process in which the effects of economic perceptions—whether egocentric or sociotropic—on political evaluations are conditioned by a variety of individual differences, including feelings of self‐reliance (Sniderman and Brody 1977), social class identification (Weatherford 1978), media consumption (Weatherford 1983), and political sophistication (Gomez and Wilson 2001), as well as by candidate characteristics such incumbency and seniority (Hibbing and Alford 1981).         "
"3","Perhaps the most compelling evidence of a conditional or heterogeneous sanctioning process has surfaced through the work of political psychologists studying responsibility attributions. Advancing an attributional moderation hypothesis, political psychologists have argued that economic perceptions should only influence political evaluations when responsibility for those conditions is attributed to the target of evaluation:"
"4","                        "
"5","Before economic discontents take on political significance, people must either believe that the government produced them or that it is the government's job to remedy them. These beliefs revolve around issues of responsibility … the impact of economic perceptions on political behavior is [moderated] by judgments of accountability. (Peffley 1985, 192)               "
"6","Not only did political psychologists underscore the theoretical centrality of responsibility attributions in the sanctioning process, but they were among the first to incorporate explicitly these attributions into their empirical models. Researchers have found a closer link between egocentric evaluations and political evaluations when responsibility is attributed to societal or governmental factors instead of to personal factors (Abramowitz, Lanoue, and Ramesh 1988; Feldman 1982). Perceptions of national economic conditions exert more influence on presidential approval and vote choice when an attribution of presidential responsibility is made (Lau and Sears 1981; Kinder and Mebane 1983; Peffley and Williams 1985; Rudolph and Grant 2002; Tyler 1982). Similarly, perceptions of state conditions have a greater impact on gubernatorial support when an attribution of gubernatorial responsibility is made (Rudolph 2003; Stein 1990; Svoboda 1995). Collectively, these studies have demonstrated the heterogeneous nature of the sanctioning process.         "
"7","Though incapable of actually modeling the attribution process, macrolevel analyses of presidential approval also point to the importance of responsibility attributions in the sanctioning process. While researchers disagree over whether the sanctioning process is primarily retrospective or prospective in nature (MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson 1992, 1996; Norpoth 1996), each position implies a role for responsibility judgments. Under the retrospective model, political actors are held accountable based on implied judgments of responsibility for past economic performance. Even under a prospective model, judgments about past economic stewardship are expected to influence expectations about future performance (MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson 1996).         "
"8","The concept of responsibility lies at the heart of theories of democratic accountability. Indeed, social psychologists contend that responsibility is the chief mechanism through which individuals hold actors accountable for their conduct. Responsibility, they submit, is the “psychological adhesive” that connects actors to events (Schlenker et al. 1994). Simply put, accountability, if it is to be properly exercised, first requires citizens to make attributions of responsibility. While we have learned a great deal about the political consequences of responsibility attributions, we possess only limited knowledge about the factors that influence the formation of these attributions. The analyses to follow are designed to test a series of hypotheses about the determinants of responsibility attributions for the economy.         "
"9","A number of studies have suggested that divided or coalition government influences the assignment of political responsibility (Anderson 1995, 2000; Lewis‐Beck 1988; Leyden and Borrelli 1995; Lowry, Alt, and Ferree 1998; Paldam 1991; Powell and Whitten 1993). Divided partisan control of government is thought to create difficulties for the reward‐punishment model of economic voting. When opposing political parties control the executive and legislative branches of a government, the concept of “incumbent governing party” is broadened beyond the president's party (Sundquist 1988). If it makes it more difficult for citizens to discern responsibility for policy outcomes, divided government may dilute the strength of the economy‐vote/approval relationship; “[w]ith divided government the responsibility is very muddled…[w]e don't know who to hold accountable, so what do we do, we reelect them all” (Cutler 1988, 489).            "
"10","Research in the American context has produced mixed results on this question. At the state level, researchers have found that economic voting varies by institutional context. One study reports that the effects of state unemployment on electoral support for the gubernatorial party are stronger in states with unified government than in states with divided government (Leyden and Borrelli 1995). Another study finds that the effects of states' fiscal conditions on gubernatorial vote choice are more pronounced after periods of unified party control (Lowry, Alt, and Ferree 1998). Inferred from these results is the conclusion that divided government weakens the economy‐vote linkage by reducing attributions of executive responsibility.            "
"11","At the national level, Norpoth (2001) introduces four models of economic voting under divided government, each of which proposes a unique solution for uncertainties concerning responsibility. A “Split Verdict” model suggests that citizens assign responsibility and administer sanctions on the basis of which party controls the institution whose seats are at stake. A “Hung Jury” model predicts that citizens will be unable to render a responsibility judgment and will, consequently, sanction neither party for economic conditions. The “President Liable” model submits that voters resolve uncertainty by ascribing responsibility to the president and absolving Congress while the “Congress Liable” model contends that voters resolve their dilemma by assigning responsibility to Congress and absolving the president. Analyzing exit‐poll data from 1992 and 1996, Norpoth (2001) finds that the direction of economic effects in both presidential and congressional elections is driven by the presidential party. Inferred from these results is the conclusion that divided government does not inhibit economic voting because it does not reduce attributions of presidential responsibility. Though suggestive, Norpoth's analysis, like those at the state level, does not actually measure individuals' responsibility attributions. It is therefore impossible to directly observe the impact of divided government on citizens' responsibility judgments.            "
"12","Modeling responsibility attributions as a function of states' institutional context, one recent study finds that attributions of gubernatorial responsibility for states' fiscal conditions decline in states with divided government (Rudolph 2003). Does this pattern hold at the national level? While institutional context does not, of course, vary for a single government at a single point in time, perceptions of institutional context do. We should therefore expect citizens who believe that there is divided government to reach different responsibility judgments than those who do not. Specifically, the ratio of presidential to congressional attributions of responsibility should decrease among those who know that partisan control of the government is divided. Though they do not set out to test this hypothesis, Gomez and Wilson (2001) do find that the president's overall share of responsibility attributions is inversely related to a broad measure of political sophistication.1 However, their statistical model prevents them from determining whether this decrease is due to changes in the ratio of presidential to congressional attributions or whether it is simply driven by increases in the proportion of attributions directed at other (nongovernmental) actors. The multinomial probit model of responsibility attributions analyzed in this study permits such theoretical distinctions to be made.            "
"13","Apart from contextual information, responsibility attributions may be shaped by individual‐level traits such as partisanship. Given the importance of responsibility attributions in the sanctioning process, politicians have displayed an understandably keen interest in shaping the formation of such attributions. Cognizant of the fact that responsibility is a double‐edged sword, leaders of both parties seek to persuade citizens that they are responsible for favorable conditions yet innocent of unfavorable ones. The desire to selectively claim or deny responsibility for particular policy outcomes has prompted politicians to engage in attribution gamesmanship (Clarke et al. 1992), blame management strategies (McGraw 1991; Weaver 1986), and to manipulate chains of traceability during the legislative process (Arnold 1990).            "
"14","An information environment containing conflicting messages from competing partisan actors complicates the task of determining who is responsible for economic conditions, particularly when each party controls one branch of government. How do citizens resolve such uncertainty? Social psychologists have noted that people tend to engage in “group‐serving attribution bias” when making causal attributions; that is, they tend to attribute perceived successes to in‐group members and attribute perceived failures to out‐group members (Fiske and Taylor 1991; Hewstone 1989). Since partisan identification is an influential heuristic that helps people to process information and to make political decisions (Bartels 2000; Huckfeldt et al. 1999; Rahn 1993), it may bias citizens' judgments during the attribution process. Indeed, theories of motivated reasoning anticipate that directional goals—the desire to reach a particular conclusion—will bias not only citizens' judgments, but also the process through which those judgments are reached (Kunda 1990; Lodge and Taber 2000).            "
"15","The notion that partisanship biases political judgments about the economy is not without empirical support. Researchers have found that partisans are disproportionately likely to believe that their own party can solve economic problems (Peffley, Feldman, and Sigelman 1987; Sigelman and Knight 1985), to blame presidents from the opposite party for economic problems (Peffley and Williams 1985; Tyler 1982), and to attribute responsibility for favorable conditions to presidents or governors from their own party (Gomez and Wilson 2001; Rudolph 2003). In the present research, the partisan rationalization hypothesis predicts that the effects of economic perceptions on responsibility attributions will be conditioned by respondents' partisanship. When their economic perceptions improve, partisans will be more likely to attribute responsibility to institutions controlled by their own party than to institutions controlled by the opposition party. Conversely, when their economic perceptions worsen, partisans will be more likely to assign responsibility to institutions controlled by the opposition party than to assign it to institutions controlled by their own party.            "
"16","At least since the passage of the Employment Act in 1946, the federal government has openly and formally committed itself to the promotion of economic growth: “The Congress hereby declares that it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practicable means… to foster and promote free competitive enterprise and the general welfare… and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power” (Public Law 304, Norton 1977). Despite this pronouncement, the proper economic role of government remains an open question even among economists (Keech 1995). Beliefs concerning the economic role of government are, at root, driven by one's economic ideology. Historically, liberals tend to support the use of governmental policies and regulations to guide the course of the nation's economy. Economic conservatives, in contrast, have traditionally been less supportive of government intervention in the economy. Given their strong commitment to the principles of economic individualism and self‐reliance, they are more likely to believe that the economy lies beyond the purview of government; the burden of maintaining economic stability belongs instead to the private sector.            "
"17","If economic conservatives are less likely to think that the federal government should play the role of economic manager, they may be less likely to attribute responsibility for the economy to governmental actors. Just as the “ethic of self‐reliance” prevents many people from blaming government for their personal economic problems (Sniderman and Brody 1977), so too may economic conservatism prevent certain people from attributing responsibility for the national economy to government officials. Indeed, one survey of Minnesota residents found that economic conservatives were less likely to hold the president responsible for inflation and unemployment (Peffley and Williams 1985). If responsibility attributions are a function of economic ideology, we should, in the current research, expect to find empirical support for the following hypothesis. As economic conservatism increases, the ratio of nongovernmental to presidential attributions of responsibility will increase.            "
"18","The data analyzed in this study are taken from the 1998 American National Election Studies. The 1998 survey marks the first and most recent occasion on which the NES has employed a closed‐ended instrument that explicitly asks respondents who they believe is responsible for the economy.1 Specifically, respondents were asked who they feel is “the most responsible for the economic conditions of the past few years, the Congress, the President, working people, or business people.”1 This instrument possesses two desirable properties. First, through its avoidance of leading terms like “credit” or “blame,” the question does not presume a robust or sluggish economy and encourages respondents to rely on their own economic perceptions when making attributions of responsibility. Second, the response options allow individuals to choose between multiple governmental and nongovernmental actors. This is essential if one wishes to make distinctions between changes in the ratio of presidential to congressional attributions and in the ratio of presidential to nongovernmental attributions.         "
"19","Informed by the work of Lacy and Paolino (1998), I approximated the effects of institutional context on responsibility attributions by creating a measure of perceived divided government. Only individuals who knew that the Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress and who knew who Al Gore was were classified as knowing that there was divided government. To help distinguish this measure from political sophistication in general, the model includes respondents' education as a control. Following Peffley and Williams (1985), I measured economic conservatism by creating an index of respondents' attitudes concerning the economic role government, including whether the government should spend more money on services, guarantee jobs, or provide economic assistance to minorities. The partisan rationalizations measures were created by forming interactions between respondents' partisanship and, given the nature of the responsibility instrument, their retrospective evaluations of the national economy.         "
"20","To examine the effects of responsibility attributions on political evaluations, I estimated similarly specified models of presidential and congressional approval.1 The attributional moderation hypothesis was tested through a series of interactions between respondents' economic perceptions and their responsibility attributions. Included as controls in these approval models were measures of respondents' partisanship, ideology, political efficacy, education, age, and, in the congressional model, approval of one's own representative.         "
"21","Before addressing the question of how to best model the attribution process, we must first consider the more fundamental question of how citizens think during the attribution process. When judging where to attribute responsibility for the economy, citizens could potentially reach their decision through a variety of decisional paths. First, citizens may structure their attributional choice along a public versus private dimension. Under this scenario, respondents might first choose whether to attribute responsibility to governmental or nongovernmental actors. If an individual chooses the former, he might then choose between specific governmental actors such as Congress or the president. Second, just as retrospective voting models suggest that voters will first decide whether or not to vote for the incumbent before choosing among nonincumbent alternatives (Alvarez and Nagler 1998), so too may individuals attribute responsibility on the basis of incumbency. Individuals may, for example, view the president as the incumbent and group the remaining responses options (Congress, working people, business people) together as nonincumbent alternatives. Finally, individuals may view their attributional choice through the lens of electoral coalitions. With a Republican‐controlled Congress and a Democrat in the White House, respondents might first associate Congress with business people and the president with working people and then choose among one of these pairs of alternatives.         "
"22","Having considered the multiplicity of decisional processes that citizens may follow when making attributional choices, the issue of model specification can now be addressed. How should one model an attributional choice between four unordered alternatives? One possibility would be to model the attribution process as a dichotomous choice between the president and all nonpresidential actors (see Gomez and Wilson 2001). While such models effectively isolate those making attributions of presidential responsibility, they do not permit us to make empirical distinctions among the nonpresidential actors. Such models are suspect on theoretical grounds as well as they are functionally equivalent to modeling vote choice in a multiparty election as a choice between the incumbent and all nonincumbent candidates (Alvarez and Nagler 1998).         "
"23","With four unordered alternatives in the choice set, another possibility would be to model the attribution process using a multinomial logit model (MNL). The MNL model would allow us to make binary comparisons between all pairs of alternatives in the choice set. However, the MNL model is potentially burdened by the fact that it imposes the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption (Alvarez and Nagler 1995, 1998). The IIA property implies that the removal of one alternative from a choice set has no influence on individuals' contemplations among the remaining choices. Violations of IIA are likely to occur when two or more alternatives in a choice set can be viewed as substitutes along some dimension (Hausman and Wise 1978). This could occur in a multiparty contest between a liberal party and two conservative parties as the two conservative parties could be grouped together on ideological grounds (Alvarez and Nagler 1998). It could also occur during an attribution process in which citizens are judging between actors that might be grouped together on the basis of incumbency, governmental status, or electoral coalitions.         "
"24","To best understand citizens' judgments during the attribution process, we require a statistical model that permits comparisons between pairs of alternatives and does not impose the IIA assumption. The multinomial probit (MNP) model satisfies both of these conditions. Like MNL, MNP facilitates comparisons between pairs in a choice set. By estimating error correlations across choices, however, MNP does not impose the IIA assumption (Alvarez and Nagler 1995, 1998; Lacy and Burden 1999, 2002; Lacy and Monson 2002). Given these statistical and theoretical advantages, a multinomial probit model of responsibility attributions was estimated.1"
"25","The distribution of citizens' responsibility attributions is reported in Table 1. As can be seen, a narrow plurality (31.8%) attributes responsibility for the economy to business people, followed by Congress (30.5%), the president (21.5%), and working people (16.1%). These survey marginals make two points abundantly clear. First, the data call into question any assumption that the president is presumptively responsible for economic conditions. Second, the data reveal considerable heterogeneity in citizens' attributions, as none of the four response options captures even one‐third of the sample.1"
"26","The results of the multinomial probit model are reported in Tables 2 and 3.1Table 2 presents the estimated coefficients and standard errors. The coefficients for the baseline choice, “the president,” have been normalized to zero both to identify the model and to facilitate comparisons across equations. Table 3 presents the predicted probabilities of selecting each response option given specified values of the explanatory variables.         "
"27","As shown in Table 2, the likelihood of choosing the president relative to each of the three remaining choices is unaffected by partisanship alone. According to the partisan rationalizations hypothesis, the effects of partisanship on responsibility attributions should be conditioned by citizens' economic perceptions. The results provide strong but qualified support for this expectation. The coefficients representing the interaction between economic perceptions and Democratic identification are negatively signed and statistically significant across all three columns. As Democrats' economic perceptions improve, the proportion of presidential attributions increases relative to those directed at each of the three alternatives.            "
"28","The effects of Democrats' rationalizations are perhaps most clearly illustrated through the changes in choice probabilities in Table 3. Among Democrats who believe that economic conditions are “somewhat worse,” the likelihood of a presidential attribution is only 0.16 while the likelihood of a congressional attribution is 0.30. Among otherwise equal Democrats who believe that economic conditions are “somewhat better,” however, the likelihood of a presidential attribution increases to 0.33 while probability of a congressional attribution declines to 0.20. Consistent with the partisan rationalizations hypothesis, Democrats are more (less) likely to attribute responsibility to the president (Congress) as their perceptions of economic conditions become more favorable.            "
"29","Contrary to expectations, the results provide no evidence of partisan rationalizations among Republicans. The coefficients representing the interaction between economic perceptions and Republican identification are incorrectly signed and statistically indistinguishable from zero in two of three cases.1 Perhaps most surprisingly, the ratio of congressional to presidential attributions does not increase as Republicans' economic perceptions improve. In fact, as Table 3 makes clear, the overall probability of a congressional attribution actually declines as Republicans' economic perceptions shift from somewhat worse to somewhat better. Regardless of whether their economic perceptions are favorable or not, Republicans are more likely to assign responsibility for economic conditions to business people than to any other actor.            "
"30","The results in Table 2 show that responsibility attributions are also shaped by citizens' economic ideology. Relative to the president, individuals are, as expected, more likely to attribute responsibility to business people and working people as their level of economic conservatism increases. Neither consistent nor inconsistent with expectations is the fact that the ratio of congressional to presidential attributions increases with economic conservatism. The precise nature and magnitude of these effects can be observed in Table 3.            "
"31"," Table 3 reports the predicted choice probabilities and first differences for a hypothetical respondent with high or low levels of economic conservatism (+/−1 standard deviation above or below the mean). As economic conservatism moves from low to high, the likelihood of a presidential attribution decreases by 0.09. A similar shift in economic conservatism increases the probability of a business people and working people attribution by 0.06 and 0.03, respectively. The results in Table 3 also reveal that while the ratio of congressional to presidential attributions increases with economic conservatism, the overall probability of congressional attributions is unaffected by changes in economic ideology.            "
"32","The results further demonstrate that divided government has a statistically significant though substantively modest influence on citizens' attributions of responsibility for the economy. The coefficient for perceived divided government is positively signed and statistically significant in two of the three columns. As hypothesized, the ratio of presidential to congressional attributions declines among those who know there is divided government. The ratio of presidential to business people attributions also declines among such individuals while the ratio of presidential to working people attributions is unaffected. Despite controls for partisanship and economic ideology, perceptions of institutional context do matter when it comes to the assignment of responsibility for economic conditions."
"33","As Table 3 makes clear, though, the effects of divided government are relatively modest in magnitude compared to those produced by economic ideology and partisan rationalizations. For individuals who know that there is divided government, the likelihood of a presidential attribution decreases by 0.03. Knowledge of divided government increases the likelihood of congressional and business people attributions by only 0.01 and 0.02, respectively. The overall probability of attributing responsibility to working people remains constant across perceptions of institutional context.            "
"34","To observe the extent to which responsibility attributions moderate the influence of economic perceptions on political evaluations, I estimated similarly specified models of presidential and congressional approval. Table 4 reports the coefficients produced by the presidential approval model. Table 5 presents the predicted probabilities of presidential approval by respondents' economic perceptions and responsibility attributions. Not surprisingly, presidential approval is shaped by respondents' partisanship. Democrats express higher levels of approval for President Clinton than do Independents or Republicans. Similarly, Clinton's approval rating declines as ideological conservatism increases. Approval of Clinton's job performance is inversely related to education and is unaffected by citizens' political efficacy.            "
"35","Of central interest in Table 4 are the effects of citizens' economic perceptions and responsibility attributions. The attributional moderation hypothesis implies that the effects of economic perceptions on presidential approval will be heightened when an attribution of presidential responsibility is made. Consistent with that hypothesis, the interaction between economic perceptions and presidential attributions is both positive and statistically significant. The nature and magnitude of this interaction is most easily observed by examining the changes in predicted probabilities across types of economic perceptions but within each attribution category in Table 5.            "
"36","Consider first the effects of changes in economic perceptions for respondents who make a presidential attribution. For someone who reports that the economy is somewhat worse, the likelihood of strong approval is 0.19. For an otherwise equal respondent who thinks that the economy is somewhat better, the likelihood of strong approval climbs to 0.66, an increase of 0.47. When responsibility is attributed elsewhere, the effects of changing economic perceptions on presidential approval are far less pronounced. When responsibility is attributed to Congress, working people, or business people, an identical change in economic perceptions increases the likelihood of strong approval by only 0.11, 0.13, and 0.06, respectively."
"37","The above results clearly demonstrate that the effects of economic perceptions on presidential approval are much stronger when accompanied by an attribution of presidential responsibility. But does this mean that economic perceptions only influence presidential approval when a presidential attribution is made; that is, is the sanctioning process entirely conditional upon responsibility attributions? This question can be answered by performing joint‐hypothesis (Wald) tests to determine whether the overall effects of economic perceptions, given each of the four possible attributions, are positive. Such tests reveal that, regardless of attribution, the overall effects of economic perceptions on presidential approval are positive and significant at the .10 level or better.1 In other words, the president receives some benefit from improving economic perceptions no matter where responsibility is assigned. As Table 5 makes clear, however, the size of that benefit is considerably larger when an attribution of presidential responsibility is made.            "
"38","The results of the congressional approval model are presented in Tables 6 and 7. Though in the expected direction, the coefficient representing Republicans fails to reach statistical significance. While congressional approval is unmoved by partisanship, it does increase with political conservatism.1 Congressional approval is also a positive function of political efficacy and approval of one's individual representative. The results show that congressional approval is inversely related to respondents' education and age.            "
"39","The effects of economic perceptions and responsibility attributions are again of central concern. Consistent with the attributional moderation hypothesis, the interaction between economic perceptions and congressional attributions is positively signed and statistically significant. This result suggests that the effects of economic perceptions on congressional approval are stronger when an attribution of congressional responsibility is made. Though not anticipated, the interaction between economic perceptions and business people attributions is also positive and significant. The predicted probabilities in Table 7 shed additional light on the nature and magnitude of these interactions.            "
"40","Consider the effects of a change in economic perceptions for respondents making a congressional attribution. As perceptions shift from somewhat worse to somewhat better, the likelihood of expressing strong approval increases by 0.07 and the likelihood of any approval increases by 0.15. For those attributing responsibility to business people, an identical change in economic perceptions increases the likelihood of strong approval by 0.04 and the likelihood of any approval by 0.07. When responsibility is attributed to working people or the president, improving economic perceptions do not increase the likelihood of congressional approval."
"41","The results in Tables 6 and 7 suggest that the effects of economic perceptions on congressional approval are strongest when an attribution of congressional responsibility is made. Are congressional attributions required or does Congress, like the president, receive some benefit from improving economic perceptions regardless of attribution? This question can again be tested through the use of joint‐hypothesis tests. These tests reveal that the overall effects of economic perceptions on congressional approval, given a specific attribution, are only positive when responsibility is attributed to Congress or to business people.1"
"42","This study represents the first attempt to explicitly model attributions of presidential versus congressional responsibility for the economy. Its purpose has been to analyze both the formation and the consequences of citizens' responsibility attributions. Multivariate analysis revealed that responsibility judgments were informed by citizens' economic ideology, partisanship, and perceptions of institutional context. Economic conservatives were less likely to attribute responsibility to the president and more likely to assign it to nongovernmental actors, particularly to business people. Citizens who knew there was divided government were less likely to assign responsibility to the president than those who lacked such contextual information. Perhaps the most curious finding, though, concerns the asymmetric effects of partisanship."
"43","As their economic perceptions became more positive, Democrats became more likely to assign responsibility to the (Democratic) president and less likely to assign it to the (Republican‐controlled) Congress. Consistent with the theories of group‐serving attribution bias and motivated reasoning, this pattern suggests that Democrats credited their own party for perceived economic successes while they blamed the opposition party for perceived economic failures. Strikingly, however, Republicans did not exhibit this same pattern of attribution bias. As their economic perceptions became more positive, Republicans actually became somewhat less likely to attribute responsibility to Congress and more likely to attribute it to the president. Moreover, regardless of their economic perceptions, Republicans were most likely to ascribe responsibility to business people."
"44","What accounts for this asymmetric pattern of partisan rationalizations? Given the importance of the economy as an issue in recent elections, why would Republicans fail to exhibit group‐serving attribution bias? Though the present design is ill equipped to provide definitive answers to these questions, it does permit some informed speculation. One possibility is that Republicans' failure to engage in partisan rationalizations stems from the fact that they are disproportionately likely to be economic conservatives. As a result, a sizable proportion of Republicans attributed responsibility for the economy to business people, leaving a smaller pool of attributions that could be directed at Republican‐controlled institutions. However, this does not account for the fact that Republicans actually became slightly (but not significantly) more likely to attribute responsibility to the president as their economic perceptions improved. A second possibility is that all citizens, regardless of party, become more likely to believe that the president deserves some credit when the economy improves. This could explain why both Republicans and Democrats became more likely to attribute responsibility to the president as their economic perceptions improved. Moreover, this explanation is not inconsistent with the finding that Democrats engaged in partisan rationalizations. Members of the president's party may simply believe that the president deserves a larger share of credit for economic progress. The question of whether Republicans did not engage in partisan rationalizations because of their economic ideology or because a Democrat was in the White House cannot properly be answered without also analyzing responsibility attributions under a Republican administration."
"45","The results demonstrated that responsibility attributions moderate the effects of economic perceptions on both presidential and congressional approval. However, the results further suggested that the effects of responsibility attributions in the sanctioning process vary according to the target of institutional evaluation. While economic perceptions had their greatest impact on presidential approval when an attribution of presidential was made, the president did receive some benefit from improving economic perceptions regardless of where responsibility was attributed. Congress, in contrast, only benefited from improving economic perceptions when responsibility was attributed directly to Congress or to business people."
"46","What explains this discrepancy? Why did the president benefit from a strong economy regardless of responsibility attributions while Congress did not? One possibility concerns the way in which responsibility attributions were measured in this analysis. Recall that the responsibility instrument asked respondents who they felt was most responsible for the economic conditions of the past few years. Respondents were not asked to rank the four alternatives in terms of their relative degrees of responsibility. As a result, we do not know which of the remaining alternatives respondents may have thought was the second most responsible. If the president, as the most visible representative of the federal government, was disproportionately likely to be viewed as the second most responsible actor in the choice set, then this could explain why those attributing primary responsibility to nonpresidential actors might still be inclined to sanction the president for economic fluctuations. Future research might fruitfully consider questions of both primary and relative responsibility.         "
"47","The normative implications of this study's findings for theories of democratic accountability are both encouraging and disquieting. Consider the finding that attributions of presidential responsibility decrease among those who know that partisan control of the government is divided. On the one hand, this finding suggests that citizens have the capacity to act as discriminating and sensible consumers of contextual information when making judgments of political responsibility. The president is, after all, less able to dictate the terms of macroeconomic policy when Congress is controlled by the opposition party and should arguably not be held as responsible for the nation's economic conditions. While the direction of this effect comports well with the expectations of democratic citizenship, its modest magnitude should be a source of some concern. Given the institutional constraints imposed by divided government, one might reasonably ask why contextual considerations were not weighted more heavily in citizens' decisional calculus than they were. The modest nature of this effect is particularly disturbing given the substantial attribution bias produced by citizens' partisan attachments."
