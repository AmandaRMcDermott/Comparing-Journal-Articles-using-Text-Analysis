"1","Official calculations suggest that Social Security's yearly surplus will end around 2017 and the resulting drawdown of its accumulated Trust Fund will be completed around 2041 (2008 Annual Trustees Report). Projections over a 75‐year horizon estimate the unfunded liability to be approximately $4.3 trillion in present value, approximately $13.6 trillion over an infinite horizon. Social Security expenditures as a proportion of GDP are expected to increase 41% between 2000 and 2050 (Galasso 2006, 26).         "
"2","The typical proposal to bring Social Security revenue and obligations in balance (e.g., Diamond and Orszag 2004) is actuarially based, advocating adjustments to payroll tax rates, benefit schedules, the inflation indexing formula for benefits, the taxable wage base, and the normal retirement age.1 These kinds of “parametric” changes were the focus of the last major revamping of Social Security in 1983, which was designed to ensure solvency for 75 years (National Commission 1982). Like the actuarial reforms advocated now, those changes imposed net benefit reductions on future retirees.         "
"3","Yet granting their often controversial technical assumptions, purely actuarial evaluations are still problematic because they neglect the political context in which Social Security operates. Any proposal to retrench Social Security must be politically as well as actuarially sustainable. Otherwise, political pressure will force policymakers to retract it, leaving the long‐term problem of intergenerational transfers unresolved. Moreover, the prospect of a policy reversal may induce current workers to reduce their savings in anticipation of continued benefits, making a reversal even more likely (for estimates of the impact of moral hazard, see, e.g., Gokhale, Kotlikoff, and Sabelhaus 1996).         "
"4","Tax increases to prefund anticipated outlays raise similar issues. The problem is that the revenues they generate are fungible: historically, federal spending is tied to a unified budget reflecting both ordinary tax and payroll tax receipts. Spending increases with payroll tax revenue (e.g., Nataraj and Shoven 2004; Smetters 2004; cf. Diamond 2005; Hungerford 2005). If so, dedicated tax increases produce greater resources for Social Security in terms of current cash flow but not on an accrual basis.2 In this sense, the conventional wisdom that the Trust Fund is being spent rather than accumulated (e.g., Concord Coalition 2005) is correct. Even Social Security's funded liabilities are problematic.         "
"5","In sum, determining how Social Security can be made sustainable is more than an accounting exercise. Like the existing policy, any suggested changes must pass political muster. And all reforms imply additional reductions in net benefits for those who have paid taxes linked to the original benefits schedule. So in order to understand support for Social Security, let alone the prospects for potential reform, one must explain why the large transfers from the young to the old already entailed by the current program have been politically acceptable, particularly with a median voter age of 47 (Galasso 2006, 35). The explanation developed here focuses on the role of expected upward mobility in determining conditions under which a majority of voters, composed of workers and retirees, will support a reduced Social Security program despite their altruistic concern for their children and grandchildren.         "
"6","If parents care about their children, why do they support Social Security's current financial structure? The issue, again, is not whether small parametric changes can put Social Security on a sound financial footing, that is to say, whether there is a Social Security “crisis.” Rather, the issue is why there is political support for the existing systematic intergenerational transfer, which the leading reform proposals explicitly or implicitly increase. True, Social Security's financial problems are dwarfed by Medicare's. Yet Medicare is more complicated and controversial to model. Social Security offers us better access to a very profound political puzzle."
"7","One explanation appeals to the combination of conservative U.S. political institutions and the resistance to Social Security reform by external groups like unions and the AARP (e.g., Bonoli 2000; Pierson 1996, 164–65). However, the puzzle is by no means unique to the United States, and the leading groups resisting change represent Social Security beneficiaries (see Campbell 2003; Day 1990, 112–30) who presumably care about their children. Moreover, resistance to change does not explain why altruistic voters would have produced the status quo being protected.         "
"8","A simpler answer to the puzzle is that current beneficiaries have contradictory and uninformed beliefs (Retirement Confidence Survey 2006), compartmentalizing concern for their children and concern for their own disposable income. A convenient feature of this kind of explanation is its ability to explain every possible behavior beneficiaries might exhibit.         "
"9","Nevertheless, the public and particularly the elderly seem relatively well informed about Social Security (Jacobs and Shapiro 1998). Even benefit reductions related to arcane miscalculations of Social Security benefits can generate extraordinary political opposition (Campbell 2003, 105). More generally, systematic analysis suggests that senior citizens are aware of the impact of social insurance programs (Campbell 2003). Likewise, the majority of workers whose payroll taxes exceed their income taxes presumably understand some of the economic ramifications of these issues (Tabellini 2000, 523–24). Most important, a large majority of workers (67%) seems to understand that Social Security benefits will diminish in the future (Retirement Confidence Survey 2006), yet support for the program is robust (Jacobs and Shapiro 1998). In any case, if individuals are myopic, their myopia, we will see, varies by age, relation of personal income to the mean, and changes in income mobility.         "
"10","Finally, some question whether there is a puzzle at all: parents, it has been argued, are not in fact particularly financially altruistic toward their children. This explanation unfolds in the broader context of the political economy of public deficits. Social Security debt would not in fact burden future generations if the current generation increased its savings sufficiently to produce a bequest offsetting the additional taxes that will be imposed on its descendants. However, there is broad agreement that social security programs reduce savings, albeit perhaps modestly (e.g., Disney 2006; Gokhale, Kotlikoff, and Sabelhaus 1996).3 Further, since Social Security benefits are provided as an annuity, this form of wealth cannot be bequeathed. Yet the elderly have not responded by increasing their purchase of life insurance, which of necessity is bequeathed (Auerbach et al. 2001; cf. Becker and Murphy 1988, 3–4).         "
"11","These findings suggest that the Social Security puzzle is not an artifact of its official balance sheet: private bequests do not offset the program's intergenerational transfers. By the same token, these findings do not refute the commonsense assumption of parental altruism as long as one does not expect their altruism to be supererogatory. For given the post‐WWII growth of the U.S. economy, most members of the current generation can rationally expect their descendants to have higher incomes (Feldstein 1995, 410), but even altruistic parents may not want their descendants to consume more than or even as much as they do. Parental altruism, in other words, is consistent with dissaving (Becker and Murphy 1988, 4). On the other hand, since the projected growth in Social Security's unfunded liability exceeds projected economic growth (2008 Annual Trustees Report), the Social Security puzzle remains. The government's largest program poses a genuine financial problem for children and grandchildren even after adjusting for economic growth.         "
"12","Intergenerational altruism, in short, does not preclude a political struggle in which the older generation successfully attempts to transfer wealth to itself. According to Mulligan and Sala‐i‐Martin's (1999b)“gerontocracy” model of intergenerational transfers, this struggle, unalloyed by altruism, plays out to the advantage of the elderly. Retirement translates into lower opportunity costs of leisure activity, including the lobbying and voting that help secure Social Security benefits (see also Campbell 2003, 98–103; Day 1990, 36–62). Since these benefits are conditioned on retirement, Social Security itself helps maintain the competitive advantage enjoyed by the organizations mobilizing the elderly (see Schulz and Binstock 2006, 213–18; for countervailing institutional factors, see Pampel 1994).         "
"13","Despite its many strengths, the gerontocracy model leaves some important gaps. For example, noting that spending on youth, like spending on the elderly, has increased out of proportion to demographics, Mulligan and Sala‐i‐Martin (1999b, 5) of course do not attribute this result to “pedocracy” but rather to the preferences of the middle aged. Yet one plausible reason for these preferences is parental altruism, which contradicts the pure transfer motive embedded in the gerontocracy model. Conversely, why do the young favor Social Security? The 1992 ANES found that 86% of respondents ages 18–34 oppose taxes on Social Security benefits, as do 88% of those 35–64, while 87% of those 65 and older oppose them. The respective percentages for those who believe benefits are too low are 67%, 61%, and 47%. Similarly, the breakdown for supporting increased federal spending on Social Security is 49%, 50%, and 44% (Campbell and Lynch 2002, 36; see also MacManus 1996, 154–56; Schulz and Binstock 2006, 208). While surveys of this type do not force respondents to make the tradeoffs critical to actual political decisions (although see Jacobs and Shapiro 1998), these responses offer little evidence of pure intergenerational conflict.4"
"14","Even in the absence of altruism, the elderly's exploitation of their organizational advantages will approach political limits due to the resulting inefficiencies and decreasing productivity of the young (Esping‐Andersen and Sarasa 2002). Yet Bohn (2005; also Cooley and Soares 1999) argues in a general equilibrium setting that the current Social Security benefit structure is politically sustainable on a pay‐as‐you‐go (PAYG) basis since U.S. voters of median age or higher will support the necessary tax increases (Galasso 2006 makes a parallel argument).5 To reach this result, he assumes that in calculating the program's future net benefits voters treat their previous contributions as sunk costs. Support for the program from those below retirement age is sustained each period by trigger strategies entailing the destruction of the system if any cohort of retirees fails to receive the appropriate benefits.         "
"15","By modeling Social Security as a repeated noncooperative game, Bohn (2005) attempts to show how an implicit intergenerational compact can be sustained in the absence of altruism. Whether this compact would in fact survive the high tax rates needed to maintain it is unclear (Joines 1999).6 The trigger strategy solution raises other, more technical issues like the multiplicity of the resulting game‐theoretic equilibria (Galasso and Profeta 2002, 12), the extent to which these strategies are contingent on the predicted reactions of future generations, and the fact that these particular solutions are not renegotiation proof (Fudenberg and Tirole 1991, 174–82; Tabellini 2000, 524).7"
"16","In any case, Bohn's motivation for sidestepping altruism is clear. “Altruism is almost too powerful to be interesting: social security is obviously viable if the young are eager to make transfers to the old” (Bohn 2005, 49). The problem with his substitute explanation is that altruism also flows in the other direction. When neglecting their own sunk costs at each decision point, which rationality certainly requires voters to do, they must also neglect the new “sunk costs” they impose on their descendants. Similarly, insofar as the young support Social Security as a means to provide for their parents and themselves, they thereby support a program that will impose worse terms on their own children.         "
"17","In sum, it is doubtful that models of intergenerational conflict can simply replace the commonsense axiom of intergenerational altruism. It is also doubtful that models invoking simple altruism can, in and of themselves, replace conflict models. For these conflict models did not arise out of thin air. Given the scale of the redistribution projected for the remainder of this century, one might have expected citizens with even garden‐variety parental altruism to have intervened. Their failure to do so still poses a puzzle."
"18","Social Security represents a substantial intergenerational transfer of wealth. The 1983 changes, which significantly increased payroll taxes and extended the normal retirement age, implied official recognition that, due to demographics and the limits of economic growth, this transfer could not be duplicated for subsequent beneficiaries. Yet even those pared‐down benefits and scheduled transfers cannot be sustained under the present system. Political support for this actuarial fact is the political puzzle."
"19","An important building block of my explanation for the political dynamics of Social Security is a modified version of Bénabou and Ok's (2001) model of voting on redistribution. Bénabou and Ok posit a standard income mobility process in which expected future income is a positive function of current income but increases at a decreasing rate, a process somewhat akin to regression to the mean. Given this central assumption and a few others, they show, somewhat paradoxically, that a majority of voters may oppose long‐term redistribution because they rationally expect to have above‐average incomes (also see Alesina and Ferrara 2005; Lind 2005, 121–22). The implication of this Prospect of Upward Mobility (POUM) hypothesis for a progressive program like Social Security is immediate. Voters who currently benefit from the progressivity of Social Security may be willing to reduce future net benefits to the extent they expect this same redistribution to hurt their descendants.         "
"20","The solution posed here, then, trades on the fact that the Social Security program redistributes intragenerationally as well as intergenerationally. No doubt Social Security's official role as an insurance program is the foundation for its support. But, I suggest, support for the additional dimension of intergenerational transfer beyond what underlying economic growth would justify is due to each generation's perception that its descendants will find the intragenerational insurance less valuable."
"21","A simple application to U.S. income data and the U.S. income mobility process will help illustrate how the voters' calculations might work. Bénabou and Ok (2001) summarize the U.S. case using a three‐class household income distribution—$16,000, $36,000, and $91,000—with stationary transition matrix            "
"22","Suppose that U.S. incomes have converged to the unique distribution {.33, .44, .23} that is invariant to these transitions (of course the incomes of particular households or their descendants change). Given this stationary distribution, median income, $36,000, is lower than per capita income, $42,050. In fact 77% of the population is poorer than average. Yet the expected income of the middle class, $45,625, is above average, as is the expected income of the upper class, $58,000. In other words, 67% of the population rationally expects their children to have above‐average incomes. Under these circumstances, over three‐fourths of the population would support redistribution in the current period but, if calculations are risk‐neutral, a supermajority would reject a future policy of redistribution.9"
"23","Of course, the typical voter is not risk‐neutral and Social Security represents an important form of insurance against a bad income history.10 To see the impact of the POUM hypothesis in this setting, consider the situation of risk‐averse voters who, to take a relatively stark example, are offered the option of restructuring Social Security into a means‐tested program. The resulting income floor may be attractive to a voter who expects her descendants to benefit from income mobility but is worried about the downside risks they will nonetheless face. Even in this stark form, the restructuring proposal can dominate both laissez‐faire and complete redistribution.11"
"24","Assume each individual has the standard utility function             "
"25","Suppose the current 12.4% Social Security tax applies to all middle‐class incomes and up to $80,400 of upper‐class incomes.13 The proceeds are transferred only to retirees in the lowest class. For risk parameters larger than 0.35, indeed up to 25, this alternative system produces greater expected utility for the middle class than does laissez‐faire or complete redistribution. According to this calculation, therefore, a pure insurance version of Social Security with greater upside incentives would be politically and financially sustainable on a PAYG basis. Indeed one argument for social insurance generally is that it encourages risk taking (e.g., Bird 1998).         "
"26","The preceding section illustrated the hypothetical impact of the POUM process on support for Social Security. This section moves toward testability by developing a stylized political‐economic model of the U.S. Social Security program focusing on its predominantly PAYG structure. The model program has two key features: it is politically viable in the short run, gathering majority support, yet it can undergo retrenchment in the long run even though voters throughout are altruistic toward their parents and children. The model is based on Tabellini (2000), but modified to focus on POUM considerations. The formal details to follow are necessary, in part, because given available data the POUM hypothesis cannot be tested directly, but related hypotheses derived from the model can be tested.         "
"27","Each period three generations coexist: children, their working parents, and their retired grandparents. Each child has one parent and lives for three periods. The net rate of population growth is n with each parent producing 1 +n children. A good ct is jointly consumed at time t by each dependent child and working parent. With i indexing families, generation t children inherit productive endowments from their generation t−1 parents, so their endowments at time t are eitt=eit−1t. The cumulative distribution of eitt, |eitt| < 1, is given by the known function Gt(·) having a 0 mean and, like the standard income distribution, a lower median. At time t the utility of each t−1 generation working parent in the ith family is described by            "
"28","At time t the utility of each t− 2 generation retiree in the ith family is described by            "
"29","Because endowments are unequally distributed and the retirement benefit is lump sum, this Social Security program's central function is to provide individuals with retirement insurance in the event they have low productivity as workers. Insurance can be useful since neither a parent nor a grandparent can fully predict the impact of her (grand)children's endowments on their earning capacity as workers. To be precise, childhood endowments are governed by a concave stochastic transition function f:            "
"30","From (1)–(4), optimal gifts and bequests satisfy U′(cit) ≤ 1/δ and U′(cit) ≥α. In light of the empirical findings discussed above, I follow Tabellini (2000) in shutting down acts of private altruism by assuming these inequalities are strict for all feasible income: U′(0) < 1/δ and , where  is the maximum (supremum) value of eit−1t. With the government budget balanced each period and with mean endowment 0, gt=τt(1 +n)w.         "
"31","To determine the additional equilibrium conditions, note that optimal savings are given by             "
"32","In period t workers and retirees determine the t + 1 payroll tax by majority vote which, indirectly, is a vote on the size of those workers' Social Security benefits and the tax burden of their children. This delay in implementation reflects the common understanding that significant changes in the Social Security program will allow sufficient time for older workers to adjust their retirement plans, which Galasso (2006, 55 and 192) interprets as a divide‐and‐conquer strategy across age groups. Voters choose with respect to one policy dimension, the tax level, not the timing of the tax or the retirement age.         "
"33","To find the optimal tax for workers and retirees, substitute the equilibrium conditions into the utility functions of working parents and retirees, respectively:             "
"34","After substituting for Pit + 1 and Pit + 2 and using the law of iterated expectations and the equilibrium conditions, (7a) yields            "
"35","Obviously, τt+ 1 not only determines the tax burden to be shouldered by the children of time t working parents but has implications for the tax decisions made by these children, their children, and so on via iterations on (6a). However, the dawn of a new period reinitializes the decision problem which otherwise is structurally identical to the one characterized here: with PAYG, binding tax decisions are made one period at a time. The voter's interest in the endowment of her children and grandchildren only concerns how their expected endowment compares to the average endowment of others in the same generation. That is where the uncertainty lies, not with the endowment of the median voter. In this sense, there is nothing for a voter to be strategic about.         "
"36","The interpretation of equation (8) is clearest when γ < 1, which will be assumed (Galasso 2006, 224 estimates γ= 0.75). In this case, the impact of a tax increase on each voter's expected utility is monotonically negative in expected endowment. If her (grand)child's expected endowment is below average (Eteitt + 1 < 0) and small enough, the relevant voter will unequivocally support more spending on Social Security. But as expected endowment increases, individual support turns to opposition.         "
"37","What is the political result? Consider a simple majority‐rule voting game played by an electorate consisting of all the workers and retirees and two candidates who propose alternative tax rates. Since (7a) and (7b) are linear in expected endowment it can be shown that the resulting preferences are single‐peaked and the additional second‐order conditions for an optimal tax are satisfied (see, e.g., Tabellini 2000, 530). This equilibrium tax rate is determined by the median voter's optimum. A strictly positive rate implies that the Social Security program is sustainable at some level.         "
"38","Designate the expected endowment of the children and grandchildren of the median voters by Etemt + 1 (expected because mobility is a stochastic process) and the number of retirees by NR. The fact that there are 1 +n as many workers as retirees and the simple relation between the two generations' utility lead to an implicit definition of the median voters:            "
"39","Using equation (8), the economic equilibrium condition It+ 1=U′(cit + 1), and setting (7a) or (7b) to 0, Et(emt + 1) can be associated with equilibrium consumption c*t+ 1 such that            "
"40","Although It+ 1=U′(cit + 1) > α, for plausible values of It+ 1 and a sufficiently low degree of altruism toward children (δ < 0.5), 1 − 2δ (1 −α+U′(cit + 1)) > 0. Thus the numerator is positive. Also, by assumption, γ < 1, so the denominator is positive as well. Then applying the implicit function theorem to (10), ∂τt+ 1/∂Et(emt+ 1) < 0 (with an interior optimum).18 In addition, using the chain rule:            "
"41","By definition Gt(·) is also strictly increasing, so c*t+ 1 is unique. Finally, since the equilibrium conditions require            "
"42","Thus the Social Security program survives when the optimal tax creates a wedge between the wage and equilibrium consumption of a median voter's children or grandchildren, that is, when c*t+ 1 < w.19 To determine whether this condition is in fact satisfied, define Et(ewt + 1) as the result of substituting w for c*t+ 1 in the right‐hand side of equation (10). Using equations (9)–(11) and the fact that ∂Gt/∂c*t+ 1 > 0, there is a positive tax when this level of tax‐free consumption pushes the left‐hand side of equation (9) beyond the voting equilibrium, that is, when            "
"43","Whether the Social Security program is politically sustainable, in short, depends on the expected distribution of endowments.20 However, even when the tax is positive the logic of the POUM hypothesis puts downward pressure on the actual rate. Specifically, since ∂τt+ 1/∂Et(emt + 1) < 0, Social Security taxes decline when the expected endowment increases. Whether this implies ever declining Social Security taxes and eventually a corner solution dictating τ*t+j= 0 for some j depends on technical features of the income transition process (Bénabou and Ok 2001). During the period 1969–76, for example, the U.S. income distribution was almost stationary whereas in the period 1979–86 it became more skewed (Bénabou and Ok 2001, 478). If the latter pattern continues, the model predicts worsening terms for each generation of Social Security recipients. But declining mobility in the United States would blunt or even negate this implication.         "
"44","The main point is that insofar as parents and grandparents rationally expect their children and grandchildren to have a larger endowment they will support lower payroll taxes. Indeed, as with Bénabou and Ok's (2001) analysis of U.S. data, the median endowment can remain perpetually below the mean while income dynamics push the expected mean below the median. In that case, altruistic median voters support reductions in their children's Social Security program. To state the basic conclusion more precisely, the following statements are mutually consistent: (1) knowing what they know at time t, time t median workers would have voted at time t − 1 for the actual time t payroll tax, (2) time t median retirees did in fact vote for it, and (3) if the endowment of time t + 1 median workers were identical to the endowment of time t median workers, time t median workers and retirees would vote to extend the time t tax to time t + 1, but (4) based on expectations about endowments, time t median workers and retirees vote to reduce or eliminate the time t+ 1 tax. Altruistic retirees who support Social Security for themselves vote to trim or eliminate it for their children or grandchildren.21"
"45","When taxes decline, each new retiree has paid higher taxes in support of her parent's generation than the taxes now supporting her. Strictly speaking, within the model these declining Social Security taxes do not imply that the new retiree experiences a negative net lifetime return on Social Security taxes paid. The qualifier is necessary since, theoretically, population and productivity growth could offset the impact of declining tax rates. But this theoretical possibility is not a serious empirical restriction: the positive impact of U.S. growth has in fact been trumped by the increasing longevity of retirees.22"
"46","Even though net benefits decline with declining tax rates, the distinct interests of workers and their children are not expressed in the voting booth since dependent children do not vote. Workers and retirees, on the other hand, cannot know the actual endowments their (grand)children will bring to the workplace. So voters with below‐average incomes can still support future reductions in net Social Security benefits to the extent they expect their descendants to have above‐average incomes. True, those who already enjoy above‐average incomes will also be inclined to oppose redistribution. However, the income mobility process is characterized by an increasing concave function. Expected decreases in income for those at the upper end are relatively larger than expected increases for those at the lower end."
"47","Finally, note the crucial role played by altruism in generating these results. For the limiting case of no altruism—when α=δ= 0—equation (8) says that workers' utility increases with increases in taxes on their children, while equation (7b) says that retirees are indifferent to taxes that will not change their own benefits.         "
"48","The model in the preceding section suggests why the current Social Security program is politically sustainable despite the ongoing transfer of wealth from the young to the old that the program entails. Unfortunately, it is not possible to test this proposed explanation directly: although changes in Social Security are a foregone conclusion, U.S. citizens have never been offered a direct referendum on the program, let alone a systematic comparison of a fully articulated set of reform proposals."
"49","Yet it is possible to determine whether, on the margin, the kinds of intergenerational forces identified by the model—relative income, mobility, and age—have their expected impact on surveyed support. Many considerations factor into any individual's decision regarding this social insurance program, not the least of which are the decision maker's own degree of risk aversion and how her discount rate interacts with the projected time when descendants' incomes exceed the mean. Consequently, I frame the appropriate inferences about expressed support for Social Security in terms of relative probabilities."
"50","Macrolevel changes also affect the political sustainability of Social Security. Relative labor productivity, the skills profile of immigrants, patterns of capital formation, and a host of other factors can change the distribution of income‐producing endowments. Social Security taxes, in turn, influence savings and capital formation. All of these considerations may have far‐reaching implications for the politics of Social Security."
"51","Here the model and empirical analysis focus on the tail end of the process, the individual‐level forces affecting the respondent's specific decision problem. The model embeds individuals in a closed political economy yielding general equilibrium prices and outcomes.23 The resulting model is structural in the sense that it is rooted in the individual's fundamental preferences and opportunities. As a result, the structure of the individual's decisions about Social Security can be assumed to be invariant to macrolevel forces influencing the decision's outcome so long as their impact is channeled through endowments or wages.         "
"52","That said, only a model incorporating the kinds of macrolevel factors just noted can fully explain the level of support for Social Security and thereby predict its political future. Unfortunately, available data are insufficient to estimate the key political parameters of such a model. The ANES data used here, for example, are not panel data and, if aggregated, would yield a mere nine observations. But these individual‐level data are sufficient to confirm whether POUM‐based forces affect individual support as hypothesized.24"
"53","While the distribution of endowments is a key driver in the model, they are unobservable. Fortunately, endowments are positively associated with income and income is observable. The resulting distribution of income has implications for political behavior since Social Security in the model, as in practice, is redistributive: the tax burden is a positive function of endowment but, in the model, benefits are distributed in equal lump‐sum amounts. Accordingly:"
"54","                        "
"55"," H1: The higher individuals' incomes, the less likely are they to support Social Security.                  "
"56","A corollary is that individuals with above‐mean incomes are less likely to support Social Security than those with below‐mean incomes. Although a trivial weakening of the hypothesis, this corollary more precisely reflects the model's basic political logic centering on the individual's relation to mean income: a uniform proportional tax with an equal lump‐sum distribution of revenue will benefit only those with below‐mean incomes and harm only those with above‐mean incomes.25 When coupled with the POUM hypothesis, the same redistributive logic implies that some of those with below‐average income may rationally expect their descendants to enjoy above‐average income and therefore be harmed by redistribution. This expectation is determined by the transition process governing income:26"
"57","                        "
"58"," H2: The greater the degree of income mobility, the less likely are individuals with below‐mean income to support Social Security.                  "
"59","There is a parallel hypothesis relating mobility and income itself, which a parallel empirical analysis confirms."
"60","Finally, comparing the financial calculations of the two voting generations, we found above that the elderly receive lower marginal utility from the payroll tax than do workers. Accordingly:         "
"61","                        "
"62"," H3: Ceteris paribus there is a tipping point at which age reduces relative support for Social Security.                  "
"63","While surveyed support for Social Security is extremely high, there certainly is evidence that this support takes into account the program's financial weakness. For example, a majority of Americans do not believe Social Security will pay them the benefits currently promised (Schulz and Binstock 2006, 5). The public's realism provides a context for interpreting the relevant question in the 1984–2000 cumulative ANES concerning support for current Social Security spending.27 But does it provide sufficient leverage for assessing attitudes toward future Social Security program spending?         "
"64","Intuitively, surveyed support for current Social Security spending should be associated with support for future spending. How does this natural interpretation square with the model's thesis that support for the current program does not imply opposition to future reductions? First, mobility notwithstanding, the financial circumstances of parents and children are still correlated. In particular, the poorer parents who also expect their children to have below‐average endowments will be consistent in their support of Social Security over time, as the parents with above‐average endowments will be consistent in their opposition."
"65","Second, it is important to recognize that model workers and retirees do link their current and future support for Social Security despite the fact that the model program is fully PAYG, as the actual program essentially is. PAYG means that this year's spending does not directly determine next year's. From the economic equilibrium conditions (5), however, the taxes supporting current retirees affect current taxpayers' after‐tax savings. Their savings, in turn, affect their future consumption as retirees (see equations (4) and (5)). Specifically, ceteris paribus higher current Social Security spending reduces workers' savings. This reduces their consumption as retirees. In general Social Security benefits can be increased by way of response only by increasing future Social Security spending. Of course, a future spending increase that benefits current workers also benefits their altruistic retired parents.         "
"66","In short, although the equilibrium conditions imply that higher current spending reduces the after‐tax income of current workers, those workers and retirees willing to support higher current spending will support future spending increases ceteris paribus. Granted, the ceteris paribus condition, which controls for the level of altruism among other things, makes it more difficult to link current surveyed support and future support in absolute terms. Yet the model does imply that the factors affecting future support—age, income, mobility, and income position—affect current support the same way. The question about current spending, then, can be used to assess the model.         "
"67","I examine the three hypotheses using ordered logit. The dependent variable SocSec measures the respondent's level of support for Social Security and is coded 0 if the respondent supports decreased spending, 1 if he or she supports keeping spending the same, and 2 if he or she supports increased spending. Exogenous variables are Income, CPI‐adjusted family income in thousands of dollars based on the income midpoint of each of the five percentile ranges except for the top coded 96th to 100th percentile; BelowMean, coded 1 if Income is less than mean family income calculated from U.S. Census Bureau Historical Table F‐5, 0 if not; Mobility, a measure of income mobility for the sample year;28MobilBlwMean, an interaction of Mobility and BelowMean; Age; Age2; Male (to control for Social Security's negative actuarial impact on men relative to women), coded 1 if male, 0 if female; AfricanAm (to control for independent regard for government programs; an ideology variable produces parallel results), coded 1 if African American, 0 if not; Education (to control for information about Social Security finances; see Jacobs and Shapiro 1998), coded 1 for grade school, 2 for high school, 3 for some college, and 4 for college, including advanced degree; Child, coded 1 if respondent has a child, 0 if not (the theoretical impact of this control variable is unclear: it may affect the parent's time horizon relative to those who will not have children; current and future children can provide gifts and services to parents, reducing the importance of Social Security to current parents; and current children may be covered by Social Security insurance for survivors and the disabled); and dummy variables for year (using 1984 as the base year). The results are reported in Table 1 (missing years dropped due to multicollinearity).         "
"68"," Table 1 provides support for all three hypotheses.29 One, as predicted, family income is negatively associated with support for Social Security.30 Two, setting Mobility artificially to 0, we see that having income below the mean with no chance of advancement increases support for Social Security. This, again, reflects the program's redistributive dimension. However, with increasing mobility, support for Social Security decreases among those with income below the mean (the relevant variables are now BelowMean and MobilBlwMean). Three, Age exhibits an inflection point at which support for Social Security begins to decline.31 It is also worth noting that the negative coefficient on Male suggests that men and women behave as rational actuaries.         "
"69"," Table 2 reports the results of simulations using CLARIFY (Tomz, Wittenberg, and King 2003) to estimate both the impact of the hypothesized influences on Social Security support and the inflection point for Age.         "
"70","Each of these simulations determines how a change in a key variable changes the probability of the response associated with each of the three levels of support for Social Security. The simulation for Income holds all other variables at their means and increases the value of Income from its mean to one standard deviation above. This first difference generates a noteworthy percentage increase in the probability of supporting reduced Social Security spending, a smaller increase for current spending, and a smaller decrease in the probability of supporting spending increases. Evidently the small increase in support for current spending reflects the simulated decline in support for increased spending.         "
"71","The simulation for BelowMean↓ examines the effect of moving from above‐average to below‐average income.32 Specifically, it traces the impact of a shift from above‐mean income (value = 0) to below‐mean income (value = 1) while the interaction term MobilBlwMean shifts from a value of 0, because the income component is 0, to a value equal to the mean of Mobility. These results indicate modest increases in support for Social Security spending and, in particular, a shift from maintaining to increasing spending (the confidence interval reflects a two‐tailed test).         "
"72","The result for the MobilBlwMean↑ variable reflects a change in Mobility from its mean to one standard deviation above for those who have a below‐mean income. As hypothesized, this change increases opposition to greater Social Security spending, albeit modestly.         "
"73","Equally striking, support for Social Security declines with age once middle age is reached. There is an inflection point. As suggested by the poll results cited above, the effect is most dramatic at age 60 and over, which is consistent with the model and with the mean retirement age of 62 for Social Security recipients (Galasso 2006, 30).         "
"74","In short, there is a noteworthy consistency in results for each of the variables at each level of response. These findings suggest that the POUM‐based model successfully identifies forces acting on citizens for whom altruism coexists with intergenerational conflicts of interest. Of course, the model's hypotheses are not designed to offer a complete explanation of sampled attitudes toward Social Security. Rather they address one puzzle about these attitudes: continuing support despite increasingly difficult financial circumstances for the program and the promise of reduced net benefits in the future.33 The POUM hypothesis may help explain the public's equanimity in the face of these difficulties.         "
"75","In the eyes of many students of social security programs, the elderly are the victors in an intergenerational political conflict. Yet in the United States there is little reflection of this conflict in survey data. A politically oriented Sherlock Holmes might well wonder why this particular dog has not barked. After all, a proposal by parents to increase their income by abolishing child labor laws would generate considerable controversy. What about the case of parents who support a version of Social Security that also hands them their children's earned income? We do not have to blame misinformation or weak family values. Instead, voters may rationally expect that, due to the prospect of upward mobility, Social Security's net value to their children will decrease. The pace of mobility, in other words, exceeds the pace of Social Security's actuarial decline."
"76","This article provides suggestive evidence from the United States for a variant of the POUM hypothesis in which overlapping generations are assumed to care for one another. This hypothesis has a number of implications, each of which the data support. Those with higher incomes will be less inclined to support Social Security. This hypothesis is not surprising. Nor is the corollary prediction that having a below‐average income will increase support for Social Security. Yet as income mobility increases, those with below‐average incomes are predicted to reduce their support. The U.S. data are consistent with this more interesting conclusion. They are also consistent with the hypothesis that the elderly will exhibit relatively lower support for Social Security, a challenging result for models premised on an unalloyed conflict between generations.         "
"77","Of course, this analysis of the Social Security puzzle does not indicate how the underlying financial problem will be resolved. The major actuarial fixes currently discussed—an increase in payroll taxes, an extension of the wage base, an increase in the full‐retirement age, and a reduction in scheduled benefits—all imply reduced net benefits. The model used here would have to be modified significantly to incorporate all the distributional issues these proposals raise. The same is true for privatization schemes, which also involve the difficult challenge of transitioning from one system to the other."
"78","Finally, it is important to remember that the Social Security puzzle is not confined to the United States, so fundamental resolutions of it cannot appeal to “American exceptionalism.” Ultimately, one must look even beyond the democracies. It was Bismarck, after all, who initiated the modern social security program. Although his was investment based and fully funded, the Social Security puzzle now extends to democracies and nondemocracies alike. Evidently, ordinary election dynamics cannot fully account for the intergenerational redistribution taking place in so many institutional settings (see Lynch 2006; Mulligan and Sala‐i‐Martin 1999b). Then again, democratic governments are not the only ones subject to domestic pressures, nor is altruism between generations confined to democratic societies.         "
