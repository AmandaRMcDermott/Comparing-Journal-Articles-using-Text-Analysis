"1","Existing approaches to war duration and termination generally fall into three broad schools: economic theories that examine the effect of the costs of war, informational approaches that model the relationship between battlefield outcomes and demands at the negotiating table, and commitment theories that focus on the ability of parties to commit credibly to uphold the terms of a settlement once agreement is reached. Each of these approaches generates different predictions about what factors will make wars easier to resolve and therefore shorter."
"2","Economic approaches are based on the argument that factors that make wars less costly for the actors involved decrease their incentive to end them, making negotiations more difficult and leading to longer conflicts. Theorists in this school argue that “greed,” rather than “grievance,” is the main factor behind civil war, meaning that groups are more likely to fight the state when it is less costly for them to do so, rather than when their objective grievances are higher (Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Keen 2000). These approaches argue that wars will be longer when there is positive utility from warfare due to the economic opportunities that exist only as long as the war continues, because the parties do not have an incentive to end them (Collier, Hoeffler, and Soderbom 2004).         "
"3","Informational approaches (Filson and Werner 2002; Slantchev 2003; Smith and Stam 2004) examine the onset, duration, and termination of conflict as one process. They argue that wars break out due to private information about capabilities and incentives to misrepresent that information and that the process of warfare reveals information about these capabilities. As information is revealed, combatants adjust their demands accordingly and when sufficient information has been revealed, a bargaining range emerges, parties reach a deal within that range, and the war ends. For these models, the duration of warfare is affected by the degree of information asymmetries and by how clearly the battlefield reveals information.         "
"4","Theorists who emphasize commitment problems argue that wars will be longer if parties are unable to commit to uphold the terms of an agreement. Walter (2002) argues that the environment of extreme risk and uncertainty that characterizes a post–civil war state makes it virtually impossible for the parties to commit credibly not to renege on the terms of any agreement in the absence of third‐party enforcement. Wars without this international enforcement will be longer because the actors will have difficulty implementing a settlement to end the war. Fearon (2004) argues that it is easier for parties to commit in some types of civil wars than in others and that wars in which commitment problems are lessened will be shorter. Specifically, he argues that conflicts that have “sons of the soil” dynamics are afflicted by severe commitment problems and tend to drag on longer than other types of civil wars.3"
"5","The veto player approach advanced here does not directly contradict the approaches discussed above. The costs of war, informational asymmetries, and commitment problems are important factors in the duration of war. However, the existing literature has missed a major factor that impacts the bargaining environment in civil war negotiations. Namely, with very few exceptions, the literature conceptualizes civil war as a two‐party phenomenon, waged between a state and a rebel group. Scholars have used this simplifying assumption because it leads to more comprehensible game‐theoretic analysis, a tool used to develop theories of civil war duration and termination."
"6","This conceptualization is problematic for two reasons. First, it does not match the empirical phenomenon of contemporary civil wars. Many modern conflicts such as those in Afghanistan, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia have contained more than two parties. Second, and more troubling, there are good theoretical reasons to believe that civil war negotiations should be more difficult when multiple parties are at the table, and by ignoring this dynamic we miss a key factor driving the duration of civil wars."
"7","The next section presents an argument that multiparty conflicts are more difficult to resolve and therefore longer. A veto player framework for analyzing the effect of number of parties on the duration of civil war is developed and the conditions combatants must meet to be veto players are explained. First, there is a discussion of why a veto player framework is a useful analytic tool for thinking about conflict bargaining."
"8","Veto player analyses have been used in the political science literature to examine the effect of institutional arrangements on policy. The heart of the theory is that when there are more actors in government with divergent preferences that have to approve any new policy, it becomes harder to implement policy and to move from the status quo. In governmental systems with more veto players, finding agreement on new policy is difficult and fewer policies are implemented."
"9","When viewed this way, there are similarities between governmental bargaining and civil war negotiations. Civil wars can be thought of as violent conflict over policy. Insurgent groups revolt in response to dissatisfaction with a set of policies of the government. They seek to push their demands on the government through fighting and bargaining. Negotiations in civil war, like in governmental bargaining, involve parties at the table making offers for a new policy to replace the existing policy, and each party must decide whether it prefers the new policy to the status quo."
"10","Governmental bargaining and civil war negotiations are not identical processes, however, for two reasons. First, when civil war negotiations break down, fighting continues and the costs of conflict are borne by all parties. Bargaining breakdown in governmental negotiations can be costly as well, but those costs are less obvious and it is not clear that all actors in government bear them. Second, factions in civil war face a constant threat of being defeated militarily and therefore unable to bargain further. In governmental bargaining this situation only arises around elections."
"11","Rather than seeing these differences as making it impossible to apply a veto player framework to civil war negotiations, a theoretical model of multiparty bargaining in civil war is developed using both the similarities and differences between governmental bargaining and civil war negotiations. This model emphasizes the strategies that actors in conflict will use both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table to try to get the best deal possible based on the number, preferences, and strength of veto players participating in the conflict. These various strategies affect the duration of these conflicts."
"12","Before turning to the presentation of the theory there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed—why conflicts vary in the number of combatants. The next section presents a discussion of the factors that lead some civil wars to become multiparty."
"13","Using a veto player framework to analyze civil war negotiations is only useful if there is variation in the number of actors across civil wars. The introduction discussed several examples of multiparty internal conflicts. A closer look reveals that a significant number of civil wars contain more than two parties. The Peace Research Institute of Oslo/Uppsala Armed Conflict Database (ACD) identifies 288 internal armed conflicts, of which 90 contain more than two combatants at the same time (30%). Some of these conflicts contain more than ten different groups."
"14","Combatants in civil war can be generally categorized into three groups: the government, internal insurgents, and external actors who have intervened in the fighting. Civil wars generally start when one domestic insurgent group launches a violent challenge against the government. The factors that make civil wars multiparty are those that lead to additional internal insurgents emerging and to external states intervening in the conflict. Each of these conditions is discussed in turn."
"15","Internal insurgents in conflict can be further divided into two types: “original groups” who emerge independently and pursue a separate agenda from the other original groups in the conflict, and “splinter factions” who emerge due to a split within an existing group. The domestic insurgent groups in the 1998–2001 civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo can illustrate this distinction. Conflict began in August 1998 when a Congolese insurgent group, the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD), based on the border with Rwanda, launched an armed challenge against the Congolese government. In November 1998 a second Congolese insurgent group emerged, the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), based in northeastern Congo. The MLC had a completely separate leadership structure from that of the RCD, received support from a separate external patron (Uganda, instead of Rwanda), and represented a different ethnic base of support than the RCD did. These two groups can both be thought of as “original” groups in that they emerged independently of each other."
"16","The conflict in the DRC also saw the emergence of splinter factions. In January 1999, the leader of the RCD, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, was replaced at a party congress in Goma. Wamba moved to Kisangani and announced that he was not stepping down. This leadership dispute led to a split in the organization and two main factions, RCD‐Goma (the original faction) and RCD‐ML (led by Wamba) both fought against the DRC government and battled against each other. RCD‐Goma actually saw further splintering across the conflict, although none of these other splinter factions was large enough to have a significant effect on the fighting."
"17","The factors that lead additional original groups to join a conflict are likely to be the same that led the first domestic group to challenge the government: dissatisfaction with the current policy. Separate original groups will emerge if groups are dissatisfied with the current policy (or the government's position) and also with the policy preference of the other original groups in the conflict. The factors that lead civil wars to include multiple original groups are the same conditions that lead societies to have heterogeneous preferences, and these can include the size of the state, its ethnic composition, and whether the government has employed divisive policies in the past."
"18","There are three conditions under which splinter factions may form. First, splinter groups may emerge due to different policy preferences. Often, umbrella opposition groups form out of a desire to push a strong agenda against the government but then break down because the internal factions cannot agree on their specific demands. Second, groups can fracture over leadership disputes. Finally, groups may splinter out of disputes over which strategy to pursue, for example, whether to negotiate with the government, or to hold out and keep fighting."
"19","There are a variety of conditions, therefore, that can lead civil wars to involve multiple internal actors. Generally, it makes sense to think of the main factors as being simply that different groups have different preferences over the ideal policy or set of policies that would govern the country. This difference in preferences, however, is not the only factor that can lead conflicts to be multiparty, as sometimes splinter groups can emerge out of disputes over strategy. This distinction will be important for the veto player framework because whether two groups have separate preferences over the outcome of war is an important determinant of whether they are veto players."
"20","Civil wars can also become multiparty when external states intervene into the conflict. There is a growing literature that is dedicated to examining the effect of external intervention on the duration of civil wars (Balch‐Lindsay and Enterline 2000; Elbadawi and Sambanis 2000; Regan 2002). In general, this literature identifies external states as playing two roles in civil war: intervening to enforce an agreement to end the war or providing support to one side in its attempts to win the conflict. Both of these roles are important. External states may also intervene, however, out of a desire to pursue some independent agenda in the conflict. Rwanda and Uganda's interventions in the conflict in Congo/Zaire can be viewed in this way. Although both states supported internal Congolese insurgent groups, they intervened in the Congo to pursue one primary goal: the forceful disarmament of their rebel groups which had based on Congolese territory. Each country was willing to ally with whatever group or government it saw as helping advance that goal and oppose any actor that stood in its way. When external states intervene to pursue an independent agenda they represent an additional actor that has a separate set of preferences and potentially possesses the ability to block agreement.            "
"21","We now turn to a discussion of the conditions original groups, splinter factions, and external states must meet in order to count as veto players. Tsebelis defines a governmental veto player as “an individual or collective actor whose agreement … is required for a change in policy” (2002, 301). Clearly, not every party to a civil war is “required” to agree to a change in policy, including an end to civil war. Rather, there are three necessary and sufficient conditions a party to a civil war must meet to be a veto player."
"22","First, each veto player must have preferences that are to some extent divergent from the other parties to the conflict. In analyses of governments, this dimension of veto player analysis is referred to as “separation of purpose” (Cox and McCubbins 2001) and in the case of civil wars the logic is intuitive. If two parties have identical preferences for the outcome of a conflict, they do not present two different sets of interests that must be satisfied, and so only represent one veto player.         "
"23","Second, veto players must have an internally cohesive organization. For a collective group to be a veto player in the policymaking context, it must possess some sort of mechanism for organization to alleviate potential collective action problems associated with exercising a veto (Cox and McCubbins 2001). The same logic holds for parties to civil wars: if a party is not internally strong enough to stick to its position at the bargaining table or to carry out any threats or promises made, it is not capable of being a veto player.         "
"24","Third, to be a veto player a group must have the ability to continue the war unilaterally if the other parties to the conflict reach an accord. If a party cannot do so, then its signature is not a necessary condition to the war ending and it does not have the ability to block agreement. A viable option for continued warfare, therefore, is a precondition for a party to be a veto player."
"25","The importance of viability of parties fits in well with existing analyses of civil war duration. Collier, Hoeffler, and Soderbom (2004) write that organizations stop fighting civil wars for one of two reasons: they reach an agreement that they prefer to the status quo or they become unviable. The literature on insurgency has identified a number of potential factors that make groups more viable—rough terrain, lootable resources, a weak central government, and so on. In multiparty conflicts, these factors affect whether a group can credibly threaten to block agreement and therefore whether their consent is required for a negotiated end to civil war.         "
"26","Analyzing a civil war environment to determine which parties are autonomous, cohesive, and viable reveals the number of veto players in the conflict. Examining civil wars in this way provides a framework for an empirical test of the effect of veto players on conflict. Before turning to that test, the theoretical argument for why conflicts with multiple veto players are longer is presented."
"27","Civil war negotiations are likely to be more difficult among multiple veto players for four reasons. First, in negotiations among multiple parties with divergent preferences, the set of agreements that all parties will accept is smaller. This is true because, by definition, each veto player brings a distinct set of preferences that need to be satisfied to the table. Much as adding veto players to governmental bargaining shrinks the range of policies that all prefer to the status quo (Tsebelis 2002), more veto players in civil war negotiations shrink the range of bargains that all parties prefer to continued warfare (the bargaining range).         "
"28","The magnitude of the effect of each additional veto player on the size of the bargaining range depends on how different its preferences are from the existing veto players. An original group joining the conflict with a completely new agenda shrinks the bargaining range further than a splinter faction breaking from an existing group due to some small disagreement over policy. The size of the bargaining range, then, is affected not only by the number of veto players in the conflict, but also by the degree of preference diversity among them."
"29","As long as some potential agreement exists and parties can overcome information and commitment problems, they should be able to negotiate a settlement (Fearon 1995). In negotiations among multiple parties with diverse preferences, however, a bargaining range may not exist at all. Even when a range of acceptable agreements does exist, the smaller that range is, ceteris paribus, the more likely problems such as information asymmetries will lead to bargaining breakdown.         "
"30","The size of the bargaining range is particularly important in multiparty civil wars because of the second problem that arises in these conflicts—they are more likely to involve information asymmetries. As described above, informational approaches view the process of warfare as revealing information that allows parties to form more realistic assessments of their probability of victory. In multiparty conflicts, the information revealed by the battlefield is difficult to interpret. Although these wars are multiparty, individual battles are generally dyadic, fought between two combatants. For example, in the 1980s the government of Somalia faced challenges from several insurgent groups based in different parts of the country. It was not until the very end of that conflict that several of these groups banded together to take the capital."
"31","The dyadic nature of battles means that the participants in that battle must use its outcome not only to adjust their probability of victory against each other but also relative to other actors in the conflict as a whole. We can think of each actor as having two separate types of probabilities in multiparty conflicts: the probability that they will defeat each other group independently and the probability that they will win the conflict as a whole. Participating in a dyadic battle can certainly reveal information for the first type of probability, but it is not as clear how it reveals information for the second type."
"32","An additional informational problem posed by multiparty conflicts is that, for bargaining to break down, only one veto player needs to overestimate its probability of victory to the extent that it cannot see the bargaining range. The probability that one party will be overly optimistic, all else being equal, is greater the more veto players there are."
"33","None of the above discussion is meant to suggest that multiparty conflicts are inherently different phenomena from two‐party conflicts. There are still good reasons to expect that a bargaining range would exist in most multiparty conflicts, that the battlefield reveals at least some information, and that the bargaining range should eventually be visible to all parties in these conflicts. However, this discussion does suggest that these processes will take longer and that bargaining breakdown will occur more frequently in multiparty conflicts, leading wars to drag on longer before agreement is possible."
"34","The third problem that arises in multiparty negotiations is that each individual actor has an incentive to hold out and be the last to sign an agreement. Because unanimous agreement among veto players is required to end the conflict, the last signer has the ability to force all other parties to their reservation point, or the deal that gives them the lowest expected utility possible while still being preferred to continued warfare. The last signer, then, can expect to get a better deal than all other parties at the table."
"35","These incentives to hold out are available to all parties. In a sense, then, this mechanism contradicts predictions from the existing literature about which actors are likely to “spoil” peace agreements. Stedman (1997) argues that groups will spoil agreements when they stand to lose out from the peace agreement or when they have extreme preferences that do not allow for compromise. This veto player approach, however, argues that in multiparty negotiations all parties have an incentive to block agreement to try to get a better deal.         "
"36","Taken to the extreme, this argument would mean that no party would ever sign a deal since all have incentives to be the last signer. Clearly, however, groups do sign deals even in multiparty conflicts. Parties are willing to sign eventually because their ability to hold out is directly affected by their ability to pay costs of continued conflict. These costs mean that the groups that are strongest are likely to spoil agreements in multiparty conflicts, not those with the most extreme preferences."
"37","Holding out and refusing to participate in negotiations is a strategy that many parties to conflicts have used. In the Burundian civil war, Palipehutu‐FNL and CNDD‐FDD are splinter factions that for years refused to participate in negotiations unless the government acceded to consider more extreme demands than any of the other parties who had signed cease‐fire agreements made. In the Mindanao conflict in the Philippines, the Abu Sayyaf Group refused to participate in negotiations held in the 1990s between the government and the other main insurgents, the Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and in fact increased its combat activity while the other parties were negotiating."
"38","Finally, a fourth problem that only arises in negotiations with more than two parties is the problem of shifting alliances between or among parties. In negotiations among multiple combatants, a range of issues are brought to the table that must be addressed in a final settlement. Shifting alliances emerge when parties can form different coalitions on separate issues. This problem is particularly detrimental to multiparty negotiations because it prevents combatants from forming negotiating blocs to help them reach agreement. Since war is costly, parties have an incentive to find ways to achieve their goals through negotiation. One way groups could do this would be for them to ally permanently with others who had broadly similar goals and form some overarching institution to negotiate. Shifting alliances prevent groups from achieving such alliances, however, because groups that agree with each other on one issue often disagree on others."
"39","The 1989–91 negotiations in the Cambodian conflict show the problem of shifting alliances. Cambodia in 1989 was “ripe for resolution” for a variety of reasons. All four factions involved in the fighting had lost the support of their external patrons. The conflict was incredibly costly for all parties and no faction had a realistic chance of winning militarily. The United Nations Security Council had made peace in Cambodia a priority and agreed to deploy a sizeable peacekeeping force to oversee the terms of an agreement. Finally, the three insurgent groups had all formed one overarching institution and were nominally allied."
"40","Despite these favorable conditions, the peace process took two years. Negotiations in Paris in 1989 broke down over two main issues that produced different coalitions. The three insurgent groups (the Khmer Rouge/PDK, FUNCINPEC, and the KPNLF) agreed to be part of a power‐sharing government with an equal seat for the four factions, but the government refused to share power with the Khmer Rouge. At the same time, the Khmer Rouge found itself in opposition to all other parties over its demand that Vietnam withdraw completely before any agreement was reached and over the issue of whether the perpetrators of the 1975–79 Khmer Rouge‐led genocide would be brought to justice under the new government (Findlay 1995).         "
"41","In 1991 the parties did reach a comprehensive peace settlement. They were able to do so partly because the United Nations took the issue of the composition of the transitional government off the table by agreeing to temporarily administer Cambodia. Even so, the Khmer Rouge did not implement the accord, and conflict between it and the new government continued until 1998."
"42","The shrinking of the bargaining range, heightened information asymmetries, incentives to hold out, and shifting alliances all combine to make negotiations in multiparty conflicts very difficult. In the absence of decisive military victory, wars continue until agreement is found, suggesting that civil wars with more veto players will be of longer duration.4"
"43","The veto player approach suggests several empirical implications. The first is the main hypothesis that will be tested in this study and is derived from the above discussion of the effect of multiple parties on the ability to resolve conflicts."
"44","                        "
"45"," H1: The more veto players there are, the longer the duration of the civil war will be.               "
"46","In addition to this hypothesis about the number of veto players, the above discussion suggests two further implications about the effect of the preferences and strength of the veto players involved in the conflict. These hypotheses are more tentative because, while all of the previous discussion led to the hypothesis about the number of veto players, these hypotheses are each based on one specific element of that framework."
"47","The preferences of veto players matter because veto players with more diverse preferences shrink the size of the bargaining range further. The smaller the bargaining range, ceteris paribus, the harder it is to find an agreement within that range. This suggests the following hypothesis:"
"48","                        "
"49"," H2: The more diverse the preferences among veto players, the longer the duration of the civil war will be.               "
"50","The strength of veto players will have two effects on duration. First, one reason conflicts with multiple veto players will be longer is that all groups have an incentive to hold out to be the last signer. Groups will be able to hold out longer if they are stronger and can absorb the costs of fighting. Second, stronger nonstate actors can prevent military defeat by the state and remain in the conflict longer. Both of these factors suggest the following hypothesis:"
"51","                        "
"52"," H3:                  The stronger the veto players in the conflict are, the longer the duration of the civil war will be.               "
"53","This study examines the effect of veto players on the duration of every civil war begun since 1945. The criteria for identifying civil wars are those used by the Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD). The ACD defines an armed conflict as “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle‐related deaths” (Strand, Wilhelmsen, and Gleditsch 2004, 3). The ACD divides conflicts into four types: interstate wars, civil wars, internationalized civil wars, and extrasystemic wars. This analysis includes all conflicts except interstate wars.         "
"54","The ACD counts all conflicts within one country over separate territories as distinct conflicts and all conflicts within one country over government as the same conflict. This coding rule presents problems for analyzing duration, since coups occurring 30 years apart in the same country are treated as the same conflict. In this dataset, any conflict that occurs after a 24‐month break in fighting is treated as a new war. This coding rule generates a set of 288 separate conflicts."
"55","The unit of observation for this study is civil war–month. The ACD is based on a calendar year system and does not identify specific start and end dates for conflicts. Using calendar year presents problems for duration analysis since a conflict beginning in December of one year and ending in January would be coded as the same length as one lasting two full years. To address this problem, this study uses more specific start‐and‐end‐date data to code the beginning and end month of each civil war (Gates and Strand 2004). Splitting the ACD into conflict months produces a dataset with 18,529 conflict months with a range in duration of internal conflict from 1 to 659 months.         "
"56","The statistical method employed to test this relationship is Binary Time‐Series Cross‐Sectional (BTSCS) analysis using logit. Traditionally, scholars studying the duration of events such as wars have used one of a set of “Event History” models such as the Weibull regression or the Cox Proportional Hazard Model. Those models test the impact of a set of covariates on the duration of events, given some underlying “hazard function” that determines the baseline duration."
"57","Event history approaches can be divided into two categories: spell‐based and time‐varying. Spell‐based approaches model the effect of some treatment at the beginning of the observation on the duration of the events from that point onward. Time‐varying analyses can incorporate the effect of changes in the value of covariates over the course of the observation on the duration of events. For both, the dependent variable is the duration until some event (such as a war end) is observed. However, in the time‐varying analysis, where the unit of analysis is time and not spell, the dependent variable can also be thought of as the probability of observing some event at time t, given the covariates at time t and the fact that the observation has survived to time t."
"58","When the dependent variable is conceptualized in this way, event history analysis is identical to a binary time‐series cross‐sectional analysis that controls for duration. Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998) provide software that can be integrated into statistical packages such as STATA for the analysis of BTSCS data. In this article, BTSCS analysis controlling for the duration of wars is used to analyze the impact of time‐varying covariates on the probability of a war ending in any given month. Since for this dataset a conflict end is identified if there is a 24‐month break in fighting, a “1” on the dependent variable means that that month was followed by a 24‐month period in which conflict did not reignite. The effect of covariates are examined here, including those controlling for duration, on the probability of a war ending in a given month through a Logit model.5"
"59","In this analysis, variables with a negative coefficient prolong civil wars. If Hypothesis 1 is correct, there will be a negative association between the number of veto players and the probability of war ending in a month. This association would mean that wars are lengthier because, if wars are less likely to end in any specific month, they will on average continue longer until they do end."
"60","The main hypothesis that will be tested in this quantitative analysis is that conflicts with more veto players are longer. In this section the process through which the measures of veto players are created is discussed with enough detail to make the coding as transparent as possible and to increase its applicability to other researchers."
"61","The first step in determining which parties were veto players was to identify the set of participants in each conflict. The ACD identifies a list of participants for every year of every conflict divided between two sides: “Side A” actors support the government and “Side B” actors oppose it. This list of participants is used for two reasons. First, it made an already substantial data‐collection effort more manageable. Second, and more importantly, it made the collection more objective: beginning with an existing list of parties reduced the possibility of influencing the data."
"62","The ACD lists 770 separate conflict participants in the 288 conflicts. A way of determining whether each of these actors was a veto player was needed, and, if so, during what time period. Three coding rules made many of the conflicts clear. First, for every month of any conflict in which there were only two parties identified in the ACD, both were coded as veto players. Veto players are defined as those actors who can block settlement and continue the war unilaterally, and if there are not at least two actors who meet that definition, the war will end."
"63","Second, if there were only one participant identified on either Side A or Side B, that actor was automatically coded as a veto player. Each side must have another actor it is fighting against, and so each side must have at least one veto player. Third, each government of the state in civil war was automatically coded as a veto player. The government is by definition a veto player because by virtue of being the government it can block settlement until it is defeated militarily."
"64","Once these criteria were applied, 304 conflict participants were left who were potential veto players. Since there was no clear criterion for determining whether parties were veto players, two measures based on separate coding rules were created and are described in detail below. The first coding rule involved strict criteria to be counted as a veto player, while the second rule was more lenient. In order to code whether each of these parties met each coding rule, a determination whether they met the three criteria of autonomous preferences, coherence, and viability needed to be made."
"65","Parties were coded as autonomous if they had a separate agenda from the other groups in the conflict. Two sources were used to identify the goals of the groups. First, historical sources such as Keesing's Record of World Events and news reports obtained through Lexis Nexis were employed to identify group demands. Second, case histories were used to examine how scholars identify group goals. Both of these methods were used because of problems arising from only looking at group demands."
"66","Using group demands is complicated by two factors. First, external states intervening in conflicts rarely state their demands explicitly. To determine whether external states had autonomous preferences, historical explanations for their involvement in the conflict were used. For example, it is widely accepted that South Africa intervened in African conflicts in the 1970s and 1980s to oppose anti‐apartheid governments or to prevent them from coming to power. Second, the demands that groups make do not necessarily reflect their actual preferences. Jenne (2004), for example, demonstrates that self‐determination groups choose their demands strategically to build support from local constituencies or from international actors who have an influence on the conflict.            "
"67","Examining a combination of demands and historical explanations of groups' reasons for participating in conflicts determined whether actors had separate preferences from the other combatants. For the vast majority of cases, it was clear that the groups were autonomous. Most combatants in civil war have at least somewhat disparate goals from the other participants. There were a small number of cases, particularly those involving external states intervening on the side of the government, in which it was obvious that combatants did not bring separate preferences and these actors were automatically coded as non‐veto players.6 A set of 14 cases, however, remained that were difficult to code.7 Rather than deciding one way or the other whether these groups were autonomous, they were left coded as unclear and are included as autonomous in the lenient measure of veto players and not in the strict measure.            "
"68","Parties were coded as cohesive if, for the most part, they were able to avoid fractionalization during their participation in the conflict. This coding was complicated by the fact that, across protracted conflicts, many groups see factions break off and start fighting independently. Fractionalization only prevents parties from being veto players if the remaining groups are unable to stay cohesive."
"69","The Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) in the DRC is a good example of the importance of cohesiveness. The RCD was formed in 1998 by Rwanda to give its invasion of DRC a domestic face; however, the various Congolese leaders in the RCD had great difficulty agreeing on anything. In March 1999, the nominal leader of the RCD, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, moved his headquarters from Goma to Kisangani, leading to a split in the organization. Two groups then fought the conflict, RCD‐Goma, which was backed by Rwanda, and RCD‐Liberation Movement (RCD‐ML), which received Ugandan support."
"70","The RCD/RCD‐Goma is not coded as cohesive in this study. However, the reasoning for this coding is not that the organization split into two separate factions. Rather, it is not coded as cohesive because the different leaders within RCD‐Goma could never agree on anything other than their opposition to Kabila's government. RCD‐ML experienced some fractionalization, but was generally able to operate as a cohesive organization. It is coded as cohesive.            "
"71","The measure of cohesiveness entails whether the leadership of the group remained relatively constant over the course of the conflict and whether the group had a consistent set of demands. For the vast majority of cases measuring cohesiveness was quite clear‐cut. Insurgent groups tend to maintain the same leadership even over long participation in conflicts. Jonas Savimbi, for example, led the Union for the Total Liberation of Angola for over 30 years until he was killed in 2002, and the group ceased the armed struggle almost immediately following his death."
"72","Again, as with autonomy, there were a few exceptions. There were five groups coded as noncohesive. One is the RCD, for the reasons described above. A second is the Ugandan Popular Front, an alliance of Ugandan insurgents formed in the 1980s that was never able to exercise any control over its constituent groups (listed separately in the ACD). Third, the ACD lists “Eritrean Liberation Front factions” as a participant in the Eritrean self‐determination conflict, and those factions cannot be seen as having one coherent leadership structure or set of demands. Fourth, while the Front for the National Liberation of Chad (FRONILAT) was cohesive during the 1970s, by 1980 it had become so fractionalized that it had ceased to function as a coherent organization. Fifth, the ACD identified a military faction in Uganda in 1978–79, but no evidence could be found that such a faction opposed to Idi Amin existed."
"73","Viability was the criterion that presented the greatest challenge for coding. A party is viable if it could continue the conflict unilaterally in the face of agreement by the other combatants. In order to determine whether parties were viable, the literature on insurgency was used (such as Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Fearon and Laitin 2003) to identify factors that should make groups more viable by making it easier for them to carry out an insurgency. Six main criteria were used: how many troops the group had relative to the government, whether they operated in mountainous or forested terrain, whether they had access to lootable resources, whether they were the dominant group in the region of the country where they operated, whether they had participated and had a strong showing in elections, and whether they received external support.8"
"74","Once this data for each potential veto player had been collected, a way to make a composite indicator of viability was needed. This was achieved by assigning points to each group based on its coding on each of the above criteria. The first points were awarded based on troop strength. Groups were given four points if they had a number of troops equal to or larger than the government, three points for 50% or more, two points for 10% or more, and one point for 1% or more. The 1% threshold might seem quite low; however, there were 65 groups who received no points for troop strength because they had less than 1% the troops of the government."
"75","Next, points were assigned to the internal groups based on the other measures. Groups got one point each if they operated in forested and/or mountainous terrain.9 Rough terrain makes it easier for groups to evade capture by the state, and therefore smaller groups can remain viable longer if they are based in mountainous or forested terrain. Groups received one point if they were an ethnic group that was dominant in the region where they operated, since that would suggest that they had higher popular support.10 Since “lootable resources” can help groups fund rebellion, those that had access to such resources got a point.11 If groups had participated in elections and made a strong showing, they received a point.12 Finally, since external support can enable groups to continue rebellion longer, each group was given one point if it received substantial support from external states. This support could not simply be rhetorical, but had to involve actions such as direct military support, a state allowing the group to base on its territory, or significant financial support.13"
"76","The terrain, group dominance, lootable resources, and election performance indicators do not apply to external states intervening in conflict. To determine the points awarded to external states, the same troop criteria was used; however, each external state was given one extra point, based on the logic that states that can send their armies to another country are generally better organized relative to domestic insurgent groups. An additional point was awarded if the external state was a major power, since that is an indicator of how strong the military is."
"77","After completing this coding, a score was calculated for each potential veto player (ranging from 0 to 7) that was designed to indicate how strong it was. For example, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone in 1991–96 has a score of four because it had more than 10% the troop strength of the government (two points), controlled diamonds, and received direct military support from Liberia. The Alliance for Democratic Forces (ADF) in Uganda has a score of two because it had 1% the troop strength of the government and received support from the Sudan. Force Obote Back Again (FOBA) in Uganda in the 1980s, meanwhile, gets a score of zero because it had less than 1% the troop strength of the government and no other attributes facilitating insurgency. The assumption with this coding of viability is that the RUF is more likely to be a veto player than the ADF, which is more likely to be a veto player than FOBA."
"78","After coding this score for each group, thresholds were established for determining what a group needed to be viable. To be coded as viable under the strict measure of veto players, a group must have four points. This threshold includes all groups that have more troops than the government as well as smaller groups that have other attributes facilitating insurgency. For the lenient measure, the threshold of two points was used, meaning that groups having less than 10% the troop strength of the government only meet the lenient criteria if they have other attributes facilitating insurgency."
"79","Applying these coding rules allowed for the creation of two variables that measured the number of veto players using the strict and lenient criteria. The strict measure of veto players includes a count of all actors who were clearly autonomous, cohesive, and had at least four points on the viability measure described above. The lenient measure includes a count of all actors who were possibly autonomous, cohesive, and had at least two points on the viability measure. The veto players variables are coded for each civil war month based on historical accounts of when groups joined and exited conflicts. These two variables will be used to test the impact of veto players on duration."
"80","The ideal statistical test of the effect of number of veto players includes the veto players measure and any other potential factors that could affect both veto players and the duration of civil wars. If, with the inclusion of these other factors, the veto players variable achieves significance, that is the strongest statistical support for the theory."
"81","Several factors could potentially be associated with the number of veto players and the duration of civil wars. The ACD includes several coups or attempted coups as internal conflicts. Coups are virtually always two party, and they are almost always short. Consequently, coups are likely to be associated with both the number of veto players and the duration of civil war. To control for this effect, a dichotomous variable measuring whether the conflict is a coup was included.14"
"82","The population of the country is also likely to be associated with both veto players and duration. Population could drive duration because it is presumably easier for a conflict to generate 25 battle deaths a year in a country with a large population. At the same time, population size could be an indicator for how heterogeneous preferences are in the society. Diverse preferences are the main factor leading to multiple veto players, so population is likely associated with both the independent and dependent variables. A measure of the natural log of each country's population was also included (Gleditsch 2002).            "
"83","Another factor that could affect preference heterogeneity is the degree of ethnic division in the country. Societies with more ethnic divisions may generate a greater number of groups seeking to challenge the status quo. Additionally, some scholars have argued that the ethnic composition of a society is likely to affect the probability of war termination. However, there is little agreement among scholars about what specific ethnic composition is likely to lead to more intractable conflicts. Since highly fractionalized societies are most likely to produce more veto players and there is reason to believe that more fractionalized societies fight longer conflicts, a measure of each country's Ethnolinguistic Fractionalization Index (ELF) was included.15 Additional unreported tests using a measure of whether the civil war was an ethnic conflict, a curvilinear measure of fractionalization, a separate measure of ethnic fractionalization, and a measure of cultural division collected by Fearon (2003) were conducted. Only the results including the ELF measure are reported because the different specifications yielded similar results.            "
"84"," Table 1 presents the results of logistic regressions, including the separate measures of veto players, these three dichotomous variables, and the controls for duration discussed above. Model 1 uses the strict measure of veto players, and Model 2 is based on the lenient measure.            "
"85","Models 1 and 2 in Table 1 show a relationship between higher numbers of veto players and longer civil wars. The signs on both veto players measures are negative, meaning that civil wars are less likely to end in months with higher numbers of veto players. Both variables achieve significance at the .05 level, and the strict measure reaches a substantially higher threshold.            "
"86","As expected, a conflict's being a coup is a significant predictor of shorter duration and is highly significant. None of the other variables achieved significance, except for the controls for duration. The population of the country has a negative sign, however, and it misses traditional thresholds of statistical significance. The ethnolinguistic fractionalization of the country seems to have no relation with the duration of conflict, regardless of how fractionalization was measured."
"87","These two models were conducted on all internal conflicts from the Armed Conflict Dataset. However, the 25 battle death threshold used by the ACD to identify an armed conflict is quite low and could bring in events that do not normally meet our definition of civil war. To address that problem, Models 3 and 4 replicate Models 1 and 2, respectively, with the sample limited to those conflicts that generated 1,000 battle deaths. Those models show that the result on the strict measure of veto players holds when the dataset is limited to 1,000 battle death conflicts. The lenient measure of veto players does not achieve significance. Since the main distinction between the two measures is the level of capabilities required to count as a veto player, this finding suggests that only stronger groups are able to block agreement in more costly conflicts."
"88","The analysis in Table 1 shows support for the veto player approach. Civil conflicts are longer when more veto players are involved. The models reported in Table 1, however, do not allow for an evaluation of the magnitude of the effect of veto players on duration, only whether there is a significant correlation. Table 2 reports the results of Models 1 and 2 using CLARIFY16 to generate predicted probabilities of the effect of changes in the values of the independent variables on the probability of a war ending in a month, holding values constant on the other independent variables. The models show the effect of holding every other variable constant17 and changing the value of continuous variables from the 10th to 90th percentiles18 and dichotomous variables from no to yes.            "
"89","The results in Table 2 show that increasing the number of veto players has a substantial effect on the duration of civil conflicts. Adding one veto player under the strict criterion leads to a 0.66% decrease in the probability of conflict ending in any given month, give or take about 0.3%. This number may seem low; however, since the mean duration of conflicts in the dataset is 68 months, the baseline probability of a conflict ending in any given month is quite low. Going from the 10th to 90th percentile in the lenient measure of veto players has a slightly smaller effect, and with a larger confidence interval.            "
"90"," Table 2 shows as well that, as expected, coups are substantially shorter civil conflicts. A conflict's being a coup reduces the probability of it ending in a month by about 7%, give or take about 3%. As in the models reported in Table 1, neither population size nor the ethnic fractionalization of a country has a statistically significant effect on the probability of war ending.            "
"91","Testing Hypothesis 2 is difficult because there are not clear measures of the preferences of groups. In veto player analyses in American and Comparative politics, the ideological preferences of political parties are often measured using a generally accepted left‐right continuum. However, within the literature on civil war, there is no such standard. One way to get at the effect of preference diversity is by seeing if different types of veto players have different effects. Recall that parties in conflict can generally be divided into four groups—the government, “original” insurgent groups, splinter factions that have broken off from original groups, and external states that have intervened in the conflict. Of all of those groups, splinter factions are least likely to bring more diverse preferences to the conflict, because they were originally part of another group. A crude test of hypothesis 2, then, could be conducted by seeing if splinter faction veto players prolong civil wars less than original groups or external veto players. The lenient veto player coding was used here (because it gives a wider range of veto players) to code the type of veto players active for every month of conflict.            "
"92","Evaluating Hypothesis 3 is easier given the way the measure of veto players was coded. Two variables were created that measure the strength of veto players in the conflict. The first variable measures the average strength (in terms of the point system used to measure viability) of all veto players in the conflict except for the government. The second variable measures the point total of the strongest veto player. Having even one strong veto player in the conflict can prolong conflicts because that party, at the very least, can hold out and block agreement."
"93"," Table 3 presents the results of six regressions that include these measures of type and strength of veto players, respectively, along with the covariates from Table 1. Models 2 and 3 only include the months in which there were multiple veto players present, since it is only in those periods that strength should matter. Models 4 through 6 repeat the first three analyses with the dataset limited to 1,000 battle death conflicts.            "
"94","As can be seen from Table 3, the only type of veto player that has a significant association with duration is the number of original groups, and this variable only reaches significance when all armed conflicts are included. Although the other types miss standard thresholds of significance, on all three variables the sign is negative, meaning that adding any veto players to the war leads to longer conflicts. The results do not conclusively support Hypothesis 2, however, because although the splinter factions variable did not achieve statistical significance, its coefficient is actually larger (in absolute value) than the other two coefficients. That suggests that adding splinter factions might have a greater effect of prolonging civil wars than the other types of veto players; however, that result must be interpreted with caution because the standard error is so large.            "
"95"," Table 3 does show some support for Hypothesis 3. The presence of a stronger veto player in the conflict leads to longer armed conflicts, but is no longer significant when the dataset is limited to 1,000 battle death wars. A higher average strength among veto players also seems to prolong civil wars; however, we cannot say that definitively because the variable does not achieve significance in either test. These results, then, provide some support for Hypothesis 3, but we cannot reach a definitive conclusion.            "
"96","In this section, logistic regressions were conducted that include measures of the costliness of war and commitment problems along with the number of veto players. These statistical analyses are designed to see if the findings in Table 1 are robust to the inclusion of variables measuring competing explanations of war duration.            "
"97","Measuring the costliness of war to combatants is difficult; however, four measures that could proxy these costs were included. First, a measure of annual battle deaths was used (Lacina and Gleditsch 2005). The number of people killed in battle is the most common measure of the costliness of war. Second, terrain is often theorized to affect the extent to which the state can impose costs on insurgents, and so groups that operate in rough terrain should find war less costly. Measures of the percentage of the zone of the country in conflict that is mountainous or forested (Buhaug and Lujala 2004) were included. Third, scholars have argued that conflicts are less costly when lootable resources are available, and so a variable measuring whether there are lootable resources in the conflict zone was also included (Buhaug, Gates, and Lujala 2002).19 Finally, a measure of annual real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was incorporated (Gleditsch 2002). Some see GDP as a proxy for the opportunity costs to potential rebels of abandoning their livelihood and taking up arms, while others see GDP as an indicator of the ability of the state to impose costs on those engaging in rebellion. In either case, wars should be less costly for insurgents in poorer countries.            "
"98","To measure commitment problems, two variables were used. The first is a monthly measure of whether there was an international guarantee to enforce a settlement reached.20 The second is a dichotomous variable measuring whether each conflict contained sons of the soil dynamics.21"
"99"," Table 4 presents models that include these various measures as well as the variables from Table 1. For simplicity, only the strict measure of veto players is incorporated since that variable had a larger coefficient, higher level of significance, and larger substantive effect in the tests in Tables 1 and 2. In unreported tests, however, the same models were run with the lenient measure and although the results were not as strong, they were generally comparable.22"
"100","The first thing to notice from Table 4 is that the veto players finding is robust to the other specifications of the model. The coefficient on the veto players variable ranges from −0.95 to −1.3 in Tables 1 and 4, a relatively narrow range. The stability of the coefficient indicates that the result on veto players is robust to the inclusion of all of these different variables, and that none of them are driving the relationship between veto players and duration. Additionally, the measure of veto players achieves a high level of significance in every test.            "
"101","The results for the other variables included in the model are mixed. In particular, costs of war theories perform poorly. Forests, lootable resources, and GDP fail to achieve significance in the models in Table 4. The two war cost variables that do achieve significance—battle deaths and the percentage of the conflict zone that is mountainous—do so in the opposite direction from that predicted by war cost theories. A higher number of annual battle deaths makes civil wars less likely to end, while a higher percentage of mountainous terrain is associated with shorter conflicts.            "
"102","Commitment approaches fare better. In particular, Walter's (2002) argument that international guarantees make resolving wars easier receives support. The coefficient on the international guarantee variable is large and positive, indicating that guarantees shorten wars substantially. Fearon's (2004) argument that sons of the soil conflicts are harder to resolve does not receive support from this analysis. The sign on the sons of the soil variable is negative, as predicted, but it fails to achieve traditional levels of significance in either test.23"
"103","The results in this study provide strong support for the veto player approach. A greater number of veto players was significantly associated with longer wars in almost every test conducted, regardless of which measure of veto players was used. In addition to the statistical significance, increasing the number of veto players was found to substantially decrease the probability of war ending in any given month and to lead therefore to considerably longer civil wars. The veto players findings were robust to different specifications of the model, including those controlling for factors identified in the existing literature as influencing the duration of civil war.24"
"104","This article has presented a theoretical framework examining how the number of parties in civil war affects the duration of conflict and the ability to negotiate a settlement. Statistical analysis revealed that civil wars with more veto players are substantially more resistant to resolution. This analysis shows that the narrow assumption within the literature that civil wars are two‐actor phenomena limits our ability to understand the dynamics of war duration and termination. Scholars examining these important topics must take into account the dynamics of multiparty conflicts."
"105","Additionally, the theory and analysis in this article suggest several implications for policymakers interested in designing responses to civil wars. The three main implications follow. First, since two‐party conflicts are easier to resolve than multiparty conflicts, policymakers designing responses to civil wars should look for ways to reduce the number of veto players participating in the conflict. In many civil wars, doing so would require dispatching a large international military mission to forcibly disarm combatants, a strategy that is unlikely to be either politically feasible or successful. However, there will be some cases where the international community can find less drastic ways to reduce the number of actors in conflict."
"106","For example, when Chester Crocker was U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa in the 1980s, he developed a two‐stage approach to resolving conflicts in Southern Africa such as the civil war in Angola. He argued that these internal conflicts could not be resolved until the external dimension, primarily the involvement of Cuba and South Africa, was removed (Crocker 1999). Crocker and the United States negotiating team committed to addressing the external dimension first and in 1988 a peace agreement between Angola, Cuba, and South Africa was signed at the United Nations. That agreement removed a major barrier to negotiation and paved the way for an internal peace agreement in Angola in 1991. This two‐stage strategy illustrates one possible way to reduce the number of veto players in conflicts without having to forcibly remove them.         "
"107","Second, international actors interested in resolving these conflicts should seek to identify the set of combatants that are veto players and work primarily to reach a peace agreement that includes all of those parties. In recent years, there appears to have been a shift toward including all politically relevant actors at the negotiating table, turning many civil war negotiations into something resembling a national conference on politics in the country. The 1993 peace agreement in Rwanda, for example, included six different political parties, even though there were only two main combatants. The 2000 peace accord in the Burundian conflict was signed by 19 different political parties, and negotiations did not include the two main combatants to the conflict. If international actors are interested in achieving an end to violent conflict, this trend could prove counterproductive. Including additional parties in the negotiations leads to an even smaller bargaining range and decreases the incentives for the main combatants to agree to share power. While conducting political dialogue that includes various unarmed political groups is likely to be important for the long‐term stability of the country, a peace process designed to end armed conflict should include principally the main armed combatants, to induce them to negotiate an end to fighting."
"108","Finally, if a comprehensive accord among veto players is not possible, international actors should seek to reach peace between the government and the strongest domestic insurgents first and then seek to integrate the smaller opposition groups. Often, governments attempt to reach piecemeal settlements in multiparty conflicts and to bring the various combatants on board one group at a time. As argued earlier, it is the strongest groups in multiparty conflicts that have the greatest incentive and capability to hold out and block agreement, and so international actors should push to have those groups lay down their arms first. Doing so will increase the chances of piecemeal negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement."
"109","Each of these implications flows directly from moving beyond the assumption that civil war is a two‐party phenomenon and examining how the number and composition of groups in conflict affects combatants' ability and incentives to negotiate. Further analysis of the dynamics of multiparty conflicts is likely to suggest additional implications for policymakers interested in responding to civil wars. Given the high cost of protracted internal conflicts, understanding their dynamics and designing responses to them is an important goal for scholars and policymakers alike."
