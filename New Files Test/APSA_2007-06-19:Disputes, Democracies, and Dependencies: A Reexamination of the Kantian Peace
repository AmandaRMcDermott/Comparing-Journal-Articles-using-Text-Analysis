"1","Dyadic data in international relations are rife with dependencies. For example, because states have relatively stable policies it is reasonable to expect that data emanating from a single country are likely to be correlated, as are data directed to a single country by others. Similarly, dyads are likely to have data correlated over time. The social relations model introduced a method to decompose variance in such data into sender and receiver effects as well as permit within‐dyad correlations via the analysis of variance (ANOVA) protocol (Warner, Kenny, and Stoto 1979; Wong 1982).7"
"2","The social relations model (SRM) grows out of interest by psychologists to separate the independent and interactive effects of groups versus individuals. The basic insight provides a way of conceptualizing and acquiring unbiased estimates of actor, partner, and relationship effects and their interrelationships. The social relations model emerged in the study of family relations as systems of interacting, adaptive relationships. Strong, affectionate relations among the various dyads in a family, for example, have been shown to have powerful effects on the developmental health of children in that family. There was a dissatisfaction in the field of psychology with studying these dynamics using conceptual frameworks and methods that assumed all the objects of study were independent of one another and that the appropriate locus of inquiry was either the individual or the dyad or triad. Kenny (1985) introduced the social relations model in part to focus attention on the analysis of dyads as dependent phenomena. The development of the social relations model is presented first by Kenny (1981), but the canonical citation is from the mid‐1980s (Malloy and Kenny 1986). A widely cited volume was penned on this topic in the mid‐1990s (Kenny 1994), and recently a book devoted to data analytic approaches to the SRM was published (Kenny, Kashy, and Cook 2006). Literally hundreds of articles in the field of psychology use this widely appreciated approach to confronting the dependencies in dyadic data. In short, by separating actor, partner, relationship, and reciprocity effects from one another, this model focuses on, rather than ignores, the interdependencies among actors in a family, or other systems of highly interconnected and dependent actors such as international politics.         "
"3","The idea of further decomposing the variance in the context of dyadic data was developed (Gill and Swartz 2001; Li and Loken 2002) to permit the statistical analysis of normally distributed dyadic data using additive effects. These ideas have been extended to a generalized linear model that incorporates third‐order dependence via a bilinear effect (Hoff 2005) similar in spirit to that first introduced by Gabriel (1998).         "
"4","There is strong interdependence among the observations in many international relations data sets. A first‐order dependency is the inclination for states to behave toward others in a consistent manner, or, alternatively, for a state to be the object of consistent policies from others. Often this is captured in a time‐series context, though below we offer a different conceptualization.8 Consider, for example, the behavior of the United States toward Cuba in the years since Fidel Castro announced he was a Marxist‐Leninist. The range of variation is narrow. By the same token, for an extended period Libya was the object of a consistent set of policies by a relatively large number of other states. The existence of first‐order dependencies is widely recognized, and many forms of time‐series analysis take them into account, including, of course, pooled cross‐sectional methods. The problem, as alluded to above, is that the dependencies do not stop with the first‐order, but become more complex, and these have not thus far been accommodated, or even generally recognized, in most analyses of international relationships. Controlling for time dependence does not eliminate other higher‐order dependencies.9"
"5","When analysis moves away from the policies of individual states over time to embrace other complicated sets of relationships, higher‐order dependencies are likely to become rife in the data, as we have argued above. But what does “higher‐order dependencies” mean? Second‐order dependence refers to what is often described as reciprocity in the context of directed relationships. The study of arms races is one area in which this has been frequently investigated in a single pair of countries. In the years before World War I, did the French military budget depend in some significant part on what the French believed the Germans would spend? Similarly, did the Germans gear their spending on what they anticipated the French would do? Given the obvious answers to these questions, is it possible to consider the arms acquisition policies of a state in isolation from what other salient states are doing? Interactions in international conflicts also often evince similar reciprocity at the dyadic level. For instance, India's aggressive behavior towards Pakistan is likely to induce similar behavior from Pakistan. Many pairs of countries show evidence of this type of reciprocity, both in the conflictual as well as cooperative realms, even though reciprocity can still be asymmetric such that one actor in the dyad responds more strongly, or weakly, than the other. The prevalence of reciprocity—a second‐order dependence among observations—in directional network data in the study of international relations challenges the basic assumption of observational independence. It can neither be ignored nor assumed away and therefore needs to be explicitly modeled."
"6","To discuss fully third‐order dependence, some formalism is helpful. We define yij as some measure of the relationship between actors i and j. This may be a measure of the flow between actors, as in the case of data on international commerce or even a measure of whether a “linkage” exists between the actors. If the value of yij is identical to yji for all ij pairs, the data are said to be undirected (and symmetric). Third‐order dependence includes (a) transitivity, (b) balance, and (c) clusterability (Wasserman and Faust 1994). Transitivity follows the familiar logic of “a friend of a friend is a friend.” In particular, for directed binary data, triad ijk is transitive if whenever yij= 1 and yjk= 1, we also observe that yik= 1. A triad ijk is said to be balanced if all pairs of actors relate to one another in an identical fashion, specifically: yij×yjk×yki > 0. The idea is that if the relationship between i and j is “positive” then both will relate to another unit k identically. If yij is positive, then to observe balance, yjk and yki are either both positive or both negative. Clusterability is a relaxation of the concept of balance. A triad is clusterable if it is balanced or the relations are all negative. The idea is that a clusterable triad can be divided into groups where the measurements are positive within groups and negative between groups.         "
"7","The notion that “a friend of a friend is a friend” captures the concept of transitivity in directed binary network data setting and is illustrated in Figure 1. Consider a triad of countries {ijk}. This triad is composed of three dyads {ij}, {jk}, and {ki}. In a network context, there are six possible links if the data are directional and three if data are nondirectional. If we know that country i considers j as an ally and country j is allied with k, then the probability that k will also be allied with i is likely to be higher than for another country outside of this network, since these countries are at least indirectly connected in the alliance network by virtue of their separate linkages to country j. In other words, knowing something about the relationship between countries in the first two dyads in a triad often tells us something about the relations in the third dyad. Treating dyads {ij}, {jk}, and {ki} as independent from each other, as the way we routinely do in empirical analyses of international relations data, usually ignores important patterns in these data.         "
"8"," Transitivity and Balance in Triads                      "
"9","The concept of balance implicates the putative stability in a triad; a large set of balanced triads is therefore called a balanced graph or balanced network. Clusterability is a relaxed version of balance: a triad is clusterable if it is balanced or the relations are all negative.10 During the cold war, for example, members of the NATO pact all had mostly cooperative relations with one another, as did members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization (the first WTO), but members in each “cluster” had relatively hostile relations across these two blocs. Thus, while the entire network was not necessarily clustered into one grouping, individual countries could be clustered in terms of their probability of having positive relations with those clustered nearby and negative relations with those located in different clusters, further away. This kind of third‐order dependence is generally prevalent in network data, and transitivity, balance, and clusterability are commonly found in dyadic IR data sets that capture international transactions among countries.         "
"10","As we think about third‐order dependencies, knowing the relation between i and j as well as between j and k may reveal something about the relationship between i and k, even when we do not directly observe it. Hoff, Raftery, and Handcock (2002, 1091) note:         "
"11","                        "
"12","In some social network data, the probability of a relational tie between two individuals may increase as the characteristics of the individuals become more similar. A subset of individuals in the population with a large number of social ties between them may be indicative of a group of individuals who have nearby positions in this space of characteristics, or “social space.” Note if some of the characteristics are unobserved, then a probability measure over these unobserved characteristics induces a model in which the presence of two individuals is dependent on the presence of other ties."
"13","In other words, the “social space” summarizing these unobserved characteristics is another “image” of the third‐order dependence in these dyadic data. We describe how to estimate and map these latent positions such that position in a latent space represents these dependencies. Stated differently, once the higher‐order dependencies are taken into account, the dyadic data can be analyzed by techniques such as regression that assume the data are independent of one another."
"14","Conditional on the inclusion of a latent dimension that captures the dependence of the observation on one another, the dyadic data can be treated as independent, and the coefficients can be estimated by well‐known techniques. If the data are truly independent, estimations under these two scenarios will be equivalent, indeed identical. However, if there is clustering or dependence of the observations on one another in the manner specified above, they will diverge substantially. Our hypothesis is that evidence for the Kantian peace argument is based on a faulty assumption of the independence of international events and that once these dependencies are incorporated into the model, a different picture will emerge. The latent variables capture this dependence and allow us to more precisely estimate the effects of the independent variables upon the probability of conflict."
"15","Using the social relations reformulation to capture sender (initiator), receiver (target), and higher‐order dependencies in the MID data, we explore a model analogous to the original specification in Oneal and Russett (1999). This model is analogous, but has two distinct advantages. First, it permits the direct estimation of important dependencies in the dyadic data. These dependencies have implications not only in the means but also in the covariance structures of the data. Second, because the model has a hierarchical format it is unnecessary to force nondyadic variables to have a dyadic character (or vice versa), an unfortunate practice that is widespread in the empirical literature. Each partner to any particular interaction has associated covariates at both the country and dyad level. The hierarchical specification allows relational as well as country‐specific linkages to be coherently included in a single model. Often researchers have tried to deal with dyadic data by creating dyadic versions of all the variables. Joint democracy is an example of such a variable. But we will have much richer analyses when we have models that allow for covariates that are dyadic as well as for covariates that may selectively affect the initiators and targets of dyadic actions. For example, Oneal and Russett (1999) include only covariates that are entirely dyadic in operationalization, a procedure that is typical in the literature. Many extant studies have multilevel covariates, but often these levels are homogenized to one level.11 As a result, there is a distinction in the literature between dyadic and monadic studies of the Kantian peace. Our conceptualization emphasizes that both “monadic” and “dyadic” covariates coexist, at least plausibly, and this framework provides a standard way of incorporating them that also has the benefit of taking advantage of the social relations conceptualization. There are individual and dyadic effects that are neither transparent nor identical in groups that have highly dependent relations. A multilevel approach helps to tease out these specificities. As a result of these advantages we have been able to adopt a simple approach to measuring the three putative foundations of the Kantian peace: democracy, trade, and international organizations.         "
"16","The Kantian strand of the democratic peace theory asserts that dyadic levels of democracy will tend to suppress the likelihood of international conflict and will absolutely prevent the occurrence of war. High levels of economic interaction also have an independent effect in suppressing the probability of conflict, as does joint participation in international organizations. Each of these causal covariates is thought to operate independently. A variety of control variables is often employed, typically including a measure of the capability of the state, such as the level of economic development, measured as gross domestic product (GDP), the size of the country as measured by population, and the amount of democracy in a particular country. At the same time it is often argued that countries that are proximate have a greater opportunity and therefore likelihood of interstate conflict. Thus, some measure of distance between countries is almost always included in contemporary models. We include all of these in our specification, as well. What is different is that the standard models assume that the observations are independent.12 Thus, they assume that the estimated coefficients apply equally to every one of a set of independent observations.         "
"17","The specific variables we employ are patterned after the major results in the literature. Dyadic variables (xij) capture the pillars of the Kantian peace: (1) joint governance structures measured as the product of the polity score of sender and receiver, (2) the imports of the sender from the receiver, and (3) the number of international organizations in which both are members. Like most empirical studies, we also added a measure of the distance between pairs of countries; we use the distance in kilometers between the capital cities. In the dyadic context, i and j index the sending and receiving countries. For both sender and receiver, three country‐level covariates (xi) capture the population, the economic size measured in terms of gross domestic product, as well as the regime type of each country. Detailed information on each of the covariates and their sources may be found in Appendix A.13"
"18","The model is:             "

"20","We modeled the probability of a militarized dispute yij with a logistic link function:            "
"21","Since it has been demonstrated that the empirical results for the Kantian peace are stronger in the period following the end of World War II (Box‐Steffensmeier, Reiter, and Zorn 2003; Gowa 1999), we have focused on militarized interstate disputes over the last 50 years, estimating the model in 11 specific years: {1950, 1955, … , 1995, 2000}. Table 2 provides one “big table of numbers” for the Bayesian estimation of the hierarchical, bilinear random effects model for the year 2000, as an illustration of our basic results.15 It is important to note that the 95% empirical credible limits for all the dyadic variables representing the Kantian peace argument include zero. Stated differently, the three traditional explanatory variables that undergird the notion of a Kantian peace do not have strong, unambiguous empirical effects in the most recent year available for analysis. However, as we show below, in most other years the patterns are more supportive of the notion that higher levels of democracy tend to reduce conflict probabilities; in most years dyadic democracy levels exert a modest, negative impact on the probability of a militarized interstate dispute.16"
"22","The results in Table 2 also demonstrate that the higher‐order dependencies posited are prominent in these data. These dependencies are represented, in part, by the common sender variance, the sender‐receiver covariance, and the common receiver variance. Each is large and important. Taken together, these three components exert a vastly stronger influence on the probability of a militarized dispute among pairs of countries than the standard covariates. Together they are substantially larger than the error variance. It is also worth noting that the dyadic reciprocity of the democratic peace in this particular year is large, a result similar to the large autoregressive coefficients widely reported in empirical literature on the Kantian peace. The size of these components serves to underscore the importance of dependencies in these dyadic data on militarized interstate disputes. These results hold in all years we examined.17"
"23","We present a graphical display of the estimated coefficient for each of the four dyadic variables for each of the 11 years we analyzed in Figure 2. Note that the variances of the estimates are reduced in more recent yearly time slices and that the effect of each variable moves around considerably from year to year, in contrast to the assumptions made in standard, pooled analyses. In particular, the impact of the number of joint memberships in international organizations moves from exerting a modest suppression on militarized interstate disputes in the 1950 through 1970 era, to exhibiting a slight, but always positive impact thereafter. This suggests that international organization membership does not, in recent years, reduce the probability of militarized interstate conflict, but may actually be associated with a greater number of dyadic disputes. In the same way, with the exception of 1990, both the impact of joint democracy and international trade within dyads appears to exert a much smaller impact on the probability of militarized disputes in recent years. This goes against any claim that the forces of the Kantian peace are getting stronger as more countries become democratic. On the other hand, the second row of estimates illustrates that the level of democracy in each country in a dyad generally has an association with increased probability of conflict in militarized interstate disputes. Thus, democracies appear to be more likely to be the first‐mover, or initiator, in a militarized dispute, and they are more likely to be targets of militarized disputes, though this effect seems to be diminishing. It is the confluence of democracy on both sides of the dyad that is associated with fewer instances of conflict, a result that is entirely consistent with the bulk of research on the broader topic of the democratic peace.         "

"25"," Note: The dot in each panel represents the location of the posterior mean estimate and the lines present the 95% credible intervals. The top row displays the estimates for dyadic covariates. The first panel in the second row illustrates estimates for the joint democracy measures. In general, more recent periods have smaller effects as well as smaller variance around these estimated effects.                     "
"26","In addition, we analyzed each decade since 1950, using a bilinear model as specified above. One distinct difference in these analyses is that we counted the number of disputes for each dyad pair during the decade, rather than a simple binary indicator of dispute. As a result, we employed a Poisson link function in the bilinear model. The results are presented visually in Figure 3. These results show that imports tend to reduce the probability of disputes, though in the 1970s this effect was positive, and the 1975 analysis presented earlier had credible intervals spanning zero. Similar to results for individual years, the impact of IGO membership is frequently positive, rather than negative, as the Kantian peace argument would suggest. Distance has a strong negative impact on the probability of MIDs, and its decade‐averaged impacts appear to be increasing in magnitude.            "
"27"," Changing Effects of Covariates, for Five Decades from 1950 to 2000                         "
"28","Compared to the annual results, however, the joint democracy variable has strong and consistently negative impacts on the probability of interstate conflict, exactly as predicted by the Kantian peace argument. To the extent that both partners are more democratic, their joint probability of getting into a dispute with each other is reduced. The separate impact of the level of democracy on both sides of a dyad is shown to be generally negative, but often indistinguishable from zero. Generally, the level of democracy in the initiator is more a powerful retardant for dispute involvement than is the level of democracy in the target. In short, we find more support for the democratic pillar of the Kantian peace in the decade‐based analyses."
"29","How well does the general bilinear model predict militarized interstate disputes? First, we return to the yearly analyses. Incorporating the higher‐order dependencies for the annual data from the year 2000, the model correctly classifies 63 out of 114 militarized interstate disputes (52%, for a cut‐point of 0.0048), accompanied by only 12 false positives. We also provide predictions mirroring our earlier experiment reported in Table 3, which reflects data for a single year. Thirty‐seven disputes are correctly identified by our model using a cut‐point of 0.50, with only six false positives. There is a substantial number of false negatives (77). Using the ex post ante mean to determine the prediction threshold, 63 correct dyadic MID involvements are predicted, with 12 false positives and 51 false negatives. It appears that the model is making reasonable predictions, correctly identifying about one‐half of the observed disputes, accompanied by a relatively low rate of false predictions.18 Importantly, of the 75 predicted disputes about 85% are actual disputes. Not every year has results comparable to those for the most recent year. In some single years, there are very few actual MIDs. Other years have much more modest predictive success. For example, in 1950 (shown in Table 4) only a few militarized dispute involvements are correctly predicted; however, seven disputes are correctly predicted out of a possible 36—almost 20%, accompanied by only three false positives. As shown in Table 5 in 1960, 1975, and 1980, the model fails to predict a single conflict.            "
"30","We present in Figure 4 the latent positions of countries in 1950. These are shown in two plots, one for the MID initiator latent space, on the left, the other the target latent space, shown on the right. Colors correspond to geographical positions, so that similar countries are proximate to one another. For example, the countries of North and South Asia are shown in an aquamarine/turquoise tone. China and North Korea, besides being the largest vectors in the latent space, are located close to one another, virtually overlapping. This illustrates that they have similar patterns (in 1950) of initiation of militarized disputes with other countries. Other groupings in this latent mapping illustrate the clustering of European countries (shown in maroon and also in purple hues). The corresponding illustration of receiver latent space for 1950 also shows considerable geographic clustering. The basic idea of these latent clusters is that they capture the extant dependencies in the data, incorporating them into the model, so that conditional on these latent clusters, the dyadic data may be treated as independent and identically distributed.

"33","Even in years that are sparse in the number of MID involvements, the model still performs better than previous models. Table 5 illustrates the predictions of the model using the posterior mean for each year as the cut‐point. These results, of course, were generated in‐sample. It is a much more demanding task to generate good out‐of‐sample results, where the predictions are not a direct consequence of the data that generated them. We now turn to such an approach, introduced in political science by Beck, King, and Zeng (2000).            "
"34","We focus our discussion on the most recent 10‐year period from 1990 to 2000.19 There are 130 countries for which data are available in this period, resulting in a dyadic matrix of 130 × 130, with the diagonal set by definition to 0. We randomly divide these dyads into two equally sized sets, a training (fit) set and a test set. The model is estimated using data from the training set. Estimated coefficients are then used in combination with the covariate data from the test set to generate predicted probabilities in the test set. This is an out‐of‐sample, cross‐validation of the model. We treat the dependent variable as binary for any conflict during the decade and average covariates over the period. Several models are estimated. First we estimate the general bilinear latent space model, with three latent dimensions as specified in Equation 1. This model was estimated for the full data, and then it was estimated for the randomly generated 50% sample which comprises the training set. The estimates from the fit set estimation were used to predict MIDs in the test set of data; this is labeled “Test Set: Latent,” in figures to follow. Next, using the fit set, we estimated a model that deleted the higher‐order dependencies from Equation 1; this model is essentially a multilevel logistic regression that includes the dyadic as well as sender and receiver covariates. This is labeled “Test Set: Logit” below. Another model was estimated in the same fashion, except that the dyadic covariate that measures the distances among actors was deleted; this model is labeled “Test Set: Logit w/o Distance.” Finally, for comparability we conducted a separate 50% cross‐validation on the Oneal and Russett (1999) model based on Column 2 of Table 1 in their study; this model uses the Oneal and Russett data, their covariates, and their specification, including the four splines to represent the peace years correction. This is labeled “Original OR Study/Data.” We include the peace years correction in the Oneal and Russett model in this cross‐validation experiment in order to gauge the relative performance of that model which specifies a time dependency within dyads, but ignores higher‐order dependencies. This compares to the model developed herein which ignores the time dependencies, but focuses on the higher‐order dependencies.            "
"35"," Figure 5(a) presents the Receiver Operator Characteristics curves for these estimations. The ROC curve presents the true positive prediction rate as a function of the false positive prediction rate, for all possible cut‐points dividing the estimated probabilities into predicted events and nonevents. The light blue line illustrates that the in‐sample accuracy of the latent space model is quite high. The out‐of‐sample ROC curve for this model is shown in blue, and is below the in‐sample fit, illustrating that the model performs worse in out‐of‐sample tests, but that it still is fairly accurate. The red line presents the ROC curve for the standard logistic implementation of the model (which does not specify any higher‐order dependencies). This line is interior to both blue lines, illustrating that it has worse fit compared to the other two estimations. We present a green line which is a standard logistic model that is estimated without the inclusion of the distance variable in the specification. This model captures the ability of the Kantian tripod variables to accurately predict the absence and presence of militarized disputes in out‐of‐sample tests. Finally, the gray line close to the diagonal presents cross‐validation results for the original Oneal and Russett model (including peace years corrections), using their specification and their data for the same decade. This model is the least successful in the cross‐validation experiment. In general, including the higher‐order dependencies allows one to have improved model performance, and it turns out that including distance as a covariate is more important than whether any of the covariates frequently used in this literature is included.

"37"," Note: Results are also presented for a standard logistic model in which the distance covariate is deleted. This illustrates that the out‐of‐sample predictive power of the standard Kantian peace model rests in large part on the inclusion of geographic proximity of dyad pairs, rather than the explanatory power of covariates capturing the substance of the Kantian argument.                        "
"38"," Figure 5(b) illustrates the out‐of‐sample predictive ability of a standard logistic regression compared to the specification which includes the latent representations of the higher‐order dependencies in the data. In this figure we examine the 100 largest predicted probabilities of each of the estimated models, sorted from largest to smallest. We then examine each corresponding dyad to see whether a militarized dispute existed in that dyad. We keep a running total of the number of correctly predicted MIDs and plot it against the running number of dyads checked (from one to 100). For any given model, if the largest 100 probabilities corresponded to 100 dyads that were in militarized interstate disputes, then the plot of the cumulative success would fall along the line y=x; if no MIDs were found in the dyads with the 100 largest predicted probabilities, the line would be indicated by the line y= 0. Better models will have a cumulative predictive success that is closer to the diagonal. This kind of comparison complements the ROC curve and provides a more complete picture of the out‐of‐sample predictive performance than do single number summaries.            "
"39","The standard approach substantially underperforms models that include the latent representation of the higher‐order dependencies in these data. The latent space approach is able to capture approximately twice the number of actual disputes that the logistic specification identifies. In order to gauge further which covariates were important, we selectively eliminated joint democracy, joint memberships in intergovernmental organizations, and measures of economic interdependence, as well as the country‐level covariates. None of these made any difference in the outcome. Instead, we found that deleting the geographic proximity variable drastically undercut the out‐of‐sample predictive ability of the standard model. This is portrayed in Figure 5(b) by the green line. In short, these results suggest that (a) despite a strong in‐sample descriptive performance, a typical approach to examining the Kantian peace is outperformed substantially by a model that includes the higher‐order dependencies that characterize dyadic data and (b) most of the power of the standard Kantian peace model in out‐of‐sample tests is derived from the inclusion of geographic proximity of countries.

"40"," Figure 6 presents a map of countries' positions in three latent dimensions estimated for the period from 1990 to 2000. The latent dimensions, represented here in two dimensions, are scaled to have unit length, but the size of the latent vector is proportional to the size of the acronym representing the country. Further, the initiators are scaled to be located interior to the latent representation of the targets. Three clusters of initiation are evident: one in Africa (indicated by the acronyms for Uganda and Rwanda), another in the Middle East (flagged by Iraq and Jordan), and a third, led by the United States. In terms of the dependencies at the other end of the Militarized Interstate Dispute, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo lead an African cluster, Iraq is revealed as a likely target of United States–initiated disputes, while Jordan, Iraq, and North Korea are shown to be hostile toward the United States and many of its traditional allies. These dependencies are shown by the closeness of country positions in this representation of latent space. Actual militarized interstate disputes are shown in this figure by lines connecting the countries involved.            "

"43","By way of summary, we observe that a bilinear, latent space approach allows coherent heuristics about models that are based on dyadic data. In particular, we learned that it is possible to make new inferences about the Kantian peace. Prime among these is that the Kantian peace tripod is shakier in some years than in others, and we need to understand better this temporal fragility. It seems most solid in years in which scant conflict occurs, but worse in years in which there is more conflict. Ideally a predictive model of conflict should be as strong when there are more conflicts as when there are fewer. Without such a property it is a less reliable guide to policy than would otherwise be the case and, moreover, it is less satisfying theoretically."
"44","Perhaps more importantly, we also learned that interaction dependencies abound in existing data used to study the Kantian peace. Under the standard approach to the Kantian peace—and, we suspect—many other problems in international relations research, second‐ and third‐order dependencies among the data overwhelm the impacts of the standard covariates thought to explain why democracies do not fight one another. This does not mean that empirical theories are incorrect, necessarily. It does mean that they are incomplete if they fail to take into account these contextual dependencies. In particular, we must recognize that countries have a character to their foreign policies that is broadly consistent, imposing a correlation in their actions toward others. Often this is the result of explicit coordination. For example, at the turn of the century, then Chancellor of Germany Gerhard Schröder and President of France Jacques Chirac held informal bilateral dinners every six weeks, reportedly in part to coordinate their foreign policies in opposition to the United States.20 Similarly, some countries elicit similar responses from many others, imposing a correlation in their dyadic behavior patterns. These features of the social relations model are missing from most models in international relations, even those that recognize consistent patterns within dyads over time. These results also show that context is neither impossible to take into account systematically, nor solely the domain of qualitative analysis.            "
"45","The broad research program of the democratic peace has been an attractive research program to many in the field of international relations. This attraction is probably due to the coherence of the program, as well as to the fact that it offers the basis for theoretically informed, empirically supported policy advice, that, if adopted, ought to motivate the enhancement of democratic political institutions. The results of the Kantian peace research program contain similar implications for the promotion of democracy and increasing levels of trade and membership in international governmental organizations. However, in our reexamination none of these aspects receives strong empirical support in the analysis of data from single years. Instead the dependencies in the dyadic data among common senders and common receivers overwhelm the standard covariates thought to be supportive of the Kantian peace. However, when we pool the analysis for decades, we see that these components regain their statistical prominence. We might conclude that the Kantian peace is a longer term phenomenon that might not be visible in separate, yearly slices of data. However, there is an inescapable fact that undercuts this conclusion. When we conduct out‐of‐sample tests of the basic model, we find that despite high statistical significance, none of the variables representing the Kantian tripod is associated with any substantial degree of predictive success. Instead, it is only the distance variable that undergirds the predictions of the standard representation of the Kantian peace. This suggests that the extant results frequently cited in the quantitative literature on the Kantian peace are probably plagued by overfitting. However, the goal of these analyses is an identification of the process whereby international conflict is influenced by democracy, trade, and international organizations."
"46","In comparison, the model that captures the dependencies among countries performs remarkably well in out‐of‐sample tests. While it is true that more complicated models will always do better in in‐sample statistical tests, this is not true of out‐of‐sample examinations. Consequently, we have greater confidence in the contribution that our specifications of the dependencies can bring to the study of the Kantian peace and other international phenomena."
"47","Our results should raise some skepticism about the robustness of the Kantian peace argument. That is not to suggest jettisoning the Kantian ideas. But it does suggest that our certitude about it needs tempering. To be sure, shared democratic political institutions in a dyad reduce the probability of conflict, but the overall effect is modest. Modest effects can, of course, be important. The idea that shared memberships in intergovernmental institutions reduces conflict shows great variation over time, and in recent years actually appears to have a modest positive effect—it is associated with more conflict, not less. Finally, support is virtually nonexistent for the idea that high levels of trade dampen conflict. The Kantian tripod rests on a weaker empirical basis than was previously thought."
"48","In addressing these substantive problems we also attempted to cast light on three more general problems in some empirical work in international relations. The first problem is that dyadic data contain dependencies that are omitted by most popular procedures for analyzing international relations.21 Because regression‐based approaches assume that the data are exchangeable and the errors independently and identically distributed, they are unable to capture the extent to which dependent data may actually reflect the ebb and flow of international politics. In reviewing the difficulties of analyzing dyadic international relations data, King noted that the thorniest problem is to unravel the dependencies in dyadic data that result in biased estimates of coefficients and covariance structures, and further suggested that “[a] logical methodological starting point for addressing the problems at hand would be based on Bayesian hierarchical, random effects, or split population models” (2001, 506).22"
"49","A second important problem concerns the basic inferential model that dominates popular practice in the field of international relations and other disciplines. Since much research in international relations is based on observational studies that have a large number of cases, there is an appearance of statistical significance in almost all the findings in the literature, even considering the well‐known publication bias for positive and statistically significant results. Actually, the prevailing popular statistical approach reflects the ability of the tests to detect small differences—i.e., the power of the tests—as well as the number of observations more than it reveals any underlying statistical significance of hypothesized causal linkages (Gill 1999; Savage 1957). This research tradition somehow expects more from tests of significance, an expectation that probably creates more problems than it solves. While observational data rarely comprise a random sample, they nevertheless are frequently treated as an enormous one. Large samples have immense statistical power that large collations of observational data do not. As a result, statistical significance tests can be badly misleading in terms of producing information about the underlying data generating processes by allowing scholars to attribute statistical significance to summary characteristics known a priori to be different.         "
"50","Finally, many studies have focused solely on statistical significance as a measure of “fit,” while at the same time avoiding evaluations of the out‐of‐sample fit of estimated model predictions with actual data. Regression diagnostics are only one heuristic, not the terminus of scientific investigation. Indeed, they can often be misleading by suggesting confidence in results that are highly uncertain. We show that a predictive (out‐of‐sample) heuristic helps to protect scholars from making statistical inferences that may be problematic. In this regard, we underscore Beck, King, and Zeng's (2000) insights about using predictive cross‐validation for model assessment in international relations. The basic idea is quite simple: a good model will not only have estimated quantities of interest that are informative, but it also should accurately map the covariate information into the dependent variable in a new set of similar data. In terms of predicting the pattern of militarized interstate disputes, this does not appear to be the case for Kantian peace theory.         "
"51","One weakness of work on this topic to date is the absence of any substantial consideration of time dependencies, despite our demonstration that other dependencies are important. Given that many research reports use the time series corrections of Beck and Katz (1995, who have now somewhat revised their earlier recommendations; Beck and Katz 2004) but ignore the second‐ and third‐order dependencies, it seemed reasonable to focus on the latter as a way of opening up a new line of thinking about dependencies. In the long run it will be important to include temporal as well as higher‐order dependencies in our models of interstate interaction. However, no one has yet solved this problem.23"
