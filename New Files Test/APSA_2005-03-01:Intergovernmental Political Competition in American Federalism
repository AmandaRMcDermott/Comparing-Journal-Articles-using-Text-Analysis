"1","This section details the formal model for the simple case of only one level of government supplying the publicly provided goods or services. Whether scholars of federalism are interested in questions of centralization and devolution of power (Chubb 1985a, 1985b; Crémer and Palfrey 1999; Treisman 1999; Weaver 1996; Zimmerman 1992), tax and spending efficiency (Gordon 1983; McKinnon and Nechyba 1997; Musgrave 1983), or policy responsiveness (Boeckelman 1992; Lowry 1992; Wood 1991), their initial focus must be on the motivations of governmental officials within the various levels of government. Unfortunately, many models of federalism are not explicit about what motivates politicians and how national and state political interests interact (but see Chen and Ordeshook 1994; Crémer and Palfrey 2000; Nechyba 1997; Persson and Tabellini 1996; Treisman 1999; Weingast 1995). In this model, as formalized below, politicians receive credit for providing goods demanded by their constituents and blame for taxes.6"
"2","This baseline version of the model is a simple decision theoretic choice by a policy maker within a single level of government—for example a spending decision by a governor in a policy area in which there is no national involvement. This policy maker chooses what quantity of the good to provide. The decision is made to maximize the policy maker's utility, based on the following utility equation:            "
"3","The provision of a quantity of goods is costly, and that cost increases with the amount of the good provided. For example, the provision of health care involves costs of buildings, doctors, medications, supplies, and so on, all of which increase as the government expands eligibility for medical services and the level of benefits available.10 It is assumed that these costs are paid through taxation, although the tax system may have some level of inefficiency (due to waste, oversight and monitoring, drains on economic growth, substitution effects, and so on). For example, a state seeking to raise revenue through a sales tax may find residents changing their spending behavior by buying fewer goods or making purchases out of state.11 Assuming a balanced budget, the following equation captures how taxes are raised to pay the costs of good provision:12αt=mq. Based on the level of tax efficiency (α), taxes (t) are raised to cover the marginal costs (m) of the quantity (q) of good provision. The level of tax efficiency is given by the constant α, which ranges between 0 and 1. For a value of α= 1, the tax system is perfectly efficient. Lower values indicate inefficiency in the ability of the government to raise taxes. The marginal costs of the good provision are given by m, a positive real constant.13 Because m and α are constants, it is easy to solve this taxation equation for t, indicating that the level of taxation is a simple function of q: .         "
"4","Inserting this function into Equation (1) shows that the policy maker's utility is based solely on his or her choice of quantity of the good to provide:            "
"5","This choice gives rise to the following proposition:"
"6","Proposition 1  Given provision by only one level of government, a greater quantity of the good is provided when: (a) marginal costs are smaller; (b) tax efficiency is greater; and (c) demand for the good is greater.            "
"7","Proof:  Proofs of all propositions are given in the appendix.            "
"8","As we would expect based on the construction of the utility function, the government is responsive to the citizens in order to claim credit for the program benefits and to limit blame for taxation. As the public demands a greater amount of good provision, the government provides that higher quantity. As the tax system becomes more efficient, or as the good becomes less expensive, the government provides a greater amount of the desired good. This idealistic view of the world becomes more complicated when a second level of government is introduced."
"9","This section expands the model of the previous section to include both a national and a state government within a single representative state. Intuitively, the policy makers could be thought of as a governor and a senator from the state with the median level of desire for national spending in the particular policy area. Three additional assumptions are used in this model of intergovernmental political competition. First, the utility that the state and national policy makers receive is based on the fraction of the total provision of the goods and services and fraction of the total level of taxation for which the state and national governments are responsible, respectively. For example, if the national and state governments both provide the goods and require taxation, they share in the credit and the blame; however, if only one level of government engages in public good provision, it receives the full credit and blame for the spending and taxation. Second, to better reflect reality, the state and national governments are allowed to differ from one another in their marginal costs (m) and levels of tax efficiency (α). Third, the national government is assumed to choose its level of good provision before the state government. Although this assumption does not affect the comparative statics results discussed below, it does allow for a larger range of values under which the national government engages in a type of preemption, selecting a substantial enough level of the good such that the state policy maker chooses not to join in its provision.15"
"10","These assumptions are formalized in the following utility equations and game structure:            "
"11","Therefore, a policy maker considering increasing the quantity of publicly provided goods and services weighs three factors in determining the credit he or she will receive: (1) the greater quantity produced leads to a larger total amount of credit, (2) this policy maker receives a fraction of that total rise in credit depending on the proportion of the good provided by his or her government, and (3) that proportion of credit increases along with the proposed increase in quantity. The same three factors are relevant in assigning blame based on taxation."
"12","As in the unitary government model, the amount of taxation for each level of government is determined by its chosen quantity, by its relative tax efficiency (α), and by its marginal costs (m). As noted in the second assumption above, tax efficiency and costs are allowed to differ by level of government. This reflects the real world where, for example, increases in sales taxes or in corporate and individual income taxes by states cause the loss of tax bases across state lines in ways that national taxes do not. Thus state and national taxation, respectively, are given by the following: "
"13","Inserting these levels of taxation (tS and tN) and the credit and blame fractions (fC,S, fC,N, fB,S, and fB,N) into Equations (4) and (5) yields equations that are now only functions of state and national quantities (qS and qN) and constant parameters (d, mS, mN, αS, and αN):19"
"14","As suggested by the third assumption above, the game structure is very simple. First the national government chooses a level of provision (qN), then the state government chooses a level of provision (qS). Sequential games of this nature are solved through backwards induction. Doing so yields the following optimal choices of quantity, with intermediate steps shown in the appendix:            "
"15","When the state government is much more efficient than the national government , the national government policy maker would receive more blame than credit for joint provision of the good. In such circumstances, the national government bows out leaving the state government to act as a sole provider, selecting the quantity derived above in the case of unitary governance. Conversely, when the national government is much more efficient than the state , the national government acts as a sole provider, with its provision chosen as in the case of unitary governance.         "
"16","When the national government is only somewhat more efficient than the state government, it can use its “first mover” position in the game to preclude any state provision. In particular, for , the national policy maker will choose to provide a quantity of the good in excess of what it would desire to provide on its own, in order to keep the state government from providing some of the good and capturing a share of the credit from its provision.         "
"17","Finally, when the state and national government are fairly comparable in their provision abilities, they engage in joint provision. Taken together, this result leads to the following propositions."
"18","Proposition 2  Given intergovernmental political competition, whichever level of government is considerably more efficient at good provision will engage in its supply to the exclusion of the less efficient level. Given fairly similar levels of efficiency, both state and national governments will provide the good.            "
"19","According to this result, one attractive feature of intergovernmental political competition is that, when one level of government is much more efficient than the other, the more efficient level will act as a sole provider. For example, due to economies of scale, a national postal service is likely to gain preeminence over state‐level services in any federal system. For such policy areas, a system of layer cake federalism, with constitutional assignment of specific governmental functions to a single level of government, would yield the same result given extremely different governmental capabilities, as long as the specified assignment is to the more efficient level of government. Given dramatic changes in the relative costs of provision or taxation abilities of the state and federal governments, however, constitutional assignment could potentially result in the less efficient level of government being assigned control within a particular policy arena. For instance, a number of federal systems constitutionally assign education provision to subnational governments to preserve a diversity of standards across a heterogeneous population, as well as for other purposes. If, over time, the population becomes more homogeneous and the national government becomes better able to raise taxes and to provide educational funding and services, the previously beneficial constitutional specificity may become an undesirable constraint."
"20","According to the model, differences between marble cake federalism and layer cake federalism emerge when the relative capabilities of the two levels of government are not significantly different from one another. This is the true case of competitive federalism, where both levels of government jointly provide the goods or services. Pleasingly, this competition is responsive to the relative abilities of the joint providers, as noted in the following."
"21","Proposition 3  Given good provision by both the state and national governments, each level of government increases its good provision when: (a) its marginal costs decrease; (b) its tax efficiency increases; (c) demand for the good increases; (d) marginal costs increase for the other level of government; and (e) the tax efficiency decreases for the other level of government.            "
"22","The elements of this proposition note the tradeoffs and competition across different levels of government in a federal system.20 As one governmental level becomes more efficient (either in the costs of provision or in its ability to raise taxes), its portion of the total good provision increases. This is in line with the theory of functional federalism (Peterson 1995). However, the political considerations introduced in this model of intergovernmental political competition also run counter to functional federalism at times. It is not simply the case that which ever level of government is a more efficient provider of a good will provide it with other levels of government bowing out. Rather, if there is political utility to be gained by providing a good, even if another level of government provides it more efficiently, politicians will choose to provide such a good. Therefore, intergovernmental political competition introduces the possibility of inefficiency in the provision of goods. For example, national politicians seeking to build a tough‐on‐crime image may desire to become involved in providing policing services, despite more efficient targeted policing at the state and local levels.21 The credit‐claiming logic presented here thus explains the persistence of joint provision despite advice on proper programmatic allocation offered by scholars like Oates (1968, 1972), Rivlin (1992), and Peterson (1995).            "
"23","As noted in Proposition 3, for the case of simultaneous provision of a good, national government provision may increase for a variety of reasons, ranging from a decline in its own costs, to an increase in its relative tax efficiency, to a rise in the marginal costs of state provision, to an increase in public demand for the provided good. State responses to this increase will be very much tied to the motivation behind increased federal spending, as detailed in the following proposition.22"
"24","Proposition 4  When a greater quantity of good provision by the national government results from increased public demand for the good, then state quantities will increase as well. When a greater quantity of good provision by the national government results from decreased marginal costs of national provision, decreased relative state tax efficiencies, or increased marginal costs of state provision, then state quantities will decrease.            "
"25","This proposition details the general direction of state responses to changing federal spending patterns.23 If the major thrust behind national spending increases or decreases is a change in the public's demand for spending in a particular program area, we should expect the same direction of movements in state and federal spending. If, on the other hand, federal spending changes in response to the relative costs or efficiencies of providing a good at one level of government or the other, then state and federal spending patterns should move in opposite directions. For example, following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, public demand for homeland security increased dramatically. Spending at the national level did not displace state and local spending. Rather, state spending on security increased as well, although it varied by state depending on the degree of budget crisis faced in each state. Earlier eras saw similar joint federal‐state spending increases in response to greater public demand in such areas as education and health care.            "
"26","When national provision rises due to a decrease in relative costs (such as found with increasing economies of scale) or an increase in tax efficiency, we would expect a decrease in state spending. Other than during wars, probably the greatest increase in national spending relative to state spending resulted from the Sixteenth Amendment, allowing the federal government to tax incomes.24 This permitted the national government to raise substantial revenues with fewer adverse economic effects and less political blame than other revenue sources at its disposal. Also of great importance is the balanced budget restriction in effect in most states but not the national government (McKinnon and Nechyba 1997). The lack of such a requirement for the national government allows national politicians to raise taxes in a “politically more efficient” manner, by passing costs to future generations. While Proposition 4 explores state responses to increasing national provision, similar relationships develop upon national spending cuts. When running deficits became less politically acceptable in the 1980s and early 1990s, the relative ability of the national government to raise revenue with little blame decreased, resulting in fewer intergovernmental grants, greater policy devolution, and more unfunded mandates (Gramlich 1987; Posner 1998; Quigley and Rubinfeld 1996; Weaver 1996). The fact that many states substituted their own revenues for declining federal funds was something of a mystery (Forrester and Spindler 1990; Stonecash 1990), but fits nicely with the theory presented here. Drops in federal funding were not a result of decreased demand but of tax revolts and the political inability of the federal government to continue running annual deficits in hundreds of billions of dollars. Therefore declining federal funds represented a credit‐claiming opportunity at the state level.            "
"27","State‐by‐state variation could be explained simply by parameters moving in different directions in different states over time. However, the model's results predict more systematic patterns as well. Consider the state government joint provision quantity, rewritten here:               "
"28","As noted above, this system of intergovernmental political competition has many nice features. When one level of government is far more efficient than another, that efficient level of government provides the good to the exclusion of the other. When both provide the good, spending is responsive to the relative costs and tax efficiencies of the two levels of government. Despite these features, however, this system as a whole is inefficient over the broad range of conditions under which the governments jointly provide the public good. This inefficiency arises for two reasons. First, because the less efficient government provides the good in conjunction with the more efficient government, the provision is by definition more costly than were the more efficient level of government to provide the good by itself. Second, the political competition that leads to joint provision also leads to overprovision relative to provision by either level of government acting by itself."
"29","Proposition 5  Under joint provision, intergovernmental political competition leads to greater governmental spending and taxation than would occur were one level of government solely responsible for the public good provision.               "
"30","Because politicians in this model have utility functions that imitate efficient agents of the voters, and because they are assigned credit and blame in exact proportion to their activities, it may be surprising that the model leads to inefficient outcomes. Inefficiencies arise, however, from these multiple actors seeking to take credit that they would not receive if they had left good provision to the more efficient level of government. This inefficiency is not simply a product of the common culprits of duplication of services or of “tragedy of the commons” problems of distributive politics (Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen 1981). Instead, because credit and blame are shared, and because blame increases in quantity at a rate exceeding that of credit, the total quantity at which the marginal blame from further taxation equals the marginal credit from further provision is higher. This finding illustrates how a focus on vertical competition yields very different predictions from models of horizontal competition (Tiebout 1956; Brennan and Buchanan 1980), in which competitive pressures across subnational governments rein in the leviathan of massive government spending.               "
"31","Returning to Grodzins' marble cake vs. layer cake analogy, it seems that, based on the model as presented so far, proper constitutional assignment of policy control to the more efficient level of government would yield better outcomes across the board than would the system of competitive federalism brought about by lack of constitutional assignment. This view changes substantially, however, upon significant heterogeneity across states."
"32","To explore the model with multiple states, it is beneficial to rely on four additional assumptions. First, I here allow the states to differ from one another in their public demands (thus state i has public demand di), in their marginal costs of provision (m), and in their tax efficiencies (α).25 Second, I assume an odd number of states each individually represented in a national government operating under a majoritarian decision rule. This means that the national government's choice of quantity will reflect that desired by the national policy maker from the median state, with just under half of the other national politicians desiring less spending and just under half desiring greater spending. The median state is defined by its demands (dM), costs (m), and tax efficiency (α), which in combination influence the quantity desired by the national policy maker representing this state. The median national representative, best thought of as a senator from the median state, still bases his or her decisions on the national government's marginal costs (mN) and tax efficiency (αN), while realizing that credit and blame will be given based on the total good provision and taxation in his or her home (median) state. Third, I assume that the quantity chosen by the national government is the same for each state. This is not to say that the same amount of money would be spent in large and small states, only that the same level of national defense or environmental regulations would be applicable in all states.26 Fourth, I here focus on the case of model parameters under which there is joint provision of the good by national and state governments.27 Outside of these parameter values, only one level of government would provide the good, yielding the unitary case above.         "
"33","All other assumptions remain as in the single‐state model above. Once again, the national government first chooses a quantity, then the state governments choose their quantities.28 The national quantity is chosen based on the conditions in the median state, SM, while state‐level decisions depend on the conditions within each individual state. As derived in the appendix, the quantity choices for state i and for the national government are as follows:            "
"34","As one might expect, the decision of the national government is the same as above, where the single representative state is now the median state. Which state is the median depends on the combination of state characteristics. For the simplified case where the states only vary from one another based on marginal costs, for example, the median is simply the state with the median costs. National government representatives from states with higher marginal costs desire greater national spending, while those from states with lower marginal costs desire less national spending. Thus the competition for credit between state and national policy makers leads these national representatives to appear quite responsive to their states' conditions and to make arguments in favor of efficiency. Yet this result arises not from an assumption that politicians seek efficient policy outcomes (indeed there is no such assumption in the model); rather, politicians are motivated here simply by credit claiming and blame avoidance.         "
"35","All of the conditions of Proposition 3 continue to hold. Each state increases its provision when its marginal costs decrease, its tax efficiency increases, and public demand within the state increases, as well as when the national government's costs increase and tax efficiency decreases. In addition, however, each state is now also responsive to features in the median state, as these influence the spending decisions of the national government. When marginal costs increase in the median state, the quantity chosen by each of the other states decreases in equilibrium. Higher costs in the median state lead the median national policy maker to gain an advantage from greater national spending, which in turn results in lower spending in the other states, leading to the appearance of a diffusion of spending decisions across states. This finding provides an alternative logic that complements evidence of horizontal federal competition, consistent with policy diffusion across states (Berry and Berry 1990) or the potential “race to the bottom” in social service benefits (Bailey and Rom 2004; Berry, Fording, and Hansen 2003; Volden 2002). Perceived insufficient provision of health or welfare services in the average state may lead to greater national involvement, which in turn could lead to lower social service provision spreading across the states.         "
"36","This multiple‐state model is advanced to show that the conditions above hold beyond the case of a single representative state and to explore how heterogeneity across states affects the relative efficiency of intergovernmental political competition within marble cake federalism compared to constitutional assignment resulting in layer cake federalism. This latter point is best illustrated in the following three‐state example."
"37","In the single‐state model, it was established that competitive federalism, resulting here from the lack of explicit constitutional assignment, led to less efficient outcomes than would have occurred under proper assignment to the best provider. Does this finding hold given heterogeneity across states? The short answer is: no. To illustrate this finding and the interaction between heterogeneity and efficiency in the optimal assignment of governmental functions, consider the following three‐state example. Here the states differ from one another only in terms of demand for public provision, with all states having the same marginal costs and tax efficiencies as one another. The levels of public demand in the low‐demand and median‐demand states are fixed at one (dL= dM= 1), with the level of demand in the high‐demand state (dH) allowed to vary. The greater this value, the more heterogeneous the states are. The states and the national government are here assumed to be perfectly efficient in their tax collection (αN=αS= 1). National marginal costs are fixed at one (mN= 1), with state marginal costs allowed to vary. Thus the states are more efficient providers for mS < 1 and less efficient for mS > 1.            "
"38","The goal here is to compare the utility produced by the system of competitive federalism to both national government assignment and state government assignment for the entire range of dH and mS. To do so, I rely on the utility function of Equation (1), U=dq−t2, aggregated across the three states. For the cases of national assignment and state assignment, the quantities are those chosen by those two governments, respectively. For the case of joint provision, the quantities provided (and taxes raised) by the two levels of government are added together and inserted into Equation (1).            "
"39","Consider first the case of national assignment. The national government's quantity is based on the level of demand in the median state, leading to the following total utility level:29"
"40","Next consider the case of state assignment. Were control over this policy area assigned to the states as sole providers, their provisions would depend on state characteristics as in the unitary government model, yielding a total level of utility across the three states equal to:               "
"41","Finally, for the case of joint provision under intergovernmental political competition, the quantities chosen are as in Equations (11) and (12) above, yielding an overall utility of:               "
"42","Comparing these utilities allows an understanding of conditions under which marble cake federalism may be preferred over layer cake federalism. Figure 1 shows the regions over which each of these three assignment regimes produces the best outcome. Boundary conditions between the regions are determined by setting the utility equations equal to one another and solving for mS.            "
"43","                 Optimal Assignment in a Federal System                         "
"44","Assignment of policy control to the state governments is preferred for the entire range over which states can provide the good more cheaply (mS < mN= 1), and even for slightly higher costs given enough heterogeneity across states. In this region, state assignment precludes national provision, which would be more costly and not responsive to state heterogeneity. Indeed, national assignment is only optimal in the upper left region of the figure, where state heterogeneity is quite low and the national government can provide the good at a lower cost. Finally, the system of competitive federalism is preferred when the national government is a more efficient, lower cost provider, but when there is also substantial variation across states. Here, the national government establishes a baseline level of provision for all states, which it can achieve with fairly low costs. Unlike in the case of national assignment, however, here the states can engage in additional provision beyond the national minimum. Although the states face higher costs, state‐level policy makers are able to be more responsive to local conditions than are national policy makers, thus yielding a more desirable pattern of good provision. This illustration can be represented by the following proposition.30"
"45","Proposition 6  A system of intergovernmental political competition is preferred over explicit assignment to the state or national government when: (a) the national government is a more efficient provider of the public good, and (b) there is substantial heterogeneity across states.               "
"46","Under such circumstances, joint provision occurs with the national government providing some federal baseline level of goods and services, while the various states add their own level of provision on top of national activities. While this model focuses on direct provision of goods, rather than on regulatory federalism, this finding is also consistent with many regulatory policies. For example, in environmental standards or in minimum wages, the national government issues minimum standards at or above which states can set their policies. When the national government is more efficient at setting such standards (because of better information, for example), and when the states are heterogeneous in their policy preferences, such joint regulatory policy is more beneficial than sole state‐level or national‐level policy determination."
"47","Zimmerman calls for a general theory of federalism that “emphasizes the continuous readjustment of the respective competences of Congress and the states, and explains that relations between the national government and a state and its political subdivisions are not uniform in each state and are affected by a variety of factors” (2001, 29). This article takes a major step toward that goal, by advancing a new model of American federalism based on the concept of political competition among politicians in different levels of government. Properly characterizing the motivations of politicians at various levels of government is crucial to understanding the workings of federal systems. Relying on such explicit characterizations of political motivations, this article explores state and national government responses to changes in program costs, public demands, and tax efficiency. It characterizes conditions under which the more efficient level of government will take the lead in programmatic spending. And it explains why states react differently to changes in national spending patterns."
"48","The model presented here thus offers a number of normative claims and positive propositions. Normatively, the theory suggests conditions under which clear allocation of authority to the states or to the national government would be preferable to lack of assignment. Where states are able to raise taxes efficiently and to provide specific goods and services at low costs relative to the national government, state assignment is preferred, as it precludes meddling by national politicians. Likewise, where the national government is a more efficient provider and the states are quite homogeneous, national assignment keeps state politicians from becoming involved in the policy area in a quest for credit. This is consistent with reform proposals to allocate programmatic responsibility to specific levels of government that perform best in particular areas (Rivlin 1992; Peterson 1995). However, the model shows that lack of assignment leading to joint provision is actually desirable when the national government can efficiently set a base standard that heterogeneous states can exceed with their own provision.         "
"49","In positive terms, the model presented here offers predictions that are relevant comparatively across countries and specifically within American federalism. Proposition 5 predicts a larger public sector in federal systems with joint provision than in unitary systems with single‐level provision. This stands in contrast with work focused on horizontal competition predicting that decentralized systems will limit the size of government. For example, Brennan and Buchanan (1980) offer the Leviathan Hypothesis—that when expenditures and taxes are decentralized the size of government will be smaller. Yet the empirical work on the relationship between federalism and/or decentralization and the growth of government has produced quite mixed results, plausibly because vertical intergovernmental competition offsets horizontal competition.31 Such a possibility points to the benefit of work like Rodden (2003), which separates horizontal competition (degree of decentralization) from vertical pressures (intergovernmental transfers), finding support consistent with both the Leviathan Hypothesis and the model presented here. Future studies breaking down expenditures by policy area and determining the degree of joint provision within those areas would advance our understanding even further.         "
"50","In the realm of American politics, the model's predictions range from obvious (more spending on highly demanded services provided at low cost) to unexpected (varied state responses to changing national priorities). The latter could be tested with data on national and state spending, public demands, marginal costs, and tax efficiency. Depending on the policy area, spending data are available from many sources, and public demands could be calculated nationally (and occasionally by state) through surveys about spending priorities. Marginal costs could be calculated by program area, as teacher salaries, construction costs, land values, health care costs, and the like vary substantially across states. And tax efficiency could be calculated through data exploring the tax capacity and tax effort of each state (Berry and Fording 1997). Taken together, a suitable research design would begin with major spending changes by the national government. If the theory presented here is correct, state responses should be a function of national factors as well as state demands, costs, and tax efficiency, as stipulated in Equation (10). As indicated there, some of these effects will be nonlinear and complicated. Nevertheless, it is important to uncover these relationships if we are to determine the likely effects of changing national spending priorities over time. Moreover, such predicted responses could shed light on which states' representatives in Congress are most likely to support which spending proposals.         "
"51","Beyond the prospects for empirical exploration of the propositions raised here, the model can serve well as a basis for further theoretical work. Relying on direct provision of goods and services as a baseline, scholars could include the possibility of the national government instead using intergovernmental grants. This would allow a better understanding of when such grants are used, when subnational governments are likely to apply for and accept grants, and how they change their spending patterns in response to grant funding. Further theoretical work could explore when the national government instead relies on preemptive actions or unfunded mandates, placing restrictions or demands on the actions of the states."
"52","In summary, limited constitutional assignment in American federalism creates a complicated system. The political nature of decisions within this system results in legislative federalism tempered by functional federalism. The complex patterns of state and national spending and taxation make sense only in light of these considerations. The model of intergovernmental political competition advanced here thus provides for a clearer conceptualization of the marble cake that is American federalism."
