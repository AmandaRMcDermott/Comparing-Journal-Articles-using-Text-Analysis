"1","Since good, general treatments of the importance of contiguity and territory have been offered elsewhere (e.g., Diehl 1991; Hensel 2000; Vasquez 1993, 1995), I will only briefly discuss them here. My main purpose is to develop a new theoretical account that effectively incorporates the roles of both contiguity and territory into a single explanation. In developing this new account, I make reference to Starr's (1978) opportunity and willingness framework, as it provides some useful organizing concepts for the discussion to follow. In particular, his notion of opportunity resonates well with my analysis of geographic contiguity, while his idea of willingness provides a useful conceptual lens through which to view territory and its particular effects on conflict.         "
"2","The geographic contiguity of states, not taking into consideration the particular nature of any grievances between them, has consistently been cited as a key variable in explaining conflict (e.g., Bremer 1992; Diehl 1985). One particularly useful way to think about this variable is provided by the opportunity component of Starr's opportunity and willingness framework. Drawing on work by Boulding (1962) and Sprout and Sprout (1965), Starr (1978) highlights the importance of contiguity in providing a more ready occasion for conflict. Occasion here, to be clear, refers to what is often called interaction opportunity, or the extent to which a certain policy is possible for a state and, if it is, how feasible its implementation would be. At its most basic level, a contiguity‐based account argues that while states may choose not to fight, the geographic nearness of contiguous states provides a setting amenable to conflictual interactions. And since higher levels of conflict require increased degrees of participant commitment, it is also reasonable to expect that great distances between disputants will not only quell their propensity for engaging in conflict, but also lower the chances that they will continue fighting at increasingly intense phases of dispute. In other words, a contiguity‐based explanation argues that states are less constrained in their opportunities for all levels of interaction and participation, including militarized disputes and wars, when the venue of combat is geographically nearby.         "
"3","While this account is fine as a starting point, ideally, we would also want to know what makes conflict and its escalation more or less likely in the presence of contiguity and the interaction opportunity it provides. Herein lies the weakness of the contiguity/conflict literature. In short, though interaction opportunity is posited as a necessary condition for conflict, either little is said or a random process is assumed about conflict beyond that. The random walk notion supposes that proximate states will simply interact with one another more frequently and, just like those who drive in traffic are more apt to get into accidents, frequently interacting states are more likely to have conflictual (as well as cooperative) interactions (Bremer 1992, 2000; Gleditsch and Singer 1975). The reliance on this random walk idea underscores how underdeveloped this literature is in answering the following question: given ample opportunity to enter into conflict, what specific factors push states to actually do so?         "
"4","The opportunity and willingness framework suggests that the answer to the above question, and the key to filling the void in the contiguity/conflict literature, lies in “willingness.” As Starr uses the term, willingness refers simply to the degree to which an actor desires to pursue a particular policy action. That is, peaceful states may be perfectly able to engage a potential foe (i.e., they have an apt level of interaction opportunity), but clearly unwilling to do so because they deem the issue at hand insufficient to justify such engagement. And while there are a number of possible factors that can affect willingness (a point to which I return below), the most prominent rooted in geography focuses on territory and the role of territorial grievances."
"5","The general conception of territory as a strong impetus for militarized action is at the heart of a territory‐based explanation of conflict (Vasquez 1993; see also Huth 1996; Senese and Vasquez 2004, n.d.). And this is true in terms of both onset and escalation (Senese and Vasquez 2003). A basic tenet, for instance, of the territorial account is that domestic populations are more concerned with preserving the integrity of land and more willing to fight in defense of it than in defense of an ideological or policy stance. Additionally, a territorial disagreement may become a foundational threat to a state's security since, by definition, nation‐states comprise well‐defined and controlled areas of land. Given this, any threat to such a basic element of a state's makeup will be given high priority by that state's leadership. For these reasons, then, states are simply more willing to resort to the initial use of military force when the issue at stake involves territory. With specific regard to escalation, the territorial explanation maintains that territorial disputes will have a greater probability of escalation, as both sides have ample willingness to stay the course and not back down. In these ways, then, territorial disagreements are expected to raise the chances of both militarized dispute onset and escalation, relative to nonterritorial disagreements.         "
"6","Taken together, it appears that contiguity and territory fit nicely within an opportunity and willingness schema. While previous work has marked each separately as an important predictor of conflict, a first important advance of the joint contiguity‐territorial explanation developed here lies in its explicit consideration of both contiguity and territory as important precipitators of conflict. This is not to imply that the previous research focusing on contiguity or territory states that only one or the other can logically affect levels of conflict. Instead, it is to say that this prior work does not fully consider the impacts of both within the same theoretical model. Further, joint consideration is nicely in line with Starr's (1978) claim that some minimal level of both opportunity and willingness must exist before a conflict choice can be made. A second advance of the joint explanation is its expectation that the effects of contiguity and territory are disproportionate across the two phases of conflict, as opposed to a nondifferentiation between dispute and war onset shown in most prior work. In this way, the joint explanation approximates more closely the notion of Kinsella and Russett (2002), who also build on the work of Starr, that the effects of causal factors may not be consistent along the range of international conflict.         "
"7","In line with the first of these two advancements, we can begin to derive theoretical expectations for a joint account. Owing to the posited conflict‐enhancing potential of both contiguity and territory, a joint version expects the least dispute and war‐prone dyads to be noncontiguous with no outstanding territorial disagreements. Such cases represent situations where the mutual absence of contiguity and territorial grievances generally reduces both opportunity and willingness, respectively. And, logically, the flip side of this produces an expectation that the most dispute and war‐prone dyads will consist of contiguous states with territorial disagreements.         "
"8","The main implications of the joint account's second advancement come into play in differentiating the expected tendencies of the other two scenarios—contiguous pairs without territorial disagreements and noncontiguous pairs with territorial disagreements. Since a lack of opportunity is often seen as a factor that prevents discord from arising in the first place, an opportunity and willingness framework suggests that contiguity is most crucial at the dispute onset phase. The key rationale behind this expectation is the observation that contiguity is both quite stable and obvious—stable in the sense that states only rarely see change in this aspect of their relationship, and obvious in that both sides clearly know if they are neighbors. Therefore, since information pertaining to whether states are contiguous or not is public from the beginning, the disproportionate effect of this factor should be included in leaders' conflict choices at the outset. Once a dispute has begun though, contiguity becomes less important as the most significant barriers of opportunity have already been weighed and overcome."
"9","It is at this point where willingness becomes relatively more meaningful, leading a joint theoretical explanation to place greater emphasis on the effect of territory in pushing ongoing disputes to war. Contrary to the immediately transparent nature of contiguity, knowledge about an opponent's commitment to fight over a particular issue (such as disputed territory) is less obvious early on. This aspect of willingness starts out more within the domain of private information and, while somewhat apparent at early stages, only becomes more public as a conflict unfolds. Territory fits nicely within this framework, as states become more aware of each other's dedication to stay the course only as persuasive actions (in the form of escalation behavior) are exhibited. And since a good deal of extant theory and empirical findings suggest that contested territory is at the very core of states' priorities, its magnified role in the escalation of militarized conflict (compared to its onset) is to be expected."
"10","Deriving from this logic of a joint contiguity‐territorial explanation, then, the following two hypotheses naturally follow:"
"11","                        "
"12","(Dispute Onset): The expected probability ranking of dispute onset based on the presence or absence of contiguity and territorial claims is (from lowest to highest): Noncontiguous, Nonterritorial < Noncontiguous, Territorial < Contiguous, Nonterritorial < Contiguous, Territorial."
"13","(War Onset): The expected probability ranking of war onset based on the presence or absence of contiguity and territorial disputes is (from lowest to highest): Noncontiguous, Nonterritorial < Contiguous, Nonterritorial < Noncontiguous, Territorial < Contiguous, Territorial."
"14","While the joint explanation considers both contiguity and territory in explicating dispute and war onset, it weighs their effects unevenly across these two phases of conflict. It does so by placing relatively more emphasis on the impact of contiguity (opportunity) in states' decisions to enter disputes in the first place, while granting a greater relative influence to territory (willingness) on disputants' choices to escalate to war. In this way then, this new joint explanation reflects a form of contingency that reveals itself in disparate expectations across the two phases of conflict, as evidenced in the disparate orderings of the two middle categories across the two hypotheses."
"15","In appraising the above hypotheses, answers to several related questions are also revealed. For instance, I assess whether or not contiguity affects conflict chances even in the absence of territorial disagreement, and, whether or not territory increases the risk of disputes and war even in the absence of contiguity. In addition, I evaluate the possibility that nongeography based opportunity and willingness factors may supplement, or substitute for, the posited effects of contiguity and territory. For example, major power status and high levels of economic development may provide degrees of interaction opportunity similar to those of contiguity, while the absence of alliance ties and joint democracy may facilitate the willingness of states to engage in militarized disputes and war in a fashion similar to that of territory."
"16","How do the expectations of the joint contiguity‐territory explanation fare against the historical record? To answer this question, I examine dispute and war observations over the 1919–95 time span taken from the Dyadic Militarized Interstate Dispute data set (DYMID). The DYMID set includes only observations for pairs of states that were actually on opposing sides of an explicit militarized conflict action that took place as part of an interstate dispute.1 Since I am interested in both conflict onset and escalation to war outcomes, two dependent variables are necessary. For the first dependent variable, I code dyads as having a dispute onset when a militarized interstate dispute (MID) begins in a year. The second dependent variable measures whether or not a dispute advances to war. After exclusions for missing data on the explanatory variables, the number of observations becomes 494,613 dyad years for the MID onset analyses, and 1,348 MIDs (from which 96 wars emerge) for the war onset tests.         "
"17","To measure the first key explanatory concept of interest, the Correlates of War Contiguity data are used (Stinnett et al. 2002).2 The contiguity indicator is a dummy variable measuring whether or not two states or their colonies are contiguous by land or within 150 miles or less of water. Two operational indicators are used to capture the second key explanatory concept—territorial disagreement. At the dispute onset stage, I rely on a territorial claim variable derived from Huth and Allee (2002, chapters 1, 2, and appendix A).3 Their set records all territorial claims between recognized states from 1919 to 1995, whether or not they give rise to the threat or use of militarized force. At the war onset phase, I rely on the DYMID set's revisionist character variable as a measure of territorial dispute. This variable specifies the particular aspect of the status quo the revisionist state seeks to change in the militarized dispute, and four categories are employed to capture this: territory, policy, regime, and other. All these attempts must be characterized by the threat, display, or use of militarized force and coding of the substantive content of the revisionist claims is based on objectives stated before the initiation of the MID and not on those that occur within the MID (Jones, Bremer, and Singer 1996, 178). In terms of territorial disputes, this means a claim to territory must be made before the MID; fighting a war by conquering territory or annexing territory as a result of war does not make the MID that gave rise to the war a territorial MID unless explicit claims to territory preceded the MID. Since my purpose here is to differentiate territorial from nonterritorial disputes, policy, regime, and other disputes are grouped into a nonterritorial reference category.         "
"18","By using different measures of territorial disagreement across the two levels of conflict, I more accurately match theoretical concept to empirical indicator. The Huth and Allee measure is ideal for my dispute onset tests, as it marks the presence of standing claims that may last for long periods of time and may or may not lead to militarized disputes. However, it is not well‐suited nor intended for tests such as those embodied in my war onset examination. This is true because militarized disputes over nonterritorial issues can and do occur between states that are classified by Huth and Allee as having outstanding territorial claims. In other words, just because states have competing territorial claims does not mean that all of their MIDs will be over territory. In fact, of the 529 MIDs arising between states with Huth and Allee territorial claims, nonterritorial aims principally drive the revisionist actor fully 39% (208) of the time. Because of this nuance, the MID‐based revision type measure is more appropriate for the war onset tests.         "
"19","While this study is concerned primarily with the effects of contiguity and territory, I also consider several alternative indicators of opportunity and willingness.4 Concerning willingness, the absences of alliance ties and dyadic democracy are plausible substitutes or supplements to the influence of territory. Thus, I include an alliance control, derived from the Correlates of War alliance data, that distinguishes allies from nonallies. My democracy variable measures the difference between the Polity IV democracy and autocracy indices (i.e., democracy minus autocracy) and relies on what has been termed the “weak link principle” by assuming that the norms and expectations most likely to affect conflict are those of the less democratic party to the dispute (Dixon and Senese 2002). With regard to opportunity, the contiguity effect may be attenuated when at least one of a pair of states is able to project its influence across great distances. For this reason, I introduce two variables—a dummy indicator measuring whether the dyad consists of two minor powers and a continuous measure of economic development using logged energy production per capita taken from the Correlates of War capabilities data base. In line with my democracy indicator, I gauge the lesser developed actor within a dyad. And to more fully capture the potentially confounding effect of power, I also include a standard measure of relative capability, operationalized by first recording each party's power using the Correlates of War composite index of national capabilities and then computing the natural log of the ratio of the larger to smaller values for each pair of states. Finally, because there may be temporal dependence among dyads across years in the MID onset tests, I control for this using the cubic spline technique developed by Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998).         "
"20","Since I am interested in explaining conflict behavior at two points of intensity, and the joint explanation makes predictions contingent on conflict phase, I use an appropriate two‐stage estimation procedure for my primary analyses. This censored probit technique estimates and controls for potential sample selection bias, which could otherwise lead to biased coefficient estimates in the war (second stage) equation (Greene 2000, 926–37). As its estimate is always insignificant (p > .05), I only briefly discuss the implications of this selection parameter (ρ). Also, to control for the potential nonindependence of conflict observations that are not the first to be observed for a particular pair, I adjust the calculations of all standard errors for clustering by dyad.         "
"21","Within the analyses, my main focus will be on the variables representing contiguity, territory, and their interaction. In fact, the addition of the multiplicative terms is both a crucial and novel component of the tests below, as it allows me to estimate the particular conditional relationships among contiguity, territory, and conflict rather than the general ones explored in previous work using additive models.5 Specifically, the results detail the contingent effects of territorial claims and revision attempts based on the presence (or absence) of contiguity, and the contingent effects of contiguity based on the presence (or absence) of territorial claims and revision attempts, at both the dispute and war onset points. And to more easily illustrate the substantive nature of these effects, and relate them to the theoretical expectations, my discussion draws on a set of predicted probabilities that are derived from the relevant statistical models.         "
"22","Before viewing the censored probit results, I begin with a brief look at the distribution of cases across the MID and war onset dependent variables. Table 1a shows the percentage of dyad years that experience the onset of a MID, based on the presence or absence of contiguity and territorial claims. As expected, dyad years characterized by territorial claims are associated with a higher percentage of MIDs compared to those absent such claims; and this is true for both contiguous (4.45–16.6%) and noncontiguous (0.15–6.59%) pairs. Similarly, contiguity is associated with a higher percentage of MIDs than is noncontiguity, among dyad years both with (6.59–16.6%) and without (0.15–4.45%) territorial claims. These positive impacts for territory and contiguity are nicely in line with Hypothesis 1. Also supportive of the joint explanation are the observed rankings for the least and most dispute prone dyads—the percentage of years with a MID onset is lowest for noncontiguous dyads absent territorial claims (0.15) and highest for contiguous dyads with territorial claims (16.6). The only element in Table 1a not supportive of Hypothesis 1 is the observation that noncontiguous dyads with territorial claims experience MID onset a higher percentage of the time (6.59) than do contiguous pairs absent such claims (4.45), a point which I return to shortly.         "
"23"," Table 1b shows the percentage of MIDs that escalate to war, based on the presence or absence of contiguity and territorial revisionist aims. Like the MID onset percentages shown in Table 1a, the war onset percentages reveal a clear association between territory and conflict—territorial MIDs are linked to a higher percentage of wars than are nonterritorial MIDs, among both contiguous (2.36–11.33%) and noncontiguous (3.75 to 33.33%) disputants. Unlike Table 1a, however, is the observation in Table 1b that contiguous disputants are actually less likely to escalate their disputes to war compared to noncontiguous foes; contiguity imparts a sharp decrease in the percentage of wars among territorial disputants (33.33–11.33) and a modest lessening for nonterritorial foes (3.75–2.36). The implications of this finding are quite important and are discussed in more detail below.         "
"24","Turning to the multivariate censored probit estimations, I start by considering the individual impacts of territory and contiguity on conflict, absent multiplicative terms, as shown in the first column of Table 2. Viewing these base model results first, one sees that both territorial claims and geographic contiguity impart significant positive effects on the likelihood of MID onset. This indicates that state pairs with competing territorial claims are more likely to engage in MIDs, as are geographically contiguous pairs, evidence consistent with Hypothesis 1. At the war onset phase, however, we see a different effect for contiguity, but not territory. For example, while territorial MIDs are more apt to escalate to war than nonterritorial disputes, contiguous foes are actually less, not more, likely to push their MIDs to the point of war compared to noncontiguous adversaries. Although the joint explanation does predict a smaller influence for contiguity on war onset, this reversed effect is not supportive of Hypothesis 2. Interestingly, these findings for contiguity suggest that one reason why contiguous states are involved in many wars is simply because they are involved in many disputes, not because their disputes are more likely to escalate to war compared to those between noncontiguous states.         "
"25","To tap into a key question raised by the joint explanation though—whether the direction and/or magnitude of the contiguity influence differ depending on the presence (or absence) of territory, and vice versa—it is necessary to add multiplicative terms between contiguity and territory to both stages of the statistical model.6 In this interactive specification (shown in the second column of Table 2), we once again see significant positive estimates for the influences of both territorial claims and contiguity on MID onset. The inclusion of the Contiguity × Territorial claim interaction makes the interpretation of these two parameter estimates a bit less straightforward, though, as they are conditioned on the value of the other variable equaling zero. And since such renderings are much clearer when presented in the form of predicted probabilities, I will save a full interpretation of the MID onset findings until later. For now, it is sufficient to note that the estimates for our three key variables are all statistically significant at this first stage, and that the significance of the multiplicative term suggests some type of contingency between the contiguity and territorial claim impacts.7"
"26","At the war onset phase, both the territorial MID and Contiguity × Territorial MID estimates are statistically significant, while the contiguity estimate is not. Comparing these findings from the model with interactions to those shown for the base specification, we begin to see the explanatory benefits of including the interaction term. For while the base model results suggest a general negative influence for contiguity on the escalation of disputes to war, the interaction model suggests that an accurate interpretation of the contiguity impact is more particular; specifically, it is contingent on a consideration of the particular type of alteration (territorial or nonterritorial) sought by the revisionist actor in a MID."
"27","Before moving to the predicted probabilities, a few words about the control estimates are in order. Recall that I include power status and development variables at the MID onset stage as alternative opportunity factors and alliance and democracy variables at the war onset phase as auxiliary willingness indicators.8 Briefly, these control estimates reveal a number of things. First, dyads consisting of two minor powers are significantly less likely to engage in disputes compared to dyads consisting of at least one major state. Second, increasing levels of economic development lead to higher chances of MID onset. Third, the negative and significant Peace years estimates indicate the reinforcing nature of peace—as the number of years since the previous dyadic dispute increases, the probability of another MID onset decreases. Fourth, alliances impart no significant impact on the probability of MIDs escalating to war. Fifth, increasing levels of dyadic democracy lead to lower chances of war onset among disputants, although this result is only marginally significant (p = .077). Sixth, increasing levels of disparity in relative capability do reduce the chances of MID onset, but have no significant impact on MID escalation to war. And finally, the estimates for ρ are insignificant, indicating no meaningful correlation of error terms across the MID and war onset stages.         "
"28","While the findings shown in Table 2 indicate the direction and significance of the explanatory variable effects, predicted probabilities illuminate more clearly their substantive impacts. The first column in Table 3 compares the likelihood of a pair engaging in a MID, depending on whether or not the dyad was characterized by contiguity and/or a territorial claim, while the second column compares the probability of a MID escalating to war, based on whether the disputants were contiguous and/or fought over territorial revisionist goals. Viewing the dispute onset estimates first, we see a clear ordering among the four dyad types that is strongly supportive of Hypothesis 1. Noncontiguous dyads absent territorial claims are by far the least likely (.001) to engage in a MID, while contiguous pairs with competing territorial claims are by far the most likely (.038) to experience a dispute onset. The mixed dyad types fall somewhere in between—noncontiguous pairs with territorial claims show a .011 probability for MID onset in a given year and contiguous pairs without competing claims experience MID onset with a probability of .018.9 This ranking is nicely in line with two key bases of the joint explanation at the dispute onset stage—first, both contiguity and territory will increase MID onset chances and, second, the contiguity effect will be stronger than that of territory.         "
"29","Moving to the War onset estimates, we see only partial support for Hypothesis 2. The hypothesis does correctly predict that territorial MIDs will encompass the two most war‐prone categories and, conversely, that nonterritorial MIDs will make up the two least war‐prone groupings. However, its predictions within each of these two classes are not supported, mostly due to the unexpected impact of contiguity. Contiguity imparts no significant effect among nonterritorial disputes and, even more surprisingly, it actually acts as a pacifying condition among territorial MIDs (contiguous pairs are three times (.094 versus .282) less likely to escalate their territorial disputes to war than are noncontiguous foes). So, while this probability ranking for war onset does support the joint explanation's prediction that the territory effect will be stronger than that of contiguity, it does not support the explanation's notion that contiguity will have some positive impact on the likelihood of MIDs escalating to war.         "
"30","Beyond showing clear support for the MID onset expectations (Hypothesis 1) of the new joint explanation, and only partial support for its war onset predictions (Hypothesis 2), the predicted probabilities in Table 3 also reveal several related and interesting findings. For one, at the MID onset phase we see a meaningful contiguity influence among both dyads with and without territorial claims—contiguity raises the likelihood of MID onset from .011 to .038 among those with territorial claims and from .001 to .018 among those without. This is strong evidence supporting the joint explanation's idea that contiguous states enjoy more interaction opportunity, especially at the earlier MID onset stage, as the contiguity effect is present regardless of whether the bone of contention is territorial or not.         "
"31","The joint explanation's posited willingness enhancing role for territory is also clearly evident—territorial claims increase MID onset among both contiguous and noncontiguous dyads, while territorial MIDs are more likely to go to war for both contiguous and noncontiguous disputants. Particularly intriguing here are the war onset findings. When territory is not in disagreement, MIDs are unlikely to escalate to war. When territory is in disagreement, war is more likely, but it is most likely when borders are not contiguous. While an explanation for this result is not immediately obvious, one possibility is that territorial MIDs between noncontiguous states must be about very substantial disagreements (like, hypothetically, Iranian demands for revision of Jerusalem's territorial status quo). In such a situation it would be impossible for the two states to split the territory between them and thus avoid war via a prewar bargain, because there literally is no territory between them to split.10 This suggests that the 141 territorial MIDs between noncontiguous states are substantively different from the average of the 450 territorial MIDs between contiguous states.11 Closer examination of such potential explanations is surely a ripe area for future research.         "
"32","Taken together, the findings for the effects of contiguity and territory on the onset of disputes and wars provide strong support for the joint account's expectations at the dispute onset stage, and partial support at the war onset phase. In line with one of the explanation's key notions, territory always imparts a conflict‐enhancing influence, with territorial claims raising the likelihood of MID onset and territorial MIDs raising the likelihood of war. Thus, the conflict‐heightening effect of territory is not contingent on a particular phase of conflict. The same cannot be said for the contiguity impact, however, as contiguity tends to promote the onset of disputes while actually lowering the probability of their escalation to war. In this fashion, the influence of contiguity is not consistent across the two thresholds of conflict. Instead, a proper description of its effect is plainly contingent on the particular phase of conflict being examined."
"33","I began this investigation by developing a new theoretical account that simultaneously considered the roles of both contiguity and territory in pushing state pairs into disputes and wars. This joint contiguity‐territorial explanation goes beyond prior work in two essential ways. First, it explicitly regards both contiguity and territory as important precipitators of conflict. And second, it predicts that the effects of contiguity and territory will be disproportionate across varied phases of conflict. After deriving hypotheses for the joint account at both the dispute and war onset points, I proceeded to an empirical evaluation spanning the years from 1919 to 1995.         "
"34","The empirical analysis sheds significant new light on the exact nature of the territory and contiguity impacts, while controlling for a host of alternative explanatory factors. For instance, while the direction of the territory influence is consistently positive, its magnitude is markedly greater among noncontiguous pairs than among contiguous ones. And this finding, that territory imparts a stronger effect among noncontiguous dyads, holds at both the dispute and war onset points. With regard to the impact of contiguity, I find even more pronounced evidence of contingency. The presence of contiguity consistently increases the likelihood of dispute onset, with this effect gaining strength in the absence of territorial claims. This contingency of magnitude at the dispute onset phase is quite minor, however, when compared to the contingency of direction shown at the level of war onset. By itself, contiguity exhibits little influence on the escalation of nonterritorial disputes to war, while imparting a strong negative impact on the likelihood of war among territorial MIDs. Taken together, these findings perfectly support the joint explanation's predictions for dispute onset, while partially supporting its expectations for the onset of war. And further, the joint account's dual consideration of contiguity and territory enables it to more accurately explain the results compared to theoretical explanations based on contiguity or territory alone, but not in tandem.         "
"35","The particular discovery of the contingent relationship between contiguity and war onset helps to explain a couple of significant puzzles. First, it clarifies Lemke and Reed's (2001) finding that contiguous great power rivals are less likely to experience war than noncontiguous great power rivals. Perhaps their finding for contiguity could be further elaborated by a joint consideration of the overriding issues of contention among rival states. Second, these results for contiguity on war onset highlight the importance of resolve (Morrow 1989) in pushing states from dispute to war. For instance, my analyses clearly show that while noncontiguous actors rarely fight, on those rare occasions when they do, their fights are the ones that tend to escalate to war (especially when vying over territory). This suggests that the costs of engaging with a distant foe in a militarized dispute are quite high—so high, in fact, that most states decide not to do so. However, when those high startup costs are overcome, noncontiguous disputants clearly signal their commitment to pursue their goals through increasingly intense rounds of escalation. This evidence of resolve among noncontiguous disputants may also help to reinforce the reluctance of such potential foes from entering conflict in the first place. For if a state has good reason to believe that its potential opponent will not back down, as signaled by a distant and willing‐to‐fight enemy, it will choose not to enter the fray itself unless equally resolute in its intentions.         "
"36","Finally, several additional points are worth noting. First, the examination here indicates that my use of an opportunity and willingness framework (Starr 1978) has proven rather fruitful. Specifically, geographic contiguity, and territory in particular, appear to be viable indicators of interaction opportunity and willingness, respectively. Second, territory appears to be a more important precipitator of conflict than is contiguity, especially in terms of war onset. This finding answers Vasquez's (2001) call for a crucial test to decipher the relative importance of territory and contiguity in pushing states toward or away from international conflict. And third, this analysis suggests that future research should carefully weigh the contingent nature of various causal processes.12 This may prove to be especially true for the conditional impact of geographic contiguity. In this way, we can move forward by explicitly incorporating the possibility of contingent linkages among explanatory factors into our theoretical and statistical modeling choices.         "
