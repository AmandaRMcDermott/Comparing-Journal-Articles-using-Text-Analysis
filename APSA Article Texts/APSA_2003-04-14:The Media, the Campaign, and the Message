"1","The collapse of the primary season has made the invisible primary1 an increasingly critical period for campaigns. It is during this portion of the process that campaigns struggle to position themselves for the coming primary season (Buell 1996; Hadley 1976). At the heart of this struggle is the need to build name recognition, raise poll numbers, and build a war chest. Because most candidates have little money to spend on paid advertising, free and positive coverage of the campaign's stump message by the news media becomes the primary means to accomplish these goals.1 Thus campaigns focus their efforts on attracting media attention by staging media events or issuing press statements.            "
"2","From the vantage point of journalists, however, election news during the invisible primary is neither timely nor immediately relevant. Any news coverage of the race during the early, invisible portion of the process tends to be justified by emphasizing the new, the dramatic, and the conflict‐oriented. Consequently, the focus of the media's early coverage becomes changes to the field, attacks, scandal, and, of course, the horse race (Brady and Johnston 1987; Sigelman and Bullock 1991). If campaigns cede to news organizations, if they structure their messages to incorporate news norms or to conform to news routines, are they more likely to succeed in using the media as a conduit to transmit their message to the voting public? Does this tactic work for all campaigns? To answer these questions we need to know more about both the nature of campaign messaging and the norms and routines that structure the attention of the news media.            "
"3","Scholarly research recognizes two dominant message strategies for the conduct of presidential campaigns: messages designed to wage war (competitive) and messages intended to market or sell the candidate (substantive) (Scammell 1998; Bowler and Farrell 1992; Collins and Butler 1996; Haynes, Flowers, and Gurian 2002). We add a third category to this dichotomy—information dissemination. In contrast to competitive and substantive messaging, informative messages play a supportive albeit vital role in message communication. Each of these strategies requires some elaboration.            "
"4","Competitive positioning is derived from a philosophy of campaign as war. Campaigns are waged in terms of relative gains competing for a fixed rather than an expanding market. The goal is to improve one's position within the field while simultaneously harming the standing of the competition. Although competitive positioning strategies can take several forms, the most prominent is an attempt to spin one's campaign as either the frontrunner or the challenger to the frontrunner and to present all others as “also‐rans.” If the media adopt this frame for the candidate's campaign the candidate gains credibility for his or her claims. Competitive framing may also reflect efforts to confine the race by staking an ideological claim or establishing an entry fee. The goals of a competitive strategy are to both limit the field of competitors and to define the competitive structure of the race.            "
"5","Prior research indicates that campaigns recognize two distinct competitive strategies (Haynes, Flowers, and Gurian 2002). Positive competitive messages attempt to define the horse race or tout prestigious political endorsements. In general, this strategy attempts to frame the candidate as the leader or as endowed with momentum. Negative competitive messages, by contrast, issue an attack either on an intraparty opponent or on the interparty incumbent. This messaging tactic attempts to upset the existing ranking and shift the balance of the race by slowing the momentum of the lead candidate(s).            "
"6","In contrast to competitive positioning, substantive positioning is rooted in commercial marketing theory and views the campaign in terms of absolute rather than relative gains. Targeting key populations and mobilizing untapped voters is often viewed by campaigns as the key to winning the nomination and eventually the election (Holbrook 1996). Substantive messages are thus designed to capture targeted voting “markets” by presenting the candidate in a manner that appeals to specific groups, e.g., “soccer moms.” Substantive strategies may take the form of announcing a policy position, responding to a particular event within the framework of a policy orientation, or even embracing a group endorsement. Endorsements by individuals or groups prominently affiliated with an issue or a targeted audience acts as an imprimatur for the targeted group, providing a stamp of approval to members of that group. If successful, a substantive positioning strategy will generate support among the targeted population.            "
"7","Information dissemination is a form of messaging that is not discussed extensively in the theoretical literature but is, nevertheless, essential to campaign strategy (Haynes, Flowers, and Gurian 2002). These logistical messages, which detail the candidate's schedule and provide access to the candidate and his staff, are generally designed to bring the media and the voters to the candidate in an environment the candidate controls, e.g., a press conference. Such basic campaign information is critical to the success of any candidate's overall messaging strategy.            "
"8","Knowing how campaigns structure their message is only half of the story. How the media react to various messaging strategies must also be examined. We need to know which types of messages from which types of candidates are relayed to the public and which messages are not. Unfortunately, there has been little research as to how media coverage affects campaigns and candidate behavior (Arterton 1984; Semetko et al. 2000). The literature, while limited on these specific questions, does provide some guidance for the development of a set of testable hypotheses. In the following section, we focus on specific news norms and routines that are theoretically linked to successful message placement.            "
"9","The magnitude, direction, and nature of candidate news coverage are governed by media norms and routines (Gans 1979; Tuchman 1973; Graber 1997; Arterton 1984; Ansolabehere, Behr, and Iyengar 1993). In general, news norms define the scope of values used to determine if information is “worthy” of news space. By contrast news routines provide procedural shortcuts that both reinforce news norms and enable the media to make timely decisions concerning whether information is newsworthy. Campaigns can manipulate news routines and appeal to news norms in an attempt to enhance their ability to transmit messages to the public via the press by dressing the information they provide to the media in dramatic or timely trappings designed to entice journalists (Kalbfeld 2001). To determine if these strategies are successful, we focus our analysis of news coverage around three pillars of “newsworthiness”: who said it, how did they say it, and when did they say it?            "
"10","Newsworthiness is partially a factor of who is saying what. The “who” must have national recognition or specific expertise on some level in order for the message to be broadcast by the news media. Within the context of presidential campaigns “who” is newsworthy generally falls into two categories: those who are winning and those who hold a newsworthy position (Mayer 1999). The dominant frame of the horse race demands that the media establish a ranking among the contenders that will allow them (the media) to monitor the progress of the race (Aldrich 1980; Matthews 1978). Handicapping the contenders enables the media to justifiably narrow their coverage to only the most viable candidates.            "
"11","Frontrunners, because they are dubbed serious contenders by the media, become newsworthy. It is this same “newsworthy” standard however that determines how organizational resources are distributed. The combination of news resources distributed and news attention determined based on candidate ranking bolsters scholarly claims that the media are more receptive to the messages of frontrunners than to the messages of lower tier candidates (Semetko et al. 2000), particularly in state level news organizations (Rosenstiel 1994). Unfortunately, this has not been tested. While there is ample evidence to show that frontrunners dominate the coverage generated about the campaign (Hagen 1996; Haynes and Murray 1998), we do not know how much of this coverage emanates from the frontrunner's own campaign message strategy. There is some reason to question candidate influence given the tremendous amount of negative coverage that surrounds frontrunners (Haynes and Rhine 1998). Hence the first hypothesis we test purports that frontrunners are more successful in transmitting messages via the media to the public than are lower tier candidates.            "
"12","Frontrunners, however, are not the only newsworthy contenders in the race. Within the field of competitors there are also candidates who may or may not be the frontrunners, but who are nationally well known for other reasons (e.g., they hold a prestigious office). We expect to find that candidates who possess an established national image benefit, regardless of their ranking, and find the news media receptive to their campaign messages (Arterton 1984; Shea 1996).            "
"13","An alternative view of “who is saying it” considers industry routines and asks instead “who is covering it?” Which other media organizations are transmitting, the campaign's message may be as important as who actually said it. Wire services, for example, play an integral role in determining what constitutes news. Beyond providing national and state1 media organizations with both complete, ready‐to‐print news stories and reliable resources to fill holes in stories, wires guide editorial decisions by signaling the “newsworthiness” of a story (Ansolabehere et al. 1993). In fact, “[a] huge share of the news stories appearing in nearly every newspaper in the country and featured on television and radio news originates from the wires of the Associated Press” (Graber 1997, 44). In sifting through the day's possible stories, news routines push all editors to turn to the wires and to other industry leaders to provide external validation of a story's “newsworthiness” (Graber 1997; Pfau and Parrot 1993; Gans 1979). In general, therefore, we expect to find a positive correlation between the press release stories redistributed by the Associated Press (AP) and those carried by national and state news organizations.            "
"14","To recapitulate we expect news routines and norms to force journalists to consider “who” is sending a message when making decisions about whether or not to transmit a message to the broader public. Thus we expect to find that during the invisible primary:"
"15","                              "
"16","Frontrunners will be more successful in having messages from their press releases picked up by journalists and used in news stories."
"17","Candidates with established national images will be more successful in having messages from their press releases picked up by journalists and used in news stories."
"18","Messages that are picked up by the AP are more likely to be used in news stories published in national and state press organizations than are messages that are not picked up by the AP."
"19","The structure of a candidate's message should also influence the nature of message transmission. Outside of the dominant “horse race” norm of campaign coverage (Sigelman and Bullock 1991), journalists also seek the controversial and dramatic in weeding through potential stories (Arterton 1984). A policy position that is disclosed in the context of a press release attacking an opponent's policy plank provides the conflict necessary to hook the media as well as the substance necessary to inform voters. The predominance of competitive messages across campaigns signals the recognition of this norm by campaign organizations (Haynes, Flowers, and Gurian 2002; Selnow 2000). A headline such as “Alexander Stuns Gramm” on a press release is designed to provide journalists with a dramatic or conflict‐oriented angle for a routine story. The campaign's reward is a prominent quote or extensive exposure within a story. Consequently we expect to find that candidates will have more success transmitting competitive messages to the public via the press than any other form of strategic messaging.            "
"20","The provision of a good or useful quote can also act as an independent factor in more substantive or non‐campaign stories (Pfau and Parrott 1993; Shea 1996). For news organizations, a candidate quote provides a valuable vehicle that enables journalists to assign attitudes and opinions to particular individuals thus leaving the media free of bias. Additionally, quotes can add balance to a story or a colorful or humorous anchor to hold the interest of readers. Thus the inclusion of an attributable quote in a press release is expected to enhance the ability of a campaign to transmit its message via the press.            "
"21","Finally, the length of the press release itself and the targeted audience may also affect the probability of successful placement. In general, information that is packaged in small compact messages (the print equivalent of sound bites) provide journalist with relevant information that is easily plugged into a story. Consequently, we expect to find that reporters are more receptive to shorter rather than longer messages. The targeted audience of the press release may also be an important factor. Journalists and researchers alike suggest that the more the press release is tailored to a state or region, the more likely it is that material from the press release will be transmitted in that state or region (Yepsen 2001; Shea 1996). Local journalists, covering a national election, who can “peg” the story with a local angle will do so. When campaigns provide the angle, it is more likely that journalists will respond to the press release positively.1"
"22","In sum, we expect that how a message is delivered to the press is as important as who said it. We expect to find:"
"23","                              "
"24","Competitive messages will be picked up by journalists and used in news stories more often than substantive messages or messages that focus on information dissemination."
"25","Press releases containing quotes are more likely to be picked up by journalists and used in news stories than press releases containing no quotes."
"26","Shorter messages are more likely to be picked up by journalists and used in news stories than are longer messages."
"27","Messages that are geographically focused will be more likely to be picked up by local journalists and used in news stories than are messages utilizing a national focus."
"28","The timing of the message dissemination fleshes out our model of newsworthiness. During the invisible primary the challenge of influencing the media's framing of the candidate and the campaign is secondary to getting the media to simply pay attention. On any given day the campaign has to compete with newsworthy, noncampaign events within the greater social environment. Candidates must therefore become news to gain media coverage. One tactic candidates use to become news is to offer commentary on contemporary newsworthy events. “Piggybacking” a campaign message on the heels of an event, whether political or not, takes advantage of inertia within the media. Dominant news stories, such as the crisis in Bosnia, may fill the papers and airwaves for three or four days or more before peaking and fading. When candidates comment on these events, they provide journalists with easy, accessible material that can be used to fill space in stories (Shea 1996). Journalists scrambling to find a new or unique angle within a short period may be more open to a message that relates to the major news story or event than one that does not. Thus, we expect to find that messages disseminated in the time period surrounding major news events will be more likely to be picked up and used by journalists than messages disseminated during other periods.            "
"29","Finally, the dynamics of both the campaign and the media's coverage of the campaign change as the first official primaries draw near. As the campaign enters the official primary stage it becomes timely “news” and media organizations are more likely to utilize the resources at their disposal to cover the campaign directly rather than rely on campaign organizations for information. It is also at this stage of the campaign that paid media becomes a viable alternative through which campaigns can reach voters directly. Thus as the media becomes more interested in the campaign, the candidates' organizations spend less energy trying to directly influence the media and more energy attempting to directly influence voters (Patterson 1980). We, therefore, suggest that those candidates still attempting to rely on press releases to reach the media during the later stages of the invisible primary are more likely to fail. Our final set of hypotheses purport:            "
"30","                              "
"31","Messages issued in the time period surrounding an event—political or nonpolitical—are more likely to be picked up by journalists and used in news stories than messages issued when there are no events."
"32","Candidate messages contained in press releases will be less likely to be picked up by journalists and used in news stories the closer the campaign gets to the start of the official primary season."
"33","The preceding hypotheses, when taken together, comprise a general model of media‐constrained candidate‐messaging strategy. News norms and routines dictate what is considered newsworthy and how it will be covered. In general, news organizations are influenced by factors relating to who is speaking, how they are presenting their message, and when they are attempting to communicate their message in judging what is news and what is not. When news norms and routines interact with the campaign process during the invisible primary the result, if our hypotheses are correct, is a campaign media environment that is friendly to competitive messages, particularly when they emanate from the campaigns of frontrunners, and hostile to substantive messages that provide voters with detailed information on the candidates' positions on the issues. Third‐tier candidates, or even challengers, attempting to discuss their position on the issues or to define the agenda of the campaign face an uphill challenge in their competition for news space."
"34","We draw the data for this study from two primary sources; one related to campaigns, the other to newspapers. Our base unit of analysis is 277 press releases issued during the invisible primary by the five major Republican candidates vying for the 1996 presidential nomination. Our data cover the time period from September 22, 1995 through January 17, 1996.1 We focus on the invisible primary for two reasons: the first arising from the nature of the campaigns and the second premised on the nature of news coverage.            "
"35","As noted earlier, the invisible primary represents a stage of the campaign when candidates attempt to gain a favorable position for the start of the primary season. Both fiscal and legal constraints limit most candidates' ability to use paid media thus increasing the importance of and the campaigns' emphasis on free media coverage. However, a focus on the invisible primary is also important from the media's perspective. Research in areas outside of campaigns has confirmed that the news media are more likely to adopt frames presented to them when there is little other information available to them (Terkildsen, Schnell, and Ling 1998). For candidates these early frameworks are especially important because much of what occurs in the later stages of the campaign is a function of events and strategies established during earlier stages of the campaign (Buell 1996; Aldrich 1980; Matthews 1978; Hadley 1976).            "
"36","Campaign press releases provide us with the data necessary to measure how candidates structure their message. Press releases serve as the frontline in the battle for media coverage. “[They] provide the campaign with an easy, rapid means of soliciting press coverage [and are] by far the most commonly used technique” for doing so (Shea 1996). To determine how successful campaigns are in convincing the press that their candidate is news, we need to examine the media's coverage of the campaign. To accomplish this task, we constructed a database of news stories generated in the print media by these press releases. Utilizing keywords from each press release we conducted a full text search of the news section of three Lexis‐Nexis databases—wires, general news, and U.S. news. An extensive keyword search for each press release was completed for the issue date of the press release and the following three days.1"
"37","We chose to limit our analysis to print media stories. Broadcast journalists—at least those representing the major networks—have a more stringent timeframe within which they can cover “news.” If an election is four months, six months, or a year away, it is difficult for the election to compete with more current or more sensational stories.1 Print media on the other hand have greater flexibility in their “news space” and research indicates that, in general, the print media dedicate more space to covering the early stages of the campaign (Just et al. 1996).            "
"38","The Lexis‐Nexis search results indicate that of the 277 press releases examined, 13% generated stories in the national press and 33% generated news articles in the state press.1 In general, the fact that less than one‐third of the campaign's efforts resulted in media coverage supports the notion that campaign organizations face an uphill battle in getting the attention of journalists during the invisible primary. While local news organizations appear to be more receptive than are national news organizations the numbers are a bit deceiving. Only a handful of state and local newspapers provided any coverage of the campaign during the time period under consideration. In fact, news organizations operating in states with early primaries, notably New Hampshire and Iowa provided a good percentage of local coverage.1 Thus although campaigns were more successful in using local media to communicate their message to the public, only a very limited public received the message.1"
"39","Our dependent variable measures whether the campaign was successful in having its message picked up and used by the news media; it is a simple dummy variable that indicates whether the press release “hit.” To create our dummy variable the content of each newspaper article was carefully analyzed and coded on a variety of indicators. For the news story to be coded a hit, the following criteria must be present: the theme of the press release must be represented in the story and the presentation of candidate information must, in general, be in the same tone as it is presented in the press release.1 The dependent variable does not measure the degree of meshing, but simply indicates that there is a clear similarity between the content of the news article and the press release.1 If a clear similarity exists, the press release was coded as a “hit.”            "
"40","We expect state press organizations to behave differently than national press organizations (Just et al. 1996). National newspapers have larger staffs and greater flexibility in their “news space” than do smaller state or regional newspapers. It is possible therefore, that local press organizations may rely more on information disseminated by the campaigns and national wire services than would national press organizations. Alternatively, we expect national newspapers to have the resources to follow up on campaign information and provide a broader treatment of any subject matter contained in a campaign press release. Thus we analyze state and national news organizations separately.1 To facilitate separate analysis we constructed separate dummy variables indicating whether the press release “hit” in the national press and whether the press release “hit” in the state press.            "
"41","To create our independent variables each press release was coded on a variety of indicators and composite scores were created to measure four message strategies: positive competitive positioning, negative competitive positioning, substantive positioning, and information dissemination. To create our composite scores we categorized the content of the press release into five broad categories: issues (subdivided into issue‐mention and issue‐detail), candidate history/background, campaign announcements (subdivided into group endorsement, political endorsements, candidate schedule, and staffing), attacks, and the horse race."
"42","A series of dummy variables—one each for informative, substantive, positive competitive and negative competitive messages—were then created for each press release based on the presence or absence of specific categories or subcategories. The negative competitive dummy variable reflects the presence of language attacking an opponent (this attack could be about issue positions or about campaign tactics). Positive competitive positioning, on the other hand, indicates a discussion of the horse race and/or politically prestigious endorsements. Both competitive strategies paint a picture of the initiator relative to either a single opponent or the entire field. Rather than focus on the opposition, substantive messaging focuses primarily on selling a package comprised of the candidate and his or her message. Scores defining substantive positioning, therefore, reflect either a detailed discussion of issue positions, a group endorsement of the candidate, or a discussion of the candidate's history or background. The information index simply captures press releases that reveal campaign logistics such as a candidate's schedule, the location of campaign offices, or the identity of campaign staff.1 We included dummy variables for negative competitive, positive competitive and substantive messaging in our model leaving information dissemination as our baseline category. (See Table 1.)            "
"43","To determine the competitive ranking of the candidates we relied on both the results of public opinion surveys reported in the Gallup Poll Monthly1 and the amount of money raised by the campaign reflected in their Federal Election Committee disclosures.1 There were six polls and two FEC disclosures during the period under consideration. We use this data to calculate an objective measure of a candidate's standing in the field. Specifically, we calculated the percentage of both the top funds and the top poll numbers held by each of the candidates on any given day. We then combined these daily scores and used the average daily score as the candidate's ranking. To simplify our models we then constructed dummy variables for each of our three conceptual candidate rankings—frontrunner, challenger, and third tier.1 We included dummy variables for frontrunners and challengers in our model leaving third tier candidates as our baseline category.            "
"44","A dummy variable was created to measure whether or not an event was proximate to the time period in which a press release was issued. To construct our list of events we searched the online archives of Time and Newsweek. The event dummy was coded one for the date of the political (national and international) or campaign event and each of the three days preceding and immediately following the event. Political crises—events whose occurrence could not be anticipated—were simply coded positive for the day of the event and the three days following the event. For example, the Million Man March occurred on October 16, 1995. This was a planned event so every day from October 13 through October 19 was coded positively in our event dummy variable. The O.J. Simpson verdict on the other hand was an unplanned event, so we only coded positive for the day the verdict was announced and the three days after the decision was announced.            "
"45","Finally, we take into consideration the background of each candidate, the targeted audience and whether or not the message was picked up and carried by the wire services. As discussed earlier, the literature suggests that incumbents, candidates who have achieved national stature, and or those who have substantial elective or campaign experience have a better chance of influencing the campaign agenda than lesser‐known challengers. The 1996 field of Republican presidential nominees included no incumbents, but did have two sitting Senators and two candidates who had made prior runs for President. These candidates may have had an advantage in getting press coverage and so we included a dummy variable to indicate the candidate's past and present experience. Dole, Buchanan, and Gramm are each coded as having an established national image in the media based on prior campaigns or prior public roles. Neither Alexander nor Forbes had an established national image at the time of this campaign."
"46","A second consideration lies in the intended audience of the press release. Candidate messages are often designed for specific audiences. Some are broadly structured for national consumption and others specifically targeted at local groups. To test for the effect of geographic targeting we constructed a dummy variable indicating whether the message contained in the press release was locally focused (1) or nationally focused (0).1"
"47","Finally, news routines suggest that wire coverage provides a signal to other media organizations that the story is “newsworthy” thereby enhancing the chances that other news organizations will repeat the story. To test for this effect we created a dummy variable that indicates whether or not the press release was carried by the AP wire service the day before or the day the news story appeared in the newspaper."
"48","The data indicate that candidates consistently use the press release vehicle in their attempt to reach the media and the public before the official start of the primary season. A press release was sent out by at least one of the candidates on 75% of the days under consideration (September 22, 1995 to January 17, 1996). Two or more candidates issued a press release on 59 of these days and on 34 of these days campaigns disseminated five or more press releases."
"49","The data also show that candidates use the press release vehicle to engage in competitive (positive and negative), substantive, and informative message dissemination. Table 2 presents the distribution of press releases among these categories by each type of campaign. Additionally, it should be noted that 39% of the press releases are targeted at local audiences. The balance addresses a national audience. This suggests that although candidates view press releases as a messaging vehicle for a variety of audiences, during the invisible primary, the candidates' focus is on influencing the national media.         "
"50","Furthermore, our data show that both the national media and the state press do, in fact, pay attention to a variety of messages generated by the campaigns. Table 3 indicates that proportionally the national media transmits more informative messages than any other type of campaign message. This should favor frontrunners, who, as indicated above, tend to disseminate a proportionately higher number of informative messages. The national media do not, however, appear to be receptive to substantive messages. Only 8% of messages picked up and used by the national press were of a substantive nature. By contrast, 33% of campaign messages appearing in the local media were generated by substantive press releases.         "
"51","Our hypotheses suggest that successful message transmission is related to “who” is sending the message, “how” they structure their message, and “when” they disseminate their message. To test our hypotheses we used a logit regression. The results reported in Table 4 below provide some interesting points for discussion.            "
"52","The results presented in Table 4 suggest that news organizations behave differently. There is a clear distinction between how the national press approaches campaign messages and how the state press approach campaign messages. A comparison of coefficients across columns highlights the differences. For example, messages that are targeted toward a specific geographic region are significantly less likely to be picked up and used by national newspapers but are more likely to be used by local newspapers. A similar pattern is found throughout the table. Quotes report a positive and significant effect on message transmission in the state press but a negative, though not significant, effect at the national level. The time remaining to the start of the official primary season reports a significant positive effect at the local level and a negative, though not significant effect at the national level. The national press is significantly more receptive to shorter press releases disseminated late in the process. By contrast, the local press is more open to longer press releases disseminated early in the process. We will discuss each of these factors further below, but when taken together the results suggest that news norms are, in fact, constrained by the nature of the media organization to some degree (Graber 1997).            "
"53","To facilitate further discussion of the results probability tables have been constructed that highlight some of the more intriguing findings. The probabilities in Table 5 were calculated for a model press release that was 20 lines long, geographically focused, and issued 120 days from the start of the official primary season. The probabilities are reported for each type of campaign and for each type of message.            "
"54","A perusal of Table 5 illustrates that news routines strongly influence the ability of campaigns to have their messages picked up and used by both the national and the state press. Who is speaking does affect the ability of campaigns to place messages. It is clear, for example, that “who else is paying attention” does matter in validating the newsworthiness of a story. The coefficients for our AP variable indicate that the probability of either the national press or the state press transmitting a campaign's message increases both significantly and substantially if the AP carried the story. As illustrated in Table 5, state newspapers are between 11% and 12% more likely to transmit a message picked up and used by the AP than one that is not. The national press shows a similar, albeit less dramatic, increase in the probability of a campaign having its message “hit” if the AP carried the message. The more substantial effect indicated by our state model is probably due to the fact that local media organizations do not have adequate resources to provide direct coverage of the campaign at this stage of the campaign. Thus these newspapers rely on the AP for their stories. A perusal of our data reveals that the AP or AP staff authored 10% of the stories appearing in the state press. By comparison less than 3% of the national press stories in our database carry an AP byline.            "
"55","The coefficients, reported in Table 4, also support our hypotheses that frontrunners are better able to place their messages in the press for broadcast to the voting public—at least in the national press. Table 5 shows that a press release issued by a frontrunner has between a 6% and 9% higher probability of being used by national journalists than a similar press release issued by a third‐tier candidate. State news organizations, on the other hand, apparently do not respond to who is speaking in the same fashion when evaluating the newsworthiness of a message during the invisible primary. In fact, the model reports a marginally significant negative effect on message transmission if the message emanated from a leading candidate. This effect could stem from the fact that the campaigns of frontrunners focus on the national media and the broader exposure they provide. By contrast, challengers and third‐tier candidates who lack access to the national press may focus their energy on generating coverage in state and local presses in order to create momentum. Jimmy Carter successfully utilized this strategy during his 1976 campaign.            "
"56","Alternatively, this effect could be the product of state and local media organizations. Relatively few states provide any coverage of the campaign as early as the invisible primary. Our data indicates that outside of the primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire only the larger state papers such as the Los Angeles Times or the Atlanta Journal and Constitution give any voice to the campaign message.1 The media in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire tend to have a stronger dictate for covering the campaign more holistically, particularly in terms of their duty to the voters in their state. David Yepsen, Political Editor for the Des Moines Register illustrates this point. “In Iowa you're covering it for an electorate that has to choose among a large number of candidates. There's no luxury; that guy is not going anywhere; this is a place where voters decide and we have to provide that information” (Yepsen 2001).            "
"57","When we disaggregate our state data into early primary states and other states we find that it is the Des Moines Register and the Manchester Union Leader that are responsible for the negative impact of both the frontrunner and the challenger dummy variables. This apparent bias toward third‐tier candidates could be linked to campaign strategies at this point in the process. The leaders and even the challengers are focusing on fundraising and nailing down key endorsements and thus are spending comparatively little time in the states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Third‐tier candidates on the other hand need a big showing in these early states and lacking both resources and access to the national media may spend a lot of time on the ground courting the local press and the voters. This accessibility may bolster their ability to use the local media, but further research is warranted in this area.            "
"58","Our second group of hypotheses suggests that how the campaign structures its message is important to its ability to transmit the message via the media to the voting public. Again the different media outlets respond uniquely. Contrary to expectations, competitive messages, both positive and negative, were neither significantly nor positively related to transmission (with the exception of the coefficient for positive message in our local press model which reports a positive but insignificant coefficient of .103). Despite the fact that competitive messages dominate those sent by the candidate and those produced by the news media, it appears that candidates have little to do with the nature of the competitive messages generated in the press. However, candidates retain a better chance of having competitive messages, especially negative competitive messages used by national journalists, than they have of having their substantive messages reported in a story to the broader public. Table 5 indicates that the national press is up to 5% more likely to use a negative competitive message in a news story than a substantive message.            "
"59","Surprisingly, the national media are most likely to transmit an informative message; furthermore, this predisposition toward informative messages is consistent across tiers. Although frontrunners have the highest probability of having their messages transmitted by the national press, all candidates are more likely to have informative messages transmitted than any other form of message. A perusal of the data indicates that most informative messages appear in multi‐item summation columns such as “Washington Briefs” that simply rehash the day's events or list coming events for the next day or two. The impact of this type of message transmission for the campaign is probably marginal at best."
"60","Perhaps a more intriguing finding is that substantive messages have a significant negative effect on candidate message transmission in the national press and a positive though not significant effect on message transmission in the local press. This may be the result of candidates introducing policy planks on the campaign trail. Campaigns generally stage events with local groups such as farmers in Iowa to announce a relevant policy plank. The local press thus covers the story as a local event regardless of the content of the speech while the national press ignores it because it is viewed either as a local event or because it is not yet newsworthy. There is some support for this argument. As Table 5 illustrates the variation across models is quite dramatic. A frontrunner, issuing a geographically focused substantive message has a 37% probability of having that message used by the local press but only a 12% chance of having that message used by the national press. Similarly, a third‐tier candidate has a 44% percent chance of having a substantive message picked up by the local press but only a 6% chance of having that same message used in the national press. Clearly, despite the fact that candidates are disseminating substantive issue based messages, they are encountering a roadblock in attempting to get those messages to the general voting population via the national press.            "
"61","Press releases containing useful quotes are positively related to message transmission at the state press level increasing the odds that a message will be used. This effect, again, may result from variations in resources across media organizations. As mentioned earlier, national news organizations have greater resources and access to candidates at this juncture and may rely more on direct contact and therefore exclusive quotes in covering a story than do local news organizations. Local media organizations lack the resources to cover each candidate directly and thus are more dependent on the campaign and other resources for information. Again, if we disaggregate our state data we find further support for this explanation. We find that the local media in states without early primaries are more likely to use messages containing quotes then local media in states with early primaries. Since events are occurring in Iowa and New Hampshire throughout the invisible primary papers such as the Des Moines Register and the Manchester Union Leader do not have to expend the same amount of resources to cover the candidates directly as would local papers from other states.            "
"62","The length of the press release appears to have a varying impact on message transmission as well. The longer the press release the less likely the national news media will utilize the message. This effect is probably best explained in conjunction with the prevalence of informative message transmission by the national press. As noted earlier, informative messages at the national level often appear in multi‐item columns or news briefs. Informative messages that simply list the candidate's schedule, which are in general very short and to the point, fit nicely into these columns. There is no significant relationship between length of message and the state press."
"63","Our hypotheses also predict that the targeted audience will affect the ability of the campaign to transmit their message to the public via the press. The coefficients in Table 4 indicate that geographically focused messages have a substantial and significant negative effect on candidate message transmission in the national press and a positive, though not significant effect at the local level. As expected the odds of a message being transmitted by the national press decrease 54% if the campaign message is targeted to a local audience. The effect is reversed for the state media. Nationally focused messages reduce the probability that the state media will use a candidate's message in a news story. However, the relationship does not reach statistical significance for our state model.            "
"64","Our final set of hypotheses examines the timing of the press release. We find that contrary to expectations, messages that are “piggybacked” onto events do not have an increased probability of being transmitted to the public. In general the relationship between the proximity of an event to message dissemination and message transmission was weak and insignificant. However, we do find support for the hypothesis that candidate messages will be less likely to be transmitted to the public via the news media the closer we get to the start of the official primary season—but only for state news organizations. As Table 6 illustrates, however, the reduction is quite dramatic. For example, the probability of a negative competitive message issued by a frontrunner being used by the state press drops from 30% 120 days before the start of the primary season to 14% 30 days out. The results for the national press model are the opposite of what we predicted and fail to achieve statistical significance.            "
"65","Our efforts to systematically examine how campaigns structure messages, identify which messages are transmitted by the press to the public, and analyze what factors influence message transmission reveals that the news media's institutional norms and routines play a significant role both in terms of conditioning the behavior of candidates and in determining the nature of the campaign discourse. What then are the consequences for campaigns in terms of how they structure and disseminate messages directed to the media for broadcast to the general public. Are campaigns more successful in having their messages picked up and used by the media if they cede to news norms and routines. In general, we find mixed support. Who is speaking appears more influential in getting the media's attention then either how they say it or when they are saying it."
"66","The frontrunner has much more access to the national press and the broader national electorate than do either challengers or third‐tier candidates. When combined with the media's focus on only the most promising of contenders this access aides frontrunners in maintaining the poll numbers and raising the funds necessary to maintain their status. It also stacks the deck against second and third‐tier candidates who need exposure to keep going. Lower‐tier candidates find a much more accessible venue for their message at the state and local level. Third‐tier candidates in particular, find that they are more successful in having messages picked up and used by local press, but this also subjects them to a much more limited audience early in the race when national poll numbers and fund raising is crucial."
"67","The dominance of competitive messages, both positive and negative, within the campaign information environment would lead one to expect that these types of messages would find their way into the media more readily than would any other type of message—we find little evidence of this. Competitive messages are more likely to find their way into print in the national media then issue based substantive messages, but shaping a message within a competitive frame does not significantly enhance the probability of a campaign message being picked up and used by the media. Thus, although campaigns appear to emulate the news catering to conflict and horse race norms by disseminating a large number of competitive messages it does not appear to significantly influence either the media's coverage of the campaign or attention to the candidate."
"68","Correspondingly, we also find that the national media provides a particularly hostile environment for candidates who want to talk about the issues. Substantive campaign messages are significantly less likely to be used in news stories by the national press. Although candidates find a much more willing venue in the state press, they also find a much more limited audience. It is clear from this study that candidates do provide substantive, issue‐based discussions from the earliest stages of the campaign. Consequently, candidate complaints that the media are not willing to provide coverage of substantive discussions appear to be well founded."
"69","We have examined only one portion of the campaign process, the invisible primary, during one presidential campaign. The generalizability of our results is, consequently, limited. However, our results are important; they provide a framework for an extension of this study both to the active portion of the campaign and across presidential campaigns. Of interest are the questions concerning how changes in the campaign environment alter candidate message strategy? Over time do particular norms become more influential than others? How about over the course of the campaign? Are the news media more sensitive, for example, to competitive status during the visible or the invisible primary or in races with or without an incumbent? Are timing issues more critical when time becomes so limited in a frontloaded calendar? Do campaign message strategies change over time to meet the challenges of both a shifting media environment and an evolving campaign environment? The answers to these and other questions will certainly help us shed light on the constant yet ever‐changing relationship between campaigns and the news media."
"70","To match press releases to newspaper articles we searched three Lexis‐Nexis databases: wires, general news, and U.S. news. To achieve maximum efficiency in our search we utilized the “more options” screen for each database. This option allows more keywords to be entered and in turn provides a narrower search."
"71","To conduct our search we entered the last name of the candidate issuing the press release as the first key word in the “search for” box. Depending on the press release, the search is then narrowed with the use of additional key words. If the press release is specific enough, conducting a narrow search will retrieve only those articles related to that release and fewer articles need to be read to weed out the nonhits. However, some of the press releases, such as Lamar Alexander's “Nashville Notes” cover various topics and events and the use of key words beyond “Alexander” might lead to the omission of some articles. Generally, when the release is vague, all stories containing the name of the candidate who issued the release were read and only those that were considered a “hit” (i.e., the information in the press release made it into the news story in some form) made it into our population of articles."
"72","We also narrowed the search by using a three‐day window beginning our search on the issue date of the press and ending it three days thereafter. Finally, the sources to be mined for hits are specified. For the wire section, only the Associated Press is used. In the general news section of Lexis‐Nexis, the source searched is major newspapers. In the U.S. news section, a region must be chosen and then within that region a state and local papers are searched. We searched each region in turn. All of the searches are full text searches, in order to avoid missing any articles.         "
