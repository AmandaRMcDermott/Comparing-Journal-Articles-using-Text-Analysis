"1","Despite the nominal discussion of “retrenchment” in the literature, numerous accounts of the welfare state instead highlight its resilience. Indeed, a major starting point in the new politics literature is the continued generosity of the welfare state. For instance, the main empirical puzzle motivating Pierson's seminal work, Dismantling the Welfare State, was that avowedly antiwelfare administrations—Reagan's in the United States and Thatcher's in the United Kingdom—were so unsuccessful in rolling it back in the 1980s. Other authors have reached similar conclusions (Stephens, Huber, and Ray 1999; also see Huber and Stephens 2001a, chapter 6; cf. Green‐Pedersen and Haverland 2002).         "
"2","Without going into a discussion here about the validity of specific explanations for welfare state austerity and retrenchment, it is worth prefacing our discussion of spending trends by pointing out that welfare state expansion is not monocausal. While there have been important changes militating toward contraction, many of the larger structural trends long alleged to increase demand for welfare programs—affluence, urbanization, secularization, democracy, “de‐familialization,” and economic specialization—persist (Scarborough 2000). These conditions are too often ignored, leading to the erroneous impression that some new “adverse” changes (globalization, union decline, or ideological change) will fully and quickly lead to a collapse of welfare programs and institutions.         "
"3","Measures such as levels of (or changes in) total public social expenditure, total transfer payments as a percentage of gross domestic product, or, in the case of individual programs, programmatic expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) have all been used—and continue to be used—as indicators of “welfare effort” (e.g., Cameron 1978; Garrett 1998; Huber and Stephens 2001a,b; Korpi 1983; Stephens, Huber, and Ray 1999; Swank 2002; Wilensky and Lebeaux 1958). For example, to support his argument that conservative governments in Germany, the United States and Britain failed to tame public spending, even Pierson's (1996) more qualitatively oriented comparison ultimately relies on government program spending, employment, and social transfer data, all measured as a percentage of GDP.            "
"4","In spite of their continued use in recent studies, reservations about the use of expenditure data are well documented (Castles and Mitchell 1992; Clayton and Pontusson 1998; Esping‐Andersen 1987, 1990; Gilbert and Moon 1988; Goodin et al. 1999). Such data cannot tell us very much about how, or on whom, the money is spent. In terms of understanding the impact of welfare state entitlements on individual life chances, this distinction can be crucial. As Esping‐Andersen remarked, “it's difficult to imagine that anyone struggled for spending per se” (1990, 21). Indeed, insofar as the welfare state serves to insure against misfortune vis‐à‐vis the market, actual spending levels are not directly relevant to protection provided.            "
"5","There are other reasons why social spending data are problematic as measures of welfare state generosity. First, changes in the structure of the dependent population can overwhelm (and hence mask) real cuts at the individual level. For example, aggregate social spending grew during the British recession of the early 1980s, even though the Conservative government slashed entitlements. As long as the percentage growth of dependents in a program (e.g., the unemployed) exceeds the percentage per capita reduction in benefits, aggregate social spending will be higher.5"
"6","Another problem with the use of spending as a ratio of GDP, perhaps the most often used measure of effort, concerns differences in economic growth rates. If, as many have argued, the welfare state performs services that have higher relative costs (Baumol's disease), or are paid by a postindustrial private sector whose productivity is inherently lower than in the past, the same level of services should require a growing share of government.6"
"7","Finally, differences in the tax treatment of transfers (either due to income tax exemptions or simply to different tax structures) distort the degree to which social spending, as measured in national accounts, translates into disposable income for program recipients. The role of taxation as an avenue for social transfers has been given more attention in recent years (Howard 1997), but while the tax system is increasingly being used as a transfer mechanism—the United States' Earned Income Tax Credit and the United Kingdom's Working Families Tax Credit being notable examples—it can also be used to claw back apparent increases in social spending. Adema (1998, 2001) finds that increases in gross expenditure levels can be offset considerably by changing the tax treatment of transfers (e.g., making benefits taxable), or by increasing consumption taxes. Either way, “net spending can often fall well below gross expenditures” (1998, 20).            "
"8","If the current reliance on aggregate spending in dynamic comparisons of welfare effort is problematic, how should we evaluate welfare state generosity? We believe that it is necessary to look at elements of welfare state programs that provide us with an indication of the likely impacts of programs on individual life chances. This is the approach taken in Esping‐Andersen's influential study of welfare state regimes, The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, and the desirability of his approach has been stated by various comparative welfare state scholars (Castles 1998b, 2002; Green‐Pedersen and Haverland 2002; Hicks 1999; Kitschelt 2001). In this section we discuss our approach at greater length and, using data derived from it, reevaluate trends in welfare commitments for eighteen countries over the last three decades. We find considerable evidence of retrenchment, starting generally in the mid‐1980s.            "
"9","Although individual entitlement measures are preferable dependent variables if our chief concern is explaining changes in the welfare state's impact on individuals and families, problems remain. There is a real paucity of data reporting benefit replacement rates. Since The Three Worlds, few published studies have replicated the original study or examined whether the pattern Esping‐Andersen reported in a single cross‐section of countries (in 1980) is (or was) as generalizable as the welfare state literature has assumed.            "
"10","Recent studies have made use of available data, such as the unemployment benefit replacement rate data published by the OECD (1995; e.g., Huber and Stephens 2001a; Iversen 2001). These data are less than desirable as a good indicator of welfare effort. First, this OECD data uses replacement rates without taking income and social insurance taxation into account. Large cross‐national differences in the tax treatment of benefits make such gross replacement rates deceptive. Depending on the tax treatment and marginal rate of benefit income, very different gross replacement rates can translate into the same final disposable income. For example, in 1997, gross unemployment benefits replaced 97% of an average production worker's net income in Denmark, 89% in Norway, 79% in Finland, 76% in Canada, and 65% in Belgium. Yet, after tax, the net replacement rates in all five countries were almost identical (between 63 and 66%). Such discrepancies undermine the value of gross replacement rates as a gauge of welfare state generosity not only across countries, but also over time: the tax treatment of benefits differs among and changes within countries during the 1970s and 1980s.7 Different tax treatment of benefits reveals further difficulties with relying on spending as a basis for welfare state generosity. Since spending figures include gross program outlays, rather than outlays net of tax, relative program generosity across countries is distorted.            "
"11","Given the discrepancies in the gross replacement rate data, the case for determining the net replacement rates of major social insurance programs as an indicator of individual welfare state entitlements is strong. While there has been limited work in this area, the existing data has several major shortcomings, particularly with regard to evaluating partisan effects. First, the Swedish Institute for Social Research (SOFI) also has a program calculating social rights (see Korpi and Palme 2001). Data like these were the basis for Esping‐Andersen's (1990) decommodification indices. Unfortunately, these data calculate benefits only at five‐year intervals and are not in the public domain. Second, the OECD Jobs Study (1994) estimated net unemployment replacement rates for four separate years: 1961, 1971, 1981, and 1991. The long gaps between data points make it difficult to estimate partisan effects. Moreover, our data address several major shortcomings of these estimates. Among other things, the OECD rates are calculated for single workers only, are based on imprecise projections regarding determination and tax treatment of benefits, and assume a relatively long period of unemployment. There are also more recent efforts by the OECD to calculate net replacement rates (OECD 1999). These results, however, do not provide any insight into recent trends, and they have only been calculated biannually since 1995. (For overlapping years our data are very close to theirs.)            "
"12","The data reported in Table 1 cover two programs: unemployment insurance and sickness insurance.8 Following the methodology discussed in Esping‐Andersen (1990) and some recent efforts by the OECD (1999), we estimated the benefits due for the first six months of the event and then annualized this figure in order to calculate a notional “tax owed” for the individual. We then deducted any income taxes or social charges due on that benefit and divided that figure by the net wage of the “average production worker” (APW). For benefits, we drew upon information from national government agencies responsible for such programs and the United States Social Security Administration's Social Security Programs Throughout the World. Wage and tax structure information are derived from the OECD's Tax/Benefit Position and Taxing Wages publications (which have been published since the mid 1970s), with additional information from various national governments. We calculated these net replacement rates for sickness and unemployment for two recipient groups: (a) a single worker, and (b) a married APW with a nonemployed spouse and two children. The replacement rates in Table 1 are the average for the two household types. An example of how the net replacement rate is calculated is provided in the appendix.            "
"13","To give a sense of trends, data are presented for years 1975, 1985, 1999, and the highest recorded rate in the 1975–99 period. Table 1 also displays the change in replacement rate (a) between 1999 and 1975, the year often considered to be the end of the golden age of welfare expansion, and (b) between 1999 and the highest‐recorded replacement rate. These replacement rates tell a very different story than studies examining spending data with respect to welfare state trends in OECD countries. First, there has been a great deal of retrenchment in benefit generosity in most countries. Second, there has been some convergence in replacement rates across countries.            "
"14"," Unemployment Insurance: in 11 of the 18 countries—Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States—cuts in unemployment insurance replacement rates have totaled five points or more compared to their post 1975 peaks. (If we went back to 1971, Canada would also appear in this list.) In eight countries, replacement rates in 1999 were more than 10 points below their peaks. Furthermore, Column 7 shows that in 10 of the 18 countries, replacement rates in 1999 are lower than they were in 1975. As the table suggests (and the annual data confirm), replacement rates peaked by the late 1980s in most countries.            "
"15","Not only has there been considerable retrenchment in most countries, but there has also been considerable cross‐national convergence in unemployment replacement rates. The coefficient of variation declines from .30 in 1975 to .22 in 1999. Consistent with convergence there is a strong negative pattern when change in replacement rate is graphed against initial replacement rates.9 This convergence in unemployment replacement rates contrasts with the recent emphasis on path dependence in comparative welfare state programs. While our evidence does not directly refute all claims that welfare state trajectories are path dependent, it stands as an important result contradicting this general assertion.            "
"16"," Sickness Insurance: the results for sickness insurance replacement rates largely resemble those for unemployment replacement rates. As with unemployment insurance, sick pay replacement rates are more than five points lower than their post 1975 peak in 11 of 17 countries (the United States has no national sick‐pay program). Replacement rates in 1999 are lower than they were in 1975 in eight of the 17, and the evidence suggests that the late 1970s or 1980s was the period in which sick‐pay replacement rates peaked. Judging by the coefficient of variation, there is not much convergence (or divergence) among these countries with respect to sick‐pay replacement rates, although the statistical analysis suggests more conditional convergence, leading us to conclude that even here there has been some convergence over time.            "
"17","Our results suggest a pattern of welfare state retrenchment emerging in the last several decades. Moreover, the pattern of retrenchment is generally consistent with the conventional wisdom that the 1980s marked something of a watershed. Prior to the 1980s, we see expansion of generosity, while after that period, there seems to be retrenchment.10"
"18","Our results are consistent with income inequality trends, such as those compiled in the Luxembourg Income Study (2003). Their data on post‐tax GINI coefficients and 80/20 splits suggests that most of the countries examined here have experienced increased inequality between the early to mid 1980s and late 1990s, in some cases considerable. Of course, inequality is affected by factors other than the welfare state (structure of skills, wage bargaining, etc.). Moreover, our results do not preclude the possibility that commodifying and inequality enhancing retrenchments in social insurance programs for the “typical worker” have been offset by existing means‐tested programs for those in poverty.11"
"19","On a more qualitative level, we can point to other evidence of some major programmatic change in another major program: pensions. For example, in Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, all examples of what has traditionally been defined as a universalistic welfare regime, flat‐rate pensions have been all but eliminated by the late 1990s. All have moved away from the universal citizenship pension, to primarily means‐tested systems. Overall these systems are still dominated by state provision of pensions, but the character of earnings‐related pensions has shifted somewhat more toward a conservative model relying on market earnings. Other evidence from our data set suggests that, not only are replacement rates declining, but the conditions for receiving unemployment (and pension) benefits are also becoming more stringent. The overall implication of these results is that workers are being asked to shoulder larger amounts of labor market risk compared with the social insurance systems of several decades past.            "
"20","Using the replacement rate data thus not only has the advantage of allaying some of the concerns that apply to the expenditure data, but, more importantly, it also shows more clearly how changes in welfare state have impacted upon the life chances of “typical” individuals in the labor market. On the basis of this evidence, we should be less sanguine about the resilience of welfare states in the face of various pressures for retrenchment than has been suggested. With these data in hand, the next section of the article turns to the role of government partisanship in explaining these changes."
"21","In examining the partisanship argument, several studies have cited convergence pressures operating on both the left and the right. On the right, the existence of the welfare state is said to check retrenchment designs (via vested interests or constituents who now benefit from its programs). On the left, various structural factors (including the idea of “growth to limits” and globalization) are said to explain pressures for retraction or stasis. As noted in our introduction, Huber and Stephens (2001a,b) and Castles (1998a, 2001) at least partially concur with Pierson's claim that differences between left and right have narrowed.         "
"22","Of course, push‐and‐pull factors may operate in opposite ways on the two sides of the partisan divide. “Constraints” for one side can bolster the argument for expansion or contraction by the other side. For example, by itself, appealing to the pressures for globalization offers the justification for cuts to be used against opponents of such cuts. Likewise, opponents of retrenchment may use vested interests to resist retrenchment pressures resulting from globalization or other sources and to expand those programs. Thus, in and of themselves, competing constraints have an ambiguous effect on outcomes, do little to speak to partisan preferences, and say little about the effect of the latter on the former."
"23"," Iversen (2001) provides a stylized model of changing demand for welfare protection that allows for a constant level of differentiation between left and right parties. In this model, while the level of welfare generosity may change due to institutional and structural constraints, there is no reason that the unconstrained differences between the parties are narrowed. If the median voter shifts to the right, right parties demand bigger cuts than does the left but the difference between them can be the same. It could even increase. Kitschelt (2001) also suggests a model in which a left party's desire for a larger welfare state may be masked by strategic considerations that lead the left to make preemptive cuts or the right to resist cuts. Common to both authors, however, is the implicit presumption that underlying partisan differences over the nature of the welfare state remain.12"
"24","Empirical support for this idea can be gauged from other sources. For example, an analysis of national party manifestos suggests that, while there is considerable variation within most countries over time in the degree to which parties of the left/right support welfare state expansion/contraction (and evidence in some countries that parties are less expansionist than in the past), there is no systematic evidence of convergence among the major parties on welfare state expansion issues as the declining partisanship thesis implies (Budge et al. 2001). Additionally, case studies presented in Scharpf and Schmidt's (2000) assessment of changes in welfare and employment relations in Western Europe suggest persistent partisan differences.         "
"25","That partisan differences exist does not necessarily imply that partisanship matters for explaining changes in welfare state entitlements. However, on two fronts, we show that partisanship does still matter critically. First, our reexamination of partisanship and retrenchment in the Germany, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States strongly rebuts conclusions drawn in initial studies (Pierson 1994, 1996). Second, our appraisal of the statistical evidence (particularly of changing replacement rates) suggests that the partisan nature of government matters for retrenchment. Moreover, its effect is completely consistent with the idea that the overall context for welfare state expansion has indeed shifted somewhat.            "
"26","Pierson's case studies of the United States and United Kingdom sought to assess why two very neo‐liberal/rightist administrations, with extensive plans to roll back the welfare state failed to do so convincingly. While Reagan and Thatcher probably got less retrenchment than they wanted, from a comparative perspective they were quite successful by many criteria.13 Both countries spend less as a percentage of GDP (and the government employs a smaller share of the workforce) in 2000 than at any time since the early 1970s, and this occurred in the face of an increasing portion of the population that is retired and drawing a public pension. It is true that the United States looks slightly less like a case of retrenchment than the United Kingdom, but two things mitigate that fact. First, the United States was a smaller welfare state to begin with; second, its welfare state experienced a more rapidly aging population and its programs are more strongly weighted toward that segment of the population.            "
"27","The extent of retrenchment in these two countries is even is more apparent if we look at comparative benefit replacement rates. While the 18‐country average unemployment net replacement rate between 1980 and 1989 grew about one point (from 60.8 to 61.9), the decline in the United Kingdom in that period was 18 points (48 to 30)! While the average sickness benefit replacement rate rose from 69.7 to 71.9 across our entire group of 18 countries in this same period, it fell 16 points in the United Kingdom from 49 to 33. Combined with Thatcher's success in eviscerating trade union power, ending the state earnings‐related pension, and privatizing public infrastructure (including 20% of the public housing stock) in a single decade, one could certainly cite this as a considerable roll‐back of what is one of the oldest welfare states in the world."
"28","Changes to unemployment insurance (and pensions) in the United States under the Reagan administration were also comparatively large. Unemployment insurance replacement rates fell from 65% in 1980 to 59% in 1989, after the benefit was made liable to federal (and, more importantly, state and local) income tax.14 Finally, as in the United Kingdom, the Reagan administration also targeted labor unions, a major proponent of the American welfare state (such as it was), and unionization fell rapidly.            "
"29","To infer from these examples that the partisan nature of government has little overall impact on welfare state retrenchment seems questionable. The same can be said when the comparison is extended to Germany and Sweden. The United States, United Kingdom, and Germany lack variation on the critical partisanship variable.15 All four have also experienced nontrivial cuts in their benefit replacement rates. The one country of the four with the least amount of time under right‐wing governments, Sweden, is the only one to experience unambiguously higher growth in overall aggregate spending. Thus, even in terms of spending, the evidence against a partisanship effect seems weak.            "
"30"," Huber and Stephens (2001a) explicitly test for effects of Social Democratic (and Christian Democratic) executives on patterns of welfare spending during retrenchment. Their interpretation that a shift in the policy agenda to defending (rather than expanding) entitlements explains the insignificant estimate for partisan differences is problematic. First, a positive coefficient is consistent with either more spending or fewer cuts by left governments (vis‐à‐vis the right). (What would have changed was the intercept term of the model if the average change went from positive to negative.) Most of Huber and Stephens's estimates for 1972 to the 1990s have a positive sign for left parties. The fact that the estimates are not statistically significant may be the result of greater variance in their limited sample, not a zero effect. Moreover, and as we will elaborate upon below, finding that left governments are not clearly associated with expansion, does not necessarily imply that right governments are not associated with retrenchment.            "
"31","One argument that is consistent with a partisan effect in both Huber and Stephens's and Pierson's explanation is that there are new constraints (e.g., unemployment, globalization) determining spending priorities, and that these are correlated with partisanship and the size of the welfare state. If for example, countries dominated by left governments are more open to trade, and openness is increasingly associated with retrenchment, excluding trade openness from a model of welfare state generosity creates a downward bias in the estimated effect of left governments. On the other hand, estimating these omitted variables reduces the bias, while including them inflates the errors associated with estimates of partisanship effects. In Huber and Stephens's statistical analysis of the retrenchment period for example (1999, 202–21), with only 18 observations, model parsimony may necessitates excluding globalization as a regressor, but the downward bias in partisanship estimates may remain. These problems are as, if not more, pronounced when attempting to draw inferences from Pierson's four case studies."
"32","Another specification problem with models examining the relationship between retrenchment and partisan explanations is, once again, the dependent variable. Advocates of the class mobilization and partisan thesis, like Korpi and Palme (2001) or Esping‐Andersen (1990), point out that partisanship and class power should not necessarily explain aggregate spending but the degree of decommodification of risks in the welfare state. In this light, a “new politics of the welfare state” that focuses on distributional issues within the welfare state is not really at odds with “old” theories of class and class politics. That a relationship no longer exists between spending and partisanship may simply reflect that spending is a poor(er) proxy, not that partisanship has less impact on decommodification. This only underscores the importance of using entitlements data as the basis for evaluating the continued validity of partisan explanations.            "
"33","On all of these counts, existing empirical work discounting partisan and class explanations of the welfare state are not necessarily well designed as tests either of the implications of partisanship or of critical causal forces in the new politics approach. Critics of partisanship explanations have generally failed to specify correctly what outcomes partisanship affects—life chances not aggregate spending—and not tested the purported causal mechanisms of “new politics” explanations—differences among overall configurations of forces affecting welfare states—on such outcomes."
"34","In this section we examine the determinants of changes in replacement rates for unemployment benefits and sickness insurance in 18 OECD countries over the period 1975–99. Our primary goal is to assess the importance of partisanship as an explanation of changes in benefits over this period."
"35","There has been some controversy among scholars of political parties as to how partisanship can be best operationalized. Probably most studies have used some measure of left‐party strength in government, usually the share of cabinet seats. We follow this convention here, with the expectation derived from previous studies that left parties will be positively associated with expansion of welfare benefits. However, we also note Castles's (1982) suggestion that right‐party strength—measured here as the average right‐cabinet seat share—is the most appropriate indicator of partisan effects on welfare retrenchment.16 We therefore expect the relationship with changes in replacement rates to be in the opposite direction; that is, right parties will be associated with retrenchment in benefit replacement rates.17 By estimating the models alternately with left‐ and right‐party strength variables, we can be more confident that any results—if consistent using both measures—are not overly sensitive to the choice of partisanship variable. Our expectation is that left parties will be positively associated with growing replacement rates, particularly during periods of welfare expansion. Conversely, parties of the right will be associated with welfare retrenchment, particularly in periods of retrenchment.         "
"36","In addition to the partisanship variable, our statistical model includes several explanatory variables commonly found in other models of welfare state change. GDP growth is included, with the expectation that higher levels of growth will be associated with more generous benefits. The impact of globalization is measured using two variables: trade openness ([imports + exports]/GDP) and financial openness, the latter being a composite measure of the restrictions placed on financial transactions by states developed by Quinn and Inclán (1997). Based on most recent empirical studies, we do not expect substantial globalization effects, but include these measures because their impact on outcome measures such as ours has not been ascertained. We also include controls for budget deficit (as a percentage of GDP) in order to control for the possibility that partisanship is correlated with budgetary crises, and the latter are correlated with changes in replacement rates. In order to control for a possible effect of the program population, the unemployment rate is also included as an independent variable.18"
"37","In order to account partially for possible cross‐national convergence in benefit generosity suggested in the discussion of trends in the first section of the article, the lagged replacement rate is included as an independent variable. A negative coefficient would imply that above (below) average initial replacement rates are associated with more (less) severe cuts, conditional on the other variables in the model.         "
"38","We include two different type of controls for political and welfare policy institutions. First, we include Huber, Ragin, and Stephens's (1997) measure of institutional veto points to assess the extent to which governments may find their “room to maneuver” restricted by general constitutional structures argued to affect public policy outcomes. The literature leads us to expect that more veto points will be associated with less retrenchment.         "
"39","The second institutional variable measures the extent to which corporatist bargaining arrangements dominate within a country. We employ Siaroff's (1999) measure of “integration,” which provides a unidimensional and ordinal measure based on levels of social partnership, industry‐level coordination and national policymaking patterns. Higher scores are indicative of greater neo‐corporatism and less pluralism, and vary by decade. In line with previous empirical findings, we expect more integrated/corporatist democracies to be more resistant to welfare state retrenchment.         "
"40","The basic model for unemployment and sickness benefits is:               "
"41","Given the well‐documented caveats associated with using regression analysis with cross‐national and time‐series data (Beck and Katz 1995), we estimate our models using OLS regression with panel corrected standard errors (PCSE). Several things about this model's specification bear mentioning. First, for each program replacement rate (unemployment and sick‐pay insurance), preliminary tests on the levels of the replacement‐rate series indicated problems with stationarity. This led us to use the first differences of the dependent variable.            "
"42","Second, we attempted to reduce problems of simultaneity bias by using the lagged values of all time varying independent variables. Thus, independent variables in the equation have (t− 1) subscripts in Equation 1. We also justify our use of a lagged measure of partisan composition of government based on a presumed lag between a policy change by a particular government and its substantive effect.19"
"43","Third, we use fixed country effects, which are denoted “D” in Equation 1. While there is no explicit theoretical reason to include them, fixed effects do allow us to reduce the possibility that the substantive estimates are in fact attributable to country‐specific trends. In this sense, this is a rather conservative approach to testing our main hypotheses. We exclude the estimates for the country dummies, for reasons of space and ease of presentation. With the fixed effect Ds, β0 and β9 drop out of the equation.            "
"44","The fourth point relates to the specification of interaction terms. In order to capture the “sea change” that occurred in the 1980s and suggested in much of the literature on contemporary welfare states, we needed to locate this structural break in a manner that was both nonarbitrary but consistent with the literature. We used the year of the major economic recession during the early 1980s in each country. We then interacted each of the substantive variables with that break.20 This results in a dummy‐variable‐interaction model that allows us to evaluate relationships between the substantive variables before and after the critical break year.            "
"45","For each of the two programs, we present results from two different methods of estimation. The first is the more or less standard OLS regression with corrections for heterogeneous errors across panels. In order to demonstrate that the results that we are interested in (those for partisanship) are robust, we present estimates without interaction terms (thus treating the entire period 1975–99 as governed by the same slopes), without country dummies, and with only convergence effects.21"
"46","As a second approach we dichotomized changes in replacement rates, and estimated the model with a logistic regression function, coding cuts “1.” Our expectations for the signs of the individual estimate in this model are opposite to those in the OLS model (with few exceptions, noted below), as a “positive” result is a cut in the replacement rate. As in the OLS regressions, we present estimates excluding some of the control variables."
"47","Further specification changes were made to test the robustness of these results. This included dropping countries from the analysis, using alternative combinations of the control variables in the model, and using techniques to bound the influence of “large values” of the dependent variable. Unless otherwise noted, results for alternative specifications (which can be obtained from the authors) do not alter the substantive conclusions discussed in this section, except where noted in the text (e.g., for estimates of deficits or unemployment)."
"48","In this section we discuss the results of our statistical analyses. In short, we find consistent effects for partisanship and convergence, but not for the controls. Here, we focus primarily on the results for political partisanship and convergence effects in the two periods analyzed, since these are of main theoretical interest here, and assessing the robustness of what function as controls in this model is beyond the scope of the article."
"49","Partisanship  For unemployment benefits, estimates for both of the partisanship variables (left‐cabinet shares and right‐cabinet shares) are in the predicted direction. Moreover, the pattern of the results corresponds to our expectations. Before the break points in the 1980s, left governments are associated with larger, statistically significant increases in replacement rates. Thus, from column 1 of Table 2, in the era of welfare expansion, a government composed of all left parties increased replacement rates three points faster than a government of all right parties. However, since the recessions of the early 1980s (column 2), left governments are not significantly associated with increases in replacement rates.               "
"50","For right governments, we see the mirror image of this effect. That is, up to the 1980s (column 3), right governments are associated with changes in replacement rates that cannot be differentiated from zero. Since the 1980s, in the era of welfare retrenchment, governments made up of all right‐wing parties are associated with larger cuts (about 1.5 points larger) in unemployment replacement rates. Alternative specifications of the model (several of which are included in Table 2) all lead to the same conclusion.               "
"51","Our results may help to explain why previous studies, like Huber and Stephens, failed to find strong left‐partisan effects during the 1980s and 1990s in their quantitative analyses. Because they only estimate effects for the “pro‐welfare” parties (e.g., left), and not for the “antiwelfare” ones, they exclude what are the important partisan effects at work in retrenchment. We would expect that substituting right parties would result in larger estimates of partisan effects post 1980.               "
"52","The estimated effects of partisanship on changes in sickness benefits in Table 3 are very similar to those for unemployment. The coefficients suggest substantive effects of political shifts to the right that are in fact greater than those found for unemployment benefits. Overall then, these results suggest reasonably strong partisan effects on welfare state retrenchment, even with controls for the macroeconomic context and other common factors generally held to impact the welfare state. Korpi and Palme's findings (2003), also based on an entitlements‐based approach to examining welfare state reforms, are largely consistent with ours. Since the data they use are not publicly available, however, it is not possible to compare our results directly.               "
"53","Globalization  Our results for the effects of economic internationalization are more or less consistent with previous work (Castles 2001; Garrett 1998; Pierson 2001). We fail to find widespread and robust effects of financial openness or trade openness on changes in benefits. The direction of the effects varies, depending on which dependent variable is used. The marginally significant estimates for effects of Trade Openness on unemployment program outcomes are due largely to a single case, Ireland. (Irish trade increases dramatically at the same time its replacement rate is falling.) There are, however, reasonably consistent results for the restraining effects of openness on changes in sick pay in the 1970s and early 1980s.               "
"54","Convergence  There is a consistent negative relationship between changes in replacement rates and their initial levels (“lag replacement rate”). This result also obtains without additional controls in the unemployment insurance model (Column 7 of Table 2), which implies that the result is not simply conditional on other variables. These results are consistent with the convergence in levels noted earlier in the discussion of unemployment replacement rates in Table 1. That changes in replacement rates are negatively correlated with their past level provides evidence for conditional convergence and against the notion of path dependence. In the sickness model, the convergence effect is conditional on other variables in the model as shown in column 6 of Table 3. The significant convergence estimate for sick pay obtains, however, if we control only for partisanship (column 7). This implies that, in the absence of partisan differences, there would also be convergence in sick‐pay replacement rates.               "
"55","Institutional Effects  Our results suggest that corporatist institutions may play a role in reducing welfare state retrenchment. Estimates for the corporatism variable are consistently positive (implying that more corporatist countries cut replacement rates less), and at least marginally statistically significant. Such results are consistent with the view that strong unions and policy concertation will tend to resist retrenchment, or retrench less. Moreover, estimates of the model that do not control for corporatist institutions (available from the authors) suggest that taking them into account lowers the estimated retrenching effects of right governments, especially since the 1980s. (For the unemployment model, the coefficient for right government falls from −1.80 if corporatism is excluded from the model to −1.51 when it is included.) However, the sign and significance of the corporatism estimates are sensitive to alternative specifications of the model, suggesting that they are not very robust. For example, if the corporatism variable is added to the specification shown in columns 8 and 9, the estimate is not significant in either period and the sign in the second period is negative. In contrast to the effects of corporatism, constitutional veto points seem to exert little discernible impact on welfare state outcomes (nor does it in alternative specifications).22"
"56","Structural Economic Crisis  Finally, the results in Tables 2 and 3 provide at best limited evidence that macroeconomic constraints systematically facilitate the speed of retrenchment. Unemployment and higher budget deficits are both consistently associated with larger cuts in replacement rates in both programs. However, these effects are sensitive to the model specification and to which dependent variable is used. We have no good explanation for why these results tend to be stronger in the estimates for sick pay than for unemployment insurance. Given the fact that unemployment insurance is perhaps a more salient factor than sick pay in affecting unemployment levels and the demand for social benefits, we would expect it to be more tightly linked to the macroeconomy.               "
"57"," Table 4 presents results of logit estimations of the basic models. We dichotomized the dependent variables using two rules. The first codes any negative change in the replacement rate as 1 and all zero or positive changes as zero. The second attempts to exclude “marginal” changes in replacement rates, which may accrue through no obvious intention to cut replacement rates.23 The table reports only the coefficients for Right‐ and Left‐Cabinet Shares, and, as in the earlier model, each of these effects are estimated in separate regressions. Two points should be kept in mind when viewing these results. First, the expected signs on the partisanship variables and the convergence terms are reversed, because a “positive” outcome here represents a cut in benefits. Second, since it is a dichotomous variable, the estimates are for the probability of making any cut in benefits (above the threshold specified). A cut of five points is treated here as the same as a cut of one point. Thus, these estimates tell us nothing about the magnitude of cuts.            "
"58","For reasons of space, we report only the estimates for convergence terms and partisanship, and only for selected specifications. The results for right parties are very similar in sign and significance to those reported in Table 2. Up until the 1980s, we cannot conclude that right parties are more or less likely to initiate cuts in benefits. After the recessions of the early 1980s, however, right parties appear much more likely to initiate cuts than nonright parties. This reinforces our conclusion that parties of the right are more likely to cut benefits, not just raise them less, or cut them more than nonright parties in this period.            "
"59","Estimates for left parties are generally negative over both periods, but these estimates are not robustly significant statistically. This pattern of results within the logit framework is actually consistent with the belief that right parties are the “antiwelfare” parties and that the post‐1980s period is the era of retrenchment. Only when both conditions are met—right government in an era of cuts—do we expect to see a strong negative effect; and the left‐party effects in the 1970s are weak, in contrast to the results in Table 2, possibly because no parties (right or left) were likely to retrench during this period.            "
"60","In this article we have reexamined two key topics in the welfare state literature that have been the subject of considerable debates in recent years. Like many others, we believe that the entitlements approach to welfare state generosity, and the replacement rate data introduced in this article, provide a much greater purchase over questions concerning the welfare state's alleged resilience (or lack thereof) in recent years, and the role that partisanship plays in shaping welfare state entitlements."
"61","Beyond the improvement in measuring welfare state generosity, we think our analytical results have a number of important implications for our understanding of welfare state politics. First, our analysis provides several good reasons not to abandon established theories of the welfare state. Not only is it not particularly productive to abandon theories because the things we wish to explain change their trajectory, but it is also the case that some old accounts hold up rather well. While some events may help us to focus more on what our categories and concepts are, this is quite different from abandoning links between them. Viewed in a broad comparative context, and over a number of years, there is evidence that welfare states have changed considerably since the early 1980s."
"62","Second, at least one of the conventional explanations cited to explain welfare state expansion—the partisan makeup of democratic executives—also appears to work “in reverse,” despite claims to the contrary found in the “new politics” accounts of welfare state adjustment. Just as government by the left tended to lead to more rapid expansion of the welfare state, particularly the expansion of rights to reasonable income outside of the market nexus, government by parties of the neo‐liberal right since the 1980s (or even since the mid‐1970s) has tended to result in greater retrenchment."
"63","In a similar vein, our results cast some doubt on the idea that preexisting institutional arrangements necessarily constitute major barriers to change. To date, the evidence in favor of this idea has not been particularly persuasive when viewed in a proper comparative context. We find only limited evidence that more class‐consensual institutions (i.e., neo‐corporatism) has been more successful at resisting cuts in benefits during the last two or three decades, and we find almost no clear evidence that political systems with greater dispersion of power constrain welfare expansion or retrenchment."
"64","The evaluation of the scope and dynamics of welfare state reform must pay more attention to the distribution of risks and life chances. Such features are not only beyond the scope of comparative spending data, but have generally been recognized as being so. We hope that by shifting the focus from expenditure measures to data that better reflect the consequences of welfare state policies, our research may contribute to correcting this lacuna in current welfare state research.
