"1","Scholars and activists have long expected the presence of women in office to encourage greater political involvement among their fellow female citizens. Extant empirical work has focused primarily on the United States, but the theoretical arguments and proposed causal mechanisms are applicable, and have been proposed (e.g., Kittilson 2005), cross‐nationally. Most previous work has concerned psychological engagement (e.g., interest, attention) rather than actual political activity. We seek to determine if female politicians serve as role models in the fullest sense—encouraging other women and girls to follow in their footsteps and participate actively in politics. We examine two kinds of political activity: political discussion with friends and family, and political participation, such as joining a political group or working for a party.         "
"2","First, we ask whether female descriptive representatives encourage political discussion among women (discussion hypothesis). The mere presence of fellow group members may make politics a subject of women's discussion. To the extent that female politicians raise issues of interest to women (e.g., Childs and Withey 2004; Swers 2002; Wolbrecht 2002), frame legislative decision making from women's perspective (Walsh 2002), and provide substantive representation (e.g., Lijphart 1991; Schwindt‐Bayer and Mishler 2005; Swers 2002), female role models may spark women's discussion about political topics. Previous research finds that the presence of female politicians is associated with greater psychological engagement (e.g., interest, attention, efficacy) in the United States (Atkeson 2003; Atkeson and Carrillo 2007; Burns, Schlozman, and Verba 2001; Koch 1997; Sapiro with Conover 1997) and in the United Kingdom (Norris, Lovenduski, and Campbell 2004), which may translate into a greater propensity for political discussion.4 With regard to discussion specifically, scholars have reported positive effects under certain conditions for both proselytizing (encouraging others to vote for a particular candidate) and conversing about politics in general (Atkeson 2003; Hansen 1997; but see Lawless 2004).         "
"3","Second, the presence of female politicians might encourage women to enter the political arena themselves (e.g., Burns, Schlozman, and Verba 2001; Carroll 1985); that is, might make it more likely that women are (or, in the case of young women, intend to be) politically active (role model hypothesis). The expectation is that seeing others “like them” active in political life may inspire women and girls to active political participation. Impact on attitudes such as interest and efficacy is important, but the ability of female role models to inspire actual political involvement is arguably of even greater consequence and import. Yet, while widely proposed as a rationale for greater descriptive representation, most previous research on American adults has reported weak, inconsistent, or nonexistent links between the presence of female politicians and women's political participation (e.g., Dolan 2006). However, other work finds that the presence of visible female politicians is positively associated with a range of anticipated activities among American adolescent girls (Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006), and that the presence of a successful female MP candidate predicts greater campaign volunteerism and turnout among women in the United Kingdom (Norris, Lovenduski, and Campbell 2004). We are not aware of any large‐N cross‐national research linking descriptive representation and women's political activity.         "
"4","Finally, the term “role model” suggests that the impact of descriptive representatives is greatest among young people (socialization hypothesis), a possibility unexamined by previous research. Young people are in the process of learning about the political world and their place within it, and thus their actions may be particularly open to influences in their environment. As individuals age, many of their behaviors become more established and less malleable, and thus, we hypothesize, less influenced by such factors as the presence of female representatives.         "
"5","The expectation that political attitudes and behaviors might be most open to influence at a younger age is supported by research throughout the world which suggests that political activity is habit forming—participating at a young age is a strong predictor of participation later in life, and perhaps more importantly, not participating as one enters political adulthood makes future participation increasingly unlikely (Franklin 2004; Gerber, Green, and Shachar 2003; Jennings and Stoker 2004; Plutzer 2002). Other work suggests that the attitudes and actions of the young are more malleable and susceptible to cues than are those of older citizens who have established political habits (Campbell 2002; see Sears 1975). Dramatic political events appear to have a particularly strong and long‐lasting impact on the political predispositions of young people as they enter political life (Beck 1974; Beck and Jennings 1991; Inglehart 1981; Sears and Valentino 1997).         "
"6","We examine the impact of female politicians on the political activity of women and girls cross‐nationally by employing three studies: the European Values Survey (EVS), conducted in 1999–2002; the European Social Survey (ESS), which took place in 2004; and the Civic Education Study (CES),5 a survey of adolescents conducted by the International Association for Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), the same organization that provides cross‐national comparisons of academic performance, in 1999–2000.6 The target age for the CES was 14 years old, which in most nations meant the eighth grade.7 By employing three distinct surveys, we are able to examine each hypothesis across more than one dataset, providing a reliability check that increases our confidence in the results. (Consult the online appendix for details on the construction of all variables).8 To maximize comparability across these three datasets, the analysis has been limited to fully democratic countries, nations receiving the maximum democratization score on the Freedom House index.9 The EVS, ESS, and CES models thus include 23, 22, and 20 nations, respectively, with considerable overlap across datasets, as Table 1 indicates.         "
"7","We are interested in the effect of the presence of female political role models on propensity for political discussion and political activity. Among the adult datasets, the EVS (but not the ESS) contains a measure of political discussion, in which respondents are asked to indicate how often they talk about politics when they “get together with friends”: frequently, occasionally, never. We measure Political Discussion in the CES with two separate variables, one that asks about discussion with family members and another with friends. Both measures are indices that combine two questions about domestic and international politics and, like all the indices we discuss, have been standardized to have a standard deviation of 1.0. This standardization provides a common metric by which to compare the magnitude of effect sizes across the models and datasets.            "
"8","To measure Political Activity in the EVS, we create an index that includes petition signing, boycotting, demonstrating, and membership in and volunteer work for a political party and/or a “local action group.” For petitions, boycotts, and demonstrations, respondents are asked whether they (1) would never participate in that activity; (2) might participate in it at some point in the future; or (3) have participated in that activity. The questions about parties and groups ask if one is a member and/or is currently doing unpaid volunteer work for that organization. Because the diversity of response options does not lend itself to an additive scale (since it is not clear how to weight probable against reported activity), we instead generate a political activity index using factor analysis. Each respondent is thus assigned a factor score (minimum = 3.2, mean = 5, maximum = 6.98, standard deviation = 1).            "
"9","The ESS contains a similar battery of Political Activity, asking whether the respondent has participated in each activity “during the last 12 months.” The activities include contacting government officials, working in a political party, working in another organization, wearing a campaign badge, signing a petition, participating in a lawful demonstration, and boycotting. Factor analysis confirms that these items load together, and so they have been combined into an additive index that has been standardized (minimum = 0.34, mean = 1, maximum = 5.86, standard deviation = 1). Note the considerable overlap in the activities queried in these two sources of data; the most significant difference is that the ESS asks about wearing a campaign badge and the EVS does not."
"10","To examine the impact of female politicians on political activity among adolescents in the CES, we employ a set of items in which respondents were asked, “When you are an adult, what do you expect that you will do?” followed by a list of activities that includes join a political party, write letters to a newspaper about social or political concerns, and be a candidate for local or city office (minimum = 0, mean = 1.5, maximum = 4.44).10 While these are all conventional forms of political behavior and thus correspond to questions asked of adults in the EVS and ESS, it is nonetheless reasonable to ask whether questions regarding Anticipated Political Activity are a reliable guide to future activity. In the absence of longitudinal data, we are admittedly unable to determine if intentions to participate translate into actual behavior. While existing research indicates that young people who identify themselves as potential participants in the political sphere are more likely to develop into politically active adults (Campbell 2006), a more cautious interpretation of these questions is simply that they provide insight into adolescents' current state of mind: do they envision themselves as politically active (Youniss, McLellan, and Yates 1997)?            "
"11","For each dependent variable, we are interested in determining whether the presence of female political leaders affects women's and/or girls' political activity. Each model thus requires an independent variable reflecting the presence of female politicians within a given country, which we gauge by the percentage of women in each nation's lower legislative house (%Women) at the time the survey was conducted (IPU 2005). As the country's premier law‐making body, parliaments are the central political institutions of any ostensibly democratic nation‐state. While women may serve in powerful and influential positions behind the scenes, their presence as MPs indicates a public and visible face for female politicians.11 The countries in our three datasets reflect considerable variation in the presence of female MPs, ranging from just 6.3% in Turkey (in 1999) to 45.3% in Sweden (in 2004).            "
"12","Our focus on the percentage of women in the national legislature (collective representation), rather than on whether the legislator a respondent can participate in choosing is female (dyadic representation; see Weissberg 1978),12 distinguishes our work from most of the research on the role model effect in the United States (exceptions—work that examines the impact of descriptive collective representation—include Atkeson and Carrillo 2007; Schwindt‐Bayer and Mishler 2005). Our analysis also is somewhat distinct in focusing on the impact of female elected officeholders rather than candidates, although recent work has moved in that direction (Atkeson and Carrillo 2007; Schwindt‐Bayer and Mishler 2005; see Lawless 2004). A focus on representation by the collective body of elected leaders is particularly appropriate in the comparative context. Outside of the United States, multimember districts and party‐list voting mean that the direct relationship between citizens and an individual representative is comparatively obscured. Indeed, when the entire country is a single district (e.g., the Netherlands) the dyadic approach is simply not possible (Powell 2004). The candidate‐centered nature of U.S. elections means specific candidates are highly visible to American citizens in a way that is not replicated abroad, even in other nations with single‐member, first‐past‐the‐post electoral systems, such as the United Kingdom. A system employing party lists also makes it possible that female candidates are relegated to the bottom of parties' lists, as appears to have been the case in the past (Kittilson 2005).13 While certainly elections draw citizens' attention to the political sphere (thus highlighting the presence of female politicians), our point is simply that elections in the comparative context are less likely to highlight individual legislative candidates.            "
"13","In addition to the % Women MPs, we account for the respondent's sex (Female). We test whether women and girls are affected differently than men and boys with an interaction term between Female and % Women. A positive coefficient for this interaction would indicate that as the percentage of women in office rises, women's discussion and activity change relative to that of men. The inclusion of the interaction term means that % Women (without interaction) reflects the impact of women in office on men and boys.            "
"14","At the individual level, we control for a number of variables that have a plausible connection to political participation, and might differ by sex. In the adult surveys (EVS and ESS), these include Education level, employment status (Unemployed= 1), and whether the respondent is either Married or living in a committed relationship. We also control for Age since, as explained below, it is a variable of theoretical interest. In the CES, we control for two measures of adolescents' socioeconomic status and home environment: the number of Books at Home14 and the education level the respondent expects to achieve (Expected Education).            "
"15","It is critical to attend to the potential for a spurious correlation—that what appears to be an effect of the presence of female MPs may actually be the effect of a political or social context that facilitates both female representation and women's political activity. To this end, we control for a number of country‐level factors associated with the representation of women, and which also may be related to women's political participation. Most crucial are the cultural attitudes toward women and women's roles that characterize a society. Accordingly, we include a separate dummy for Scandinavian countries, which stand out as uniquely egalitarian in their gender norms (Paxton 1997; Paxton and Kunovich 2003). We employ a dichotomous variable for nations that were either part of the former Soviet Union, or within the Eastern Bloc. The number of years since female enfranchisement (Suffrage) gauges formal acceptance of female political roles and is a consistent predictor of women's representation (Kenworthy and Malami 1999; Reynolds 1999; but see Moore and Shackman 1996).15"
"16","We also include a direct measure of “gender ideology,” attitudes toward the role of women in society (Paxton and Kunovich 2003).16 In the ESS, an aggregate national mean for Gender Ideology is calculated from three questions that gauge attitudes toward gender equality, while in the EVS it is only possible to use a single question that asks whether men's jobs should take priority over women's when the economy is poor.17 In the CES, gender ideology is measured as a national mean of three gender role items that closely resemble those in the ESS.            "
"17","We measure the relative socioeconomic development of women using the United Nations' Gender‐Related Development Index (GRDI), which has been shown to predict the representation of women (Reynolds 1999) and also might be associated with female engagement with politics. We include the share of women in the labor force (Female Labor Force) to tap into the population from which women leaders are most likely to emerge and as an indicator of the social acceptability of women in nontraditional roles (see Kenworthy and Malami 1999; Moore and Shackman 1996; Oakes and Almquist 1993; Paxton 1991; Paxton and Kunovich 2003).18 We account for the possibility that some parties and ideologies may facilitate the representation of women (Caul 1999; Duverger 1955; Reynolds 1999; Rule 1987) and likewise encourage girls' political engagement by controlling for the proportion of the vote captured by left parties (% Left).19 We control for the general level of national affluence (Per Capita GDP). Finally, proportional representation is strongly associated with greater descriptive representation for women (Duverger 1955; Rule 1981, 1987, among many others). We thus employ a measure of the Electoral System provided by Kenworthy and Malami, a 3‐point ordinal scale in which nations are coded “2 if their electoral system uses proportional representation exclusively, 1 if it is a mixed system, and 0 if proportional representation is not used at all” (1999, 252).            "
"18","The nested structure of all three datasets—respondents sampled within nations—requires attention to the clustering of respondents within nations, which is a violation of the standard assumption for OLS regression that cases are fully independent from one another. In intuitive terms, the problem is that two respondents from, say, Sweden have more in common with one another than with two respondents from Spain. For the national variables this is true by definition, since national‐level variables are the same for every resident within a given country."
"19","To address this issue, we employ a hierarchical linear modeling, or HLM, approach, which accounts for the grouped nature of the data by modeling the intercept of the individual‐level equation as a function of the national‐level variables, and allowing the intercept to vary randomly across nations (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002).20 The interaction term, Female X % Women, which constitutes the test of our hypotheses, is known in HLM parlance as a cross‐level interaction because it models the relationship between variables at different levels of aggregation. It too is allowed to vary randomly by nation. Using the ESS and EVS equations as an example, the model can be formally expressed as:               "
"20","There are many country‐level variables that might plausibly confound the relationships we report. Accordingly, we have opted to err on the side of including a relatively large number of country‐level variables in the model, even though this presents a high statistical hurdle for any country‐level hypotheses, as the statistical power for level‐two variables is diminished. However, we stress that the results reported below are not dependent on the control variables included in the equations. The statistical relationships we report hold up for aggregate‐level bivariate regressions, as well as hierarchical linear models with varying blocs of country‐level variables. (Please consult the online appendix for the presentation of multiple specifications, including bivariate scatterplots.)"
"21"," Table 2 reports results for the models testing the discussion hypothesis, while the models in Table 3 test the role model hypothesis. Note that across all the datasets, the direction and significance of the national‐level variables vary widely, reflecting that they cover different, albeit partially overlapping, sets of nations, and that there are apparently not consistent relationships between national characteristics and individual‐level political involvement. The individual‐level controls generally perform as expected.         "
"22","Beginning with political discussion (Table 2), our attention centers on the interaction between Female and % Women. Among adults, women's propensity for political discussion does appear to rise as the percentage of female MPs increases (column 1; p < 0.01, two‐tailed).21 The presence of women in office has a positive impact on girls' frequency of political discussion with their friends (column 2; p < 0.05), but does not correlate with more discussion at home (the coefficient is positive, but fails to reach statistical significance; column 3).         "
"23"," Figures 2A and 2B display the substantive interpretation of the significant interaction term for adult women (EVS) and adolescent girls (CES). As is our standard practice, we display the statistically significant results graphically, with other variables held constant at their means, in order to make the interpretation of the interaction term transparent. In both datasets, males have a higher level of political discussion than females but they do not discuss politics more as the percentage of women in office increases (the main, uninteracted effect for % Women is not significant in either the EVS or CES models). Women and adolescent girls, however, do talk about politics more in nations with more women serving in elective office. Both figures show that while the gender gap in talking about politics does not disappear when moving between the minimum and maximum values for women in office, it does narrow. Specifically, in Figure 2A we see that females' political discussion rises 0.25 points on a 3‐point scale, while in Figure 2B it rises 0.4 standard deviations.         "

"25","                 Political Discussion with Friends, Civic Education Study (Adolescents)                      "
"26","Turning to political activity (Table 3), we find support across two datasets for the role model effect. Among adults in the EVS (column 1), the interaction between Female and % Women is positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01), while in the ESS (column 2), the interaction term is positive but fails to achieve statistical significance (p = 0.70).22 Results for adolescents (column 3) also indicate a positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01) relationship between Female X % Women and Anticipated Political Activity. Thus, across two of three datasets, the more female MPs, the more likely women and girls are to (intend to) engage in political activity.         "
"27","A possible, or partial, explanation for the nonsignificant findings in the ESS concerns the varied wording of the dependent variables across surveys. The ESS only asks about what respondents have actually done in the last 12 months. The EVS, on the other hand, inquires as to whether respondents have ever participated (a longer time horizon) and perhaps more importantly, whether they expect to participate in the future. The CES, of course, also asks girls what they intend to do in the future. Thus, the EVS and CES (where we find a significant effect for female MPs) capture not only actual political activity (in the case of the EVS), but also the impact of female MPs on whether women and girls envision themselves as politically active citizens in the future. By including the impact of female MPs on women's and girls' conceptions of themselves as politically active, rather than their actual behavior, a significant finding may be more likely. However, running a model in the EVS with a dependent variable that is an additive index of activities respondents report having done (with intended activity coded as 0) produces unchanged results; that is, the presence of female MPs exhibits a statistically significant effect even when we limit the dependent variable to only activities done, and do not include what those respondents plan to do. (See the online appendix for more details.)         "
"28"," Figures 3A and 3B graph the role model effect among adults (EVS) and adolescents (CES). As the percentage of female MPs increases, there is a corresponding increase in women's political activity (Figure 3A) of roughly a fifth of a standard deviation—a moderately sized impact. Even at the maximum number of women in office, women's involvement continues to lag behind that of men, but the gap is considerably narrower. Note that the line for men is statistically insignificant, as can be inferred from the insignificant coefficient for % Women. Among adolescents (Figure 3B), we observe a line for males that slopes upward and is marginally significant (p < 0.15), and an upward‐sloping—but steeper—line for females that is clearly significant (p < 0.01). The magnitude of the impact is 0.6 standard deviations. Perhaps more importantly, the net effect is that adolescent girls close the gender gap in anticipated activity as the percentage of women in office increases, matching and even slightly exceeding boys when women comprise roughly 33% (approximately the 75th percentile) of the national legislature.

"30","                 Anticipated Political Activity, Civic Education Study (Adolescents)                      "
"31","As the percentage of women in office increases, our results are suggestive that boys are more likely to express an intention to be active in politics. The results are more definitive that girls' anticipated political activity rises. The steeper slope for girls indicates that they are especially receptive to female role models, but the upward‐sloping line for boys intriguingly suggests that political systems with greater female involvement are perceived as more open and accepting for all—males as well as females (for a similar finding regarding the effect of role models on women's and men's confidence in the legislature, see Schwindt‐Bayer and Mishler 2005).         "
"32","Testing the socialization hypothesis requires data from both young and old cohorts. The CES cannot speak to this question since all of the respondents are of roughly the same age, although our finding of a strong role model effect among adolescents in the CES is consistent with—even a necessary condition for—the socialization hypothesis. The EVS and ESS, however, do include a range of ages among their respondents and thus provide an opportunity to evaluate the socialization hypothesis directly. To do so, we estimate a second set of ESS and EVS models in which Age is interacted with both the respondent's sex and the percentage of female MPs: Age X Female X % Women. A negative coefficient for this triple interaction term indicates that the role model effect lessens with age. Results for political discussion in the EVS and political activity in both the EVS and ESS are reported in Table 4.         "
"33","The socialization hypothesis is not supported for political discussion: the triple interaction term is clearly nonsignificant (column 1), although the double interaction remains significant (as it is in the baseline model). Thus, these results support the conclusion that all women, regardless of age, talk about politics more as the percentage of female MPs in their nation's lower house increases."
"34","The results for political activity, however, are consistent with the socialization hypothesis. In both adult datasets, the presence of female MPs has a significantly greater impact on the political activity of younger rather than older women; Age X Female X % Women is negative and statistically significant (p < 0.01) in both models (columns 2 and 3). The presence of the triple interaction testing for an age effect is not only itself significant in the ESS models, but its inclusion makes the double interaction (Female X % Women), which was nonsignificant in the baseline model, become significant (p < 0.01) as well. The fact that the triple interaction is significant in the ESS when Female X % Women was not significant in the baseline model underscores the importance of differentiating the role model effect by age lest we reach the (false) conclusion that female MPs fail to affect the political activity of women.23 Examining the role model effect among all women may mask the impact of female MPs if that impact is found mostly, or even only, among the young.24"
"35","The interpretation of interaction terms rests on simultaneously accounting for multiple coefficients, some of which have opposite signs, and thus can be complex. To simplify the presentation, Figure 4A and 4B provide a graphical display of the socialization effect, again holding all control variables at their means. For simplicity's sake, we have opted to show only two lines on each graph. Each line represents how variation in the percentage of women in office affects the political activity of females who are 20 and 60 years old, respectively.25 The results from the EVS (4A) reveal a line sloping slightly downward for 60‐year‐olds but a sharply upward‐sloping line for 20‐year‐olds. Consequently, in nations with a low percentage of women in office, there is little difference in the political activity of 20‐ and 60‐year‐old women. As the percentage of women in office rises, the gap between the lines widens—younger women become more politically active than their elders by about a quarter of a standard deviation. In Figure 4B (ESS), the slope of the line for 60‐year‐olds is essentially flat, but the slope for younger women is sharply positive—increasing by 0.25 standard deviations. In this case, young women express a greater willingness to be politically active than do older women when the percentage of female MPs exceeds about 20% (roughly the mean).         "

"37","                 Political Activity and Age, European Social Survey                      "
"38","We have found that the socialization hypothesis holds for political activity, but not discussion. One possible explanation is that these divergent findings may be consistent with the rationale underlying the socialization hypothesis: a less demanding activity, such as partaking in political discussion as part of daily life, is more easily stimulated among all women by the presence of female MPs. Propensity toward a more demanding activity, such as engaging in political activity beyond conversation by signing a petition, joining a political party, or volunteering for a local organization, may be especially difficult to stimulate (or discourage) among older citizens whose habits are established, but still open to being shaped by political context among the young. In other words, discussion demands less effort or change in behavior, and thus may be more malleable at every age. Activity, on the other hand, requires greater commitment and behavior alteration, and thus may be less malleable as citizens age. Perhaps this is why previous research, which has not accounted for age differences, has been more likely to find a role model effect for psychological engagement than political activity. Future research into the impact of descriptive representation on political participation should account for the possibility that the effects might differ by age."
"39","We also note that the evidence favoring the socialization hypothesis addresses, at least partially, the concern that we have reversed the direction of the causal relationship between the percentage of women in office and the political activity of women. Perhaps there are more female members of parliament within a nation because women are more politically active, and not the other way around. While this is a plausible hypothesis, it is far less plausible that there are more women in office because only young women are more politically engaged, especially since the young have generally lower rates of political participation.         "
"40","A number of normative theorists have proposed—and hoped—that greater numbers of women in political office will have many positive effects: compensate for past and present injustice, provide a voice for overlooked interests, and contribute to the overall legitimacy of a democratic system (Phillips 1995; also Dovi 2002; Mansbridge 1999). Many related expectations, such as the prediction that female legislators will place issues of interest to women on the agenda and support policies that benefit women, have received strong empirical support (Lijphart 1991; Schwindt‐Bayer and Mishler 2005; see Reingold). Scholars and advocates also have expected that female descriptive representatives would affect other women's engagement with and participation in the political sphere (e.g., Burns, Schlozman, and Verba 2001; Carroll 1985; Dovi 2002; Kittilson 2005), but there have been few tests of these effects outside of the United States. The only large‐N cross‐national research of which we are aware demonstrates that the presence of female MPs is associated with increased confidence in the legislature among both women and men (Schwindt‐Bayer and Mishler 2006); our research is thus the first attempt to date to examine the impact of female descriptive representation around the world on women's actual political activity, rather than on political attitudes or engagement.         "
"41","Our analysis speaks to the representation literature by suggesting that, as exemplars of the possibility and potential of female political activism, female politicians in democratic nations do function as true role models, inspiring women and girls to be politically active themselves. Women of all ages are more likely to discuss politics, and younger women become more politically active, when there are more women in parliament. The findings regarding young women also contribute to the revival of research into political socialization, particularly in the comparative context where it has been long neglected (Sapiro 2004, 5). Future research can, and should, test whether such effects persist—do young women who are in nations with a large number of women politicians remain highly participatory as they age?         "
"42","Evidence favoring the role model effect has normative implications, given continuing sex disparities in political engagement—in general and among young people in particular. In 11 of 20 countries in the Civic Education Study (see Figure 1B), girls are significantly less likely than boys to report that they envision themselves as politically active adults. In only two countries—Finland and the United States—are girls significantly more interested in political activity than are boys. Given that participatory habits develop in adolescence and largely persist throughout one's life (Franklin 2004; Plutzer 2002), there is good reason to believe that gaps in anticipated involvement among adolescents develop into gaps in actual engagement among adults, as correspondence between the female‐male differences in Figures 1B (adolescents) and 1A (adults) suggest. Women thus risk not having their voices heard, or not heard as loudly, as men's in their nation's democratic processes. However, our analysis should leave advocates of gender equality hopeful, as these results suggest that the gender gap in political involvement can be ameliorated. Where there are female role models in political life, adolescent girls and young women in particular are more likely to envision themselves as active participants in politics, raising hopes for greater gender equality in the future. Women, it appears, lead by example.         "
