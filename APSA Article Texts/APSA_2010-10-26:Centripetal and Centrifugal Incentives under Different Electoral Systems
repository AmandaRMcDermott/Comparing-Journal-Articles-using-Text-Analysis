"1","In the last 10 years, considerable effort has been made to integrate empirical and formal models of political processes. Attempts to test microfoundational theories of where parties locate in policy space—given constraints imposed by their competitors and by the electorate—have been particularly fruitful (Adams, Merrill, and Grofman 2005; Kedar 2005; Schofield and Sened 2006). A prime example here is Adams, Merrill, and Grofman's (AMG) Unified Theory of Party Competition (2005) where the authors use survey data to estimate individual respondents’ vote choice and then analytically derive each party's strategy. Their model uses an elegant conditional logit design to estimate the main choice parameters—policy positions and nonpolicy salience—which are then entered into an algorithm that computes equilibrium locations.         "
"2","AMG's objective is to integrate spatial models of party competition with behavioral models of the vote. To AMG, parties’ equilibrium positions in policy space are predicted to vary as a function of nonpolicy, or valence, considerations. As the authors recognize, however, their novel modeling strategy can be extended to a range of applications, from purely descriptive estimation of equilibrium strategies to more sophisticated applications.2"
"3"," AMG single out electoral rules as a “potentially complicating” factor that might have implications for the validity of their unified model. In particular, they maintain that “a complete understanding of parties’ or candidates’ policy proposals in historical elections…must move beyond an exclusive focus on vote maximization to encompass…the electoral laws in effect in the real‐world election of interest” (2005, 71).         "
"4","In this article, we address the effect of electoral rules explicitly, modifying the voters’ utility function to include preferences about the future allocation of seats. We begin with a utility function that incorporates the expected distribution of seats into the voter's utility preference and then allows the equilibrium location of parties to be updated in response to the voter's utilities.3 We then implement the proposed design by applying the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) engine in WinBUGS 1.4 (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003) in a novel way, setting the model to follow a random walk over the equilibrium space of parties.         "
"5","We begin, as do Adams, Merrill, and Grofman (2005), with a specification of the voter's utility where each voter's probability of voting for party k has both proximity and nonproximity components:               "
"6","There are a number of alternative specifications for Uik that may be used in place of the utility model defined in (1), including a valence model (Schofield and Sened 2006), a policy preference model (Kedar 2005), and a policy discounting model (Adams et al. 2005), among others. For our purpose, we modify the utility function of voters to describe the utility attached to the prior policy performance of the party (valence, as shown in equation 1). Key to our inquiry, however, is to consider the utility attached to voting for a party given expectations over the transmission of votes into representation in government (seats). To do so, the model reported in equation (1) can be reexpressed as               "
"7","To illustrate, imagine there are three parties, A, B, and C, competing under simple plurality rule, with A and B on the left of a unidimensional policy continuum, and C on the right. Further imagine that the ideal point of voter i is on the left and equidistant from Parties A and B. Moreover, the expected vote shares reported by the media show Party A gathering only 20% of the vote while Parties B and C are expected to receive close to 40% of the vote. If a voter's utility is a function of the electoral performance of a party, voter i should prefer to cast a vote for Party B, which has greater chances of defeating Party C. This example describes the underlying logic of Duverger's well‐known psychological effect, where the distance between seats and votes is strictly a function of the mechanical effect of the electoral rules, but a reduction in the number of parties is influenced by the weight the voter attaches to such difference, as captured by the psychological effect parameter, β2. By weighing the salience of electoral rules as they affect the utility attached to a party, β2 captures the essence of the psychological effect as it pertains to “the shaping of party and voter strategies in anticipation of the electoral function's mechanical constraints” (Benoit 2002, 36, emphasis added).            "
"8","A fundamental problem in estimating the utility model just described, however, is that the expected seats won by a party are not independent from the parties’ policy choices (equilibrium locations). Because of this, voters anticipate the future distribution of seats and votes rather than observing its actual realization. Such anticipations have been a recurring issue confronting research on electoral rules.5 Our approach to this issue is to model it analytically using an estimation procedure to approximate the voter's decision problem by iteratively updating the expected difference between seats and votes into the equilibrium model, . Expected seat‐vote differences are anticipated by voters and parties, leading to strategic voting on the part of voters and, it follows, to new equilibrium adjustments by parties (Alvarez and Nagler 2000; Bawn 1999; Benoit, Giannetti, and Laver 2006; Cox 1997; Duverger 1954).            "
"9","In the next section, we describe how we estimate the weight parameters of equation (3). The values of the parameters of interest—α, β1, β2—can be estimated from survey data using maximum likelihood estimation. Our chief interest, however, is to provide a more general test of the relationship between electoral rules and equilibrium locations. Accordingly, we now describe the general algorithm used to estimate the salience assigned to the third term in equation (3), the seat‐vote differential.            "
"10","A major contribution of this article is to allow voters to update the expected vote and seat shares of each party. In turn, we can use this information to retrieve the equilibrium location of parties. The expected votes for each party, consequently, inform the updating process and have associated expectations about their future seat shares."
"11","Characterizing an electoral system involves an almost infinite combination of rules and procedures, involving variations in district magnitude, the number of votes, formulae for transmitting votes to seats, and so on. Almost all the important features of an electoral system, however, can be summarized with two parameters: ρ, which describes the overall majoritarian properties6 of electoral rules, and βk, k= (1,2, … K). Majoritarian biases describe the extra seats that a party obtains by virtue of winning more votes than other parties in the race. Such biases reward or penalize a party strictly as a function of their relative vote share.7"
"12","Early work by Laakso (1979), Taagepera (1986), Grofman (1983), and King (1990) provides the backbone of current seat‐vote models, whose mechanical properties are well known. For our purposes, we begin with a multinomial design that allocates seats to multiple parties using a simplified multinomial design proposed by King (1990) of the form               "
"13"," Equation (5) allows us to estimate changes in the equilibrium location of parties that are function of majoritarian parameter ρ. We can now model the mechanical effect into the voters’ utility function in equation (3). As noted, ρ explains the majoritarian pull of the electoral rules (mechanical effect), whereas β2 describes how much voters care about strategic incentives (psychological effect). Finally, since electoral rules are set exogenously to the voter's utility, note that we do not require any instrumental variable to model their effects (cf. Ordeshook and Shvetzova 1994).            "
"14","Having presented our model of voter utility, we now provide an algorithm to estimate the equilibrium location of parties as we change the mechanical properties of the electoral rules."
"15"," Adams, Merrill, and Grofman (2005) show that the random utility model in equations (1) and (2) can be used to search for the equilibrium location; that is, the combination of strategies used such that party k will not unilaterally increase its vote share by choosing a different policy location. Starting with the model in (5), the expected vote share for party k is               "
"16","By iteratively solving for each party's preferred location, max (Lk), AMG provides an algorithm to find each party's equilibrium. They also provide a proof of the conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria for each party k.8"
"17","Notice that estimating the equilibrium strategy of party k does not require information about the actual vote choice of the respondents as in equation (2). The algorithm also has no stochastic component and mechanically updates the spatial location of each party in response to changes in the location of all other parties, with fixed proximity and nonproximity parameters α and β1,2. While Lk appears “implicitly in both sides of [equation (7)], we may use [equation (7)] as the basis of an iterative algorithm” (AMG 2005, 260). Because (7) is not a statistical model, all parameters of interest have to be fed into the algorithm, which AMG do using the maximum likelihood estimates from equation (1) and (2).            "
"18","We use WinBUGS 1.4.2 (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003) and R 2.8 to estimate the conditional choice models and to retrieve the equilibrium location of parties. This implementation provides some advantages, such as the possibility of estimating simultaneously the conditional logit model proposed by AMG, the equilibrium algorithm, and confidence intervals around the equilibrium estimates.            "
"19","To test for the effect of the electoral rules on the equilibrium location of parties, we examine postelection survey data collected by Module 2 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, which contains postelection surveys from elections occurring between 2001 and 2006 (CSES 2007). The model and the predictions it yields pertain to systems in which governments are formed as a result of party strength in national legislatures. We thus examine all parliamentary elections for which data are available from the CSES module: Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.9 These cases capture a wide range of electoral rules, from single‐member district plurality, to mixed designs, to various proportional formulae. The number of credible competitors on the national stage also varies widely, from three in Britain and Spain to nine in the Netherlands, for 79 parties in all (see supporting information). This variation is key: since the nonproportional properties of electoral rules become stronger as the effective number of parties gets larger (Calvo 2009), seat‐vote differences will be more pronounced for countries having many parties vying for seats in the legislature.         "
"20","Our strategy is to first estimate a model of voter choice and then use the initial parameter estimates to inform a series of simulations designed to assess the sensitivity of voter utility to changes in the electoral rules. As per equation (3), the analyses pool individual‐level measures of vote choice, ideological proximity, and performance assessment with information about the differences between all parties’ seat‐vote shares. The dependent variable is the respondent's self‐reported party vote. Independent variables include self‐reported ideological location of the voter, xi, the reported location of each party, Lk, valence variables describing other nonpolicy factors, Tik, and an aggregate variable measuring the difference between the seats and votes of each party k, (Sk−Vk). To estimate the ideological proximity of voters to parties, (xi−Lk), we take advantage of the CSES survey design, which asks respondents to provide a location for themselves and each party on a left‐right ideological scale from 0 to 10. To measure nonpolicy factors, Tik, we use 10‐point thermometer scales for each party.10"
"21","Following AMG (2005), we estimate the vote choice model using conditional logit (CL). Table 1 reports the results, first with a model which pools the 79 parties and then disaggregated by country. Results of the pooled model show that each of the parameters of interest—the ideological proximity parameter (standard in spatial models), the valence parameter, and the majoritarian bias parameter—are estimated precisely and signed in the expected directions. The proximity weight (α) is negative, indicating that the utility of selecting party k increases as the distance between the voter and the party's placement becomes smaller. The valence weight (β1) is positive, indicating that parties that receive higher performance marks by voters also win more votes. And the seats‐votes weight (β2) is also positive, conveying that voters prefer to vote for winning parties which receive more seats than votes. In summary, voters prefer a party which is ideologically closer, has a valence advantage, and is projected to benefit from the country's electoral rules.         "
"22"," Table 1 also reports CL results disaggregated by country. The magnitude and sign attached to parameters is generally similar across the country surveys. In all instances parameters are signed in the expected directions, though in four cases estimates do not attain statistical significance (the proximity weight for Great Britain, Israel, and Sweden, and the seats‐votes weight for Denmark). Results from the pooled model provide strong support for the overall effect of electoral rules. We still present single‐country models to show the different effect across cases, which provide a range of feasible values for the simulations in the next section.11"
"23","The CL parameters provide us with starting points to map the effect of electoral rules on party equilibrium locations. We can now examine the sensitivity of the model to changes in the electoral rules, analyzing changes in the equilibrium location of parties and, by extension, on the parties’ electoral success. Our approach is to hold constant the weight that voters attach to the first two parameters of interest—ideology and valence—while varying the degree of majoritarian bias of the electoral rules as well as the weight voters attach to the seat‐vote differences. That is, we hold constant the first two terms of the utility function, −α (xi−Lk)2 and β1Tik, and let the two key parameters of the seat‐vote term, β2 and ρ, vary. This is done by allowing the algorithm described in equations (6) and (7) to map the location of parties at five different values of β2≡{0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0} and six different values of ρ≡{1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4}.12 We then gauge the effects of these parameters on parties’ equilibria and on expected vote shares (as depicted in equation 3) against a baseline provided by a restricted model with no seat‐vote effect (as in equation 1).         "
"24","For illustrative purposes we first demonstrate the basic properties of the model with results from the 2002 Swedish election. We then pool the equilibrium estimates for all 79 parties in the 13 elections across all values of β2 and ρ to measure the response to mechanical differences in the electoral rules.         "
"25","In the 2002 Swedish general election, votes were contested by six main political parties: the Left Party (with a position of 1.3 on the 0–10 left‐right scale), the Social Democrats (3.5), the Center Party (5.7), the Liberal People's Party (6.5), the Christian Democrats (7.1), and the Moderates (8.9). These six parties obtained vote percentages in the election of 8.4, 39.9, 6.2, 13.4, 9.1, and 15.3%, respectively. How do electoral rules affect the positioning in policy space under the assumption of vote‐maximizing behavior? In turn, how do these positions affect party vote totals? We can address these questions by varying the mechanical properties of the electoral rules to examine how seats‐votes differentials matter for the parties’ positions and vote shares."
"26","First, we consider how less permissive electoral rules affect the Nash location of each party. Figure 1 displays model results for each of the six Swedish parties. Solid lines describe party equilibrium strategies under strictly proportional rules (ρ= 1). Dashed lines describe party equilibrium strategies under plurality‐like rules (ρ= 3). To facilitate comparison, the weight voters accord to the seats‐votes differences, β2 (the psychological effect), is fixed at 0.6.13 Differences between the posterior distributions of both specifications thus capture the effect of electoral rules for party equilibrium locations.            "
"27","                 Equilibrium Location of Parties in 2002 Swedish Election                         "
"28"," Note: Figures report the posterior probability distributions as located along the 0–10 left‐right scale as described in the text. Distributions displayed with a solid line describe party equilibrium strategies based on a model of voter utility with ρ= 1 (see equation 5). Dashed line distributions describe party equilibrium strategies for ρ= 3. For both cases, α is set to −.05, β1 to 1.0, and β2 to 0.6.                        "
"29","The solid lines show that under proportional rules, the Left Party and the Social Democrats have well‐defined equilibrium locations to the left of the political spectrum (less than 5 on the 0–10‐point scale), while the Center Party, the Liberal People's Party, the Christian Democrats, and the Moderates—all members of the 1991–94 and 2006–present coalition governments—have equilibrium locations to the right of center. Electoral system effects on these Nash positions can be observed by comparing the solid lines (ρ= 1) to the posterior distributions reported by the dashed lines (ρ= 3). These movements capture the effect of imposing majoritarian biases on parties and voters. Results show that, with the important exception of the Social Democrats, this manipulation of electoral rules induces centrifugal effects: the vote‐maximizing prescription for the Left Party is to become more extreme on the left side of the policy spectrum, while conservative parties move further to the right. Cox's (1990) Downsian claim that majoritarian rules exert centripetal incentives is supported for only one—and by far the largest—of the six parties, the Social Democrats.            "
"30"," Figure 2 plots the mean equilibrium location of each party with the ideological distribution of voters on the left‐right dimension. Here, we again see that the position‐taking incentives provided by electoral rules are party‐specific. A shift from ρ= 1 to ρ= 3 yields moderation for the Social Democrats but extremism for the smaller parties. Figure 2 shows the effect of electoral rules on party electoral success, as expressed by expected vote share and shown on the y‐axis. Again, the effects are party‐specific. A change from proportional to majoritarian rules is estimated to increase vote share for the largest party in the system, the Social Democrats, by about 8% (compare height of solid and dashed lines). All other parties, however, lose votes when the system becomes less proportional. That is, consistent with our model's predictions, the mechanical rules induce more voters to choose the Social Democrats, giving this party a larger seat premium.            "

"32"," Note: Equilibrium location of parties along the left‐right scale in the 2002 Swedish election if ρ= 1 (solid line) and if ρ= 3 (dashed line). For both cases, α is set to −.05, β1 to 1.0, and β2 to 0.6. Height of vertical lines describes the share of votes obtained by each party at their equilibrium location. The grey line displays distribution of the voters.                        "
"33","Evidence reported for party competitors in the 2002 Swedish election suggests that nonproportional rules generate centripetal incentives for large parties (the Social Democrats) and centrifugal incentives for smaller parties (all others, none receiving more than 16% of the vote). We now report results using the full set of 2,370 observations, first looking at party locations and then party vote shares.14"
"34"," Figure 3 offers a visual comparison of the equilibrium locations of all parties as the electoral rules display larger majoritarian biases. The horizontal axis displays baseline equilibrium locations in a strictly proportional system, when . This model estimates only the effect of the proximity and valence components of the vote choice, as in AMG's (2005) workhorse model described in equation (1). Equilibrium positions charted on the horizontal axis are produced from a model which incorporates information about the seat premium resulting from the use of different electoral rules, including all observations where . The diagonal line thus represents no change in party equilibrium positions after accounting for electoral rules. In Figure 3, parties are characterized as either favorably biased or unfavorably biased in seats.            "

"36"," Note: The horizontal axis reports party equilibrium locations produced by applying equation (1) and solving for Lk as described in the second section of the text and equations (6) and (7). The vertical axis reports party equilibrium locations produced by applying equation (5) and proceeding as above to estimate equilibrium positions.                        "
"37","The results are consistent: those parties which are favorably biased in seats have incentives to cluster in the center of the policy continuum. That is, parties with positive seat premiums () have centripetal incentives. This is just as previous research suggests, and the Swedish Social Democrats serve as a good example. Most parties, however, tend to be biased against in terms of seats and votes. Majoritarian biases mean the party receives fewer seats in the assembly than it would if rules were strictly proportional. For these parties, the reductive effects of majoritarian rules exert centrifugal pressures, pushing them to the extremes.            "
"38"," Figure 4 uses the same information as in Figure 3 but displays separate estimates for each country.15 Horizontal axes report the difference in party seat share and vote share as we vary the majoritarian bias parameter such that higher values indicate greater seat premiums. Vertical axes display the party's difference in Nash locations based on a utility model without consideration of seats and votes (β2= 0 in equation 5) compared to one which includes a seats‐votes component (β2 > 0). On the vertical axes all position differences are standardized so that, regardless of whether a given party is located on the left or right, positive values connote centrifugal movements and negative values indicate centripetal movements.

For presentation, one of the 13 countries (New Zealand) is not shown.                        "
"41"," Figure 4 graphs provide a picture for all cases analyzed consistent with that shown for Sweden. As majoritarian biases favoring party k increase, k displays stronger incentives to move toward the median voter in the sample.16 In the Swedish example, we saw that one of six parties fits this scenario. Overall, one‐third (33%) of our observations exhibit center‐clustering tendencies. Of these, the simulations show that a change in electoral rules would have the strongest center‐clustering pressure on the Norwegian Conservatives, with a difference in equilibrium location of 1.0 points along the 11‐point left‐right scale (for ρ= 3.5 and β2= 1). However, the remaining two‐thirds of the party observations face unfavorable seats‐votes differential. As shown in the southwest quadrants of the graphs, nonproportional rules produce centrifugal incentives for these parties.17 The strongest such incentive is for the Danish Christian People's Party (a centrifugal shift of .63 when ρ= 4 and β2= 1).            "
"42","As with the Swedish example, pooled analyses reported above showed that majoritarian biases “crowd out” smaller parties and cause them to move to more extreme policy locations. Moreover, as Figure 2 showed, the voter's decision to incorporate electoral rules in her utility function reduces the expected vote share for smaller parties. The implications of our analyses in terms of vote shares are shown in Figure 5 for the pooled sample. The figure plots estimated party vote shares from the baseline model (equation 1, horizontal axis) and the seats‐votes augmented model (equation 5, vertical axis). Parties located on the diagonal are those for which electoral rules produce no change in their vote totals.18 Parties located below and to the right of the diagonal experience a decline in vote shares. In the absence of partisan bias, this sample includes only smaller parties. Parties located above and to the left of the line gain in votes, such as the Swedish Social Democrats, Dutch Christian Democrats, or British Labour, which frequently head up governments.            "

"45","Finally, Figure 6 plots the parties’ seat‐vote differentials (produced as in Figure 4) against their difference in expected vote shares attributed to including the seats‐votes parameter in the voter's utility function. Results are displayed by country. Differences in vote probabilities are compared to the gain or loss incurred by considering the effect of electoral rules on party electoral success. Values greater than zero along the vertical axis indicate that majoritarian bias increases party electoral success while values less than zero mean a loss of vote shares. Again we see that electoral rules affect different parties differently. The story is one of asymmetric gains: a minority of the party cases gains votes—and gains considerably, upwards of 15%. The majority of party competitors, however, would be harmed by a majoritarian electoral reform. For most cases, however, the model predicts this loss to be on the order of fewer than five percentage points.            "
"46","                 Seats‐Votes Differences and Party‐Expected Vote Shares Compared                         "
"47"," Note: The horizontal axis reports the difference in seat share and vote share received by the party where higher values indicate greater seat premiums. The vertical axis reports the party's difference in expected vote probabilities based on a utility model without consideration of seats and votes (equation 1) compared to one with seats and votes considerations (equation 5). For presentation, one of the 13 countries (New Zealand) is not shown.                        "
"48"," Figure 6 displays the relationship between majoritarian bias and the absolute vote shares received by each party such that parties lying above (below) 0 on the vertical axis are absolutely advantaged (disadvantaged) by nonproportional rules. An alternative approach would be to examine the relationship between electoral rules and parties’ relative gains. It is plausible that a party gains votes under nonproportional rules but does not gain to the same degree as another party in the election. Such a party would be absolutely advantaged but relatively disadvantaged. Indeed, additional results, included as part of the Supporting Information to this article, show that in a small minority of cases (81 of 2,370 observations, or 3.4%), majoritarian rules cause some parties to fall into this category.19"
"49","We have shown that electoral rules that reward large parties also drive them to take more moderate positions. Conversely, smaller parties typically see their vote share decline and are pushed toward more extreme equilibrium positions. For further insight, we can perform multivariate analysis on the simulated data to isolate the contributions of the mechanical and psychological effects. We first examine shifts in party Nash positions as produced by taking electoral rules into account (equation 5) relative to not doing so (equation 1). As per the previous section, we expect that party incentives to cluster in the center in search of votes will become greater as majoritarian biases increase (that is, as ρ increases) and as the voter's psychological anticipation of this effect gets stronger (as β2 increases). Centripetal tendencies will not be uniform, however. The effects should work in the opposite direction for adversely biased parties—such parties should move toward the extremes.            "
"50","Model 1 in Table 2 tests this prediction. The dependent variable is the difference in party Nash locations, ΔNash, coded so higher values indicate centripetal movements. This measure is regressed on the mechanical for (ρ) and psychological (β2) parameters of electoral rules, their interaction with a dummy variable scoring 1 for biased‐against parties and 0 for favorably biased parties, and a control for the initial effective number of competing parties (ENCP) as produced by equation (1).20 Results show estimates for ρ and β2 are positive and statistically significant, meaning that nonproportional rules provide center‐clustering incentives. The interactive term, however, shows these parameters only affect parties which are favorably biased in terms of seats and votes. Most parties (80% in our sample) are biased against in seats. For these parties, increases in the mechanical and psychological properties of majoritarian rules produce centrifugal effects. Specifically, for biased‐against parties the coefficients on ρ and β2 are −0.03 and −0.22, respectively.21 For biased‐against parties, increases in the mechanical majoritarian properties of the electoral system leads to small but statistically significant centrifugal movement. Increase in the psychological majoritarian properties of the electoral system also creates incentives for dispersion for the small biased‐against parties.22"
"51","The second model in Table 2 assesses the reductive effect of majoritarian biases for party systems, isolating the impact exerted by mechanical and psychological factors as posited by Duverger. The dependent variable is the ENCP as calculated for each observation in the data using the vote shares for each party produced from applying the analytic model to equation (5). Results of the regression analysis show, as Duverger proposed, that this reductive effect works through both the mechanical effect of electoral rules and, by way of voter anticipation of this effect, through the psychological effect. Further, the reduction in the number of competing parties is attributable to declines in votes received for both large (favorably biased) and small (biased‐against) parties. Calculation of conditional effects shows that the influence of the latter on the party system is somewhat larger.23 This variation squares with intuition: large mainstream parties are less likely to be susceptible to changes in electoral rules than the smaller parties.            "
"52","Researchers have done much to specify how and under what conditions electoral rules matter for party position taking. Deservedly influential is Cox (1990), where he formally derives an exhaustive set of predictions for the conditions under which parties converge in policy space under a set of factors characterizing a given electoral system. Following Downs and Cox, theoretic work to date has focused on institutional incentives while treating all party actors similarly. In this article, we build on recent work on spatial models, and formally account for the effect of electoral rules on vote choice, party competition, and the policy preferences of different types of parties.         "
"53","At the heart of our story lies the relationship between electoral rules and vote choice in competitive elections. Strategic voting influences party platforms, generating simultaneously centripetal and centrifugal tendencies, based on the party's particular characteristics.24 The voter utility function developed here, which accounts for the seat‐vote properties of electoral rules, allows us to model the strategic behavior of voters. More importantly, our results provide evidence supporting a centripetal effect of plurality‐like electoral rules on favorably biased parties, e.g., parties positively biased in seats by the electoral rules. By contrast, nonproportional rules crowd out smaller parties into more extreme policy positions, as voters defect from parties that expect fewer seats than their vote share.         "
"54","These findings have several implications. For one, the insight that different parties have different incentives clarifies anomalous findings in recent research on the behavioral consequences of electoral rules. For example, Blais and Bodet (2006, 1250–55) find that proportional rules produce less centrist parties and a greater diversity of policy positions, an empirical finding which is consistent with Cox's 1990 predictions that parties tend toward the extremes under proportional rules. However, using different data, Ezrow (2008) finds no evidence that the system's “average party policy extremism” is affected by electoral rules: PR systems are no more likely to exhibit high levels of party policy dispersion than countries selecting members to the assembly with simple plurality rule. Others have suggested that the answer to the absence of this relationship can be found by examining nonpolicy, or “valence,” considerations (Erikson and Romero 1990; Schofield and Sened 2006) or by considering the role of party activists (Aldrich 1983).         "
"55","Our research, however, implies that the heterogeneous effects of mechanical and psychological rules at the individual party level ought to cancel out any observed aggregate‐level relationship between the electoral system and party equilibrium locations. Future research should aim to disentangle the relative importance of valence, competence, proximity, the electoral environment, and other factors on the policy strategies of competing parties.         "
"56","Second, our findings are relevant to recent interest in how small parties shape the overall policy space of political competition. Adams and Merrill (2006), for example, show that the centrist strategies of third parties are not just of passing interest but have implications for the positions taken by the main parties, moving them to the extremes. Meguid (2008) also assigns a key role to small parties. An implication of these studies is that all party competitors can sway election results and, in turn, where parties choose to locate on policy. As with these studies, our findings highlight points of difference (heterogeneity) across party competitors. However, rather than arguing that party strategies are due to party system effects, our account differs from other entrants in this research agenda by showing how the directions and opportunities for party policy shifts depend in part on the electoral system. Competitor behavior matters for explaining policy shifts (Adams and Somer‐Topcu forthcoming); our work, however, shows that the degree to which this matters is a function of the rules of the electoral game.         "
"57","Finally, our model of voter utility and the party Nash equilibria it produces offer a new means for isolating the mechanical and psychological processes through which electoral rules shape party competition. While the effects of formal institutions on party systems are widely recognized, political scientists too often have placed the mechanism connecting rules to outcomes in a black box. Many recognize, however, that “the operation of electoral systems on the number of parties winning seats operates twice, both on the conversion of votes to seats but also on the composition of votes itself” (Benoit 2002, 44). By proposing a means to isolate these effects within the voter's utility function, we offer a way to connect this fundamental insight into our empirical models.         "
