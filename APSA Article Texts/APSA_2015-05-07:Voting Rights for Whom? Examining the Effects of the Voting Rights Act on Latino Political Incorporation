"1","The Voting Rights Act passed with strong bipartisan support and was signed into law on August 6, 1965. Despite the 2013 Supreme Court decision ruling that the coverage formula in Section 4 of the act was unconstitutional, the VRA is considered by many to be the most successful civil rights law in American history. In addition to codifying and effectuating the 15th Amendment's permanent guarantee that no person shall be denied the right to vote based on race or color, the VRA imposed more stringent requirements in certain jurisdictions. Two of these were the language assistance provisions of Sections 203 and 4(f)(4). Enacted in 1975 (and reauthorized in 1982, 1992, and 2006), these provisions address discrimination against language minorities. While the provisions initially focused on protecting Spanish‐language minorities in Texas who had a well‐documented history of discrimination in voting and education, Congress eventually expanded coverage to American Indians, Asian Americans, and Alaskan Natives based on evidence of widespread discrimination against these groups (Tucker and Espino 2007).         "
"2","Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) require language assistance for targeted language groups in certain jurisdictions during the election process so that all citizens have equal opportunities to register and cast free and effective ballots. Assistance includes providing registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, ballots, or other materials relating to the electoral process in the language of the applicable minority group as well as in English. In other words, all election information that is available in English must also be available in the minority language (U.S. Department of Justice 2008). Criteria for coverage under Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) are similar (see Table 1). However, for Section 4(f)(4), the criteria were fixed and based on conditions present in 1972, whereas for Section 203, criteria are reevaluated after each decennial census.         "
"3","                              "
"4","                              "
"5","From 1975 until the Supreme Court's Shelby County v. Holder decision in 2013, three states (Alaska, Arizona, and Texas) and 19 jurisdictions in six other states were covered under Section 4(f)(4) (Tucker 2009, 74–75).1 As of 2011, there were 248 jurisdictions covered by Section 203 (213 counties are covered for Spanish heritage, or those minority groups that speak Spanish). Statewide coverage of specific language groups is also permissible under Section 203, and in 2011, three states (California, Florida, and Texas) were covered for Spanish. In this case, however, only the 5% trigger is used to determine coverage, and implementation takes a different meaning.2 Further, it is possible for jurisdictions to be covered under both of the language assistance provisions. For example, in 2011, there were 100 counties doubly covered, and these represented 35% of all counties covered under Section 4(f)(4) and 46% of all counties represented under Section 203 (see also Lien et al. 2007).         "
"6","Before surveying the evidence linking the VRA's language assistance provisions to Latino representation in politics, it is worthwhile to consider a few of the features of Latino office holding in the United States. For starters, the number of Latino elected officials has nearly doubled between 1984, the first year for which systematic data were collected, and 2012, increasing from some 3,130 officials to about 5,930 (NALEO 1984, 2012). Second, Latino elected officials have and continue to be most prevalent at the local level. For example, in 1984, more than three‐quarters of all Latino elected officials held municipal or school district positions, with local school board members representing the largest share (44%). Though the share of Latinos in local elected offices had fallen slightly by 2012 (67%), Latino office holding remains a mostly local phenomenon. Third, the bulk of Latino elected officials comes from a small number of states, mostly located in the southwestern part of the United States where the Latino population is most concentrated. For instance, Texas was home to over 1,000 elected Latino school board members in 2012 and California had nearly 700.            "
"7","While it is evident that Latino representation has expanded over time, it is not clear whether or how language provision policies are causally linked to representation. Systematic studies of the relationship between Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) and Latino representation are in short supply, but evidence and data linking language assistance coverage to greater Latino electoral participation do exist. One set of empirical studies employs survey data to test for the effects of Spanish‐language ballots and registration material on voter registration and turnout for Latino and limited‐English‐proficient respondents. These studies rely on cross‐sectional analyses and focus on the effects of Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) in the mid‐2000s. Although they generally find no effect of language assistance provisions on turnout or voter registration for Latinos overall, they do find positive and significant effects for limited‐English‐proficient Latino voters (Hopkins 2011; Jones‐Correa 2005; Parkin and Zlotnick 2011, 2014). However, Parkin and Zlotnick (2014) did not find similar increases in voter registration among limited‐English‐proficient Latinos in covered versus noncovered jurisdictions, but instead found increases in voter registration only for Latinos who speak English “very well” (as measured by the National Latino Survey). Overall, findings from this relatively limited body of work suggest that at least for the mid‐2000s, the language assistance provisions of the VRA did have some of their intended effects, but that these effects were not the same for all groups or for Latinos with different levels of English‐language proficiency. It is worth noting, however, that these studies did not address the question of whether the language assistance provisions were fully implemented in the local jurisdiction included in the samples.            "
"8","In a second body of work that draws more heavily from case studies and qualitative evidence, the connection between increased voter turnout and more office holding among Latinos or Asian Americans in covered jurisdictions has been emphasized. In particular, during the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in 2006, social scientists and legal scholars compiled information and available data to document changes in the number of language minority citizens registering to vote, turning out to vote, and casting ballots for their preferred candidates (National Commission on the Voting Rights Act 2006). These reports, in conjunction with testimonies given during congressional hearings on H.R. 9, the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments of 2006, indicate that when local election officials complied with the requirements of Sections 203 and 4(f)(4), registration, turnout, and office holding among Latinos and Asian Americans increased, oftentimes substantially. While this evidence is more anecdotal in nature and therefore cannot be used to draw firm causal inferences, it nevertheless suggests that when covered jurisdictions followed the letter and spirit of the law, non‐English‐speaking U.S. citizens overcame the language barriers that had previously prevented their political participation.            "
"9","In oversight hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary, voting experts in jurisdictions covered by Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) provided evidence linking increases in Latino voter registration, turnout, and office holding to the enforcement actions brought by the Department of Justice (Committee on the Judiciary 2006). For example, Bradley Schlozman, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, argued that suits filed in Florida, California, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington had significantly narrowed gaps in electoral participation. As evidence, he cited a 24% increase in Latino voter registration in Yakima County, Washington, since the division's Section 203 lawsuit, and a 21% increase in San Diego County since the division's enforcement action there. According to Schlozman, “These language enforcement efforts have made a tremendous difference in enhancing minority representation in politically elected ranks” (U.S. Congress , 35).            "
"10","Together, this evidence indicates that the language assistance provisions of the VRA can play an important role in increasing political participation and representation among underrepresented groups. However, it appears that these effects are not automatic, sometimes vary by minority group (Lien et al. 2007), and oftentimes rely on election monitoring and other enforcement activity by the Department of Justice. Indeed, there are a number of reports that highlight compliance problems with the language assistance provisions. Common problems include inadequate numbers of trained bilingual poll workers; incomplete or insufficient amounts of translated election materials; the failure to develop translated materials for the Internet and other electronic media; mistranslation of candidate names, ballot initiatives, and referendum language; and the use of different screening procedures for language‐minority voters (Ancheta 2006; Tucker and Espino 2007). Beyond these compliance issues, instances of voter intimidation, harassment, and discrimination (including the denial of ballots) against limited‐English‐proficient voters have also been documented (Ancheta 2006, 299).            "
"11","While current literature has helped to frame questions surrounding whether and how bilingual ballots and other language assistance provisions are linked to minority participation and representation, the two distinct strains of research remain relatively separate. Consequently, there is still much to be learned with regard to the relationship between how the language assistance provisions of the VRA operate and the efficacy of these provisions across space and time. In the next section, we develop a theoretical framework that connects design and implementation features of the VRA with behaviors of actors affected by the act. Integrating insights from political science theories that deal with issues of compliance and political oversight, we develop a set of testable hypotheses regarding the conditions under which the language assistance provisions of the VRA are expected to operate most efficaciously on Latino political incorporation."
"12","Existing theory on the political incorporation of underrepresented groups focuses on two mechanisms in particular. The first connects key characteristics of the group—namely, its size, cohesiveness, and resources—to the group's ability to mobilize and participate effectively in politics (Engstrom and McDonald 1981; Parkin and Zlotnick 2011; Rocha 2007). The second mechanism focuses on electoral rules and institutions and examines the ways in which they may hinder or help underrepresented groups translate their voting strength into legislative seats or other elective offices (Bullock and MacManus 1990; Marschall, Ruhil, and Shah 2010; Trounstine and Valdini 2008). The language assistance provisions of the Voting Rights Act operate on both of these mechanisms. In particular, Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) reduce the costs of voting for language minorities by making information, campaign and elections materials, and, most importantly, ballots accessible in the native language of the protected group. By lowering the threshold for voting, the language assistance provisions may also reduce the importance that resource variables play in voter registration and turnout for language minorities.         "
"13","Since jurisdictions covered under Section 4(f)(4) were also historically covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act,3 this language assistance provision also operates on Latino political incorporation through electoral rules and institutions. Section 5 required covered jurisdictions to receive preclearance from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the attorney general before making any changes to their electoral rules or processes. This prevented jurisdictions from adopting at‐large systems, reducing the number of legislative seats, or making other changes typically associated with diluting the votes of protected minority groups.         "
"14","Analyzing the effect of Section 5 on the political incorporation of underrepresented groups is relatively straightforward given its design features. Changes in electoral procedures automatically required preclearance, so scrutiny and oversight were guaranteed. On the other hand, the language assistance provisions of Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) rely on implementation and compliance from local election authorities. There is no automatic trigger that necessitates local voting procedures and processes to be scrutinized by the federal government. Examining the efficacy of the language assistance provisions of the VRA therefore involves questions of implementation, oversight, compliance, and enforcement."
"15","Under a traditional model of bureaucratic behavior, local election officials are presumed to respond to laws and regulations adopted by Congress or other elected bodies. In this way, local election officials operate as agents who implement the priorities of principals (in this case, elected officials). However, one of the core assumptions of the principal‐agent model, the asymmetrical preferences of the agent and principal, implies that implementation is not guaranteed, automatic, or straightforward (Miller and Moe 1983). In particular, actions that benefit the principal may be costly to the agent, resulting in a preference for shirking. In addition, asymmetry in information makes shirking more tempting since the principal cannot easily observe the actions of the agent and because monitoring the agent's actions can be prohibitively expensive (Miller 2005). Thus, given limitations in the time, resources, and expertise of members of Congress to effectively and efficiently manage their agents, local election officials, like other street‐level bureaucrats, operate in a relatively autonomous environment that provides considerable discretion, and thus power, when it comes to policy implementation (Elmore 1979; Lipsky 1980).         "
"16","Weingast and Moran (1983) address this fundamental problem by focusing on how the threat of sanctions (in the form of congressional hearings or oversight) creates incentives for street‐level bureaucrats, such as local election officials, to implement and comply with laws passed by Congress. As McCubbins and Schwartz (1984) demonstrate, constituents play a key role in making these sanctions appear credible by sounding an “alarm”—complaining to their congressional representative when bureaucrats fail to either provide services or extend rights to which they are entitled under the law. In addition to these “alarms,” Congress also attempts to get bureaucratic agents to implement and comply with its laws by imposing procedural controls that protect or favor certain constituencies. For example, by specifying who holds the burden of proof, crafting procedural rules requiring consultation with specified groups, or allowing courts to be used to enforce due process and legislative procedural mandates, Congress creates other mechanisms to induce bureaucratic compliance.         "
"17","Insights from principal‐agent models have an interesting application to the case of language assistance provisions in the Voting Rights Act. On one hand, the preclearance provision of Section 5 is a good example of a procedural control mechanism, since covered jurisdictions seeking electoral changes must always demonstrate that these changes will not lead to retrogression in racial minority groups’ voting rights or electoral franchise before such changes are approved. Evidence suggests both that Section 5 has been efficacious in this regard (Fraga and Ocampo 2007) and has been causally linked to the increased ability of African Americans to translate their voting strength into greater political representation, particularly on local school boards and city councils (Shah, Marschall, and Ruhil 2013). On the other hand, given the other criteria for coverage under Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) of the VRA, it would seem that constituents in covered jurisdictions are relatively ill‐positioned to sound the alarm if and when local election officials fail to fully implement or comply with the language assistance provisions of the law. In particular, the lack of English proficiency and above average rates of illiteracy in jurisdictions covered under Section 203 present barriers to language minorities such that they may neither complain to elected representatives should language assistance not be provided nor be aware of what services and resources they are entitled to under the law. Less frequent local alarms make congressional oversight less likely, which in turn reduces the incentives of local election officials to fully implement or comply with the language assistance provisions.         "
"18","Though it is challenging to measure the extent to which the language assistance provisions of Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) have been fully implemented in jurisdictions meeting the conditions of coverage, evidence suggests that shirking on the part of local bureaucrats does occur. In Tucker and Espino's 2005 survey of 810 jurisdictions covered (or formerly covered) by Sections 203 and 4(f)(4), 80% reported that election practices fell short of compliance with VRA language assistance provisions (Tucker 2009, 137). For example, 65% of responding jurisdictions said they did not confirm the language abilities of part‐time poll workers, and 67% reported their poll worker training did not include information on covered languages in their jurisdiction (Tucker 2009, 149–51). In addition, nearly two‐thirds of responding jurisdictions admitted they did not engage in any community outreach to covered language groups, and 61% reported that they failed to provide language assistance to voters making telephone inquiries (Tucker 2009, 216). These findings are consistent with Jones‐Correa and Waismel‐Manor (2007), who conducted site visits with county clerks or registrars in 66 Section 203–covered counties in 15 states in 2005. Based on their study, one in seven covered jurisdictions could not, upon request, offer registration materials in languages other than English as required under the law, and one in four covered jurisdictions did not have personnel present who could offer aid in the languages indicated under the Voting Rights Act.         "
"19","Given the principal‐agent problem inherent in implementing Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) and the relatively high degree of discretion local election officials possess in determining how they will meet the requirements of the language assistance provisions, how can we explain why some jurisdictions implement and comply with the language assistance provisions of the VRA while others do not?"
"20","First, we hypothesize that the efficacy of the language assistance provisions of the VRA increases with the duration and consistency of coverage. Specifically, uninterrupted coverage under Section 203 and/or more years of coverage under the language assistance provisions are likely to yield more complete implementation and compliance, and greater effectiveness of the provisions themselves. This is especially true for Section 203, since coverage is dynamic and subject to change after each decennial census. Uninterrupted coverage means that election officials have more time and incentive to locate qualified translators and interpreters, develop procedures for hiring bilingual poll workers and staffing polling places, train existing staff on issues related to language sensitivity and cultural awareness, and create systems of oversight and evaluation. They have time to develop the necessary infrastructure to provide language assistance and are more assured that their investment is worthwhile given that coverage will be renewed in the future."
"21","Consistent coverage also means that voters experience the language assistance provisions more fully and consistently. As the infrastructure of Section 203 becomes commonplace, some voters come to rely on and expect language assistance. In other words, the policies become institutionalized and language assistance for limited‐English‐proficient voters becomes the norm. In this context, if status quo language assistance provisions are not provided, local voters may be more likely to sound alarms to their elected officials. In short, jurisdictions consistently covered under Section 203 are more likely to fully implement and comply with the letter and spirit of the law. Under this condition, we expect Latino school board representation, ceteris paribus, to also be greater."
"22","Second, we posit that under federal oversight, implementation and compliance will be greater, thereby also yielding higher levels of Latino school board representation. Though routine or systematic oversight of covered jurisdictions is not the norm, federal election observers were authorized by Congress under the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Federal observers can be and have been sent to jurisdictions covered under Sections 203 and 4(f)(4), and the number of these observers increased dramatically in the last decade (Tucker 2007). Observers are sent to monitor compliance with constitutional and statutory protections of the right to vote as well as court orders enforcing these protections in jurisdictions where discriminatory practices are suspected.4 Federal observers typically monitor elections for several years, particularly in jurisdictions where violations have been systemic and discriminatory practices are deeply ingrained. However, once federal observers determine that these jurisdictions have demonstrated compliance with requirements of the VRA, election monitoring is discontinued. Since the presence of federal election observers leads to greater implementation and compliance with the language assistance provisions, we hypothesize that, all things equal, school districts in counties where monitors have been dispatched will have higher levels of Latino representation on local school boards postmonitoring.         "
"23","Third, while the goal of federal observers is to facilitate minority voter participation during elections, by documenting discriminatory conduct, they also provide valuable evidence that can be used later should a lawsuit be brought against the covered jurisdiction. A typical example is United States v. San Diego County (2004), where the Department of Justice alleged San Diego County election officials routinely asked for additional information about citizenship from people who seemed to be Hispanic. As they did in this case, reports generated by federal election observers are often used as testimonial witnesses in voting rights cases. According to Tucker (2007, 233), since these reports are prepared at the time voting rights violations occur by impartial observers, they provide evidence that is generally unassailable in court proceedings. Since legal actions are taken by the Department of Justice only in cases where there are documented instances of voters being denied statutory or constitutional protections, they are a clear indication of jurisdictions that are not complying with the language assistance provisions of the VRA. Thus, we expect the presence of such suits in jurisdictions covered by Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) to be negatively associated with Latino representation on local school boards there.         "
"24","In sum, in attempting to understand how the language assistance provisions of the VRA operate on Latino office holding, we apply insights from principal‐agent theory. This allows us to specify a set of testable hypotheses regarding the conditions under which implementation and compliance with these provisions are most likely. First, we expect more complete implementation and greater compliance with Section 203 in jurisdictions that have been consistently covered since the language assistance provisions of the VRA were adopted in 1975. Further, we expect less complete implementation and compliance with more interruptions in coverage and fewer years of coverage. We also expect more complete implementation and compliance in jurisdictions where federal election observers have monitored elections. Finally, we expect incomplete implementation and compliance in jurisdictions where federal lawsuits claiming violations of the language assistance provisions by local election officials have been filed."
"25","To examine the relationship between the language assistance provisions of the VRA and Latino representation and to test our hypotheses regarding the efficacy of these provisions, we conduct empirical analyses on a sample of 1,661 school districts with elected school boards and student enrollment of at least 5,000 in 1999. These districts were surveyed in 2002, 2004, 2008, and 2012 as part of the National Education Panel Survey (NEPS; Meier and Favero 2011).5 We rely on the NEPS for data on the size and electoral arrangements of local school boards. For data on Latino board representation, we rely on NALEO rosters since they cover a longer time series (1984–2012). By looking at a constant sample of school districts across nearly three decades, our analysis allows us to capture changes in Section 203 coverage over time and thus to test for differences in the efficacy of the VRA language assistance provisions based on the timing and consistency of coverage as well as changes in Department of Justice enforcement policies. As Table 2 shows, the number of counties and sampled school districts meeting the requirements for Section 203 coverage has varied over time.         "
"26","To measure language assistance coverage under Sections 203 and 4(f)(4), we focus exclusively on Spanish‐language minorities. Since the criteria for coverage under Section 4(f)(4) are fixed, there is no variation in which districts are covered over time and measurement is straightforward. Two states have statewide coverage for Spanish‐language minorities (Arizona and Texas) and account for 177 of the 187 sample school districts covered under Section 4(f)(4). The remaining 10 districts are located in California (five), Florida (four), and Michigan (one)."
"27","When it comes to Section 203, coverage varies over time and is thus relatively more complicated. In our analysis, we employ three different measurement approaches. In the first, we consider whether the school district was initially covered in 1975 and maintained coverage up until the present. This binary variable (Section 203‐All Years) is coded 1 if the district met this condition, and 0 otherwise. In our sample of 1,661 school districts, 95 have been continuously covered under Section 203 since adoption of the language assistance provisions in 1975. We compare full coverage to the case where districts have been covered in some but not all years (Section 203‐Some Years). Here we do not distinguish between the number of covered years or the timing of coverage but instead treat all of these districts as intermediate cases. In this case, 498 of the 1,661 school districts are coded 1 (i.e., covered for some but not all years from 1975 to 2012). We expect this approach to best capture the efficacy of the Section 203 language assistance provisions and hypothesize that, ceteris paribus, districts covered under Section 203 for all years will be most likely not only to witness Latinos overcoming the representation hurdle and occupying at least one seat on the local school board, but to also expand the number of seats they hold on these boards. Effects should be weaker for districts covered for some but not all years, compared to districts that have never been covered under Section 203.            "
"28","Our second measurement approach focuses on the actual timing of coverage. Here we allow districts to be coded 1 for each year this status was conferred on them (in 1984, 1992, 2002, and 2011). The number of school districts coded 1 based on this specification (Section 203‐Covered Years) varies over time, and the reference category is all districts not covered during the specific years (see Table 1). While this approach better captures the temporal effect of Section 203 coverage on Latino school board office holding, it does not allow for the consistency of Section 203 coverage to be tested.            "
"29","Finally, our third approach recognizes the potential discontinuity of coverage status over time and allows districts that are most similar to each other in terms of the criteria for Section 203 to be coded the same regardless of whether they actually met the criteria for coverage after every decennial census. Specifically, we code as 1 school districts that were covered under Section 203 during any point in time (Section 203‐Any Years). This means that districts covered during all years are coded the same as districts covered during only one or two decades. This approach yields 593 districts covered under Section 203.            "
"30","Empirical studies of minority representation on legislative bodies have traditionally focused on the concept of proportionality and have employed ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to estimate the seats/population ratio. However, as others have pointed out, there are both theoretical and methodological limitations to this approach (see Marschall, Ruhil, and Shah 2010). In particular, OLS assumes that representation is a linear process and that the probability of winning a seat is invariant to legislature size. However, not only are the odds of representation on a body with three seats different from those with seven seats, but the seats/population ratio also varies dramatically according to legislative size. Moreover, proportionality is only one dimension of representation and is less germane to the vast majority of jurisdictions since they have yet to witness Latinos overcoming the representational hurdle in the first place. Indeed, the election of a Latino candidate continues to be a rare event, despite the dramatic increase in Latino office holding over time.            "
"31","A handful of recent studies have addressed these limitations. For example, Sass (2000) explicitly accounts for the discrete nature of the number of Latino legislators and allows for nonlinearity in the relationship between Latino voting strength and Latino legislative representation. Trounstine and Valdini (2008) employ a random‐effects Tobit model to estimate the probability of a city council having any minority members and, given this, the expected proportion of minority councilors. Finally, Marschall, Ruhil, and Shah (2010) and Shah, Marschall, and Ruhil (2013) estimate hurdle count models, which address issues raised by Sass (2000) and Trounstine and Valdini (2008) while also allowing the two distinct stages of representation to be explicitly modeled. We adopt this specification since it fits nicely with our conceptualization of Latino school board representation as a two‐stage process.            "
"32","In the first stage of board representation, Latinos must overcome the hurdle of getting onto the ballot and into office. This hurdle remains formidable even today, as the majority of U.S. school boards have yet to elect their first Latino member. The second stage marks the expansion of Latino board representation from a single (often “token”) member toward more substantively meaningful representation that comes with greater numbers or even a “critical mass.” This two‐stage model allows the dynamics of representation to change. In particular, the size of the legislative body may become more important in Stage 2, whereas the size of the Latino population may be less important for each additional seat Latinos gain. Formally, the model may be specified as follows:               "
"33","Here, y = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, and represents the number of Latino school board members. Stage 1 distinguishes between jurisdictions with no Latino board members (y = 0) and those with at least one Latino school board member (y ≥ 1) via a logit model. In the second step, we estimate a zero‐truncated Poisson model fit to the subset of observations (y ≥ 1).            "
"34","Given the two stages of representation, our dependent variable includes two measures. For the first, Incidence of (Any) Representation, school districts with at least one Latino board member are coded 1, and those without Latino board members are coded 0. The second measure, Extent of Representation, is the number of Latino school board members and only includes districts with at least one Latino board member.            "
"35","Our primary independent variables of interest are whether school districts are covered under Section 203 and/or Section 4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights Act (1 = yes; 0 otherwise). As described earlier, we operationalize Section 203 coverage in several different ways: (1) All Years/Some Years, (2) Covered Years, and (3) Any Years.            "
"36","Other core explanatory variables include Latino voting strength, measured as the percentage of voting‐age Hispanics (Percent Hispanic VAP). Not surprisingly, the accumulated evidence demonstrates that the voting strength of the Latino population is the most reliable predictor of Latino representation on local school boards (Marschall 2005; Sass 2000). To capture other racial/ethnic dynamics in the school district, we include a dummy variable for Majority White districts (1 = non‐Hispanic white population is 50% or more; 0 otherwise), since in these districts, racial bloc voting by whites can prevent Latinos from overcoming the representational hurdle even when Latinos make up a sizable proportion of the local population.            "
"37","We also include two measures for electoral arrangements, School Board Size and the percentage of seats elected at‐large (Percent At‐Large Seats).6 While nearly all prior research has focused on the relationship between at‐large and district systems and the proportion of Latinos on the board, few studies have uncovered strong effects (Leal, Martinez‐Ebers, and Meier 2004; Marschall 2005; Rocha 2007; Shah 2010; Welch 1990; Zax 1990). The largest set of studies includes those estimating the seats/population ratio with regression analysis, particularly the method employed by Engstrom and McDonald (1981). At the same time, the size of the board has been largely overlooked as an explanatory factor, primarily because its inclusion as the denominator of the dependent variable has precluded it as an independent variable in most analyses. As Marschall, Ruhil, and Shah (2010) explain, there is reason to believe that size matters under both types of electoral arrangements. In district systems, more seats imply more districts and thus a greater opportunity to concentrate the minority population. In at‐large systems, the greater the number of seats, the lower the plurality threshold needed to win. Thus, under both electoral arrangements, school board size should be positively related to the probability of overcoming the representational hurdle and the number of seats held by Latinos.            "
"38","Though the small body of empirical research has not expanded much beyond this core set of explanatory variables, studies of African American representation typically find evidence that the resources of the local African American population shape levels of representation. We thus include several measures for Latino resources, namely, the percentage of Hispanics who live in owner‐occupied housing (Percent Hispanic Homeowner) and the percentage of Hispanics who earned at least a bachelor's degree (Percent Hispanic College). We expect both of these to be positively related to Latino board representation. We also include a measure for the percentage of school district residents who were born outside of the United States (Percent Foreign Born) to capture resource constraints. We expect this variable to be negatively related to Latino board representation. Finally, we include a measure for the percentage of district residents who speak only Spanish (Percent Speaking Only Spanish). A larger concentration of residents who are not proficient in English means that a larger share of local residents faces higher costs of voting. It could also cause a backlash against potential Latino candidates for local office since non‐Latino voters may be more hostile to the group as a whole. On the other hand, having more limited‐English‐proficient residents may increase the salience of language issues in general, while also providing a larger advocacy group to push for language assistance (and/or the enforcement of language provisions under the VRA in covered jurisdictions).

"39","While racial/ethnic voting may be the norm, it explains only part of the success of minority candidates in local elections. This is not only because Latinos constitute the majority in only a small fraction of school districts, but also because most school districts employ at‐large electoral systems. Under these conditions, Latino candidates typically must seek electoral support beyond their own ethnic group. Although studies have found black candidates fare better in districts with larger Latino populations, empirical evidence suggests that Latino candidates do worse in districts with larger African American populations (Marschall 2005; Marschall, Ruhil, and Shah 2010; Rocha 2007; but see Meier and Stewart 1991). To investigate the possibility of biracial/ethnic electoral coalitions, we include a variable for the percentage of voting‐age blacks in the district (Percent Black VAP). Finally, since minorities have frequently been elected to office in places where liberal white voters make up a sizable portion of the population (Gilliam 1996; Kaufman 1998), we include a proxy measure (Percent White College) to test for this possibility.            "
"40","Our models also include a set of time dummies that allow us to investigate whether Latino board representation has changed over time. These dummy variables are spaced at four‐year intervals, from 1984 to 2012, to ensure at least one election in between. We use 1996 as the baseline or excluded category to better account for the reporting change made by NALEO in 1995.7 Finally, we include a set of control variables to capture the size (Total Population Logged) and wealth (Median Home Value Logged, Percent Poverty) of the local school district.            "
"41","In Table 3, we begin by estimating a baseline model that tests for the direct effect of the VRA language assistance provisions across the three different specifications of Section 203 coverage. In each model, the first stage tests for the effect of Sections 203 and 4(f)(4) on the incidence of any Latino board representation, and the second stage tests for effects on additional seats beyond a single Latino member.         "
"42","The estimates in Table 3 show strong positive effects of Section 203 in the first stage of coverage across all three specifications. All else equal, the probability of Latino representation in school districts covered continuously since 1975 is significantly higher than that of districts covered only in some years. As illustrated in Figure 1, districts covered continuously (All Years) are 43.9% more likely, on average, to achieve Latino representation compared to noncovered districts, whereas districts covered only in the Some Years model are 19.8% more likely to achieve representation than noncovered districts. This latter effect is very similar to the effect of the Any Years measure, where coverage at any point between 1975 and 2012 is associated with a 28.5 percentage point increase in the likelihood of Latino representation, all else equal (lower right panel). There is no effect of Section 4(f)(4) in Stage 1 across the first and third specifications of the Section 203 measure; however, in the Covered Years model, it is positive and significant such that coverage is associated with a 28 percentage point increase in the likelihood of representation. Since this model picks up temporal changes in Section 203 coverage, it has the least amount of overlap in Section 203 and 4(f)(4) coverage and thus provides the best leverage for finding independent effects for Section 4(f)(4). Thus, on average, when a district is covered only by Section 4(f)(4), language assistance provisions do significantly increase the likelihood of observing a Latino elected board member.         "
"43","When it comes to Latino representation beyond a single member (Stage 2), the effects of Section 203 are less apparent. In only one of the three models (Covered Years) do we see a significant coefficient. The estimates for additional representation here indicate that districts covered by Section 203 at time t, on average, have a predicted number of Latino representatives of 1.25, whereas noncovered districts, on average, are predicted to have only 1.05 Latino representatives. Again, there are no effects of Section 4(f)(4) in Stage 2 model specifications. Overall, the results suggest that the language assistance provisions of the Voting Rights Act play an important role in increasing the likelihood of representation for a single Latino board member but may not aid the expansion of Latino representation to additional seats. In addition to uncovering new evidence linking the language assistance provisions to Latino representation, our results find strong support for existing causal mechanisms.         "
"44","With regard to electoral arrangements, we find a positive and significant effect of board size on the extent of Latino representation (Stage 2) across all three specifications. Specifically, a shift from five to seven (nine) seats is associated with an increase from 1.53 to 2.01 (2.65) in the expected number of Latino board members. Our results also find a negative effect for at‐large elections. Finally, our baseline results also confirm the importance of group size for minority representation. Consistent with extant literature, we find the percent Latino voting‐age population to be the strongest predictor of Latino board representation. Across all models, a 1% increase in Latino VAP leads to a .05 to 1.5 percentage point increase in the likelihood of gaining a Latino board member."
"45","When it comes to the effects of resource variables, our analysis yields mixed results. On the one hand, larger concentrations of foreign‐born or Spanish‐speaking‐only residents do not, as we might expect, reduce the likelihood of Latinos overcoming the representation hurdle. However, contrary to expectations, the percent of Hispanics with a bachelor's degree does. In addition, the share of Hispanic homeowners in the district increases the likelihood of representation. Further, the only other factor positively associated with crossing the representation hurdle is the size of the white, college‐educated population. In terms of expanding representation beyond a single seat, we find that districts with higher rates of poverty and Spanish‐only speakers make significantly less progress. On the other hand, over time, the average number of Latino school board members has increased steadily, a trend that is not apparent with regard to the percentage of districts crossing the representational hurdle."
"46","Our baseline models confirm the two traditional causal mechanisms linked to minority representation—group size and electoral arrangements. In addition, results from the baseline models provide the first systemic evidence that the language assistance provisions have a direct effect on Latino representation in local government. As Figure 1 shows, the strongest effects of Section 203 occur when coverage is long‐standing and uninterrupted. This is consistent with our first hypothesis regarding causal mechanisms of the language assistance provisions of the VRA. In the next set of analyses, we test our hypotheses focusing on the role and effect of federal oversight and enforcement by examining only those school districts located in jurisdictions that have been covered under Section 203 or 4(f)(4) at some point in their history.            "
"47","To test for the effect of federal oversight, we rely on data obtained from the Department of Justice via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. These data provide information on the number of federal observers monitoring all elections in the United States from 1966 to 2009. We constructed a dichotomous measure of Federal Oversight that captures whether a district is located in a county that was ever monitored by federal observers (1 = yes; 0 otherwise). It is coded 1 in the first period when monitors were present and retains this value for the duration of the time series. In most instances, federal observers monitor elections in a given jurisdiction for more than a single year. Beyond this, we believe our measurement strategy captures the actual dynamic between the principal and agent that results from the initiation of election monitoring. Specifically, the presence of observers signals to local election officials that oversight is not only possible, but real. Principal‐agent theory posits that this causes them to alter their behavior at time t, while also updating their priors about the likelihood of future oversight. To avoid additional monitoring and other punitive mechanisms, local election officials are subsequently more likely to comply with language provisions at time t + 1.            "
"48","To test for the effect of Federal Enforcement, we consider all federal cases filed between 1975 and 2009 that raised claims under the language assistance provisions of the VRA. We created a dichotomous variable that takes the value of 1 in the panel‐year following the litigation (e.g., a case filed in 2007 would be coded 1 in 2008). In this case, federal action ensues as a result of the failure of local election officials to implement or comply with the requirements of the law. We therefore expect districts in jurisdictions where federal cases have been filed to have lower levels of Latino representation.            "
"49","Table 4 reports the results from the second set of analyses. The results here provide strong evidence of the effects of federal oversight for the second stage of representation. In school districts where federal election observers have been present monitoring elections, Latinos have made significantly more progress in expanding representation beyond a single seat than in districts where federal observers have never been present. For example, the expected number of Latino board members increases from 1.71 with no observers present to 2.11 when observers are present in districts covered under Section 203 for all years (for districts covered for only some years, the increase is from 1.85 to 2.28). This finding is consistent with insights from principal‐agent models suggesting that oversight increases the incentives of local agents to implement and comply with laws adopted by Congress. On the other hand, federal enforcement via the litigation of cases where language minority rights have been violated does not appear to have a significant effect on Latino board representation. While the sign is in the expected direction, the coefficients are not statistically significant.8"
"50","Apart from oversight and enforcement, we also tested for the effect of duration and consistency of coverage. As Model 1 indicates, Latinos do not achieve higher levels of school board representation in districts where Section 203 has been in force since it adoption in 1975 in comparison to districts that have only been covered for some years. Districts in jurisdictions covered under Section 4(f)(4) are also not significantly different from districts only sometimes covered under Section 203. On the other hand, when we measure the temporal effects of Section 203, we find significant differences in the extent of representation (Stage 2). This finding is consistent with results from Table 3 and suggests that effects of coverage are strongest in the period immediately following coverage. Outside of language assistance provision and enforcement/oversight variables, all independent variables largely mirror relationships described in Table 3. Overall, it appears that contextual factors operate very similarly in districts that are and are not covered under the language assistance provisions of the VRA.            "
"51","Findings from this study indicate that the language assistance provisions of the Voting Rights Act have had a meaningful effect on Latino school board representation. In particular, consistent coverage under Section 203 sharply increases the likelihood that Latinos overcome the representational hurdle and gain a seat on the local school board. Even in districts that have been covered by Section 203 for only some portion of the past three decades, Latinos are significantly more likely to elect one of their own to the board compared to districts that have never been covered. While teasing out the independent effect of Section 4(f)(4) is more difficult given overlapping coverage with Section 203, we nevertheless find strong, positive effects where joint coverage is minimized. These findings are robust to alternative specifications of the model and lend confidence that the link between the language assistance provisions of the VRA and Latino political incorporation is robust. Although the coverage mechanism for Section 4(f)(4) was affected by the Shelby County v. Holder Supreme Court decision (effectively invalidating it), the ruling left the dynamic trigger mechanisms for Section 203 untouched. From this perspective, the pattern of findings we uncover in our study is reassuring since the more efficacious of the two language assistance provisions remains in force.         "
"52","On the other hand, our analyses found little support that Section 203 affects Latino office holding beyond the initial seat. When we look exclusively at districts in covered jurisdictions, we do find evidence that coverage has a temporal effect on the extent of Latino board representation. Since increasing the number of Latino representatives on the school board depends critically on larger numbers of Latino candidates running for local office, we suspect the weaker effects here stem at least in part from the fact that there is still a shortage of Latino candidates in most districts. In addition, the criterion for Section 203 coverage that requires the illiteracy rate of the target population to be higher than the national average means that the Latino population in Section 203 jurisdictions is doubly disadvantaged. The combination of illiteracy and limited English proficiency poses formidable barriers to Latino political participation in general and restricts the pool of qualified Latino candidates. In a separate study, we have begun to look at local elections themselves so that we can systematically assess the effects of Latino candidate emergence, margin of victory, and other factors on Latinos’ office‐holding patterns across space and time. With these data, we will be better able to hone in on the causal mechanisms underlying the expansion of Latino office holding beyond a single seat, while also expanding our understanding of which offices Latino candidates seek and win and how broader electoral processes might be shaped by VRA coverage."
"53","Finally, when it comes to explaining how the language assistance provisions of the VRA operate on Latino office holding on local school boards, we find evidence that federal oversight in the form of election monitoring significantly increases the extent of Latino representation. We believe this finding is consistent with insights from the principal‐agent model. Specifically, the threat of future oversight should induce local election officials to more fully implement and comply with the requirements of Sections 203 and 4(f)(4). In the absence of oversight, however, local election officials exercise greater discretion in their compliance behavior. Given the costs associated with implementing and complying with the language assistance provisions and the lower probability associated with the sounding of alarms by the local population, it is not surprising that existing studies have uncovered a considerable degree of shirking on the part of local election officials. Thus, it appears that proactive and consistent oversight by the Department of Justice is particularly critical in ensuring the efficacy of the language assistance provisions of the VRA. Indeed, in the post–Shelby County v. Holder environment, it may be one of the best safeguards against retrogression. Together, findings from the present study point to the need for vigilance if minority rights are to be protected and expanded.         "
