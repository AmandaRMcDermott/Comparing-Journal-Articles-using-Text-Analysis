"1","Our article relates to a broad literature on the politics of information aggregation that builds on the contributions by Austen‐Smith and Banks (1996) and Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996, 1997, 1998), who study situations where, as in our model, players share common interests. Following the seminal work by Crawford and Sobel (1982) and Gilligan and Krehbiel (1987), communication games are now a canonical framework to study the politics of information aggregation. Most of this literature has focused on the aggregation of information in committees where a single outcome is determined by voting. In our model, information is aggregated through communication. While Coughlan (2000), Doraszelski, Gerardi, and Squintani (2003), and Austen‐Smith and Feddersen (2006) explore the consequences of allowing committee members to communicate before they vote,3 we instead consider communication when a set of policy outcomes is allocated to individuals with decision‐making rights which better fits the cabinet setting. Our study of optimal executive structure from an information aggregation perspective relates to work by Dragu and Board (2013), who show that the imposition of judicial review can lead to more informed outcomes.         "
"2","We analyze our game using the multiplayer communication model by Galeotti, Ghiglino, and Squintani (2013), who build on Morgan and Stocken (2008). Its key feature is a coarse information structure with the implication that a message sent to a decision maker is either truthful or not. This contrasts with information aggregation with a continuous signal space and a single policy dimension where information can be conveyed only when the message space is partitioned, as in the seminal article by Crawford and Sobel (1982). Extensions of that article have shown, however, that in multiple dimensions, the decision maker can extract all information from an informed agent (Battaglini 2002). Dewan and Hortala‐Vallve (2011) extend that framework to provide insights into a prime minister's control over ministers who are perfectly informed. In our model with coarse information, by contrast, no player can be perfectly informed, so the quality of final policies depends on the number of politicians communicating truthfully. Such multiplayer communication is, we believe, the relevant aspect of information aggregation in parliaments and cabinets.         "
"3","Imposing this structure on the message space provides tractability and substantive new political insights, as witnessed by recent papers by Patty and Penn (2013) on small networks, Dewan and Squintani (2012) on factions in political parties, and Gailmard and Patty (2009) on delegation and transparency with sequential decision making. Our article significantly extends the multiplayer communication model in considering the possibility that players have specific information about some decisions but not others. Moreover, in studying the question of the optimal assignment of decision‐making rights, we derive an entirely new set of theoretical results.         "
"4","A related paper by Dewan and Squintani (2012) adapts the multiplayer communication model to analyze the formation of party factions. In their model, each party politician is endowed with some say over the party manifesto. They can choose voluntarily to join a faction. Doing so involves delegating authority to the faction leader, who makes the final choice. After factions have formed, the party politicians communicate their information to faction leaders in private. The authors study a situation where communication can be made only within factions and one where the factional structure does not prohibit intraparty communication. They analyze the welfare consequences of factionalism in each case. The key features of that model—private communication and voluntary delegation of authority—are relevant to party structures. Here, in analyzing the optimal structure of the executive in a parliamentary democracy, our main focus is public communication. The optimal allocation of authority is that which would be chosen by a welfare‐maximizing prime minister and it does not arise through a process of voluntary delegation.         "
"5","Recent and related work by Patty (2013) complements ours in looking at how the exclusion and inclusion of cabinet members affects strategic communication. While sharing the same broad motivation and some modeling choices, the two studies answer distinct questions. Our focus is on the optimal assignment of executive authority and on the comparison between public and private communication. We show that cabinet meetings are optimal and present novel insights as to the degree to which power should be centralized in a cabinet and to whom it should be allocated. Patty (2013), by contrast, considers the optimal size and composition of cabinet meetings with an exogenous allocation of decision‐making authority. He does not make the restriction that cabinet meetings are limited to those who hold executive authority; indeed, in an interesting finding, he shows that it may be optimal for some individuals with executive authority to be excluded, whereas others without such authority should be included.         "
"6","The result that cabinet meetings yield higher welfare than private conversations can be related to Farrell and Gibbons (1989) and Goltsman and Pavlov (2011), who compare public communication and private communication in a much simpler game with a single expert and two decision makers, but critically do not consider the possibility of reassignment of decision‐making authority.         "
"7","More broadly, our results on the deliberative value of collective meetings provide a new angle on the study of cabinet governance that typically has focused on the cabinet as a system of incentives, managed strategically by a prime minister as in citations mentioned earlier. And we provide an information aggregation justification for the centralization of decision‐making rights in an assembly (either to a single leader or a cabinet with public information) that contributes to a broad rational choice literature on why majorities adopt restrictive procedures, which looks at the role of committees (Gilligan and Krehbiel 1987), political parties (Cox and McCubbins 1993) and cabinets (Cox 1987). Recent contributions to this debate include Diermeier and Vlaicu (2011) and Diermeier, Prato, and Vlaicu (2013).         "
"8","We consider the following information aggregation and collective decision problem. Suppose that a set  of politicians form a parliamentary majority that provides consent for a governing executive. They are faced with the collective task of choosing an assignment  of policy decisions that grants decision‐making authority over a set of policies . For each  the decision  is a policy on the left‐right spectrum . For simplicity, we think of the assignment as granting complete jurisdiction over policy k, though of course other interpretations, such as the assignment of agenda‐setting rights, could also be incorporated. The important element is that decision‐making authority over each policy is granted to a unique individual.         "
"9","In a fully decentralized executive, each policy decision is assigned to a different politician so that  for all  in  At the opposite end of the spectrum, all decisions are centralized to a single leader so that  for all  in . We let the range of a be denoted by  which we term as the set of politicians with decision‐making authority. We refer to such politicians as ministers. We let  denote the number of policies that minister j takes under assignment a. Our specification thus allows us to capture important elements of the executive body: its size (beyond the extremes of full decentralization and the leadership of one, there are a range of possibilities); and its balance (among the set of ministers, some may have more authority than others).         "
"10","Politicians are ideologically differentiated and care about all policy choices made. For any policy decision  their preferences also depend on unknown states of the world  uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. Specifically, were she to know the vector of states  politician i's payoff would be            "
"11","Hence, each politician i's ideal policy is  where the bias  captures ideological differentiation, and we assume without loss of generality that . The vector of ideologies  is common knowledge.         "
"12","Each politician i has some private information on the vector  Specifically, we make two opposite assumptions on politicians' information. First, for some of our analysis, we assume that uncertainty over all policies is captured by a single common state that represents the underlying economic and social fundamentals. For example, an underlying economic recession will influence policy choices of all ministries, from the home office immigration policy to the fiscal policy of the chancellor of the exchequer. We represent these fundamentals by a single uniformly distributed state of the world θ, so that  for all k and each politician i's signal  is informative about θ. Conditional on θ,  takes the value equal to 1 with probability θ and to 0 with probability . Second, and in an alternative specification, we say that the politician's information is policy specific. Each policy has its own underlying set of circumstances over which politicians may be informed. Thus, the random variables  are identically and independently distributed across  and each politician k receives a signal  about  only, again with  In the case of policy‐specific information we take  so that each politician is informed on a single issue. This specification allows us to explore a situation where expertise on policies varies and is widely dispersed among the set of politicians.         "
"13","In our setup, politicians can communicate their signals to each other before policies are executed. We allow for such communication to take the form of either private conversations or general meetings. We might think of the former as taking place over dinner or via a secure communication network, with no leakage of information transmitted. Hence, each politician i may send a different message  to any politician j. In a meeting, by contrast, a politician is unable to communicate privately with a decision maker as all communication is available to those who exercise authority. Hence, each politician i sends the same message  to all decision makers. A pure communication strategy of player i is a function "
"14","Communication between politicians allows information to be transferred. Up to relabeling of messages, each communication strategy from i to j may be either truthful, in that a politician reveals her signal to j so that  for , or babbling, and in this case  does not depend on  Hence, the communication strategy profile  defines the truthful communication network  according to the rule: if and only if  for every , which provides us with the communication structure within the set of politicians "
"15","The second strategic element of our model involves the final policies implemented. Conditional on her information, and after communication has taken place, each assigned decision maker implements her preferred policy. We denote a policy strategy by i as  for all policies k such that  Given the received messages , by sequential rationality, politician i chooses  to maximize expected utility for all k such that . So            "
"16","Given an assignment a, an equilibrium then consists of the strategy pair  and a set of beliefs that are consistent with equilibrium play. We use the further restriction that an equilibrium must be consistent with some beliefs held by politicians off the equilibrium path of play. Thus our equilibrium concept is pure‐strategy perfect Bayesian equilibrium. Fixing policy assignment a, then regardless of the communication mode adopted, there may be multiple equilibria . For example, the strategy profile where all players “babble” is always an equilibrium. Equilibrium multiplicity makes the ranking of decision‐making authority assignments a not well defined: Given the same assignment a, different equilibria may yield different payoffs to the politicians, so that the politicians' initial collective decision over assignments a is impossible. To avoid this issue we assume that for any assignment a, politicians coordinate on the equilibria  that give them the highest payoffs.4 This equilibrium selection is standard in games of communication.         "
"17","We focus on the optimal assignment of authority, defined as the assignments a that induce the equilibria  with the largest joint payoffs:            "
"18","Our notion of welfare is ex ante utilitarian: we assume that the collective decision on the optimal assignment a by politicians in  maximizes the sum of their expected payoffs. But for some of our results we can invoke the weaker principle of Pareto optimality.         "
"19","We first provide a useful derivation for our main results. We first say that a politician j's moderation is  the distance between  and the average ideology  We note that politicians' moderation does not depend on the assignment a, nor on the equilibrium  Second, we let  denote politician j's information on the state  given the equilibrium  Specifically,  consists of the number of signals on  held by j, including her own, after communication has taken place and before she makes her choice.         "
"20","With common value information, each politician's information coincides with the number of politicians communicating truthfully with her plus her own signal. Later on in our analysis, we will adopt a specification with policy‐specific knowledge, in which each politician j may hold at most one signal on each , either because  is her own signal  or because  was communicated by k to j given the equilibrium communication structure .         "
"21","Armed with these definitions, and given an assignment a and an equilibrium  we show in the appendix that the equilibrium ex ante welfare  can be rewritten as:            "
"22","We begin our study of the optimal assignment of decision‐making in an environment where underlying fundamentals are common to all policies so that politicians' information is relevant to all decisions. Initially, we explore the situation where politicians communicate only in private with decision makers. We first describe the equilibrium communication structure given any policy assignment a. The characterization extends Corollary 1 of Galeotti, Ghiglino, and Squintani (2013) to the case of arbitrary policy assignments. For future reference, for any assignment a, we write  as the information  associated with any welfare‐maximizing equilibrium 6 When the state θ is common across policies, and the communication is private, we prove in the appendix that the profile  is an equilibrium if and only if, whenever i is truthful to j,            "
"23","Having characterized equilibrium communication between politicians and ministers, we explore the implication of Condition 3 with respect to the assignment of executive authority.            "
"24","Proposition 1.Suppose that θ is common across policies, and that communication is private. For generic ideologies , any Pareto optimal assignment involves decision‐making authority being centralized to a single leader j, that is,  for all k.               "
"25","The finding that all decisions should be assigned to a single leader and, hence, executive authority should be fully centralized follows from two different facts. First, truthful communication from politician i to minister j in equilibrium is independent of the specific policy decisions assigned to j (or to any other politician ). Second, the stipulation that every politician's information is relevant for all policies implies that politicians and policies are “interchangeable.” As a consequence of these two facts, whoever is the optimal politician to make one policy decision will also be the optimal politician to make all of them. This result holds with our utilitarian welfare criterion and under the weak welfare concept of Pareto optimality. In sum, with the restriction to private conversation between a politician and a minister, the optimal size of the executive is one: Leadership by a dominant prime minister emerges.         "
"26","Having considered communication via private meetings, we now study optimal assignment of decision‐making authority when there is a cabinet providing a forum for information to be conveyed to the set of ministers. This change to the communication environment affects the strategic calculus of information transmission: It is possible that politician i would not wish to communicate with minister j on a policy if that information is shared with minister ; conversely, politician i might share information with j because minister  also has access to that information.         "
"27","The next result characterizes communication equilibria under any policy assignment. It extends Theorem 1 of Galeotti, Ghiglino, and Squintani (2013) to the case of arbitrary policy assignments.            "
"28","Lemma 1.Suppose that the state θ is common across policies k and that communication takes place in cabinet meetings. The strategy profile  is an equilibrium if and only if, whenever i is truthful,                  "
"29","Intuitively, each politician i's willingness to communicate truthfully depends on a weighted average of all the ministers' ideologies. The specific weights are inversely related to the equilibrium information of each politician. Analyzing them reveals that, in contrast to the earlier case, truthful communication from politician i to minister j in equilibrium depends upon the policy assignment. Thus, the characterization of the communication structure given by Lemma 1 implies that our earlier result in Proposition 1—namely, that private conversation leads to fully centralized authority—can be reversed once we allow for public meetings. So formal power‐sharing agreements in a multimember executive that meets in cabinet may be optimal. We illustrate this possibility with a simple example with four politicians and a generic set of biases.            "
"30","Example 1.Suppose that . Biases are , , , and , where ε is a positive quantity smaller than β.8 We compare four assignments: full decentralization, leadership by politician 2 (the most moderate politician), and two forms of power‐sharing agreements between politicians 2 and 3. In the symmetric power‐sharing agreement politicians 2 and 3 make two decisions each; in the asymmetric power‐sharing agreement politician 2 makes three choices and politician 3 makes one choice.               "
"31","The analysis requires calculating the welfare‐maximizing equilibria for each of the four assignments and comparing welfare across them. Details are relegated to the appendix. Here, we note that taking the limit for vanishing , the following observations obtain. First, for , all players are fully informed under any of the four considered assignments; at the same time, for  there is no truthful communication regardless of the assignment; in both cases, the optimal assignment entails selecting the most moderate politician 2 as the unique leader. Second, for  politicians 1 and 4 are willing to communicate truthfully under any power‐sharing agreement, but politician 4 is not willing to share information if politician 2 is the single leader. Third, for  players 1 and 4 are both willing to talk publicly only when the symmetric power‐sharing agreement is in place. Finally, for  there is no advantage from assigning any choice to player 3 instead of player 2. Our result is summarized as follows.            "
"32","Result 1.Suppose that  with  and  and compare leadership by 2, full decentralization, and power‐sharing agreements between 2 and 3, under public communication of information with common state. As ε goes to 0, the following holds: For  or  it is optimal to select 2 as the leader. For  the optimal assignment is the symmetric power‐sharing agreement of 2 and 3. For  the optimal assignment is the asymmetric power sharing agreement where 2 makes three choices and 3 makes one choice.               "
"33","The fact that full‐authority centralization is always optimal when conversations are private, though not necessarily when there are public meetings, together with the observation that private and public communication equilibria coincide when all authority is granted to a single leader, provides a striking result: The possibility of cabinet meetings induces a Pareto improvement."
"34","This result, one of the main findings of our article, holds independently of whether private conversations take place alongside cabinet deliberations. The above argument is, evidently, conclusive when private conversations are ruled out. To assess the opposite case, note that private conversation may always involve babbling in equilibrium. Then, because we always select the Pareto optimal equilibrium of any communication game, it immediately follows that the argument developed above holds also when cabinet discussion may be supplemented with a private exchange of views between policy makers. We state our finding formally:            "
"35","Proposition 2.Suppose that the state θ is common across policies k. For generic ideologies , the optimal assignment of decision‐making authority when information is exchanged in cabinet meetings Pareto dominates any authority assignment when information is exchanged only privately.               "
"36","Proposition 2 bears important consequences for optimal executive structure. It shows that if politicians in  can assign authority optimally, then imposing a cabinet structure to the executive—a public meeting at a designated time and place where ministers provide the information relevant to their decisions—induces a Pareto improvement over other forms of executive governance. In particular, cabinet government Pareto dominates an executive where individual ministers implement policy but are not bound to share policy‐relevant information.         "
"37","We have seen that when conversations with ministers take place in private, the optimal executive is centralized with a single decision maker. A multimember executive that meets in cabinet can, however, outperform a single‐member executive. This provides a normative justification for cabinet governance. What is the optimal assignment of authority within a cabinet? An analysis of Result 1 suggests that it is nonmonotonic in the level of disagreement between politicians and that centralization is optimal in the two polar cases, those with very high or very low agreement. The next result formalizes this intuition for our general setting.            "
"38","Proposition 3.Let  be the most moderate politician, that is, "
"39","When politicians have similar ideological preferences, there are few strategic constraints on communication in the parliament. In particular, even a relatively extreme politician can communicate with the most moderate one. Since information can then be aggregated regardless of the specific allocation of authority, it is better that power is centralized to a single moderate politician. When disparity in the ideological views of the politicians is large, communication with ministers is not possible and so, from a welfare perspective, it is desirable that the decision maker respects the diversity of viewpoints. Again, the most moderate politician is best placed to do so, so power should be centralized. The fact that a multimember cabinet can sometimes be optimal, as a direct consequence of Proposition 2 and Example 1, completes the proof of the claim.         "
"40","Combining Propositions 2 and 3 provides an answer to the question posed in our introduction: In the absence or ambiguity of constitutional guidelines, to what extent should power be centralized? Our results reveal that when information aggregation is not an important consideration—even relative extremists can communicate to the center, or politicians do not communicate at all–full centralization is desirable. But when information aggregation is more sensitive to the allocation of authority, it is better that power is shared in a multimember cabinet.         "
"41","Beyond this insight, what does the optimal allocation of authority within a cabinet look like? There are subtle considerations that make it difficult to provide a precise answer. However, note that in the example described in Result 1, the optimal allocation is single peaked around the moderate politician. One might conjecture then that this is a general property of the optimal authority allocation in cabinets.9 This conjecture, as our next example shows, is incorrect.            "
"42","Example 2.Suppose  and assume that  for all . In this case, one can easily show that the optimal allocation of authority  is . That is, one policy is allocated to politician 3, five are allocated to politician 4, and the remaining one is allocated to politician 6. Optimal equilibrium communication involves only politicians 4 and 5 communicating truthfully; all other politicians babble.               "
"43","Here the optimal allocation of authority is not single peaked; whereas the most moderate politician 4 has the largest share of authority, her immediate neighbor 5 has none, and politician 6 has some. To provide intuition for this surprising result, consider an alternative single‐peaked allocation . This closely resembles  except that the policy allocated to politician 6 under  is now given to politician 5. This transfer of authority makes the allocation more concentrated toward the moderate politician 4 and so better reflects the diversity of politicians' views. However, under this single‐peaked allocation, less information is aggregated.         "
"44","To understand why, focus on the incentive for politician 5 to communicate truthfully. Under the alternative and suboptimal allocation , politician 5 has an incentive to misreport a low signal to other cabinet members as doing so would bias their decisions toward her ideal point. Under the optimal allocation, by contrast, her incentive to misreport a low signal to 3 and 4 is offset by its effect on politician 6, who is now included in the cabinet. Misreporting a low signal could bias politician 6's action far away from 5's bliss point. So we see that whereas 5 communicates truthfully in the optimal allocation, she does not do so in the single‐peaked allocation.         "
"45","An intriguing implication of our finding is that the set of ministers included in the cabinet is not ideologically connected. The prediction that they will be connected arises in classic models of coalition formation (Axelrod 1970), though this result can be overturned in noncooperative bargaining models (Austen‐Smith and Banks 1990). From our information aggregation creating “holes” in the cabinet—so that moderate politicians are bypassed for more extreme ones—provides better incentives for communication and disciplines politicians who otherwise would misrepresent their views.         "
"46","Till now, we have considered a small group of politicians. Since parliament is a large representative body, and those on the government payroll can represent a significant fraction (in the United Kingdom, of around 650 members of Parliament, roughly 20% play some role in government), it is interesting to observe the optimal allocation of authority in the limit case as the number of politicians becomes large. In doing so, we provide a strong characterization result: All decision‐making authority should be concentrated to politicians who are ideologically close to the most moderate one.            "
"47","Proposition 4.Suppose that biases ,  are i.i.d. and drawn from a distribution with connected support with mean  For every small , there exists a possibly large  so that for all , with at least  probability, the fraction of decisions in the optimal assignment concentrated to politicians with biases b such that  is larger than "
"48","The proof of Proposition 4 consists of two parts. First, we show that when all decisions are allocated to a single politician i and parliament grows large, the decision maker becomes fully informed. Second, we compare the case where all decisions are allocated to the most moderate politician to that where some decisions are allocated to a less moderate one. As the parliament becomes large, the aggregate residual variance obtained in each of these assignments vanishes. The difference in the aggregate ideological loss of these assignments is, however, bounded below.         "
"49","It is important to stress that Proposition 4 does not imply that welfare is equivalent in large parliaments that adopt cabinet meetings and ones where communication with decision makers is private. In fact, our normative justification for cabinet governance holds for any size majority, including large ones.         "
"50","This section studies optimal assignment of decision‐making authority when each politician's information is policy specific, so that only politician k receives a signal about  for each policy k. We begin by characterizing equilibrium communication.            "
"51","Lemma 2.Suppose that information is policy specific. The profile  is an equilibrium if and only if, whenever politician k is truthful to "
"52","Since each politician has only one signal and that signal is informative of only one policy decision, the amount of information held by politician  depends only on whether k is truthful. Hence, whether k is truthful (or not) does not depend on the communication strategy of any other politician. Further, because each politician is informed on one policy only, and this policy may be assigned to a single policy maker, there is no difference between private conversations and cabinet meetings.         "
"53","This characterization of information transmission bears the following implication. The possibility that a politician k truthfully communicates her signal to the minister  to whom decision k is assigned is independent of any other assignment. Hence, for all choices k, the optimal assignment  can be selected independently of other assignments. The optimal assignment is to allocate decision k to the politician j who maximizes:            "
"54","Simplifying the above expression, and using Lemma 2, we see that the optimal selection of  takes a simple form when information is policy specific; policy decision k should be assigned to either the most moderate politician  or to the most moderate politician  informed of k, that is, to  depending on whether            "
"55","Because for any j, the quantity  is the average ideological loss, whereas the information gain is 1/36, we may summarize our analysis as follows.            "
"56","Lemma 3.When information is policy specific, each decision k is optimally assigned to either the most moderate informed politician  or to the most moderate one  depending on whether the difference in average ideological loss is smaller or greater than the informational gain.               "
"57","With the above characterization, we now show that although policy‐specific information might lead one to believe that full decentralization is optimal, this is, in fact, never the case.            "
"58","Proposition 5.Despite policy‐specific information, full decentralization is never optimal for generic ideologies . The most moderate politician  is assigned the policies of sufficiently moderate and of sufficiently extreme‐bias expert politicians, but not necessarily the policies of intermediate‐bias politicians.               "
"59","The complete proof of this proposition is provided in the appendix; here we convey the main intuition behind the result. Because moderate policy experts are willing to inform the most moderate politician  it is optimal that she is given authority on these policies. Since extreme policy experts are willing to communicate only with extreme politicians, it is better to let the (uninformed) most moderate politician decide. Only for intermediate policies k, it is suboptimal that the most moderate politician decides.         "
"60","Our result relates to Dessein (2002), who shows, in a different environment, that it is optimal for a decision maker to delegate authority to an expert with a small bias and a signal from a continuum. We show that decentralization is not optimal with policy‐specific information; instead, it is better that the most moderate politician is assigned the decisions of moderate experts. The difference arises because our model has binary signals instead of continuous ones. Nevertheless, our result that full decentralization is never optimal still holds if signals are continuous: Then, the decision of extreme experts should be optimally assigned to the most moderate politician.         "
"61","We have analyzed the optimal structure of the executive restricting our model to the set of institutions that allow for assignment of decision‐making authority to individuals with collective deliberation over outcomes, two of the core features of cabinet governance found in parliamentary democracies. Our main results focus on the case where uncertainty over policy outcomes is generated by a shock that affects all policies. Then we show that cabinet meetings, which provide a mechanism for information made available to one minister to be available to all decision makers, can improve the quality of policies implemented: They allow for more policy‐relevant information to be aggregated than would be the case in their absence. We then analyzed the optimal degree of centralization of executive power and showed that it is nonmonotonic in the ideological divergence in the majority party: For intermediate levels of divergence, it is optimal for power to be shared between cabinet ministers; otherwise, it is optimal for power to be concentrated to the most moderate politician. Surprisingly, when power is shared in a cabinet of ministers, in the optimal allocation, the set of ministers with decision‐making authority need not be ideologically connected. In large cabinets, however, authority should be concentrated to the most moderate politicians. Overall, our results highlight the desirability of a centralized governing executive that holds cabinet meetings. We ask whether this depends upon the dispersion of policy‐relevant expertise. Surprisingly, in the case where shocks are policy specific and a single politician is imperfectly informed about its effects, the degree of centralization is no less centralized."
"62","The two informational environments we have considered—perfect correlation and independence—are the classic ones most studied in game‐theoretical applications, for example, with respect to auctions. We thus take them as the natural starting point for our investigation into optimal executive structure. An obvious question is whether our core insights are robust to the imposition of a mixed case. Our preliminary investigations reveal that “this is in fact so” the case: The results developed here are not confined to the two cases we study, and the trade‐offs we have highlighted are indeed relevant to the mixed case.10"
"63","Finally, we highlight several areas for further research. Our work establishes a normative benchmark for evaluating the assignment of decision‐making authority to heads of executive departments in parliamentary democracies. In practice, the assignment of decision‐making rights is carried out by a prime minister who is answerable to the parliamentary majority. As noted by Strøm (2000), this creates a “singular chain” of delegation, from the parliamentary majority to a prime minister and the heads of departments, that distinguishes parliamentary democracies from presidential ones.11 Thus, our analysis reveals the delegation patterns of a prime minister who maximizes the welfare of a parliamentary majority. Since the class of parliamentary democracies is large, there are, of course, several variations from this ideal type that could be considered. For example, in some parliamentary democracies, the assignment is to a senior executive head shadowed by a junior minister within the same department.12 In other parliamentary democracies, such as Israel, the cabinet votes over policy rather than delegating the decision to a single minister. And, of course, the assignment of authority might be part of a prime minister's strategic plan, and so her objectives may conflict with those of members of her government and the majority in parliament. A further extension might consider how centralized authority affects the interaction between party elites and voters, whose actions jointly determine the ideological composition of the assembly, as well as how the degree of centralization of decision‐making authority responds to party control over nomination of the members of parliament. All of these substantive applications could be approached within the current modeling framework, though we have not done so here.         "
"64","Further lines of inquiry can be addressed within our framework, but they would involve more extensive modifications of the model. Here we have assumed that the parliamentary majority assigns decision‐making authority to ministers, having in mind the fusion of legislative and executive powers found in many parliamentary democracies. Our model could be modified so that the parliamentary majority nominates agenda setters whose proposal needs then to be formally approved by the parliament. More generally, the parliamentary majority could assign authority to committees rather than to individuals. As these lines of inquiry require significant changes to the model, we defer them to future research."
