"1","This empirical section is divided into two parts. The first section shows that in the last three elections for the French National Assembly there has been a significant male advantage among candidates of otherwise similar characteristics. Let us recall that for the main point of the article to hold, and for the theoretical model to be meaningful, proving the existence of such a male advantage is all that matters. However, we will then provide some interesting side results about the potential sources of the observed male advantage.         "
"2","Our data are mainly based on information collected from the website of the French National Assembly.17 The website provides, among other things, biographical information on candidates in 2002 elections, their party affiliation and incumbency status, and the district‐by‐district first‐ and second‐round results in both the 1997 and 2002 elections, together with abstention rate of each district. We have then collected the same data from the 2007 Assembly elections, in order to verify whether the findings from the 2002 data are robust or if there are significant changes.18 We have also obtained age data from http://www.fluctuat.net/. Finally, some of the data were given to us by the Centre de Données Socio‐Politiques. In order to avoid difficulties associated with variable number of parties and the resulting strategic voting behavior, we focus on those districts where election went to the second round and where the two second‐round candidates were from the two main party coalitions of the 2002 elections, PS and UMP.19Table 1 gives some descriptive statistics for 2002 in terms of the frequency of the various “types” of runoffs.20"
"3","The goal here is to establish the presence of male advantage in the 2002 elections. We will then see that some degree of male advantage remains also in 2007, but to a lower extent."
"4","For observation/candidate j , we assume a linear model of the form yj=βXj+ɛj. Different specifications are estimated, but in the basic one yj is candidate j's percentage of votes (henceforth score) in the second round of the 2002 (resp. 2007) elections. Besides a variable measuring the male advantage, which we describe next, the vector Xj of controls includes the score in the second round of the 1997 (resp. 2002) election obtained by the candidate of the same district and same party as candidate j.21 This party‐ and district‐specific variable accounts for the aggregate preference toward a specific party within each district. It also serves the purpose of controlling for the fact that women might be sent to “worse” districts than men. A second control is age difference between opponents in the same district, since a candidate's age is plausibly correlated with his or her perceived quality or experience (we deal with other indirect tests of the role of experience below). We also control for the difference of the square of their age.22 Finally, we control for party affiliations, since they could be correlated to the gender bias. This is done by including an indicator variable that takes value 1 if the candidate is from UMP and 0 if he or she is from PS. A constant term is also included, which represents the average score of a candidate in 2002 (resp. 2007) when all other regressors were zero.23 Error terms (ɛj) follow standard assumptions imposed by the ordinary least squares estimation method.24"
"5","The key regressor is the male advantage. It can be measured by a variable that takes value 1 if a male has a female opponent, 0 if the two candidates are of the same gender, and −1 if a female has a male opponent. We will also show, although it is not crucial to our argument, that the implicit symmetry assumption—namely that woman versus woman is just like man versus man and that the advantage of a man incumbent (respectively, new man candidate) over a woman is equivalent to the disadvantage of a woman incumbent (respectively, new woman candidate) with respect to a man—is actually supported by the data."
"6"," Table 2 reports estimation results for 2002. Specifications (1) and (2) only use new candidates while specifications (3) and (4) use incumbents.25 Specifications (1) and (3) control for the type of the opponent (either a new candidate, a 1997 loser, or a 1997 winner that was moved to a different district): for (1) the excluded category is an incumbent opponent and for (3) it is a new candidate opponent. These dummies are jointly statistically significant (p‐value <0.1) in specification (1) but not in specification (3) (p‐value > 0.1), and thus we also report (2) and (4) where those dummies are excluded. Own party score in 1997 and the party position are statistically significant in every specification. Not surprisingly, the effect of own party score in 1997 is positive.26 Age difference has a positive impact on score for both new candidates and incumbents, but is statistically significant only for new candidates.            "
"7","The main finding is a statistically significant male advantage, which is observed for both new candidates and incumbents irrespective of the specification.27Table 5 shows how this effect differs when a woman faces a woman, a woman faces a man, and a man faces a woman, from the baseline where a man faces a man. We show that the hypothesis that woman versus woman is not different from man versus man and that the advantage of a man versus a woman equals the disadvantage of a woman against a man cannot be rejected (this is termed the symmetry hypothesis in the table). In the same table, one can notice from columns 3b and 4b that female incumbents suffered a statistically significant disadvantage.            "
"8","One question to ask is to what extent the male advantage is a stable phenomenon or to what extent it was simply a transient one, perhaps determined by the sudden influx of less‐experienced female candidates due to the introduction of parity. Table 3 presents results for the 1997 and 2007 data. For 1997 we cannot separate new candidates and incumbents and many regressors are missing. Table 6 presents regressions that help us to assess the bias in the estimate of male advantage in the 1997 data due to the confounding of incumbency and male advantage as well as the impact of the other missing regressors. Specifications (10) and (11) divide the data by party and include a dummy regressor for incumbency. This allows us to see that the male advantage is about two‐thirds of the incumbency advantage. Specification (5b) mimics the 1997 specification using the 2002 data. This gives an estimate of male advantage about 25% higher than the estimate in 1997 and thus suggests that the male advantage prior to the 2002 election might have been slightly weaker. Clearly, the data from 1997 and 2007 do not allow us to reject the hypothesis of a stable presence of male advantage.            "
"9","Coming back to the 2002 data, one interesting question is to what extent the male advantage mattered, looking for the impact of gender on the probability of winning. Table 4 presents logit estimates of the determinants of a win (win equals one and lose equals zero) using the same regressors as for the specifications presented in Table 2. In both specifications (6) and (8) the joint hypothesis that the effect of the type of opponent (new, 1997 loser, or was moved district) is equal to zero cannot be rejected (p‐value > 0.1). For both new candidates and incumbents, all other regressors have the expected sign and are statistically significant. For a male, having an opponent of opposite gender increases the probability of winning—and for a woman it decreases it. The popularity of a candidate's party in 1997 has a significant positive effect. The older the candidate with respect to his or her opponent, the more likely he or she is to win, but this effect is decreasing as the age difference increases. Finally, everything else being equal, the UMP candidates were more likely to win in 2002.            "
"10","To summarize, men have a statistically higher score when they face a female candidate. A man facing a woman gets between 1 and 2 percentage points boost in his score compared to a case where he faces a man. Although this advantage may seem small in magnitude, it had an important impact for the candidates' probability of winning in 2002. Using specification (7) we compute the probability of winning for a new male candidate who runs against a female to be 22 percentage points higher than against a male (this is computed setting all other regressors at their sample mean values).28 Similar computations using specification (9) reveal that the equivalent gain for incumbent males is 10 percentage points.            "
"11","In this section we highlight what our data analysis can yield in terms of the likelihood of the various sources of male advantage that one could intuitively refer to."
"12","As already pointed out in the introduction, the male advantage we have identified among incumbents tends to prove that differential experience cannot be the only source of the male bias. Moreover, we estimated specifications (1) and (2) on a subsample of young candidates (more specifically, using the subsample of candidates who are younger than the youngest incumbent in our sample). The estimates of the male advantage are still statistically significant (and the coefficient estimate is actually larger at about 0.028 and 0.023 in each specification), in spite of the fact that in that subsample the office‐holding experience must be minimal for any gender (although of course there could still be some unobservable systematic differences at local or regional levels)."
"13","Next, we reject the hypothesis that the male bias in 2002 comes from a party bias. This hypothesis consists of asserting that the difference in the score of female candidates can be due to females being sent by biased party leaders to less favorable districts. Note first that our regressions control for the score of the party in the candidate's district in the previous election, and hence, unless there are important changes in between elections in terms of which districts are difficult to win, the regressions themselves are already basically separating the male advantage from the party‐ and district‐specific characteristics. A party bias would take the form of a correlation between gender and the expected score of candidates. In Figure 1, we divide the range of 1997 scores into intervals of 2.5% and present the ratio of new men candidates in districts falling in each interval. It turns out that women are sent to districts where the average 1997 score is equal to 44.7% while men average is 45.5%. Both a t‐test (p‐value = 0.31) and a Wilcoxon/Mann‐Whitney test (p‐value = 0.17) cannot reject that the two are equal.29 In other words, no party has shown a biased preference for men over women in “good” districts where it did not have an incumbent.            "
"14","                 Percentage of New Male 2002 Candidates as a Function of 1997 Score of Own Party                         "
"15","In contrast with the 2002 elections, in 2007 we find some evidence of party bias: the 2002 score of the districts where women were sent as candidates in 2007 averaged 45.8%, and for men it is 47.9%. These are statistically different using both the t‐test (p‐value = 0.005) and the Wilcoxon/Mann‐Whitney test (p‐value = 0.017)."
"16","Another way parties could treat women differently is by giving them less funding for the campaign. There does not seem to be any evidence of this in 2002. In fact, one party gave on average more to its female candidates. There is, however, a big difference across parties. The UMP gave 10,000 Euros to many of its candidates (the median of what it gave is 10,000 Euros) while the PS gave nothing to a majority of them (its median is 0). The UMP gave on average 9,443 Euros to its female and 9,423 Euros to its male candidates. The PS gave 1,496 Euros and 1,730 Euros to its female and male candidates, respectively. Using a t‐test, for neither party are these numbers statistically different, while using the Wilcoxon/M‐W test it is at the 10% level for the UMP (in which case women were treated more favorably than men). Given the conclusion that the experience factor and party bias were not relevant nor present in 2002, it leaves voters' bias as the most likely explanation for the male advantage.            "
"17","The Assembly deputies are elected with a two‐ballot majority rule. In order to avoid having to deal with strategic voting, in our model we assume that there are only two parties, so that the system is equivalent to one‐ballot plurality. Downs (1957) defines a political party as “a coalition of men seeking to control the governing apparatus by legal means,” where by coalition he means “a group of individuals who have certain ends in common and cooperate with each other to achieve them.” A simple way to operationalize this definition in a theoretical framework is to view a party as a “coalition of incumbents seeking re‐election.” Given the importance of incumbent politicians in any party hierarchy, it is clear that any party leader will have at least two objectives in mind when choosing the composition of the party candidate list: the maximization of the number of seats the party will obtain and the maximization of the chances of reelection of the party's incumbent politicians.30 For simplicity we will also assume that all incumbents are men.         "
"18","The crucial simplifying assumption of the theoretical model is that if a man candidate runs against a woman, he is elected no matter what the voters of that district think of the candidates' policy platforms. This very strong form of male bias is assumed in order to make computations manageable, but the qualitative results do not change if a weaker form of male bias is considered."
"19","Before turning to the more general model, it is important to illustrate the basic intuition. Suppose that we just needed to explain why men incumbents can prefer a “pure” parity law to the status quo without parity. We could give the explanation by means of a simple example: suppose that the country is divided into two districts, so that the Assembly is composed of two incumbents, i.e., the previously elected deputies of those two districts; suppose also that the two incumbents are of the two major parties and that they must run in the district where they were elected (either because it would be illegal or because voters would punish such a switch). If no parity law is passed, the chances of reelection of an incumbent depend on the realization of voters' policy preferences in his district, whereas if a pure parity law is passed, each incumbent is sure to run against a woman (as the men quota will be used by the other incumbent running in his own district), and hence there is an additional advantage, inducing a higher probability of reelection (probability 1 in the case of the extreme gender bias mentioned above). However, explaining why they passed a law that allows parties to pay fees to violate parity is not possible by means of a simple example and requires a more explicit analysis of all the politicians' incentives."
"20","Let the two parties be denoted by L and S. There is a set [0, 1] of districts. The current Assembly is composed of the candidates who were elected in the previous elections and are still in office. Districts in [0, λ) have an incumbent of party L, whereas districts in [λ, 1] have an incumbent of party S. We assume without loss of generality that λ≥ 0.5 (party L is the large party).         "
"21","At time 0, the deputies vote for a value of c∈[0, ∞], the fee a party needs to pay to circumvent parity in a district. If c= 0, there is no limit to the number of men running in the country for the same party, that is, there is no parity requirement (the status quo). If c=∞, it is illegal to have more than 50% of men running, the pure parity case. If 0 < c < ∞, the law allows parties to send men to any extra measure of districts beyond 50% provided the party pays fees equal to c times that extra measure. We need to prove that the vote outcome can be a positive and finite c, such that fees are paid in equilibrium under some realization of policy preferences.         "
"22","At time 1, lists are composed. That is, each party decides whom to run in each district. Incumbents are assumed to rerun in their district if their party decides to run a man in that district. Also, we assume that incumbents cannot shift from their home district to another one. Consequently, if a man runs in a district where the party did not win the previous election, then this man is a new candidate.31 At time 2, voting takes place. In each district, voters vote for the candidate they prefer. There are only two candidates in each district, hence no strategic voting takes place.         "
"23","Voters differ in their platform preferences, which can change over time, but they also have very strong gender preferences: being in favor of the platform of one party translates into a vote for that party unless that party's candidate is a woman running against a man. In the time elapsing between time 0 and time 2, voters' platform preferences may change. At time 2, districts [0, z) prefer the platform of party L, and [z, 1] are in favor of the platform of S. The implicit assumption here is that in any possible new realization of voters' platform preferences it cannot happen that district i has a majority of S platform supporters and a district i′ > i has a majority of L supporters. This order assumption allows us to simplify the treatment of uncertainty at time 0, since in this way the uncertainty is just about the parameter z. The uncertainty about z is greater at time 0 than at time 1. For simplicity, we assume that it is known at time 1, whereas only the probability distribution is known at time 0.32"
"24","The utility of an incumbent of party p,p∈{L, S}, depends on the fraction of seats obtained by his party in the time 2 election, denoted by Np; on whether or not he is reelected; and on the budget of the party, which is affected by the total cost paid by the party to circumvent parity, denoted by Cp. Formally, for all i∈[0, λ)            "
"25","Consistent with the Downsian view of a party discussed at the beginning of this section, we define a party as the aggregation of its incumbents. Consequently, we assume that the utility of a party is the sum of the utilities of its incumbents:             "
"26","Parity means that there needs to be 50% of candidates of each gender for each party. Any deviation from that gender distribution entails a marginal cost of c, so that            "
"27","Given all the assumptions above, we have our main theoretical finding:"
"28","Proposition 1:   If b is small and a is large (i.e., reelecting an incumbent is important for a party but the marginal utility of a new seat is small unless it allows the party to obtain the majority), then there exist well‐behaved probability distributions of voters' platform preferences such that, at the constitutional choice stage (at time 0), a “parity with fees” system is unanimously preferred to the no‐parity system, and is preferred by a majority to the pure parity system.             "
"29","The formal proof is in the appendix. The intuition is similar to the one given for the two‐district case as far as the reason for preferring pure parity to the status quo. The intuition for the additional result that parity with fees can dominate even pure parity is as follows: given that a party is a coalition of incumbents and hence reelecting incumbents has priority over electing new candidates, the larger party wants a parity law in order to protect its incumbents in the states of the world in which platform preferences happen to favor party S, but given that L's incumbents are more than 50%, pure parity is dominated by a system where even the other λ− 0.5 incumbents can be protected (with some probability) by paying fees. A small b and a relatively large a are needed so that there exist values of c for which parties are ready to pay the fee only if it allows an incumbent to run: indeed, if no such value of c exists, parity with fees cannot be optimal as either the party would refuse to pay to allow one more incumbent to run, or, if the party pays, the opponent party also pays and the incumbent runs against a man, thereby losing his seat anyway. There are restrictions on the class of admissible distribution functions because the uncertainty to be reelected needs to be sufficiently large: if a large fraction of incumbents is sure to be reelected, they may have no incentive to pass the law as it doesn't increase the probability that their party wins the election, and it is likely to impose a cut in the budget of the party. However, as one can verify in the appendix, the conditions on a, b, and on the skewness of the probability distribution to obtain consensus on parity with fees are very reasonable.            "
"30","As a corollary of proposition 1, one could easily check from its formal proof that the expected number of women elected given parity law (with fees allowed) is zero. The result is thus very sharp: not only is the parity law as it passed in France perfectly consistent with the self‐interest of the male incumbents, as proved by proposition 1, but it is also completely ineffective in terms of the official goals. Of course, using a less extreme type of gender bias than that of this simple model, we could determine a positive (but small) number of expected women elected. In fact, the model could be easily extended relaxing the assumption that a male candidate always wins against a female candidate. We could assume instead that, when voters prefer the political platform of his opponent's party, a male candidate's probability of winning is some interior g > 1/2 if the opponent is a woman.            "
"31","Leaving probability 1 of victory in the easier case in which platform preferences are also in his favor, the only change would then be that the expected utility for the party at time 1 of having one additional incumbent running in a district where the voters' preferences have switched decreases. Consequently, the optimal parity with fees system would become one associated with a lower c. The equilibrium number of women elected would be strictly positive (but small) in this simple extension. Another (more interesting) extension could be to assume that parties are “more” than a simple coalition of incumbents. There may well be other potential candidates, besides the incumbents, whose election would increase the party utility by b+a, and who come from districts where the other party has an incumbent.            "
"32","Such an extension is particularly relevant for France, as many right‐wing deputies elected in 1995 lost their seats in 1997 due to the huge (unexpected) victory of the socialist party, and ran again in 2002.33 Given the marginal utility for a party to have those candidates running, the equilibrium number of fees paid by the parties increases for most values of z, with the possible outcome that both parties pay fees simultaneously, in accordance with what has been observed. This would not affect, however, our main result. Indeed, even if the probability of having to run against a man increases (as the opponent party is more likely to pay the fee and have a male candidate), it is still optimal to have a parity with fees system as it both guarantees that incumbents are still allowed to run, and it increases their probability of running against a woman, in the case where no opponent party member looks for election in that district.            "
"33","An important corollary of our proposition is that parity may affect the party composition of the Assembly (and hence policies) when voters' platform preferences change with respect to the status quo. The number of seats won by the large party that is losing support in terms of platform preferences is (weakly) larger than if parity was not applied. Thus, the introduction of parity reduces the variance of party composition."
"34","In the previous sections we have first proved empirically the existence of male bias in the electorate, and then we have shown how the ex ante incentives of deputies and the ex post results were both consistent with a simple rational choice explanation based on male bias itself. In this section we aim to show the corresponding incentives of Senators, although no formal model nor empirical tests are necessary for this chamber.         "
"35","A Senator's term was nine years at the time of the 2002 elections (it was reduced to six years in July 2003), and a fraction of the Senate is recomposed every three years. The country is divided into a few large districts, and, depending on the population of the district, a number of Senators, ranging from 1 to 12, is elected in each district. If the number of seats to be allocated is equal to or below a threshold, then a two‐round plurality system is in order and parity does not apply. If the number is above the threshold, then the system is closed‐list proportional representation (CPR). In this case, parity means that in a party list there cannot be two consecutive candidates of the same gender. The threshold was equal to two in 2001 and to three in 2004."
"36","An essential feature of the senatorial elections is that the set of voters is composed of grands electeurs only, and about 95% of them are municipality deputies. They had no say in the passing of the parity law, but they tried to influence it through their Senators. Municipal elections are two‐round list elections. A list can run in the second round if it obtains 10% or more in the first round. The seat allocation rule is proportional with a 50% seat bonus to the winner. For instance, if a party wins the second‐round elections with 40% of the votes and 60 seats are to be allocated, then it will get 30 + (0.40 * 30) = 42 seats, and the remaining 18 seats are allocated among the other parties proportionally to their second‐round score. The implementation of the parity law at the municipal level has this property: out of each set of subsequent six candidates in a party list, three have to be women. The only freedom which is left to the parties is the position of the women within each set of six candidates. Given the electoral rule and the amounts of seats allocated in each municipality (varying between 29 and 67), the parity law is bound to have a huge effect on the gender composition of the municipal assemblies, and a lot of incumbents must lose their seat. A fraction of them must be thrown out of the list.34 Under the pressure of their grands electeurs, Senators obtained the amendment that parity would not apply in municipalities with less than 3,500 inhabitants, whereas Assembly deputies first proposed it to apply to all municipalities with more than 2,000 inhabitants. Senators also proposed to remove the three women out of six candidate rule, but it was maintained. The percentage of women elected in the municipalities with more than 3,500 inhabitants went up from 25.7% to 47.5% (thereby making the fraction of women elected in municipal councils rise from 21.7% to 33%).         "
"37","Protecting their electorate was not the only concern of the Senators: they also had to protect their own seats.35 Out of the 74 (resp., 72) incumbent Senators looking for reelection in 2001 (resp., 2004) in districts where CPR applies, only five (resp., 8) were women. Before the law was passed, Senators tried to obtain the amendment that no alternating gender rule apply for the senatorial elections, but failed.36 Nevertheless, only 20 seats—28%—(resp., 26—32.9%) went to female candidates. Given the number of districts where parity does not apply and the low effectiveness where it applies, the percentage of women is 16.6%.         "
"38","What did Senators resort to, in order to circumvent the law? The answer is what we call party proliferation.37 Out of the 29 districts where proportional elections were held in 2001 or 2004, party proliferation (incumbents previously elected under the same flag now running under different ones) took place in 11 of them. In eight other cases candidates elected on different lists registered as members of the same senatorial group after the election.38 Finally, in several other districts, candidates previously active in the same party, though new in the senatorial race, ran on different lists, with two examples of such lists obtaining more than 10%. Party proliferation has clearly been a wide phenomenon in both elections, which explains the low effectiveness of parity (see Sineau 2002).39"
"39","Let us now analyze more closely the phenomenon of strategic party proliferation in CPR. We first describe the conditions under which party proliferation is most likely to happen. Then we study its effect on the party composition of the Assembly."
"40","The cost of creating a party is relatively low for the Senators. Given the grands electeurs system and the size of the districts, the actual number of votes needed to obtain a seat varies between 260 and 892. Moreover, those are councillors themselves and Senators have regular opportunities to meet them. Let us consider a party likely to obtain a score of s and an associated number of k seats, with k male incumbents. Let k  be an even number. It seems reasonable to assume that the incumbent's advantage is decreasing among candidates from the leader of the list to the kth elected: popularity decreases with rank. Given parity, only  incumbents can be given positions among the first k positions, those leading to a seat with some likelihood. Therefore, the th incumbent is pivotal in the proliferation process. His only chance of being elected is in creating his own list and diverting at least  voters from the main party. This score is necessary, as the score of the main party, down to , is otherwise still superior to k times that of the dissident list. This may not be sufficient, however, since other parties may have a larger d'Hondt score for the last seat and obtain the formerly kth seat of that party. To illustrate this fact, let us consider a district where three parties compete for eight seats and the distribution of scores is (45,27.5,27.5), so that the allocation of seats is (4,2,2). After the parity reform, incumbent 3 of the first party is ejected from the first positions on the list. By running on his own and obtaining 10% of the votes, which corresponds to scores (35,10,27.5,27.5), he would keep his seat. If we compare that result with the situation where there is only one opponent party and the scores are (45,55) before parity and (35,10,55) after proliferation by incumbent 3, we now have a distribution of seats going from (4,4) to (3,0,5). The lower bound in the second situation is now 11 and the scores (33.9,11.1,55) then lead to (3,1,4). Let us also note that any two incumbents ejected from the main party list have no incentive to create a joint list, as, given parity, their joint list would have to win three seats for them both to be elected. Let us assume that the th incumbent is sure to keep his seat if he creates his own list. Then the probability that the th incumbent is elected on the main list decreases, as the new score of the main party may no longer be sufficient to obtain k− 2 seats. Moreover, if the th incumbent is able to be elected by running on his own, then so is the th incumbent, given the assumption that individual popularity decreases with the rank. The prudent strategy by candidate  is therefore to create his own list too, which, in turn, decreases the probability of the th incumbent to be elected.            "
"41","From this simple argument we can infer that proliferation is more likely the more popular is the th incumbent, but the unravelling may determine a situation in which the incumbents who actually are observed making the split are higher in the rank. If k is large, it may be impossible to have a sufficiently large popularity for the th incumbent and, at the same time, a decreasing order of popularity. This leads to the following:            "
"42","Remark:  Party proliferation is more likely when (1) the incumbency advantage is more equal among candidates and (2) the number of incumbents on the list, and/or the number of seats expected by a list, is lower.               "
"43","The example and the reasoning above all assume that the scores are perfectly expected. Proliferation is also more likely when the uncertainty of being elected by running on one's own is lower. When the number of seats to be allocated in a district and the number of relevant parties are larger, then the competition for the last seats to allocate is larger, which increases the uncertainty."
"44","This explains why, given that districts have on average a relatively small number of seats, parity had low effect in the senatorial elections."
"45","Parity may also affect the Assembly composition under CPR. There are two different effects. One is the large‐party effect, which plays in a similar way as under SMD: if a party has more incumbents than half the total number of seats, then it has to lose the votes associated with the incumbency advantage of the incumbents it ejects from the list. Clearly, this may affect the score of the party, and, therefore, the number of seats it expects."
"46","The second effect is directly associated with party proliferation. In the example above, proliferation by incumbent 3 led to a change in the Assembly composition from (4,4) to (3,0,5), which means a shift of one seat from left to right. The example may look extreme, as the proliferation was a failure. However, other examples may be given of successful proliferation affecting the Assembly composition. Consider a district where two parties compete for six seats. The expected scores are (43,57), which would lead to a (3,3) allocation of seats. Assume that, indeed, there are three incumbents out of each platform. Again, we may think that incumbent 3 of the left party can profitably create his own list, thereby preventing incumbent 2 from keeping his own seat. The equilibrium list composition is therefore one where the left party has split into two lists, led by incumbents 1 and 2, respectively. Let us assume that the resulting distribution of votes is (24,19,57), and the resulting seat allocation is (1,1,4): proliferation by left incumbent 2 is successful, but increases the number of seats obtained by the right party."
"47","The composition effect arising from the conflicting interests of an incumbent seeking to keep his seat and a party seeking to maximize the number of seats obtained by candidates sharing its platform is likely to affect both large and small parties. It is well known that under the d'Hondt system a party can never gain by splitting, as the d'Hondt coefficients cannot rise as a result of a split. On the other hand, as it is clear from the example, proliferation is more likely to result in a loss of seats when the d'Hondt coefficient of the party as a whole is the lowest among all parties."
"48","The above characterization of party proliferation has some implications for the advocates of gender quota legislations. Given that the probability of success after the creation of a new list is obviously lower when there is a minimum threshold necessary to obtain seats, one can conjecture that a system with PR, large districts, and a minimum threshold is the most desirable for representation purposes, although in a closed‐list system the details of the law in terms of placement rules are crucial. Another way to create barriers to party proliferation is by enlarging the districts and, correspondingly, the number of seats to allocate in the districts. First, this reduces the expected incumbent's advantage of the pivotal incumbent. Second, as the number of competing parties is larger in larger districts, the competition for the last seats to allocate is larger, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the total number of seats obtained by a platform to the way the total number of votes is divided between the lists obtained by proliferation from one party."
"49","The common criterion used to evaluate representation reforms is the effectiveness of the reform. In the literature on descriptive representation the objective to increase the number of women in politics finds many justifications.40 Among the countries where voluntary or mandatory gender quotas have been attempted, it is clear that the highest effectiveness has been achieved in countries using PR with large districts (see, e.g., Jones 2004, Table 1). It is, therefore, tempting to advocate for changes in the electoral systems toward more proportionality, larger districts, and closed lists.41 Our article moderates this conclusion by focusing on the incentives to pass gender quota reforms under different electoral systems for the incumbents.         "
"50","The incumbents were interested in not losing their positions, and deputies knew they were the least challenged by the reform. Had they passed a pure parity system without allowing for per‐violation fees, and had there been a demand among voters for new female candidates, then of course the law would have been effective. On the other hand, had the reform been more likely to be effective, then deputies would have shown the same opposition to the law as Senators have. Our analysis thus highlights the following trade‐off: when voters are not ready to favor female candidates, reforms are more likely to be passed in contexts where the electoral system will not make them effective.42 This trade‐off is something we expect to be present everywhere given the self‐interest of incumbents, and could inspire future comparative analysis of reforms.         "
"51","A final set of remarks can be made on the comparison between France and other countries that use single‐member district elections for their members of Parliament. A natural question is why parity law has come up in France and not in other countries with similar electoral systems for their deputies. Our conjecture is that this may have to do with the perceived gender preferences of the electorate. In the United States, there seems to be no evidence of voters' hostility against women, nor much evidence in favor of the male conspiracy theory. Thus, there is no “demand side” clear explanation for the low number of women in politics (see, e.g., Darcy, Welch, and Clark 1994; Welch et al. 1985). Implicitly this implies a mostly “supply side” story for the United States. The sharp contrast between our study on the French case and the earlier studies on the United States43 suggests an intriguing hypothesis to be tested in future research: countries where voters' gender bias exists have fewer women than men because of a “demand” bias and are more likely to endogenously generate affirmative action laws; on the other hand, countries like the United States where no voters' demand bias exists, and where therefore the shortage of women in politics is a “supply” issue, are unlikely to have the necessary conditions for the approval of a parity law.
