"1","We focus on two time periods: 1882–2010 and the post‐WWII period, 1946–2010.5 The main dependent variable is the partisan division of seats in state lower houses—more specifically, the Democratic share of seats held by one of the two major parties. We focus on lower chambers because most upper chambers have staggered terms, similar to the U.S. Senate, and many of them are quite small.6 The data on state legislative seats are from Dubin (2007).7 One key independent variable is the partisan division of the vote in gubernatorial elections. This is from the ICPSR and publications by the election officials of each state. Other variables are state personal income and population from the Bureau of Economic Analysis; governor approval ratings from the U.S. Officials’ Job Approval Ratings website; and DW‐Nominate scores from Poole and Rosenthal (2007).            "
"2","Term lengths for governors and state legislators vary across states and over time. Currently, the governors of all states except New Hampshire and Vermont serve four‐year terms. However, at the beginning of the time period studied here, almost a third of the states’ governors served two‐year terms. Most of these states had introduced four‐year terms by the 1960s. Most states with two‐year gubernatorial terms do not have any midterm elections in which only state legislators are elected.8"
"3","There is also some variation in term lengths for state legislators. Currently, in five states the legislators in the lower house have four‐year terms, while the rest have two‐year terms.9 For the upper house, 38 states have four‐year terms, while the remainder have two‐year terms. The majority of the states with four‐year terms have staggered elections, in which half of the legislators are elected every second year. We drop Nebraska after 1936 and Minnesota from 1914 to 1948, since they had nonpartisan legislatures.10"
"4","The dependent variable is distributed quite symmetrically about 0, with a mean of 0.3, a standard deviation of 13.0, and an interquartile range of −5.2 to 4.3. The 5th percentile is at −21.8, and the 95th percentile is at 21.8. The Democrats control the governorship in 54.8% of our midterm elections. One important feature of the data is the large number of close gubernatorial elections, at least outside the south. The gubernatorial election margin variable is distributed symmetrically about 0, with a mean of 0.8, a standard deviation of 9.3, and an interquartile range of −4.2 to 5.9. In nearly half of the elections in our sample (433 out of 873), the winning margin is below 5%."
"5","As usual in studies of electoral politics in the states, we must consider whether the south is exceptional. This is less of a concern for the RDD analyses, since very few of the close gubernatorial races occur in the south, and none until quite recently. In any case, to check for robustness, we ran all of our analyses excluding the south. The results—especially for the postwar period—are essentially the same as those reported here. We present the estimates excluding the south in the online appendix."
"6","We consider three different specifications for estimating the effect of the gubernatorial party on state legislative midterm slumps: (1) OLS, (2) an RDD specification with a flexible control polynomial, and (3) an RDD specification where only close elections are included. The OLS specification quantifies the gubernatorial midterm slump, but it does distinguish between the underlying mechanisms. With the RDD, we can estimate the fraction of the midterm slump that is due to mechanisms based on a gubernatorial party penalty in the midterm elections. Therefore, a comparison of the RDD and OLS estimates allows us to approximate the relative contributions of the two types of mechanisms."
"7","Let t index state legislative election years, and let i index states. Let  be the share of lower house seats won by Democrats in state i in election t; let  be the change in the Democratic seat share in state i between the gubernatorial election at time t−1 and the midterm election at time t; and let  be a dummy variable indicating whether or not state i has a Democratic governor at time t−1. As mentioned in the introduction, we need to take into account the fact that there is a national level of politics above the state level. Ignoring this will not bias the RDD estimates. However, it will introduce noise in the estimates. In each specification we also control for the change in the Democratic share of seats in the U.S. Congress between t−1 and t, , as a proxy for national swings in party popularity.11 In the robustness checks, we show that our conclusions are similar whether or not this variable is included.            "
"8","In the OLS, we estimate the simple relationship between  and :               "
"9","The RDD regressions follow two of the standard RDD approaches. First, we use the full sample and include a control function defined as a low‐order polynomial of the forcing variable, which is the Democratic vote share in the gubernatorial election in state i at time t−1, .12 The basic idea underlying this specification is that the treatment variable, , is entirely determined by the forcing variable, . This means that we can control for potential endogeneity of the treatment variable if we include an adequately flexible control for the forcing variable. We present results for 3rd‐ and 4th‐degree polynomials in the tables below, but we also considered 1st‐ and 2nd‐degree polynomials.13 The specification is then:               "
"10","The second RDD approach is to use the OLS specification, equation (1) above, but limit the sample to “close” elections—i.e., those where the winner’s share of the vote is close to 50%. We follow the typical approach in the RDD literature and use the margin between a party’s vote share and 50% of the two‐party vote share. We consider a variety of different thresholds in election margin to define close elections, including 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 percentage points.14 Our preference is for the tighter thresholds, such as 52%, because it seems unlikely that outcomes of elections where the winner’s vote share is 55% can be considered “as good as random.” We include the less stringent thresholds, however, for two reasons. First, these thresholds are commonly used in the RDD literature. Second, presenting the full battery of estimates shows whether or not the estimates found using tight bounds—which have small sample sizes—are stable as we move away from the threshold and increase the sample size.            "
"11","Following previous RDD work, we begin with a graphical analysis. Figures 1(a)–1(d) show binned averages of the midterm change in Democratic percentage of lower house seats, , as a function of the percentage of votes received by the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, . The range of  in the figures is 40%–60%, which covers 74% of the observations in our sample. The interval for each bin is 1 percentage point. Figure 1(a) is for the full sample from 1882 to 2010, 1(b) limits the sample to nonpresidential election years, 1(c) shows the period up to the end of WWII, and 1(d) shows the period after WWII.15"
"12","                Binned Averages of the Midterm Change in Lower House Seat Share as a Function of the Win/Lose Margin for the Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate"
"13","Note: The bandwidth is 1 percentage point. For those observations with a binned average outside of the range of the y‐axis, we replace the marker with the value of the binned average. In (a) we show the full sample, (b) nonpresidential election years, (c) the pre‐WWII period, and (d) the post‐WWII period.                        "
"14","It seems clear from Figure 1(a) that for the full sample,  falls as we cross the 50% threshold and move from Republican gubernatorial control to Democratic control. The downward shift appears to be around 3–4 percentage points. Note that despite the variation across bins, there are no bins to the left of the threshold with a negative value, and none to the right of the threshold with a positive value. There appears to be some downward trending as well, which is consistent with the reversion‐to‐the‐mean hypothesis, but it is mainly driven by the observations far from the threshold. For example, if we focus on the observations with  between −5% and 5%, then there is little or no trending.            "
"15","The downward shift across the threshold seems to be even larger in nonpresidential years, around 5–6 percentage points, as Figure 1(b) shows. There does not seem to be a clear negative shift across the threshold for the period before WWII, as shown in Figure 1(c). On the other hand, Figure 1(d) shows that for the post‐WWII period, there is a very clear downward shift, in the range of 3–4 percentage points.            "
"16","Overall, while it is difficult to pin down the magnitude, the figures indicate that there is a loss of state legislative seats for the party of the governor. Most importantly, the shifts in the outcome variable around the 50% threshold indicate that this is large due to a gubernatorial midterm penalty, especially in nonpresidential years and the post‐WWII period."
"17","We now turn to regressions. Table 1 presents the main results. Each row of the table represents a different specification, and each column covers a different sample. Column 1 is for the full sample, column 2 covers nonpresidential election years, column 3 covers presidential election years, column 4 covers the period before WWII , and column 5 covers the post‐WWII period. Each cell contains the estimated coefficient on the Democratic governor dummy variable—i.e.,  in equation (1) or (2)—as well as the standard errors in parentheses and number of observations in brackets.            "
"18","The OLS for the full time period (see column 1) shows that there is a midterm slump for the party of the governor of almost 5 percentage points. The estimates for the RDD specifications, all in the range 3.0 to 3.9, show that this slump is mainly driven by a gubernatorial midterm party penalty. All of the estimates are statistically significant at the .05 level, except in the specification limited to the 1% window where the sample size is relatively small. Thus, we can be fairly confident that the party that controls the governor’s office can expect a midterm seat loss in the state lower house of about 3.5 percentage points, which is about three‐fourths of the overall midterm slump.16"
"19","Column 2 shows that the gubernatorial midterm party penalty is even larger in nonpresidential years—over 7 percentage points. The estimated midterm penalty in the RDD specifications ranges from about 4.5 to 5.5 percentage points, except in the specification with a 3rd‐order polynomial where the estimate is even larger. Also, all of the estimates are statistically significant at the 10% level. The relative difference between the OLS and RDD estimates is about the same. By contrast, in presidential years the midterm penalty is much smaller, and none of the coefficients are statistically significant (see column 3). This suggests that the high salience of presidential elections swamps much of state politics in those years.17"
"20","Next, we explore different time periods. Column 4 considers the period 1882–1945. The OLS shows that there is an midterm slump of about 7.5 percentage points. The RDD point estimates are all between −3.3 and −4.5, except for the specification using the 1% win margin. However, the standard errors are much larger than those using the full sample, so none of the coefficients are statistically significant. Moreover, while the sample size is small when we use a 1% margin, the point estimate is essentially zero. Overall, these results suggest that in the pre‐WWII era, we do not see a clear and consistent negative gubernatorial midterm party penalty.18 Thus, the midterm slump in this time period seems to be driven by other factors, such as reversion‐to‐the‐mean‐type mechanisms.            "
"21","Column 5 covers the post‐WWII period, 1946 to 2010. Here, the OLS estimate is much smaller and shows a midterm slump of about 3.5 percentage points. The RDD point estimates are similar in magnitude to those in column 4 (and column 1), around 3.5. However, they are much more precise—the standard errors are less than half as large—so all of the point estimates are statistically significant at the .05 level. Thus, there is a strong and clear gubernatorial midterm party penalty, which accounts for virtually the entire midterm slump in this time period. If we use an interaction term to test for the difference in point estimates, we do not find any sizable or significant difference between the periods. This suggests that the difference between these periods is more about precision in the estimates rather than in size of the estimates."
"22","We also split the data both by time period and presidential/nonpresidential midterm election year. We do not report these results in tables to conserve space, but the patterns are easily summarized. For nonpresidential midterm elections in the post‐WWII period, the estimated effect of gubernatorial control is large and robust across specifications. The RDD estimates range from −5.8 to −7.3, and they are all statistically significant at the .05 level. For nonpresidential midterm elections in the pre‐WWII period, the estimated effect of gubernatorial control is also large in some specifications, but the estimates are less stable than for the post‐WWII period.19 For the two presidential‐year subsamples, the estimates are noticeably smaller and always statistically insignificant.            "
"23","We perform a number of robustness checks to test the validity of our RDD results in Table 1. These are of two types. First, we change the set of control variables in the specification. Secondly, we perform a placebo test where we test whether the party of the governor, , has an effect on the seat‐share change in the previous midterm election, . If the identifying assumptions of the RDD hold, the party of the governor should not have any effect on previous elections. We perform these checks for the full sample and the post‐WWII period.            "
"24","The results are presented in Table 2. The top panel covers the full period 1882–2010, and the bottom panel covers the post‐WWII period, 1946–2010. Each row covers a different RDD specification, and each column covers a different check. As in Table 1, each cell contains the point estimate of the Democratic governor dummy variable—i.e.,  in equation (1) or (2)—the standard error of the estimate in parentheses, and the number of observations in brackets.            "
"25","In column 1 we drop the control for national swings, ND. For the full sample, the point estimates are in the range of −5.6 to −6.0. These are larger than those in the corresponding cells in column 1 of Table 1. The standard errors are also larger, but all of the estimate coefficients are still significant at the .05 level. For the post‐WWII period, the estimates are quite similar to one another, in the range 4.2 to 4.5, and they are only marginally larger than those in the corresponding cells in column 5 of Table 1. Again, all coefficients are statistically significant.            "
"26","In columns 2–4 we add different controls—lagged seat share (column 2), a dummy variable indicating Democratic control of the presidency (column 3), and both variables (column 4). Also, to capture the possibility that the effect of the president is different in presidential election years, we interact the party of the president with the presidential election‐year dummy. In almost all cases, the point estimates decrease slightly compared to the corresponding cells in column 1 of Table 1. However, all but two of the estimates are statistically significant at the .05 level. For the 1946–2010 period, the point estimates are barely affected by the controls. As in Table 1, the estimates imply that control of the governorship leads to an expected seat‐share loss of about 3.5 to 4.0 percentage points.            "
"27","Column 5 shows the placebo tests. Note that the estimates are generally much smaller than the corresponding nonplacebo cases in columns 1 and 5 of Table 1 and the other columns of Table 2; that they exhibit noticeably more variability than the corresponding nonplacebo cases; and that half are negative and half are positive. None of the coefficients are statistically significant at the .05 level and only one of the eight is statistically significant at the .10 level, which is about what we would expect just by chance. Thus, overall these tests provide strong support for our identifying assumptions.            "
"28","While our main analyses focus on lower house elections, we also ran the specifications described above on upper house elections. Table 3 presents the main results. The table has the same structure as Table 1, except it only shows results for two samples—the entire period and the post‐WWII period (these correspond to columns 1 and 5 of Table 1).            "
"29","Table 3 shows that for the full sample the estimated effect of gubernatorial control on midterm elections for the upper house is consistently negative, but smaller than the corresponding estimates in Table 1, and generally statistically insignificant at the .05 level.            "
"30","On the other hand, for the post‐WWII period, the RDD estimates are all negative and uniformly larger than those in column 5 of Table 1. They are also all statistically significant at the .05 level. The range is fairly wide, −3.7 to −7.3, but this is not unexpected given the noise introduced by staggered terms and small upper house size.            "
"31","To incorporate the fact that the share of seats up for election varies across states and elections, we also ran a specification where we interact the treatment effect with the share of seats up for election. Essentially, this estimates the effect on the share of seats won among those that are up for reelection. Since these data are only available for the post‐WWII period, we restrict this analysis to this period. The interaction of the treatment effect gives the expected results. First, it increases the size of the point estimates, which now range between 6 and 12. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it reduces the size of the standard errors relative to the point estimates."
"32","Overall, the results strongly support those in the previous sections: at least in the post‐WWII era, there is a gubernatorial party penalty that causes a party to lose seats in the midterm state legislative elections."
"33","As a point of reference, it is worth considering what the same type of RDD approach yields at the national level, in midterm elections for the U.S. House of Representatives as a function of the party of the president. We run the same basic specifications as those in Table 1—i.e., the national‐level versions of equations (1) and (2)—except that we do not include ND as a regressor since it is the dependent variable.20 We use the Democratic percentage of the two‐party popular vote to define the presidential winning margin.            "
"34","The results are presented in column 1 of Table 4.21 The RDD point estimates are all negative and relatively large. Even though the standard errors are also large due to small sample sizes, the estimates are statistically significant at the .10 level in most specifications. The estimates are larger than those in column 1 of Table 1 and column 1 of Table 2 (top panel). Averaging across the specifications, the negative effect of presidential control on the change in U.S. House seats would appear to be roughly twice as large as the effect of gubernatorial control on the change in state lower house seats. Note, however, that the estimated effects are not much larger than the estimated effects of gubernatorial control on midterms in nonpresidential election years.            "
"35","Column 2 of Table 4 shows the results of placebo tests in which the dependent variable is the previous change in U.S. House seat share—the analog to column 5 of Table 2. In the RDD specifications only two of the coefficients are negative and four are positive. None are statistically significant even at the .10 level.            "
"36","The results above establish that there is a gubernatorial midterm party penalty in state legislative seats of about 3.5 percentage points. The RDD approach establishes that this is not due to a reversion‐to‐the‐mean or surge‐and‐decline–type mechanism. However, the RDD estimates do not allow us to determine whether the midterm penalty is due to, say, balancing or referenda‐type mechanisms. In this section, we attempt to shed more light on this issue. We do this by examining whether the midterm penalty is larger in cases where the theories would predict this. Note that in this section we do not have an “as if random” assignment of key variables used to estimate the importance of various mechanisms. Thus, unlike the results in the previous section, we cannot give a causal interpretation to the estimates here, so any interpretation must be treated with caution."
"37","First, we analyze whether the gubernatorial midterm party penalty is related to midterm elections as referendums on gubernatorial performance. This is simply a state‐level version of Tufte’s (1975) argument for the national level that midterm congressional elections are referendums on presidential performance. The idea is that since voters cannot vote directly on the sitting governor in a midterm election, they use the legislative election to punish the party of a governor who is performing poorly (or, perhaps in some cases, to reward the party of a governor who is performing especially well). This is a plausible hypothesis, since governors are typically the most visible elected officials after the president, and previous work provides evidence that voters reward and punish governors seeking reelection on the basis of state economic performance.22"
"38","We test this hypothesis in three ways. First, we check whether the midterm penalty is larger in states with bad economic performance relative to other states. Second, we check whether the midterm penalty is larger when the sitting governor has a low approval rating. Finally, we check whether the midterm penalty is larger when the incumbent governor’s party does not win reelection in the next gubernatorial election. The idea is that the outcome of the gubernatorial election at t+2 is a proxy for the overall incumbent’s performance during his or her term, including the time leading up to the midterm election. This assumes that performance strongly affects the incumbent party’s reelection probability in gubernatorial elections. It also assumes either that voters are not too myopic, or, if voters are myopic, that overall performance exhibits a high degree of serial autocorrelation (so performance in year 4 of a governor’s term is strongly correlated with his or her performance in year 2).         "
"39","Next, we analyze whether the gubernatorial midterm party penalty is related to policy balancing. Balancing theories predict that voters use midterm elections to balance the policy position of the executive. If there is ideological divergence between Democrats and Republicans, with the median voter’s ideal policy between them, then the policies promoted by the executive will tend to be more extreme than those desired by the median voter. By increasing the power of the opposing party in the legislature, voters can push policy toward the median.23 Balancing occurs in the midterm election at t+1, and not already in the gubernatorial election at t, because the party of the governor is known at the time of the midterm but not at the time of the gubernatorial election.         "
"40","We do not have a good measure of governors’ positions, or state party positions, relative to the median voter. Therefore, we use four proxies. First, we check whether the midterm penalty at t+1 is larger if the governors’ party won full control of the legislature in the election at time t. These will tend to be the cases where there is the greatest need to balance, to undo unified control of the state’s government. Second, we check whether the midterm penalty is greater when the ideological gap between parties at the national level is largest. In the table below, we present results using the overall difference between the parties’ mean Nominate scores in the U.S. House of Representatives. Thus, all of the variation in this gap is across years—large interparty differences around the turn of the twentieth century, much smaller gaps in the 1940–1970 period, and a return to large gaps in the most recent decade or two.24 Third, we can measure the ideological extremism of the subsample of governors who also served in the U.S. House or Senate, using the Nominate scores these individuals produced while in Congress. We then check whether the midterm penalty is larger for governors who are more ideologically extreme. Finally, we check whether the midterm penalty is larger for term‐limited governors. This follows List and Sturm (2006), who argue that term‐limited governors implement policies closer to their ideal points, while those who are up for reelection will moderate their policies in order to win reelection. Note that the last three variables test for rather refined degrees of balancing by voters and are therefore perhaps too demanding.         "
"41","We give the exact definitions of the variables used in Appendix A in the online Supporting Information."
"42","For each of the mechanisms we want to test, we construct a variable, Xit , which takes a high value when we expect a larger treatment effect from the gubernatorial party—i.e., when we expect a larger midterm penalty. We interact this variable with the treatment variable, , so the basic specification is:               "
"43","To see how we interpret the estimates, consider the case of a dichotomous Xit variable, with Xit=0 meaning good performance and Xit=1 meaning poor performance. Then  is the estimated effect of having a Democratic governor when Xit=0, and  is the difference between the estimated effect of having a Democratic governor when Xit=1 and the estimated effect of having a Democratic governor when Xit=0.25 Note also that  is the estimated effect of Xit when . We expect  to be negative if Xit captures a salient mechanism underlying the midterm penalty.            "
"44","For the specifications that use the control polynomial approach, we include the low‐order polynomial terms of the prior gubernatorial vote share, , and also interact these terms with Xit.26"
"45","Again, we begin with a graphical analysis. We take exactly the same approach as in the previous section, except that we split the sample according to the value of Xit and use a different symbol for each subsample. We use circles for the cases where Xit=1 and plus signs for the cases where Xit=0. The results are in Figures 2(a) and 2(b), where we show the differential patterns depending on economic growth and approval ratings.            "
"46","                Binned Averages of the Midterm Change in Lower House Seat Share as a Function of the Win/Lose Margin for the Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate"
"47","Note: The bandwidth is 1 percentage point. For those observations with a binned average outside of the range of the y‐axis, we replace the marker with the value of the binned average. Xit=1 is plotted with circles and Xit=0 with plus signs. In (a) the sample is divided by the growth level, in (b) by the approval rating, and in (c) and (d) by legislative control.                        "
"48","Figure 2(a) shows the plot for income growth. There appears to be a large negative shift in the seat change as we cross the 50% threshold for states with income growth below the median. The seat loss seems to be around 7 to 8 percentage points. For states with income growth above the median, there does not seem to be any shift as we cross the threshold. This suggests there is only a seat‐share loss for the party of the governor in states with poor relative economic performance. Figure 2(b) shows the plot for approval ratings. Again, there only seems to be a negative shift as we cross the threshold when the governor’s relative approval rating is low. The picture is not as clear as in the states with low economic performance, however, since there is an outlying, positive bin to the right of the threshold. When the ratings are high, there is no distinguishable shift as we cross the threshold.            "
"49","Table 5 presents the regression results. Column 1 shows that the interaction term between gubernatorial control and the low income‐growth dummy variable is negative and statistically significant at either the .05 or .10 level in all specifications. Column 2 shows that the interaction term between gubernatorial control and the negative income‐growth continuous variable is negative and statistically significant at the .05 level in all specifications. Thus, the midterm penalty appears to be much larger when economic performance is low.            "
"50","The regression results for the approval ratings, shown in column 3, are inconclusive. Although the point estimates on the interaction terms are all negative and similar in magnitude to those for income growth, they are statistically insignificant at the .05 level. This may be due to the lack of approval ratings data, which makes the subsample of close elections very small. Gubernatorial approval ratings covering at least half of states consistently in each election year only begin in 1985."
"51","Column 4 shows that when the incumbent party loses the next gubernatorial election, the midterm loss is especially large. For the post‐WWII period, the seat loss is between 8.5 and 9.5 percentage points. The estimates are all statistically significant at the .05 level. Column 5 covers the entire 1882–2010 period, and while the estimates are more variable, they again suggest an especially large seat loss when the incumbent governor’s performance is poor."
"52","Note that for all of the dummy interaction variables, the main effect of gubernatorial control is small and statistically insignificant. This implies that when Xit= 0—i.e., when performance is especially good—the governor’s party does not suffer a significant midterm seat loss. This is consistent with Figures 2(a)–2(b) as well. The specification underlying column 2 allows us to estimate more precisely the level of economic growth that would eliminate the midterm seat loss.27 The range of estimates is 4.0 to 6.5 percentage points higher than the median growth rate. Growth levels this high are hard to achieve. For example, only about 12% of the state‐year observations exhibit a relative growth rate above 4.0, and only about 6% exhibit a relative growth rate above 6.5.28 Of course, we must keep in mind that these figures are based on the point estimates, and their standard errors are fairly large.            "
"53","Overall, the results are strongly consistent with the referendum hypothesis, but with an average bias against the party of the sitting governor. The governor’s party does especially poorly in the midterm elections if performance is low and roughly “breaks even” when performance is high."
"54","Again we begin with a graphical analysis, shown in Figures 2(c) and 2(d). These figures are constructed exactly as Figures 2(a) and 2(b) above. Figures 2(c) and 2(d) clearly show that there is a large negative shift at the 50% threshold when the governor’s party has full control of the state legislature, and the size of the shift is about 7 to 8 percentage points (see the scatterplot of circles). When the governor’s party does not fully control the legislature, however, there does not appear to be a shift at the threshold (see the scatterplot plus signs).            "
"55","Table 6 presents the regression estimates, which exhibit the same patterns as the graphs. Columns 1 and 2 show the results for the legislative control dummy variable. Column 1 covers the post‐WWII period and column 2 covers the entire 1882–2010 period. The point estimates on the interaction term range between −6.8 and −7.9 in column 1 and between −8.3 and −10.1 in column 2; they are all statistically significant at the .05 level. On the other hand, the point estimates for the dummy variable indicating Democratic control of the governorship are close to zero and statistically insignificant in all specifications. Thus, the results indicate that there is only a large midterm penalty when the party of the governor holds full control of the legislature.            "
"56","Columns 3–6 in Table 6 present the results for interaction variables that attempt to capture more refined ideological balancing by voters.29 None of the estimates show support for this type of balancing—in fact, almost all have the wrong sign, and none are statistically significant at the .05 level. These results suggest either that voters do not engage in refined balancing or that our variables do not adequately measure gubernatorial extremism.            "
"57","Since the results above provide some support both for the referendum hypothesis and the partisan balancing hypothesis (at least in its “crude” form), we now test both hypotheses simultaneously."
"58","Table 7 presents the results. To keep the analysis simple, we focus on specifications where the sample is restricted to close gubernatorial elections at time t−1. Table 7 shows results for the 2% and 4% thresholds. In each specification we use the full legislative control dummy to capture partisan balancing. To capture the referendum hypothesis, we use the low income‐growth dummy variable in column 1, and the dummy indicating that the incumbent governor’s party loses the next gubernatorial election in columns 2 and 3. Column 2 covers the post‐WWII period, and column 3 covers the entire 1882–2008 period.            "
"59","Interestingly, the point estimates are all similar to those in Tables 5 and 6 where we tested the hypotheses separately. This indicates that there is not a strong relationship between the interaction variables. Thus, it also suggests that there is not a common omitted variable driving all of the results. The point estimates are similar for both mechanisms—all in the range −6 to −9.5—suggesting that they are about equally related to the midterm penalty.            "
"60","In this article, we show that winning control of the governor’s office in a state leads to a midterm seat loss in the next state legislative election of 3.5 percentage points on average and perhaps 5.0 points in nonpresidential midterm years. Our identification strategy allows us to rule out that this is caused by any factors other than the party of the governor, such as reversion to the mean or surge and decline."
"61","The use of a regression discontinuity design puts the finding of a gubernatorial midterm party penalty on a solid statistical footing. Moreover, the results from the RDD are not very different from the simple OLS estimates, and, in the post‐WWII period, they are essentially identical. This suggests that the OLS estimates do not suffer much in the way of omitted‐variable bias for estimating the midterm penalty. It also provides some indirect evidence that the midterm slump at the federal level might also reflect a direct effect of the party of the president."
"62","Although the RDD strategy allows us to rule out the hypothesis that reversion to the mean is the only force underlying the midterm slump, reversion to the mean might still be part of the story. In fact, the downward slope evident in Figure 1(a) suggests some reversion to the mean. A more careful analysis of the data, however, indicates that reversion to the mean is probably not a major factor driving gubernatorial midterm slumps. First, the downward slope in Figure 1(a) is mainly in the tails—there is little evidence of a slope in the range of vote margins between –5% and 5%. Second, there is little evidence of a downward slope in Figure 1(b) for nonpresidential elections, and the slope is small in Figure 1(d) for the post‐WWII period. Third, there is little evidence of downward slopes in the subsets of cases where the midterm slump is most evident: in Figures 2(a)–2(b) for the cases where performance was poor, and in Figures 2(c)–2(d) for the cases where the governor’s party had full control of the legislature. This might be expected, since there would seem to be much less scope for “surge and decline” in state elections than in national elections.         "
"63","In the analyses of possible mechanisms, we find evidence suggesting that the midterm penalty can be attributed in about equal parts to the hypothesis that the midterm election is a referendum on the performance of the governor, and the hypothesis that voters use the midterm election for partisan balancing between the executive and the legislature. Of course, the analysis of separating these two mechanisms must be viewed as tentative due to the usual problems that plague most observational studies—in particular, the danger that the estimates suffer from omitted variable bias or endogenous variable bias. The patterns in the data are so striking, however, that they would appear to point to promising directions for future research.30"
"64","One limitation of our analysis is that we focus on voters. Other mechanisms stress the behavior of strategic politicians, party leaders, or interest groups. For example, Jacobson and Kernell (1983) emphasize how strategic entry and exit of politicians can magnify voter behavior, including midterm slumps. Crain and Tollison (1976) argue that political offices yield diminishing returns to political parties. Thus, for example, if the Democrats win the governorship of a state in one election, the Republicans in that state will work harder to win state legislative seats in the next election.31 We have begun to address these issues with a preliminary analysis. Specifically, we examined the relative number of candidates who run for state legislative elections in each major party as the dependent variable. This variable can be seen as a measure of strategic behavior either by party elites—one party works harder than the other to find qualified candidates or at least warm bodies and convince them to run—or by strategic candidates. Using the same methodology as above, we find a substantively small and statistically insignificant effect of gubernatorial control on the relative number of candidates. More analyses can be done, of course, including studies of candidate quality or campaign funds raised. In any case, by adopting the RDD approach as we have done, researchers will be able to make a more convincing case that their estimates are causal effects.         "
"65","Our article focuses on accountability with respect to overall economic performance and broad partisan/ideological extremism. Previous research has found evidence that voters punish governors for high taxes and also for high crime rates.32 Another avenue for further research is to study whether voters appear to “balance” in order to avoid extreme policy outcomes on specific issues, such as taxes, crime, or social policies.         "
"66","Finally, although our article focuses on state politics, it suggests important lessons regarding presidential midterm slumps. In many ways the results mirror those at the national level, although the magnitudes are smaller. That the magnitudes are smaller is not surprising given that state electoral outcomes are highly influenced by national factors in addition to local factors. From this perspective, it is reassuring that our estimates of the relative magnitudes of state versus national midterm slumps are qualitatively similar to the relative magnitudes of other electoral phenomena, such as state versus national incumbency advantages. In addition, we also find evidence suggesting that similar mechanisms underlie state and national midterm slumps. The main difference is that surge‐and‐decline, or reversion‐to‐the‐mean, seems to be relatively less important at the state level."
