"1","Studies by Gurr (1974), Muller and Weede (1990), and Sanhueza (1999) suggest consistent democracies and autocracies are the most stable polity types.1 Consistency means a set of institutions that are mutually reinforcing. For both democracies and autocracies these reinforcing institutions bolster one another, thereby serving to perpetuate the regime.         "
"2","To understand the reinforcing nature of different institutional arrangements, the microfoundations of different institutional arrangements are featured. This article's theory rests on a single assumption: a political executive's primary incentive is to maximize his/her current and future power and authority. To better understand how this assumption plays into the various institutional constellations, autocracies are first examined.         "
"3","What makes an ideal autocracy stable? In short, it is an institutional arrangement that hinders competing elites' access to political power. A small elite ascribes or designates an autocrat to a position of complete control without political challenge to his/her authority from another political body or from civil society. The loss of such control typically means complete exclusion from political positions in the future. The power maximization incentive ensures that the autocrat jealously guards his/her power and authority. Such a system is characterized by a narrow concentration of substantial power.2 This article's central argument hinges on how political institutions affect the distribution of authority in a system of governance, not on other institutional trappings of autocracy.         "
"4","An ideal autocracy concentrates power in the executive's hands, thereby restricting potential challengers' access to channels of political power. When executive authority is limited by another institution, potential challengers to the autocrat have access to power. Without access to such channels or an institutional base, the expected costs of challenging an autocratic regime outweigh the expected benefits of capturing the narrow base of power. This exclusion stabilizes the political system. Opening up alternative channels of power—through the empowerment of competing institutions, by opening up the executive recruitment process, or by increasing the number of individuals involved in the executive designation process—gives the opposition a better base from which to demand further decentralization of power."
"5","Hence, the autocrat has strong incentives not to give up power along any of these dimensions and will try to ensure that the cost of challenging the authority of the regime is high enough to discourage further challenges. The system is self‐enforcing in that an autocrat's interest in maximizing and prolonging authority serves to sustain the autocratic political institutions."
"6"," Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003) conclude that autocrats tend to remain in power longer than leaders in democracies, but that does not mean that autocracies as a regime type are more stable than democracies. The principal problem faced by autocracies is succession. Do autocracies survive the demise of the dictator? Monarchies to a degree solve this problem with the principle of primogeniture. Indeed, some autocratic nonmonarchies (e.g., present‐day North Korea and Syria) have employed this practice. Even cases of familial regicide tend to only affect the duration of the monarch, not the monarchy. As long as an autocracy institutionally solves the succession problem, the executive's quest for ultimate authority serves to eliminate or curtail the emergence of competing institutional bases of authority.         "
"7","The same motivation regarding the maximization of current and future power and authority serves to maintain stability in an ideal democracy as well. Yet, this seems to be an anomaly—democratic polities are durable; democratic leaders are not (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003). Why does an incumbent who has lost an election accept defeat instead of undermining the democratic process to retain power? The reason is that democratic institutions ensure that power and authority are diffuse, thereby making the costs of accepting the defeat plus the expected gains from the next election exceed the expected gains from subverting the regime. Przeworski formally models such a democratic equilibrium, concluding: “Democracy will evoke generalized compliance, it will be self‐enforcing, when all the relevant political forces have some specific minimum probability of doing well under the particular system of institutions” (1991, 30–31). In other words, there is more to gain in the long run by preserving the power‐diffusing democratic institutions than by undermining or subverting them. Hence, the system is self‐enforcing.         "
"8"," Weingast (1997) extends Przeworski's model by incorporating the role of the citizenry. In Przeworski's model, democratic stability depends on the compliance of tomorrow's incumbents. Weingast, however, concludes that “restrictions on governing elites can only be binding if there exists a citizen consensus to react against tomorrow's incumbents if they attempt to rig elections” (1997, 255). As democracy becomes an established aspect of civil society, the cumulative value of compliance for elites increases. In this way, democratic institutions such as elections, limited executive authority, and institutionalized participation all reinforce one another. Furthermore, constitutional restrictions help raise the costs of subverting democratic institutions and ensure that the “stakes of political battles” are kept low (Przeworski 1991, 36). Citizen consensus in support of constitutional restrictions further raises the cost of subverting an election result (Weingast 1997). Diamond summarizes this general point nicely: “Elites choose democracy instrumentally because they perceive that the costs of attempting to suppress their political opponents exceed the costs of tolerating them (and engaging them in constitutionally regulated competition)” (1994, 3).         "
"9","Institutionally inconsistent political systems are not self‐enforcing. Authority is not sufficiently diffuse to ensure that the democratic process is not subverted or challenged. Elites in such a system are tempted to garner more power for themselves and thereby compete with one another, creating an inherently unstable system. Looking across each of the dimensions of institutional inconsistency, the source of instability becomes evident. Boris Yeltsin's stand in front of the Soviet Duma against the authority of the Soviet Communist Party serves as an example of political instability involving competition between a designated executive and a parliament that had some authority to check the executive. Unlike ideal autocracies, institutionally inconsistent regimes lack the degree of concentration of power and authority that provides stability. But power is sufficiently concentrated to induce groups or individuals to challenge the executive's authority in order to grab power. Furthermore, unlike ideal democracies, institutionally inconsistent regimes lack the incentives for individuals to work to maintain a system of democratic institutions. In this way, institutionally inconsistent polities are not self‐enforcing."
"10","This discussion suggests there are two stable equilibria3 resulting from the constellation of a polity's institutional framework:         "
"11"," The Democratic ideal type is characterized by executive recruitment through regulated, open, and competitive elections; executive parity with a parliament or other political body; and open and competitive participation. In Figure 1 the three dimensions of authority (open and competitive executive recruitment, limited executive authority, and open and competitive participation) position an ideal democracy at the upper‐back‐right corner of the cube.         "
"12","                 Authority Dimensions and Ideal Polity Types                      "
"13"," The Autocratic ideal type is characterized by executive recruitment through regulated, but nonopen (closed) executive recruitment; unconstrained executive authority; and extremely restricted and/or noncompetitive participation. This theory provides no additional insights as to what kind of competitiveness of executive recruitment this ideal type requires. Such systems include both autocracies and kingdoms. Figure 1 shows a triad of consistent autocratic institutions positioned at the front‐lower‐left corner of the cube, consisting of designation or ascription of the executive, unlimited executive authority, and suppressed and/or restricted participation.         "
"14","A polity that is neither an ideal Democracy nor an ideal Autocracy is an Inconsistent polity. Institutional consistency is present at all points in and on the cube aside from the regions immediately around the two respective vertices (1, 1, 1) and (0, 0, 0) defining ideal Democracies and ideal Autocracies. Any movement away from these two vertices results in institutional inconsistency. Cases of institutional inconsistency worth noting are located at all other vertices on the cube represented in Figure 1: (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 0).4 Every one of these vertices possesses extreme forms of two of the three dimensions of political authority that conflict with the third and thereby exhibits institutional inconsistency. Institutional inconsistency comes in several varieties—one in which the executive is elected and constrained, but public participation is suppressed or restricted, another in which the executive is elected through broad political participation, but with unlimited authority (an extreme form of “Delegative Democracy”; O'Donnell 1994), and still another in which executives are recruited by designation or ascription and are unconstrained, but participation is institutionalized. Indeed, myriad inconsistent institutional patterns are possible.         "
"15","Based on the above discussion of reinforcing political institutions, two propositions regarding a comparison of these institutional arrangements are presented:"
"16","Proposition 1  Ideal type polities are more likely to endure than Inconsistent polities (those exhibiting institutional inconsistency with respect to executive recruitment, participation, and executive constraints), ceteris paribus.             "
"17","Proposition 2  The greater the degree of institutional consistency along all three dimensions, the greater the propensity for a polity to survive, ceteris paribus.             "
"18","Indices of democracy to some extent identify ideal polity types by aggregating across different political dimensions. To assess the degree to which a polity is democratic or autocratic, Gurr (1974) devised both a democracy scale and an autocracy scale. In the original Polity dataset, polities are seen as fully democratic if they have executive recruitment through competitive elections, executive‐legislative parity, and institutionalized participation. Consistent autocracies have executive recruitment through ascription, designation, or a combination thereof; unlimited executive authority; and suppressed participation.5"
"19","The Polity dataset characterizes political systems using a set of six indicators (Gurr 1974, 1485; Marshall and Jaggers 2000, 13–14). The dataset has information on all countries with a population over 500,000 for the 1800–2000 period. Following Gurr, these indicators are grouped to form three variables describing systems along three authority dimensions. Each of these variables is normalized to range from 0 (maximum concentration of power) to 1 (minimum concentration).            "
"20","The first dimension is the regulation of Executive Recruitment and is based on three indicators: “Regulation of Chief Executive Recruitment” (XRREG), “Competitiveness of Executive Recruitment” (XRCOMP), and “Openness of Executive Recruitment” (XROPEN). Polities with succession through “Ascription” (succession by birthright), “Designation” (informal competition within an elite), or a combination thereof, are coded as the most concentrated (0). Competitive election represents the other extreme on this dimension, and is coded 1, while dual systems where ascriptive and elective rulers coexist are coded as 0.5.6"
"21","The second dimension characterizes the constraints on the executive and is based on a single indicator “Decision Constraints on the Chief Executive” (XCONST). The third dimension concerns political participation. The Polyarchy dataset (Vanhanen 2000) serves as the basis for this measure, rather than the Polity participation index. There are several problems with the Polity participation index. First, the components of the index are overly subjective. Second, the criterion for coding a polity as having regulated and competitive participation ignores aspects of enfranchisement that to some extent serve to define modern democracy. For instance, a polity that prohibits women, ethnic minorities, or nonproperty owners from voting is often regarded as having the same extent of participation as a polity that grants voting rights to all adults. Third, the Polity coding scheme classifies a large share of the polities as “factional” systems. Indeed up to 40% of all polities fit this description. In polities with “factional” participation, there is a “pattern of intense, often violent competition between ‘in’ and ‘out’ factions, who hold power seriatim and repress their opponents: participatory activity is high, even though some groups are temporary” (Gurr 1974, 1486). The problem is that factionalism does not assess the institutional configuration of a country, but rather is an outcome of an institutional arrangement.7"
"22"," Vanhanen's (2000) dataset contains two indicators: “Participation” and “Competition.” These two indicators are coded at every election or as a consequence of a nondemocratic event that alters the government, such as a coup. Participation is the percentage of the population that voted in the most recent election. Competition is the percentage of the valid vote won by all parties except the plurality winner or winning electoral alliance. After a coup both of these indicators are coded as 0. The competition indicator is useful to parse out polities with very high electoral participation, but in which there was no credible alternative to the ruling party. Vanhanen multiplies Participation and Competition to create his composite measure of democracy. This, however, is not an entirely satisfactory operationalization of democratic participation, since (1) it is biased in favor of extremely fragmented party systems—political systems with many political parties are considered more democratic than systems with few parties—and (2) it underestimates some democratic qualities in semidemocratic societies, especially in the nineteenth century. To argue, for instance, that the Netherlands is considerably more democratic than the United States simply because the largest party in the Netherlands regularly wins a much smaller percentage of the popular vote than does its counterpart in the United States would be extremely controversial.8 Hence, Vanhanen's composite measure is modified slightly. If the percentage of the valid vote won by the plurality winner is less than 70%, the Participation component is used without modification. If the percentage is higher than 70%, Participation is multiplied by [competition/30%].9 The extent to which an election has a decisive impact on the selection of the executive is thus measured. If there is no real choice, the election does not really play a noteworthy role in the selection of the executive.            "
"23","All shifts in participation are not equivalent in terms of their significance for the level of democracy in a country. A change from 5% to 15% of the population voting is a much more significant shift than is a change from 70% to 85%. To account for this nonlinearity, the natural logarithm of Participation is taken (before it is multiplied by Vanhanen's Competition measure in those instances of limited competition).10"
"24","A unidimensional measure of democracy called SIP (Scalar Index of Polities) also is created. SIP is the average of the scores along the three dimensions and also ranges from 0 to 1. This measure affords us the ability to compare this definition of regimes to others, such as that of Przeworski et al. (2000), in this analysis of regime duration.11"
"25","A polity change is defined as any change in indicators that results in one or more of the following: (1) a movement from one category to another in the Executive dimension (i.e., between ascription/designation, dual ascriptive/elective, and elective), (2) a change of at least two units in the Executive Constraints dimension, or (3) a 100% increase or 50% decrease in the Participation dimension (in the log‐transformed variable, this is a change of 0.69 in either direction from the original level). Doubling the number of citizens with voting rights qualifies as a minimum change along the Participation dimension.12 The creation or dissolution of states is also defined as a polity change. Thus a polity is defined as a political system between two polity changes. Results from analyses where we use Przeworski and colleagues' (2000, 28–33) definition of democracy and change between democracy and nondemocracy also are reported.            "
"26","Three variables (Executive Recruitment, Executive Constraints, and Participation) feature the different dimensions of governance portrayed in a cube as seen in Figure 1. The coding on these three dimensions gives a unique location in the cube with coordinates. For example, a polity with dual ascriptive and elective executives, intermediate constraints, and intermediate participation is located near the center of the cube (i.e., Inconsistent). The ideal types are defined as the Autocratic and the Democratic corners—polities that are coded with either 0 or 1 on all three dimensions.            "
"27","The ideal types also include polities that are close to the corners. As the cube in Figure 1 defines a space, it is possible to examine the distances within this space. In order to classify a regime as either Ideal or Inconsistent, the distance from the point given by the polity's coordinates to the eight corners and the midpoint of the cube is calculated. A regime is defined as Democratic or Autocratic if it is closer to either of the ideal type corners of the cube than to the other corners or the midpoint.            "
"28","The Democratic ideal type will hence include observations that are closer to the corner [1, 1, 1]. Since it is the distance from the democratic corner that defines the ideal type, scores close to 1 on one of the dimensions to some extent offset low scores on the other dimensions. The autocratic ideal type includes all polities that are closer to the autocratic corner than any of the other reference points. All polities that are not coded as Autocratic or Democratic are coded as Inconsistent. For the 1800–2000 and 1900–2000 periods the respective distributions of the three types of polities were as follows: Autocratic (43%, 39%), Democratic (14%, 17%), and Inconsistent (43%, 44%).13"
"29","To assess the stability of different polity types, differences in survival times—the time between the polity changes (see the previous section) that mark the start or end of a polity—are featured in this analysis (Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones 2004). One would suspect that the survival time of a particular set of political institutions is dependent on how long the institutions have existed, such that institutions become consolidated over time. However, the duration dependence of polities is unlikely to be strictly monotonic in this way. Political entrepreneurs are not going to construct a system of government that is expected to fail immediately. The implication is that the potentially most unstable institutions (given the environment) are never created. Furthermore, to the extent that the actors who created the institutions later occupy positions of power, they may feel committed to support “their” institutions for some time. The critical test of a democratic or quasi‐democratic institutional setup is often the first election after its creation, which typically occurs four or five years later. Hence, the hazard function would be expected to be nonmonotonic, such that the hazard of regime collapse initially increases and then, as consolidation mechanisms come into play, the hazard declines. Therefore, the log‐logistic distribution is used for these analyses.14"
"30","In the log‐logistic model, the hazard function is                "
"31","Many of the polities observed last for several decades. Control variables that change significantly over such time spans, such as economic growth rates and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita are included. To provide a more precise coding of these variables, each period of polity duration is divided into annual segments (e.g., 1960, 1961, etc.). All of these segments were coded as censored observations if there was no polity change during the time segment. If there was a regime change in a year, two observations for the country were entered, one for the polity that ended, and one for the polity that subsequently started.15 The period is split on the day of the regime change, as coded in Polity 4d (Marshall and Jaggers 2003). The control variables were then coded for each segment.            "
"32","The analysis presented in this article compares polities that date back to the eighteenth century (a few of which were already several centuries old by then) with polities formed in the late twentieth century. It is unreasonable to assume that the hazard of polity change has not varied over this period. The rate of social transformation has increased dramatically over the past two centuries, and improvements in communication technology and infrastructure have hastened the pace with which new political ideas are disseminated, assimilated, and implemented. Hence, average survival time is expected to have decreased considerably from the early nineteenth century to the late twentieth century (and the hazard rate to have increased). A categorical variable, created by dividing the two centuries under observation into five 40‐year historical periods was developed to address this issue. The first of these five periods includes the set of ancien régimes that were in existence prior to 1800.            "
"33","Presumably, a certain regime type is likely to be more stable when it is surrounded by similar regimes (Gleditsch 2002). The impact of political neighborhood is controlled for by adding a variable measuring the average “political distance” from each polity's location in the polity space (see Figure 1) and the polity locations of its neighbors.16 A political neighborhood consists of all contiguous countries with either a common border or less than 150 nautical miles of water between them. For countries without contiguous neighbors (i.e., isolated islands), the average political distance from that country to all countries in the world is assigned as the value for the Political Neighborhood variable. The variable was normalized to range from 0 (completely similar) to 1 (completely different).            "
"34","Economic development is controlled for with ln(GDP per capita), in constant 1995 dollars per capita, and economic growth is accounted for through the change in GDP per capita from one year to the next (Przeworski et al. 2000; Sanhueza 1999).17 The Economic Development variable was lagged in the same manner as the Economic Growth variable to reduce potential endogeneity bias.            "
"35","Finally, a variable denoting whether the polity was the first one after independence (First Polity in Country) was included. In newly independent countries most institutions are embryonic, not just the institutions regulating executive recruitment, executive constraints, and participation. Consolidating political institutions may take more time in such an environment than in older countries (Hegre et al. 2001).            "
"36","In this section, evidence that Inconsistent polities are less stable overall than the consistent Autocratic and Democratic ideal types is presented. Table 1 reports the results from the log‐logistic regression estimation of a model with indicator variables for the three polity groups (Autocratic, Democratic, Inconsistent), with historical periods as the only control variables. The baseline category consists of the internally inconsistent polity types, reflecting the hypothesis that the self‐reinforcing polities are more stable than the Inconsistent polities. All estimates are reported in time‐ratio form: their interpretation is the ratio of the estimated median survival time for an observation with the given characteristic relative to the survival time for the baseline case. For example, in the case of a dichotomous indicator variable, a reported estimate of 2 means that a polity that has that characteristic is estimated to survive for twice as long as one that does not have that characteristic.         "
"37","The results are in line with expectations and buttress the findings of Gurr (1974), Sanhueza (1999), and Hegre et al. (2001). Both Autocracies and Democracies are more stable than the internally Inconsistent polities. In this model, Inconsistent polities during the 1800–39 period are the baseline. Hence, controlling for historical period differences in institutional change rates, Autocracies are estimated to have a median survival time that is 1.7 times longer than that of the Inconsistent polities. Democracies are estimated to survive 3.8 times longer than their Inconsistent counterparts. Also reported are the 95% confidence intervals for these estimates, which confirm that different polity types can be ranked in terms of stability. Democracies are significantly more durable than Autocracies, which in turn are significantly more durable than Inconsistent polities. These findings provide substantial support for Proposition 1. Both ideal polity types (Democracies, Autocracies) are significantly more likely to endure than the Inconsistent types.         "
"38","The period indicators have estimates in the predicted direction: polities existing in the second and third periods (1840–1919) are likely to last about half as long as the baseline (1800–39), and polities existing in the last two periods (1920–2000) can only expect to survive for one‐third as long as the early nineteenth‐century polities.18"
"39","In Table 2 (Model 2) an analysis comparable to that in Table 1 is conducted, with the exception that several additional control variables (discussed in the previous section) are incorporated into the model, and the analysis is limited to the 1900–2000 period.19 The results continue to be robust, providing strong support for Proposition 1. The difference in estimated survival times between Autocracies, Democracies, and Inconsistent polities are of similar magnitude when controlling for these other factors and are still statistically significant. Autocracies/Kingdoms may expect to live 1.9 times longer than the Inconsistent polities while Democracies survive 3.6 times as long as their Inconsistent counterparts. In sum, the results presented in Tables 1 and 2 confirm those reported by Gurr (1974) and provide powerful support for the theoretical argument regarding institutional consistency.         "
"40","With regard to the control variables, four findings are noteworthy. First, the effect of Economic Development (i.e., GDP per capita) is curvilinear: polities in countries with GDP per capita lower than the mean (approximately $1,000 per capita in 1995 US dollars) are estimated to be slightly more stable than those in countries at the mean. However, most of the differences in estimated survival time stem from wealthy countries also being very stable. Similar to the findings of Lipset (1959), Burkhart and Lewis‐Beck (1994), Przeworski et al. (2000), and others, the higher a polity's GDP per capita, the longer it survives. Second, the time ratio estimate for Political Neighborhood is 0.35, indicating that a polity surrounded by polities diametrically different from itself (in terms of the typology presented above) is likely to expire three times as fast as an identical polity geographically located among comparable polities. Third, the estimate for First Polity in Country is 1.6, signifying the expected duration of the political institutions of newly independent countries is considerably higher than that of polities in comparable, older, countries. This finding is revisited below. Fourth, polity duration is dependent on Economic Growth in the five years preceding the observation. Increasing the growth rate by one unit (roughly a 1% annual growth rate) increases the estimated survival time by 8%.         "
"41","To assess the robustness of the results, a different index of democracy is applied. The coding criteria developed by Przeworski et al. (2000) is used to define and specify polity types and transitions. Table 2 presents the results from these analyses comparing the SIP measure and the Przeworski et al. (PACL) index. Model 3 replicates Model 2, but the temporal domain is restricted to the 1950–90 period to correspond to the temporal domain of the Przeworski et al. data. Model 4 shows that Przeworski and colleagues' finding that nondemocracies are more stable than democracies holds in the analysis, but it is not statistically significant.20 This result contrasts with Model 3, but is not surprising since Przeworski et al. employ a strict definition of democracy and a dichotomous coding. As a result, they do not code changes within the nondemocracy category, only changes that happen to take polities over to the democracy side of their single threshold. The results for the control variables are roughly the same when using the PACL indicator.         "
"42","Model 5 investigates (see Table 2) whether information on consistency can improve the ability to predict the duration of these polities. This is done by including the unidimensional, continuous, SIP measure of democracy and the interaction term between it and the Przeworski et al. dichotomous measure of democracy/nondemocracy. Adding these terms significantly improves the goodness‐of‐fit of the model—the log likelihood increases by 3.83 points. The estimate for the interaction term (in time ratio metric) is significantly less than 1. This means that the expected duration for nondemocracies decreases as the SIP score increases from 0. In other words, PACL nondemocracies are clearly more stable when they are close to what is defined here as consistent autocracy. Conversely, the estimate for the interaction term means that PACL democracies are much more stable when they are close to what is defined here as consistent democracy.21 In sum, information on polity consistency greatly improves scholarly understanding of the duration of polities.         "
"43","In this section, the importance of consistency for stability in the Autocratic and Democratic ideal types is examined in greater detail. Proposition 2 posited that the greater the degree of institutional consistency along all three dimensions, the greater the propensity for a polity to survive. To evaluate this proposition, the 716 polities in the 1900–2000 period were divided into two subgroups: those with open and competitive executive recruitment and those with recruitment through designation, ascription, and dual systems (i.e., systems where designated and elected executives coexist). Most Democracies fall in the first group and most Autocracies fall in the second. Inconsistent polities with elective executive recruitment are regarded as quasi‐democracies and those without as quasi‐autocracies."
"44","Since all the polities defined as democracies and quasi‐democracies are homogenous in terms of the form of executive recruitment in this analysis, the Executive Constraints and Participation dimensions are featured. The Executive Constraints variable is treated as ordinal, thereby the relationship between Executive Constraints and the hazard of failure is assumed to be monotonic and linear. The Participation variable measures the logarithm of the share of the population voting with the modifications regarding competitiveness described previously and is treated as an interval variable. To minimize collinearity when creating the interaction term, the two variables were centered by subtracting the mean of all observations from every observation."
"45","A log‐logistic regression model for the democratic/quasi‐democratic subsample was estimated, with the recoded Participation and Constraints variables and the interaction terms. The results from this analysis are reported in Table 3 (Model 6). The parameter estimates for all three terms are positive, and the interaction term is significant. Since the variables, Participation and Constraints, are centered at their means, the effect of these variables is interpreted as the change in the estimated survival time when one of them is increased by one unit from the mean and the other is kept constant at the mean.            "
"46","In Table 4, for polities with open and competitive executive recruitment, the predicted median survival time is provided with selected values for the Participation and Constraints variable based on these estimates. Using the Participation and Constraints variables, the polities are grouped into four mutually exclusive groups and the estimated median polity duration for the 16 combinations of values are calculated. Also reported are the number of observations in the sample that are located in each cell to avoid drawing inferences from outside the sample.            "
"47","One useful exercise is to compare the duration of different archetypal political systems represented by the vertices in Figure 1. The most consistent polity with open and competitive executive recruitment (elections) is the one with maximum constraints and maximum participation (coordinates 1, 1, 1). This institutional arrangement is estimated to stay unchanged for 31 years.22 The most unstable configuration for elective polities is where the executive is highly constrained, but the electorate is very small (1, 1, 0). Such polities are estimated to last for only 0.8 years. There are no actual cases of polities with a high level of participation, but with weak executive constraints (0, 1, 1). In general, there are very few cases of elected polities with no executive constraints. Moreover, it is evident from Table 4 that as the three institutional dimensions move towards an ideal democracy, a polity becomes more stable.23 These results strongly support Proposition 2.            "
"48","With regard to the control variables, the estimate for the political neighborhood variable has the same magnitude for polities with open and competitive executive recruitment as for the full sample, but the coefficient is not significant for the subsample. Being the first polity after independence in the country has no effect on elective polities' chances of survival."
"49","A log‐logistic regression model also is estimated for the closed executive recruitment subsample, including polities that have executives recruited through designation or ascription, or polities with dual executives. Since polities with closed executive recruitment are not homogenous in terms of their form of executive recruitment, they may be inconsistent along all three dimensions of the cube. Recruitment type is coded as a binary variable: dual systems or designation/ascription. Designation/ascription, the ideal Autocratic type, is the baseline. A model is first estimated with a three‐way interaction term between the three dimensions, all two‐way interactions, and the main terms. The insignificant terms were removed to arrive at the model reported in Table 3 (see Model 7).24"
"50","The Participation * Constraints interactive term is larger than one and significant, implying that the two variables reinforce each other when they are close to the autocratic ideal point (coordinates 0, 0, 0 in the cube portrayed in Figure 1). Both the Participation and Constraints main terms are less than one. The greater the constraints on the executive and the more extensive the level of participation are, the shorter the life of an Autocracy with a designated executive. The expected survival time for polities with executives recruited by designation or ascription are reported in Table 5a and provide results in line with Proposition 1; consistent Autocracies are the most durable. Proposition 2 is also supported; the expected survival time drops as the values for either Participation or Constraints decrease. However, the importance of consistency along both dimensions is less important than for polities with open and competitive executive recruitment. Indeed, the incidence of nonelected polities with constrained executives is extremely rare. In general, the consistent autocracies have an expected survival of 10 years, whereas inconsistent autocracies cannot expect to survive for more than four to five years.            "

"53","Milosevic sincerely believed he could win 70 percent of the vote in the election that eventually landed him in the Hague.

"54","The estimates for the dual polities are less conclusive, although the general distribution of the incidence of different types of polities presented in Table 5b is similar to the pattern found among the elected polities. For the dual polities, the interaction term Dual * Participation is higher than one and significant, and the Dual main term is less than one. Table 5b shows that the most stable polities of this type have high constraints and high participation. The overall expected duration is lower than for the designated polities, reflecting that all of these polities are inconsistent in terms of how the executive is recruited.            "
"55","The dual polities category includes a number of late nineteenth‐century European monarchies (e.g., Germany 1871–1918) and twentieth‐century polities with elected executives coexisting with nonelected ones (e.g., present‐day Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates). It is not obvious that all of these polities should be grouped with other polities with closed executive recruitment, since a few of them transformed seamlessly into polities with open and competitive executive recruitment. Unfortunately, the Polity dataset does not allow us to distinguish between different types of dual systems."
"56","The estimates for the control variables in Model 7 are different from those obtained for the polities with open and competitive executive recruitment—nonelected polities survive under different conditions than elected ones. The relationship between Economic Development and polity survival is positive and significant, but clearly smaller in magnitude than for elected polities. Growth is positive in both Model 6 and Model 7, but significant only in Model 7. The drop in significance in Model 6 is due to the reduction in the number of cases. Both elected and nonelected polities are more likely to fail when surrounded by different types of regimes. Again, the relationship is not statistically significant for elected polities (Model 6)."
"57","In contrast to the elected subsample, First Polity in Country is positive and significant for the nonelected polities. Autocracies formed just after independence are relatively stable, whereas autocratic institutions introduced after other polities are relatively short‐lived. Evidently, civil society is crucial here. In a democracy, civil society plays a critical role, in terms of political participation, in maintaining and reinforcing the institutional structure. Democracies have the added advantage of the legitimizing role of civil society to further enhance political stability. In an institutionally consistent autocracy, there is no role for the public to play. However, if the public has played a role in the past, it will expect to continue to play a role, and this shortens the polity's expected duration."
"58","The results presented in this article provide broad confirmation of this general theory, based on Eckstein (1973) and Gurr (1974), regarding institutional inconsistency and consistency. Institutional reinforcement greatly enhances regime stability. This analysis provides conclusive evidence of the significantly greater levels of stability enjoyed by Democracies and Autocracies compared to their Inconsistent counterparts. Overall, the general conclusions of Gurr (1974) hold when employing a more appropriate statistical model, controlling for potentially confounding factors, and extending the analysis to include the third wave of democratization.         "
"59","These findings provide four important lessons for studies of democratization and of democratic survival more generally. First, Inconsistent polity types are on average far more vulnerable to polity change than are Consistent polities (be they Autocracies or Democracies). Thus scholars concerned with such vitally important factors as why a democracy survives or fails should take account of consistency both when constructing their dataset of democracies as well as when examining the determinants (e.g., level of economic development, political culture, presidential vs. parliamentary government, two‐party vs. multiparty system, extent of civil violence) of democratic breakdown. The theory and results stress the differences between ideal polities (whether Democracies or Autocracies) and institutionally Inconsistent polities. Indeed the results demonstrate that these three categories are distinct. Thus, an analysis that fails to take these distinct polity types into consideration may conclude that a factor is important/unimportant when in actuality the interpretation is more nuanced. For example, the results show that the estimated survival rates of autocracies and democracies reported in Przeworski et al. (2000) are altered when including information on the extent to which the regime types are consistent. The analysis also demonstrates that consistency along all three dimensions is necessary for a polity to be maximally stable.         "
"60","The empirical analysis demonstrates that Inconsistent polities are short‐lived, but cannot inform us about what types of institutions follow them. An executive in a largely autocratic, but inconsistent, polity has a strong incentive to remove alternative channels of power. Likewise, most actors in a near‐ideal democracy have joint interest in diffusing authority. The implication of this is that Inconsistent polities will have a tendency to change toward the nearest consistent ideal type. This tendency will be stronger the closer the polity is to one of the vertices. This expectation holds up well in Gates et al. (2005). In the very long run, however, the results show that the consistent democracies are considerably more stable than consistent autocracies. This implies a long‐term global trend toward more democratization.25"
"61","Second, the findings indicate that the difference between institutional consistency/inconsistency is equally, if not more, important in terms of explaining political stability than many of the literature's standard set of explanatory variables (level of economic development, economic growth, political neighborhood). This is particularly the case among democracies. Moreover, this result demonstrates the need to disaggregate the institutional components of different political systems. Simple dichotomous distinctions between democracy and nondemocracy are fundamentally misleading."
"62","Third, not only is there a tremendous differentiation between consistent and inconsistent polities, but different types of inconstancies are found to be more durable than others. Most unstable of all are political systems with an elected executive and extensive executive constraints, but at the same time possessing extremely limited participation. Their estimated duration is less than a year. The pressures for expanding the franchise are profound in such situations, and they generally move towards institutionally consistent democracy."
"63","The least durable kingdoms or dictatorships are those with a high degree of political participation. When civil society is mobilized while the executive is neither openly recruited nor constrained, the institutional configuration is unsustainable. Such polities tend to follow three paths of change. One route is a government crackdown and institutional reform that leads to a more institutionally consistent autocracy. A second route involves a set of reforms that move the political system towards a democracy. Revolt is also a possibility, whereby the mobilized public drives institutional change, leading to a new polity."
"64","Regimes with elected executives with no constraints are very rare and are generally not durable. The mirror image, polities with nonelected but highly constrained executives, are also rarely evident. Indeed, there appears to be a general tendency for elected executives to be constrained and those unelected to be unconstrained, institutionally."
"65","A number of polity types never have existed (at least between 1800 and 2000). Note the cells with zero observations in Tables 4, 5a, and 5b. These noncases correspond to the (1, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 1) vertices in Figure 1.26 These nonevents can be characterized as extreme counterfactuals (King and Zeng 2006). As such, these values occupy a place in this theoretical framework, but they do not exist in reality. Indeed, according to this theory, they do not exist because they simply are dysfunctional. Hence, the reinforcing nature of the three dimensions of governance manifests itself both in the choice of institutions when they are first created and in the subsequent lack of stability.27"
"66","Fourth, these results provide greater insight as to why inconsistent polities experience more civil wars (e.g., Fearon and Laitin 2003; Hegre et al. 2001). This is not only because these polities are more prone to the political expression of grievances, but also because they have weak institutions for addressing challenges to the authority of the regime (Hegre et al. 2001).         "
"67","Political stability is anchored in institutional consistency. Political instability stems from an institutional structure that invites challenges to executive authority. Both Autocracies and Democracies exhibit institutional consistency that is self‐enforcing. Democracies have the added advantage of bringing in civil society to ensure further stability."
