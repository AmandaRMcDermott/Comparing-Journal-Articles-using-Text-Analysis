"1","Bigger Does Not Mean Stronger Through the 1920s and 1930s, the House of Representatives was generally characterized by large majority parties. Through the 1920s, the Republicans held solid majority status in both chambers and, far from reinstating the strong central authority of the Cannon era, their members largely relegated their formal party organization to the background. Similarly, when the Democrats held overwhelming majorities in the House through the 1930s, not only did they not return to the “King Caucus” form of party control utilized during the latter 1910s, but they also essentially splintered the institutional foundations of partisan control. As is well known, by the late 1930s, the Rules Committee was effectively and formally independent of the Speaker. During this period and the 25 years following it, the Democratic party leadership managed the legislative process through bill‐specific negotiations and coalition building, rather than through the exertion of centralized control. Specifically, and in accordance with the theory presented below, “the rewards and sanctions which the rules placed in the hands of party leaders were reduced”3 (Cooper and Brady 1981, 417). In addition, in considering this era, it is useful to recall David Brady's description of party discipline in the 55th and 56th Houses (1897–1901).         "

"3","“[T]he Republicans were in general more cohesive across the issues in the Fifty‐sixth House than they were in the Fifty‐fifth . … The increased cohesiveness of the Republicans in the Fifty‐sixth House was largely the result of their decreased majority. The Republican victory in 1896 was so overwhelming that the congressional party could afford less cohesion and still pass all the legislation the leadership desired. The decreased Republican majority in the Fifty‐sixth House meant that in order to pass desired legislation the congressional party had to be more cohesive.” (1973, 64)"
"4","Theorizing about Parties‐in‐Congress This article's theory is similar to both conditional party government (Aldrich and Rohde 1998; Rohde 1991) and the cartel theory of party government (Cox and McCubbins 1993, 2005). In both of those theories, as well as that presented here, members of the same party are presumed to have similar policy preferences. The conditional party government approach posits a linkage between the heterogeneity of majority party members' preferences and their incentive to grant procedural controls to its leaders. While the results presented here indicate a difficulty with inferring heterogeneity of legislators' underlying policy preferences from the observed heterogeneity of their voting behavior, the logic of this article's theory is compatible with that of conditional party government.         "
"5","The link between this article's theory and the cartel theory is similarly clear: both theories explicitly view the majority party leadership as facing a collective action problem. The cartel theory differs from that presented here by more explicitly distinguishing between votes on procedure and policy: members of the majority party form a “cartel” in an attempt to maintain monopolistic agenda control. The theory of equilibrium party government presented here examines the degree to which members of the majority party will agree to bind themselves together in pursuit of the legislative agenda. When the equilibrium level of party government as defined below is high, the expected rate of defection from the party leadership's favored position is low. Conversely, when the equilibrium level of party government is low, the majority party cartel is weak in the sense that its members are less likely to act in concert on any given roll‐call vote. In the context of Brady's description of the 55th and 56th Congresses, above, one partial interpretation of the results presented below is as a recognition that instrumentally minded leaders of the majority party (i.e., those who seek to not be “rolled” on the floor) will tend to pursue lower levels of intraparty cohesion when they hold a larger majority of the seats."
"6","The theory presented here is also complementary to the work of Volden and Bergman (2006), who focus on the Senate; Ashworth and Bueno de Mesquita (2004), who compare presidential and parliamentary systems; and Iaryczower (2004), who utilizes a principal‐agent framework. While a complete comparison of these important contributions with the theory presented here is beyond the scope of the article, one advantage of the approach taken is that the focus of the theory is on a collective democratic decision by members of the majority party to post a bond before a vote with the knowledge that some or all of the members are ultimately free to make their own vote choices. This article accordingly focuses its attention on the fundamental tension between the collective achievement of legislative outcomes through roll‐call votes and the inevitability of individual members' having electoral and/or personal motivations to vote against their party's agenda. In addition, the article generates and utilizes a new empirical prediction about the predictive performance of W‐Nominate scores.4"
"7","Before continuing, it is valuable to consider why a formal model is a worthwhile component of this research project. The formal theory offers several predictions, but the most important justification for the development of a formal model in this setting is that, in addition to providing a rigorous and transparent foundation for the empirical predictions (Krehbiel 1999), the formal theory provides a normative and practical justification for describing the behavior as being in “equilibrium.” Specifically, it is demonstrated formally that there is a majority‐rule equilibrium (i.e., core) in the intraparty determination of the majority party's strength. Accordingly, the theory offered here offers an intuitive prediction when one considers what a majority party leader would want to do, but the prediction is not based on the implicit assumption a majority party “leader” even exists. In this way, the theory offers an explicit derivation of a “strong” legislative party that is nonetheless consistent with majoritarianism (Crombez, Groseclose, and Krehbiel 2006; Krehbiel 1991, 1999; Patty 2007b).         "
"8","The remainder of the article is structured as follows. I first present an equilibrium model of “party government” within a legislature. The most interesting prediction of the model is that the strength of the majority party leadership in determining its members' vote choices will be a decreasing function of the majority party's seat share. I then present a novel means of testing the model that avoids some of the endogeneity problems associated with measures such as party unity scores and distributions of legislators' estimated ideal points. Instead of looking at the estimates of legislators' preferences themselves, I focus on the statistical performance of our estimates of members' preferences. I then examine the effect of the majority party's seat share on the predictive power of W‐Nominate estimates in the House and Senate from 1866 to 2004.5"
"9","In this section, a model of equilibrium party government is offered. The model's depiction of party government is sparse: it considers only the degree to which party control is exercised on individual members' roll‐call decisions. This control is exercised through a payoff penalty for voting against the party‐leadership‐supported alternative. The size of this penalty is chosen democratically by the majority party caucus at the beginning of the game, prior to the revelation of the member's nonparty‐based preferences over the alternatives being voted upon. The legislature consists of a set of n legislators (where n is assumed to be odd), denoted by N, and is divided into two parties, denoted by two sets M and m, with M∩m=∅ and M∪m=N. The sizes of the two parties are denoted by nM and nm, respectively, with nM > nm. Thus, M is the majority party. The notation  denotes the set of decisive coalitions in the legislature. Though not necessary for the substantive conclusions of the model, it is assumed throughout that  represents majority rule: it contains all coalitions with strictly more than  legislators.         "
"10","The vote in question is between two alternatives: x and q, with x representing the majority party leadership's proposal and q representing the status quo.6 The vote choice of member i is denoted by ai, with ai= 1 if member i votes in favor of x and ai= 0 otherwise. An arbitrary vector of vote choices is denoted by a={ai}i∈N.7 For any member i and vote vector a, a−i represents the vector of vote choices for all members other than i. Finally, if x receives the vote from each member of some decisive coalition  (i.e., if there exists  such that ai= 1 for all i∈D), it passes. Otherwise, the proposal fails and the status quo, q, is the final policy outcome.         "
"11","The Tension between Individual and Collective Interests The theory is based on legislators having two potentially conflicting motivations behind their vote choice. In particular, members care both about the outcome of the vote and about their own vote choice. These motivations conflict when the legislator simultaneously wants the bill to pass while he or she votes against it or when he or she wants the bill to fail but nonetheless wants to vote in favor of it.8 Formally, each member i∈N is assumed to receive a member‐specific payoff from the final policy outcome, x or q. This component of legislator i's payoff is denoted by vi if the policy outcome is x, and 0 if the status quo q is retained. In addition, each member i∈N is also assumed to care about his or her vote choice (i.e., whether the member votes in favor of, or against, x). Member i's individual benefit or cost from voting for x is assumed for simplicity to be determined exogenously and, furthermore, is unknown until immediately prior to the vote. In the real world, members often have strict preferences over the votes they cast for “position taking” or signaling reasons. Regardless of the source or sources, the key for the purpose here is that these benefits or costs are tied to the individual vote cast by the legislator, rather than the collectively chosen policy. This leads to the possibility of individual legislators free riding on the votes of their fellow partisans in the legislature.            "
"12","The payoff received by i from voting for the proposal, x, is denoted by ui∈R, while i's payoff from voting against the proposal is normalized to equal zero. Thus, if ui > 0, voting in favor of x is in accord with legislator i's individual interests, while ui < 0 represents a situation in which it is costly for legislator i to cast a vote in favor of x. It is assumed that legislator i's benefit or cost from voting for x, ui, is observed by legislator i after the selection of majority party strength (discussed below) and distributed according to a continuously differentiable density function, fi: R→R+.9 The payoff function for legislator i∈N is written as follows:               "
"13","Party Strength as a “Performance Bond.” The members of the majority party, M⊆N, choose a level of party strength, p≥ 0. In this model, the endowment of the majority party leadership with “strength” is represented as the posting of a performance bond by the members of the majority party. In particular, given a majority party strength, p, any majority party member will vote for the proposal whenever ui≥−p as if, conditional upon not voting for the party's proposal, the member would forfeit resources (e.g., electoral support, stature within the party, future committee assignments, or some other perk) equal to p. Thus, a member whose vote choice is determined by the majority party's strength does not “enjoy” the party strength, per se. Rather, the ex ante posting of a forfeitable bond commits each member to voting the party line in some circumstances where otherwise he or she would not find it in his or her interest to do so.            "
"14","In equilibrium, the performance bond affects the probability with which any given member will forgo potential future nonparty‐based benefits that he or she would have derived from voting against the party line. Since the bond occasionally forces the member to vote in a way that is counter to his or her individual interests and larger bonds increase both the frequency and severity of such occurrences, larger bonds—i.e., higher levels of majority party strength—are more costly to each member of the majority party than are smaller ones.12 I discuss some possible real‐world analogues for this performance bond in more detail later.            "
"15","The Voting Decision For any member i in this framework, the fundamental tension occurs when that member's individual and collective interests are in conflict: ui < 0 < vi or vi < 0 < ui. Considering the case of ui < 0 < vi (the other case is symmetric), the member wants to vote against the proposal but also wants the proposal to pass. This is the crux of the majority party's potential collective action problem. For any member i∈N and vote vector a−i∈{0, 1}n−1, define the following indicator for whether i's vote can be pivotal (or decisive):               "
"16","For a member of the majority party, the analogous calculation involves the performance bond held by the majority party leadership, p. Specifically, a member of the majority party, i∈M, should vote in favor of the proposal, x, only if               "
"17","Endogenous Majority Party Strength We are now in a position to define the equilibrium level of party strength, p*, in a setting where the majority party membership chooses the party strength prior to members observing their individual benefit or cost from voting in favor of the party proposal (i.e., ui). The presumption that the majority party democratically chooses its level of intraparty strength prior to the consideration of legislation is central to the theory and can be justified by the pre‐Congress organizational meetings of the party caucuses in each chamber. During these meetings, caucus officials (e.g., party leaders, whips, a nominee for Speaker of the House) are elected and the details of caucus operations for the upcoming Congress are worked out. These details include such aspects as the “binding caucus” rule of the Democratic Caucuses. With this timing in hand, the derivation of equilibrium party strength is performed under the assumption that all members will ultimately vote as if they are not pivotal (i.e., as if πi(a−i) = 0).14"
"18","Nevertheless, since the goal of majority party strength is to bind the party membership together in order to maximize the probability that preferable policies are implemented, the optimal majority party strength depends upon the probability that any member's vote choice will be pivotal. Before presenting the model's results, the logic underlying them can be described in terms of being pivotal in the following way: when a member i is very likely to be pivotal, other members have an increased interest (through their concern about whether the proposal passes or not) in i's vote choice. Accordingly, in such situations, majority party members are more willing to bind themselves together through the granting of a high level of party strength, p. Intuitively, any member is more likely to be pivotal when the numbers of supporters and opponents of the bill are both close to half of the legislature. Finally, if one presumes that members' partisanships are somewhat correlated with the policies they wish to see enacted, then all members of the majority party will be more willing to bind themselves together through the exercise of majority party strength.            "
"19","Before presenting the theoretical results, it is necessary to define four functions. First, for any member i∈N and party strength p, the probability that i votes for x, given majority party strength p, is denoted by φi(p). Following equations (2) and (3), this is defined as follows:               "
"20","Condition 1  For all                                 p≥ 0, RF               is a concave function of p.             "
"21","Substantively, this condition is equivalent to assuming that there are decreasing marginal returns to increased levels of majority party strength in terms of success enacting the majority party's legislative agenda. The condition is generally satisfied whenever members of the majority party are more likely to support the majority party's legislative agenda even when the majority party is powerless (i.e., p= 0) and members' individual payoffs are normally distributed with mean greater than or equal to zero. For example, Condition 1 is consistent with settings in which “most” members of the majority party are faithful followers “most” of the time. In such a setting, majority party strength operates essentially as insurance against occasional situations in which several members' individual goals happen to oppose the majority party's legislative program.            "
"22","The second condition requires that, for each member i∈N, the distribution of i's individual vote‐based payoffs, fi(p), is a weakly increasing function for p < 0.            "
"23","Condition 2  For each                                 i∈M, fi(p)               is a nondecreasing function for all                                 p≤ 0.             "
"24","Formally speaking, Condition 2 is satisfied by many distributions; for example, all symmetric unimodal distributions (such as the Normal) with nonnegative mean satisfy it. Substantively, this condition is consistent with situations in which members' individual, vote‐based payoffs are typically small in magnitude, and the probability of a large negative payoff shock from a given roll‐call vote is smaller than the probability of negative payoff shock closer to zero. This condition is empirically plausible, given the relative rarity of high external (i.e., electoral) visibility for any given roll‐call vote."
"25","Theorem 1 provides an existence result regarding an equilibrium level of majority party strength. The proof is simple and relegated to the appendix. Theorem 1 implies that majority party members' utility functions are single‐peaked with respect to majority party strength, p, and, accordingly, since p is unidimensional, the median voter theorem (Black 1948) implies that there exists a Condorcet winner within majority party strengths p≥ 0 among the majority party membership.15"

"30","Before identifying the Condorcet winner among majority party strengths, it is useful to consider the implications and meaning of Theorem 1. The first conclusion, that Vi(p, vM, f) is a concave function of p for all vM > 0, essentially implies that each member of the majority party has an “ideal” level of party strength and, furthermore, his or her induced preferences over party strength are single‐peaked. Since party strength is unidimensional, the median voter theorem (Black 1948) applies to the determination of majority party strength in this setting. Accordingly, the second conclusion of the theorem is that there exists a Condorcet winner among the set of possible party strengths.            "
"31","Who Determines Majority Party Strength? It follows from the median voter theorem that the Condorcet winner, p*, is any median of the majority party's members' most preferred levels of party strength, as defined by equation (10). Proposition 1 gives us a sufficient condition for the simple identification of the median member of the majority party with respect to preferences over party strength. In words, the proposition identifies the member who, in equilibrium, decides the majority party strength, p*. The following definition makes it possible to state the proposition in a succinct fashion. (The proof of Proposition 1 is contained in the appendix.)            "

"34","If one conceives of member i's individual payoffs, ui, as being negative whenever the member's reelection chances will be hurt by voting for the proposal, x, the proposition states that the equilibrium level of party government is determined by the median member of the majority party, where the median is with respect to the probability of facing external pressures to vote against the party platform. In a very stylized and direct way, Proposition 1 links the majority party‐in‐Congress with the majority party‐in‐the‐electorate. In other words, Proposition 1 links the upper bound of majority party strength with the reelection concerns of its members. Under this interpretation, the level of influence granted to the party leadership over its members' voting decisions is necessarily constrained by its members' reelection motivations.16"
"35","While there are many different theoretical comparative statics that one can investigate in this framework, two are of primary interest to us: the effect of the minority party's voting behavior, φm, and the effect of the size of the majority party, nM. Broadly speaking, these two parameters affect the optimal level of party strength, p*, in the following ways:            "
"36","                              "
"37"," Larger majority party seat shares decrease the equilibrium level of party strength.                      "
"38"," Higher levels of minority party support for the majority party leadership's favored position decrease the equilibrium level of party strength.                      "
"39","Both of these comparative statics rely on the same underlying dynamic: given that majority party strength is costly, it follows that when the majority party leadership's preferred policy becomes more likely to pass at a given level of party strength, p, then the equilibrium level of party strength will decrease. This is satisfied by either less fervent opposition by the minority party or a smaller minority party seat share. Each of the comparative statics flows from the same reality—higher levels of majority party strength are adopted as a function of the likelihood that a member's vote will be pivotal in the passage of the proposal. When the majority party holds a slim majority of seats, then its members must be more unified (in terms of the percentage voting in favor of the proposal) in order to overcome any given level of minority party opposition. Similarly, for any given size of the majority party, its members need to be more unified when the minority party's members are less likely to defect and vote for the majority party's proposal.

"40","In order to focus attention on a substantive and testable prediction of the model, the remainder of the article presumes that fi=fj=fM for all i∈M and fk=fh=hm for all i∈m.

"42","As alluded to earlier, direct measures of the “strength of party government” are difficult to construct from available primary data sources. Turning to secondary data sources, the article's theory has implications for the statistical performance of the W‐Nominate estimator (Poole and Rosenthal 1997). W‐Nominate assumes that legislators make their vote decisions in accordance with preferences over an underlying policy space in which legislative proposals are embedded. Based on this assumption, W‐Nominate produces an estimated ideal point for each legislator. The estimator is accordingly “party free,” in the sense that it produces estimates for a model of vote choice in which the partisanship of a member plays no role.18 According to the theory developed above, the degree to which a majority party member's vote choices will be determined by his or her own policy preferences depends on the seat share held by the majority party. In this section, I show that this dependence leads to a predicted correlation between the performance of the W‐Nominate estimates and the majority party's seat share. Before demonstrating this, however, I provide some more intuition for this prediction.         "
"43","Estimating Legislators' Preferences from Roll‐Call Votes in a Legislature with Strong Parties Suppose for a moment that the majority party leadership position was completely determinative of its members' vote choices (i.e., p=∞). In such a world, any roll‐call‐based estimator of members' preferences could not distinguish between any majority party member: in other words, the estimated ideal points of all members in the majority party would be identical. Furthermore, this “estimated ideal point of the majority party” would (ex post, or within sample) correctly predict the vote choice of each of the majority party's members on every recorded vote.19 At the other extreme—when the majority party has no influence on its members' vote decisions (i.e., p= 0)—the estimated ideal points will be based upon behavior actually determined by the members' underlying preferences and, accordingly, accurate to the degree that the space of underlying preferences is sufficiently rich to capture legislators' true preferences.            "
"44","Paradoxically, when one's party membership plays a larger role in determining how one votes, an estimator that does not condition on legislators' party memberships will perform better within sample than in a party‐free world.20 This intuition drives the predicted effect (within this model) of the majority party's seat share on the within‐sample performance of W‐Nominate estimates of majority party members' ideal points. When the majority party holds a larger share of the legislative seats, the equilibrium level of party strength is lower and, therefore, the within‐sample performance of the W‐Nominate estimates is also lower.            "
"45","The within‐sample performance of the W‐Nominate estimates can be measured in a number of ways, all of which are highly correlated with one another.21 In this article, I use the geometric mean probability (GMP) of the estimates.22 Formally, the GMP for member i is the exponential of the average of the log‐likelihood of the observed vote choices by i. Put loosely, the GMP for a member is similar to a weighted measure of how many of that member's votes were predicted correctly by his or her estimated ideal point. The “weighted” aspect is captured by the fact that the W‐Nominate estimates of ideal points (and roll‐call locations) assigns a probability of voting “yea” to each member for each roll call. The GMP is more responsive to votes on which a member was predicted to vote “yea” with a probability close to either 0 or 1: if such a roll‐call vote was correctly predicted, the members' average GMP is increased by a (relatively) large amount, whereas it is decreased by a similarly large amount if the members' predicted vote was incorrect.23"
"46","The predicted effect of majority seat share on GMP (for both majority and minority party members) is displayed in Figure 2. In both graphs, the vertical axis measures the GMP of the W‐Nominate estimates generated from a simulated 100‐member legislature and the horizontal axis represents the number of seats held by the majority party. The data plotted in the top graph were generated by simulating 500 votes in a 100‐seat legislature with varying seat shares for the majority party in which the seat‐share‐specific equilibrium level of party strength was applied for each majority party seat share. As discussed earlier, the graph demonstrates that the predicted average GMP for majority party members will be negatively correlated with the majority party's seat share. Furthermore, since the minority party leadership is assumed to not exert party pressure, the average GMP for minority party members does not vary with the size of the majority party.            "
"47","                 Predicted Effect of Majority Party Size on GMP                         "
"48","The bottom graph displays the effect of the majority party's seat share with a fixed level of party strength. Since the average GMP does not vary with seat share, this graph demonstrates that the majority party's seat share, per se, does not affect the statistical performance of the W‐Nominate estimates. The predicted effect of majority party size on the average performance of W‐Nominate estimates within the majority party is based on the seat share's effect on the endogenous variation of equilibrium party strength.            "
"49","In this section, the theory's predictions about the average GMP within the majority and minority parties of the House and Senate are compared with the corresponding data for the U.S. Congress since 1866. The data for the House are displayed in Figure 3, while Figure 4 displays the analogous data for the Senate. Both graphs in each figure include the predicted values of average GMP from an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of the appropriate party‐chamber average GMP on the majority party's seat share. For the majority party in both chambers, the negative relationship between average GMP and majority party's seat share is clear. For the minority party in the House, the effect of majority party seat share on average GMP is slightly positive, but the effect is not statistically significant. For the Senate, the effect of the majority party's seat share on the minority party's average GMP is positive (and statistically significant). This result for the Senate is at odds with the assumption that the voting behavior of the minority party is unresponsive to p. Because the Senate is not a majoritarian body for many of its decisions, future work should extend the numerical analysis in this article to explicitly account for supermajoritarian rules. When the majority party holds less than 60 seats in the Senate, there may exist circumstances in which the minority party has an incentive to bind itself together as well (e.g., cloture votes).

"52","Regression Analysis and Institutional Details Beyond the evidence of Figures 3 and 4, I now present a more systematic regression analysis. Considering the 40th–107th Congresses, four regressions are performed. A separate regression is performed for each of the two parties in each of the two chambers. In each of the four regressions, the mean GMP is the dependent variable. The independent variables present in all four analyses are as follows: the majority party's seat share,24 the number of years elapsed since 1866, and an indicator for Republican party having a majority of the seats. In addition to these independent variables, several chamber‐specific variables, described below, were included as well. (The results for the common independent variables are not substantively or statistically altered by dropping these chamber‐specific variables from the analysis.)            "
"53","House‐Specific Variables In the House of Representatives, an indicator variable for the 81st and 89th Congresses is included to measure the impact of the “21‐day rule,” which largely eliminated the ability of the Rules Committee to keep the floor from voting on measures that had been reported. These Congresses are particularly important from the standpoint of the conditional party government hypothesis, since the fight over the 21‐day rule (as with the fight over enlargement of the Rules Committee in the 87th and 88th Congresses) was both intra‐ and interparty.            "
"54","Senate‐Specific Variables In the analysis of the Senate, two chamber‐specific indicator variables were added. The first of these indicates the subset of Congresses elected after ratification of the 17th Amendment.25 The second of these variables indicates the subset of Congresses during which the requirement for cloture has been 60 votes.26"
"55","The results of the regressions are reported in Table 1.27 In both chambers, the majority party's seat share is significantly and negatively correlated with the mean GMP of the W‐Nominate scores for the majority party. In the House, Congresses under Republican control have been associated with a significantly higher mean GMP for the majority party. The estimated effect of control by the GOP—though it is not significant at the 5% level—is also positive in the Senate. Thus, the effect of the size of the majority party on the mean GMP of its members is as predicted in both the House and the Senate. Thus, in line with an increasing number of scholars,28 the third column of results in Table 1 provides evidence of majority party power in the Senate.            "
"56","Turning to the chamber‐specific variables, the estimated effect of the 21‐day rule is positive and significant. At first this may seem surprising: the 21‐day rule reduced the power of the Rules Committee, which is typically thought of as an arm of the majority party leadership. However, the 21‐day rule was supported by much of the majority (Democratic) party leadership as an outlet to circumvent the conservative coalition that controlled the Rules Committee (Jones 1968; Schickler 2000). Thus, securing its approval (over the objections of the majority of the minority party's membership) is interpretable as a victory for party government. The logic cuts both ways, of course, and one should hesitate before pushing this line of argument too far: one could just as reasonably inquire as to why a strong “party government” could not muster the resources to oust “Judge” Howard Smith from the Rules Committee or successfully defend the 21‐day rule in the 82nd and 90th Congresses. The fact that the estimated effect is positive is interesting in the sense that, if it is easier to secure a vote on one's favored measure, the majority party membership's incentive to provide their leaders with influence on roll‐call voting decisions is greater, which would appear in this type of regression as having a positive impact on the mean GMP of the majority party.            "
"57","The results for the Senate's chamber‐specific variables are interesting as well: both the reduction of the cloture requirement and the ratification of the 17th Amendment led to decreased mean majority party GMP. The effect of reducing the cloture requirement is consistent with the theory—by reducing cloture, the majority party membership effectively increases its net seat share. Put another way, after the cloture requirement is lowered the majority party leadership can secure the same success rate on cloture votes with a lower level of party strength. Accordingly, fewer majority party members will be forced to vote the party line after the cloture requirement is reduced. One plausible effect of the 17th Amendment, which formally eliminated the selection of a state's Senators by its state legislature, is an increase in the variance of the idiosyncratic, vote‐specific payoff shocks experienced by the Senators, as the successful pursuit of the reelection motive became more closely associated with mass publics and less with the insiders' confines of the statehouse. It may also have increased the career concerns for Senators in another way: Senators could, through the development of their own reelection constituency, increase the security of their future employment as a Senator, thereby increasing the expected payoff of developing expertise and/or stature within the Senate, both of which would potentially be at odds with deference to Senate party leaders."
"58","These conjectures about the effect of the reduction of the cloture requirement and the ratification of the 17th Amendment can be subjected to a simple “sanity check” by examining their effects on the mean GMP for the members of the minority party: if the 17th Amendment affected mean GMP of the majority party because of its effect on the distribution of the members' vote‐specific idiosyncratic payoff shocks, then the ratification of the 17th Amendment should have also reduced the mean GMP for members of the minority party.29 The results of the analogous regression for the minority party's mean GMP are presented as the fourth column of results in Table 1. The reduction in the cloture requirement has not significantly affected the mean GMP of the minority party, but the 17th Amendment did so in the same direction as it did for the majority party: the ratification of the 17th Amendment reduced the mean GMP of both parties.            "
"59","Interestingly, the estimated size of the effect is similar in the two parties. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the 17th Amendment's Constitutional commitment to direct election of Senators increased the idiosyncratic determinants of vote choice on the Senate floor. Overall, the results are similar to the recent findings of Gailmard and Jenkins (2008), who more directly examine the effect of the 17th Amendment on the voting behavior of Senators. They find that the 17th Amendment led to moderation in the roll‐call behavior of Senators from moderate states and, most relevant to the argument forwarded here, an increase in the occurrence of divergent voting by Senators from the same state on the same roll call.            "
"60","The notion of a performance bond as applied in this article can be viewed simply as an illustrative metaphor primarily intended to distinguish this article's conception of party strength from models in which legislators are paid to change their vote. Nevertheless, one can also argue that the metaphor is also descriptively realistic. When exploring for analogues of the performance bond within Congressional parties, it should be noted that a performance bond does not necessarily have to be literally “taken away” from the member (e.g., few employees are paid in advance). Specifically, it is important to note that expected future rewards under the control of party leaders (e.g., support during a future primary or general election campaign, recognition on the floor, inclusion of provisions in special rules about which member is typically interested, etc.) can serve the same purpose."
"61","While the scholarly literature is replete with references to a variety of inducements possessed by party leaders for the rewarding and/or punishing of rank‐and‐file party members,30 the possible ways by which party leaders/elites may punish defectors might be broken into three categories that can be described as “institutional,”“policy,” and “electoral” in nature. Examples of these might include the following.31"
"62","                        "
"63"," Institutional Prerogatives. While the formal rules of both chambers are largely silent on the role of legislative parties, there are a few notable exceptions. For example, in the House of Representatives, Clause 5 of Rule X states (in part) that “[m]embership on a standing committee during the course of a Congress shall be contingent on continuing membership in the party caucus or conference that nominated the Member.” A large literature has established that committee assignments are valuable to members in pursuing both policy and reelection goals. Accordingly, the explicit role given to the party caucuses by Rule X represents a formal instance of the performance bond: deviation from the party's platform (as in the “binding caucus” rules of the House Caucuses) can be punished by the forfeiture of an asset valued by the member in question. Furthermore, there is evidence that the operation of the committee assignment process within party caucuses affects “party loyalty” (e.g., Crook and Hibbing 1985; Wright 2000).                  "
"64"," Policy Influence. There is evidence that members—of either party—with higher party loyalty are more likely to be assigned to conference committees (McQuillan and Ortega 1992). Such assignments are desired by members, since the conference negotiations typically represent the final opportunity to make changes to legislation, and the changes are nearly guaranteed acceptance in both chambers. The assignments to conference committees are directly controlled by the Speaker of the House (Rule I, clause 11), who typically makes appointments of members of the minority party only after consultation with the Minority Leader. Furthermore, the Speaker has broad discretion in making appointments to conference committees and may specify the issues on which individual members are to confer.32"
"65"," Electoral Support. The possibility of withholding expected future support is observed within the empirical workings of campaign finance, where individual members often explicitly provide resources to their party leaders (e.g., Heberlig, Hetherington, and Larson 2006; Heberlig and Larson 2007). For example, in the 2006 election cycle, the three main campaign organs of the Republican party received over $30 million from Republican candidates and their political action committees, while the analogous three Democratic organizations received over $40 million in contributions from Democratic candidates and their PACs.33 Furthermore, members' campaigns represented 16 of the top 20 donors to the Democratic Party, and 17 of the top 20 donors to the Republican Party in the 2006 election cycle.                  "
"66","Finally, it should be noted that—in equilibrium—the use of these levers may be quite rare. Furthermore, such rarity is by design—when the intraparty cohesion that is pursued through their presence is achieved, one will not observe members being ousted from committees, being passed over in the appointments of conferees, or having electoral support withheld. Nevertheless, the experiences of some senior Republican members in the early twentieth century and southern Democrats in the early 1970s are consistent with the use of some or all of such levers against less than faithful legislators. More recently and directly on point is the experience of then‐Rep. James Traficant (D, OH) in the 107th Congress (2001–02), whom the House Democratic Caucus refused to appoint to any committees as punishment for his voting in favor of Rep. Dennis Hastert (R, IL) for Speaker of the House.         "
"67","The influence of members' partisanships on legislative policymaking is an important and active topic of research. To this end, I have presented a formal theory of equilibrium party government by the majority party in which majority party members “bind themselves together” in pursuit of common policy goals, aware that day‐to‐day influences on their future voting behavior create the potential for collective action failures in attempting to enact their preferred collective policy goals. By incorporating the collective preferences into their individual grants of power to their leadership, majority party members can increase their expected payoffs."
"68","This article extends an active research agenda on the determinants of partisan‐appearing behavior in legislative settings, including the role of procedural details, members' pursuits of reelection, and the combination of the two.34 Variation in external and procedural factors is purposefully ignored: the focus is on the easily measurable variation in the size of the majority party in a two‐party legislature. Ultimately, the theory should be extended to explicitly include choices about procedures and variation in the members' electoral situations.         "
"69","The two‐party theory presented here implies that—for members of the majority party—the predictive power of a party‐free measure of legislators' preferences, W‐Nominate, will be decreasing in the size of the majority party, whereas the performance of these estimates for minority party members will not depend on the size of the majority party. The average performances of the W‐Nominate estimates since the Civil War within both parties' memberships support the theory's predictions. In both chambers, majority party members' votes are predicted less accurately when their party's seat share is larger. The average performance of the estimates for minority party House members is unaffected by their share of seats, while the average performance of these estimates for members of the minority party in the Senate is positively affected by their seat share."
"70","Sure, the House … but the Senate? The finding for the majority party within the Senate is probably the most surprising. According to the traditional picture of the Senate, every member may potentially affect what is voted upon through various dilatory tactics. Accordingly, any Senator's voting behavior should be less susceptible to “party influence” than his or her counterparts in the House. The theory presented here, however, offers an intuitive rationale for the apparent influence of the majority party's seat share on the predictability of the majority party members' voting behaviors. By recognizing the potential conflict between their collective policy objectives and individual electoral interests, both Senators and Representatives may gain from the exertion of a reasonable degree of majority party influence on their voting behavior. This article's results fit nicely with other recent findings, particularly those of Gailmard and Jenkins (2007, 2008). Specifically, this article's results provide further evidence that Gailmard and Jenkins are correct in suggesting that “there is reason to be sanguine about Senate majority party power” (2007, 699).            "
"71","Institutional Details The empirical results also indicate significant effects of several key institutional features of the chambers. The access to the floor of the House provided by the 21‐day rule in the 81st and 89th Congresses increased the average performance of W‐Nominate estimates within the majority party (i.e., Democratic) membership—but not the average performance for those of the minority party (i.e., Republican) members. Within the Senate, the results indicate that the passage of the 17th Amendment, which loosened state party leaders' direct control over their state's Senators, also reduced the average performance of the W‐Nominate estimates within both parties. The reduction in the Senate's cloture requirement from two‐thirds to three‐fifths reduced the average performance of the W‐Nominate estimates within the majority party, but not the minority party. This finding deserves more study, since, following the “pivotal politics” logic of Krehbiel (1998), one could interpret the reduction in the cloture requirement as an increase in the effective size of the majority party.35 This intuition suggests that the equilibrium level of party strength (and average performance of W‐Nominate among the majority party) would decline after cloture is introduced, which is consistent with the empirical results. A richer model of procedures should be deployed within this type of setting. Given the variety of procedures (concerning both agenda‐setting and voting, per se), the seeming ubiquity of partisan division, and the potential electoral ramifications of individual legislators' recorded vote choices, one might wonder how the contextual and procedural details of each roll‐call vote, which vary widely both within and across Congresses affect the proper interpretation of the relationship between vote‐based estimates and Congressional politics as a whole. The theory and results presented in this article indicate that at least one detail of the Congressional landscape—the partisan balance within either chamber—is an important component of this relationship.
