"1","When I teach my course in urban politics, one of the first things my students observe is that the local policy agenda differs significantly from the national agenda. At the local level, not only is partisanship less apparent, but local issues focus much more on economic development and service delivery and much less on social policy compared to federal politics. Many find this surprising, since income inequalities vary so widely across communities."
"2","One explanation lies in fiscal federalism (Oates 1972). Local governments in the United States have a high degree of fiscal autonomy, meaning that much if not most of local government revenues come from local taxes rather than from intergovernmental support. Consequently, when combined with a mobile population (Tiebout 1956), local governments have strong incentives to respond to adopt policies that will retain and enhance the local tax base (Buchanan 1971).         "
"3","One of the implications of fiscal federalism is that local governments will tend to be passive participants in social welfare policy, relying instead on state and federal governments. Since the beneficiaries tend to be lower‐income households while those bearing the costs tend to be higher‐income households, social welfare tends to work against the city's fiscal interest in attracting higher‐income households to the community (Peterson 1981). Local governments thus have fiscal incentives to minimize their own social welfare expenditures. Likewise, we should expect that variation in social welfare policy across communities would be a function of the city government's fiscal resources, such as fiscal capacity (Peterson 1981) or intergovernmental revenues (Kantor 1995), rather than economic need or political factors. The tragic irony of this is that those communities with residents most in need of social welfare services are the very ones that are least likely to be in a position to provide them.         "
"4","In contrast to fiscal federalism, other theories of local policymaking underscore the significance of protest, local political representation, and institutions to policy outcomes, rather than intergovernmental factors and economic constraints. Piven and Cloward (1971), for instance, make the argument that expansion of social welfare policy during the 1960s might be the result of urban social unrest. On the other hand, growth and development bias could result from biases toward business and real estate interests in local political representation, what Molotch calls a “growth machine” (1976; Molotch and Logan 1987). Conversely, pro–social welfare interests, such as African Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities (Clark and Ferguson 1983; Greenstone and Peterson 1976), might face significant obstacles to organizing and becoming politically effective at the local level (Browning, Marshall, and Tabb 1984). Formal and informal political institutions at the local level might reinforce such biases against social welfare and in favor of development (Stone 1989). It is also possible that the economic constraints against redistribution may be weaker than fiscal federalism suggests, thereby providing greater scope for the local political process to drive policy outcomes (Epple and Zelenitz 1981; Swanstrom 1988; Wong 1988, 1990).         "
"5","Empirical analyses of local social welfare expenditures have rather consistently found support for fiscal federalism. Several studies have found that a community's fiscal capacity has a significant and positive impact on social welfare spending (Chamlin 1987; Isaac and Kelly 1981; Peterson 1981; Sharp and Maynard‐Moody 1991). Likewise, intergovernmental revenues and other intergovernmental factors tend to have strong and significant effects on local social welfare spending (Craw 2006; Kantor 1995). But analysis of the impact of local need, political representation, and other such factors on social welfare spending has had only mixed results. For instance, Chamlin (1987) and Pack (1998) find that the level of need for social services, as measured by the community's poverty rate, affects social welfare spending, but others (Isaac and Kelly 1981; Sharp and Maynard‐Moody 1991) do not. Piven and Cloward's social unrest thesis also has only mixed support (Isaac and Kelly 1981; Sharp and Maynard‐Moody 1991). And results tend to be mixed for the impact of a community's racial composition (Chamlin 1987; Craw 2006). The overall picture, then, suggests that local governments in general, and municipalities in particular, lack autonomy when it comes to social welfare policy.         "
"6","It is important to note, however, that most analyses of local redistributive policymaking take some measure of expenditures as the dependent variable (e.g., Chamlin 1987; Craw 2006; Isaac and Kelly 1981; Peterson 1981; Schneider 1989). While expenditures are a useful indicator of a community's year‐to‐year commitment to social welfare, they are also the result of a jurisdiction's annual budget process. Thus, expenditures reflect a political process that may differ from other social welfare decisions a community makes about the provision and finance of social welfare. These other decisions may not only follow a different process, characterized by a different style of politics, but they may also shape the context in which annual budgetary decisions are made.         "
"7"," Figure 2 illustrates how three sorts of decisions on the provision and finance of social welfare relate to each other. Before expenditures occur, communities must make a decision about whether to provide a social welfare function in the first place. This provision decision differs from annual expenditure decisions in that (a) it is discrete (a decision is made to provide or not provide) and (b) it occurs at one point time (rather than being repeated each year). Provision decisions tend to be self‐reinforcing (Norton 1979). Once a service is provided, a bureaucracy is organized that has an interest in continuing the service. The bureaucracy may also be instrumental in organizing clients, who have an interest in continuing the service (Frey and Pommerehne 1982; Shefter 1985). Consequently, provision decisions are often difficult to reverse. Thus the provision decision is likely to be political process, and one that differs from normal budgetary decisions.         "
"8","                 Levels of Analysis for the Local Social Welfare Role                      "
"9","Financing decisions also structure the context in which budgetary decisions are made. Communities that provide social welfare services must also make a decision about whether to finance them out of own source revenues or participate in intergovernmental revenue programs. Federal and state governments make available a wide range of grant programs to induce local governments to provide particular functions. For example, federal Community Development Block Grant, Social Service Block Grant, and Temporary Aid to Needy Family Block Grant funds support local affordable housing and social welfare functions. Municipalities may obtain access to these funds through direct application (for entitlement cities) or through state governments. Access to intergovernmental revenues is typically by application, however, and so local governments have discretion in deciding whether to accept them. Though at first glance it seems counterintuitive to suppose that local governments might refuse any available outside support, intergovernmental programs often come with administrative costs, conditions, or other “strings” that may outweigh the benefits to the community (Stein 1979, 1981). For example, large numbers of municipalities refuse to participate in federal housing programs because doing so might attract people considered “undesirable” to the community (Danielson 1975). Hence, municipalities that provide social welfare face a nontrivial decision on whether to participate in intergovernmental revenue programs or finance their efforts themselves.         "
"10","Fiscal federalism may explain variation in provision across communities. Under fiscal federalism, local governments providing social welfare services that their neighbors do not provide suffer a loss of tax base. Hence, we should expect that communities with greater fiscal capacity are more likely to provide social welfare functions than others, since they are in a better position to bear the direct costs and loss of tax base. In addition, state governments could largely determine the provision arrangements, either by offsetting the costs (through state social welfare intergovernmental grants) or by mandating those functions to particular units of local government. In this way, state governments may reduce or eliminate the capacity of local governments to avoid social welfare responsibilities. Consequently, fiscal federalism leads us to expect that variation in provision arrangements will, like expenditures, be a function of fiscal capacity and intergovernmental arrangements."
"11","On the other hand, many local governments could have a much greater degree of autonomy over provision decisions than fiscal federalism implies. Under fiscal federalism, fiscal capacity is lost when higher‐income residents or businesses exit the community and lower‐income residents enter the community. Exit, though, is not costless to the residents and businesses seeking to move. Many types of business would find it difficult or impossible to relocate once buildings and equipment are placed in one jurisdiction. Or a particular jurisdiction may have advantages that other locations do not have, such as easy access to a highly skilled workforce, or to markets for its product, or to social or business networks that reduce business costs (Savitch and Kantor 2002). Or the number of alternative jurisdictions from which a mobile business or resident may choose might be small, particularly in smaller or more consolidated metropolitan areas. Given such exit costs, some jurisdictions are in a position to adopt social welfare policies that are fiscally sustainable over the long run.            "
"12","Under this “conditional exit” model of local public finance, many local governments have some degree of bargaining or monopoly power with respect to their jurisdiction's tax base. In fact, a number of researchers have made arguments that differences in exit costs and monopoly power explain significant differences in local policymaking across jurisdictions. For instance, Brennan and Buchanan (1980) hypothesized that monopoly power varies across jurisdictions with the number of competing jurisdictions, allowing jurisdictions with less competition to sustain higher taxes and spending than others. Empirical evidence testing their “Leviathan” hypothesis has been extensive but mixed, some finding evidence in favor (e.g., Eberts and Gronberg 1990; Nelson 1987; Schneider 1989; Sjoquist 1982; Zax 1989) and others against (e.g., Forbes and Zampelli 1989; Oates 1985; Turnbull and Djoundourian 1993). Other researchers have argued that in jurisdictions with high exit costs, local governments have greater capacity to bargain with prospective businesses over development plans, rather than race to the bottom in providing development incentives to attract business (Feiock 2002; Savitch and Kantor 2002; Steinacker 2005).            "
"13","Furthermore, under a model with exit costs we should expect that local political factors will affect a community's provision decision. Fiscal federalism allows little scope for local politics to affect policy outcomes on development or social welfare policy (Peterson 1981). But exit costs create this scope by shielding local governments from the fiscal consequences of redistribution or by giving local governments bargaining power. Hence, under exit costs, local political institutions are more likely to have an impact on policy outcomes (Epple and Zelenitz 1981) and local governments have greater scope to bargain with business over development (Savitch and Kantor 2002).            "
"14","Thus, to the extent that local governments have monopoly power, elected officials are in a position to be responsive to the social welfare policy preferences of the community's median voter and/or to organized interests. When it comes to providing social welfare functions, these preferences are likely to vary significantly across different interests. Business and higher‐income households stand to bear the costs, while lower‐income households stand to gain the benefits. Homeowners are particularly likely to fear the consequences of providing social welfare, particularly changes in racial and income composition of the community (Danielson 1975). Since homeowners have little way to insure against a drop in property values, they may be expected to resist policy changes they believe could result in even a small chance for a decline in property values (Fischel 2001). Hence community decisions on provision are likely to vary with such factors as income, race, and education, as well as the size of the business sector and homeownership rates.            "
"15","Given exit costs, then, local governments have much greater scope for considering local preferences and political interests in making decisions on provision of social welfare. Cities providing social welfare services, however, also face decisions about whether to finance those services at least in part from intergovernmental revenues. On the one hand, financing arrangements may largely be a function of decisions by state and federal government. If local governments are truly “junior partners” in the social welfare system, then we would expect their role to largely be that of implementer of state and federal policies. For example, in many states, such as California, county governments are mandated to provide local offices to coordinate federal and state public welfare assistance, such as food stamps, cash assistance, and public health insurance, drawing on federal and state programs for financing. Or, state and federal governments may use intergovernmental revenues to provide incentives for local governments to carry out functions that achieve federal and state policy objectives. For instance, in cities like Detroit, the federal Empowerment Zones program aims to revitalize distressed urban neighborhoods across the country by providing block grant funds and tax credits for businesses to participating local governments. Local governments obtain benefits, but the policy objectives and structure are determined in Washington."
"16","Under this sort of “picket fence” federalism (Bickers and Williams 2001), it is federal and state governments that actively set policy, dividing responsibilities between the state level and various units of local government. Policy planning and decisions are handled at the federal and state levels, with local governments simply being street‐level agents to implement those policies. Those communities receiving intergovernmental revenues, then, are not so much choosing to participate as being induced either by incentives or mandates to do so.            "
"17","On the other hand, financing arrangements might vary because local governments exercise discretion on whether or not to participate. Some eligible communities might choose not to participate in intergovernmental grant programs because application and administration for IGR grants is often complex and involves high administrative costs, particularly categorical grant programs (Stein 1979, 1981). Other communities may be concerned that an intergovernmental revenue program will introduce too much uncertainty over year‐to‐year funding from this source, and could possibly institutionalize a level of service that cannot be sustained should the grant revenues dry up (Fossett 1983; Stein 1984).            "
"18","Perhaps the most significant costs to local officials, however, are political costs. Intergovernmental revenue programs often come with strings attached: requirements governing the purposes to which IGR money may be directed. The strings that come along with federal and state intergovernmental revenue programs are likely to commit the recipient government to social welfare strategies and programs that emphasize redistribution over economic development. While the number of these strings for many social welfare programs has certainly declined since the 1980s as federal funding has shifted from categorical to block grants, neither are these strings entirely absent. For example, the Community Development Block Grant, one of the cornerstones of federal housing assistance to communities, requires that funds be targeted to activities that benefit low‐ and moderate‐income households, reduce blight, or address urgent health and safety needs of the community. Some federal block grant funds filter down to local governments through state governments, such as the Social Services Block Grant and the Temporary Aid to Needy Families block grant, giving states discretion over how local governments may use those funds."
"19","Given fiscal federalism pressures, municipalities that provide social welfare functions but forego intergovernmental revenue support are likely to do so with a greater focus on development than on redistribution. For instance, communities might pursue an antipoverty strategy that focuses on increasing property values and attracting new business to the community, rather than addressing the immediate social welfare needs of lower‐income residents. A community's own‐source housing and community development dollars might be targeted to assisting moderate‐income households with homeownership, rather than rehabilitating rental housing for the poorest members of the community. Health care funds might be used to support public health clinics across all neighborhoods in the city, rather than targeting free clinic support in the lowest‐income neighborhoods."
"20","Hence, a community's choice to participate in social welfare intergovernmental grant programs is likely to reflect a choice over the degree to which local social welfare spending will reflect redistribution over development. Hence, for opponents of redistribution, the participation decision represents another opportunity to halt (or at least alter) the creation of new social welfare programs in the community. For instance, in the 1970s one strategy used by several communities to avoid placement of low‐income housing was simply to refuse participation in the federal public housing program, which required participating communities to apply for funds (Danielson 1975). Thus, as with the provision decision, the preferences of the median voter and organized interests with respect to redistribution are likely to affect a community's financing arrangements."
"21","Comparing across communities, then, we should expect that provision, participation, and expenditure decisions are distinctly different processes. Though tax base and intergovernmental factors are likely to affect all three types of decisions, provision is likely to be influenced by the exit costs facing households and businesses, which in turn determines the capacity for the jurisdiction to sustain redistributive policy over time. Moreover, under this conditional exit model, we might expect local politics and policy preferences to affect provision and IGR participation decisions. Both decisions provide opportunities for proponents and opponents of social welfare to lock in or veto local redistributive policy. For example, participation in housing development funds through the Community Development Block Grant may commit the community to programs that are more redistributive than it might choose based on the city's fiscal interest. Once decisions on provision and finance are made, the expenditure process is likely to be similar to other budget processes: stronger role for bureaucrats and nonprofits vested in stable government funding, changing incrementally rather than dramatically over time. Hence, expenditures are most likely to be affected by intergovernmental factors, particularly realized grant amounts."
"22","Comparing over time, we should expect that when federalism devolves more social welfare responsibility to state and local governments, local governments will seek new and creative ways of addressing social welfare needs in their communities without jeopardizing local tax base. One avenue for doing so is to seek out remaining avenues of intergovernmental support. Thus, we should expect provision and finance decisions to increasingly reflect intergovernmental factors, particularly at the state level. As it happens, this process of devolution has characterized American federalism since the 1980s, providing an opportunity to examine the effects of this process over time."
"23","I operationalize the model described in Figure 2 for two years: 1997 and 2002. The 1997 analysis uses the 1997 Census of Governments and 1990 Census of Population. The 2002 data use the 2002 Census of Governments and 2000 Census of Population. In addition to being the most recent available data, comparing 1997 and 2002 provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of devolution of social welfare intergovernmental arrangements, including the shift from Aid to Families with Dependent Children to Temporary Aid to Needy Families in 1996.         "
"24","In both years the unit of analysis consists of all municipalities with population greater than 2,500 and located in Standardized Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs; 3,856 observations for 1997 and 4,155 in 2002). I select municipalities as the unit of analysis rather than counties because municipalities have greater discretion over the types and levels of services they provide (Oakerson 1999).         "
"25","The empirical model includes three dependent variables: provision of social welfare services, participation in social welfare IGR programs, and social welfare expenditures per capita. I define social welfare to include housing and community development, health and hospitals, and public welfare. Provision is a binary variable, taking the value of 1 if the municipality had positive expenditures for at least one of these functions, 0 otherwise. Likewise, participation in social welfare intergovernmental revenue programs is a binary variable, taking the value of 1 if the city received federal or state assistance for public welfare, health and hospitals, or housing and community development, 0 otherwise."
"26","The explanatory variables for each decision fall into four categories: intergovernmental, fiscal capacity, redistributive capacity, and political. Additional variables are included that are specific to each policy decision to assist in identifying the model."
"27","State governments are likely to shape local decisions to provide social welfare services through a combination of intergovernmental grant programs and mandates that divide up responsibilities between state and local levels of government and between different types of local government. One state might, for instance, make arrangements that give public welfare responsibilities to counties (e.g., California), while others may allocate some of those responsibilities to other units of local government (e.g., Indiana). I include three measures for these state‐level arrangements in the provision model: (1) a municipal autonomy index consisting of state‐level regulation of municipal government structure and administration;2 (2) municipal social welfare share, the share of state and local social welfare activity carried out by municipalities (as a percent of total expenditures); and (3) the amount of social welfare intergovernmental payments made by the state government to local governments per capita. We should expect that communities in states with greater autonomy are less likely to provide social welfare, while those in states assigning greater responsibility for social welfare to municipalities or providing more intergovernmental aid will be more likely to provide social welfare.            "
"28","A community's fiscal capacity is its level of taxable resources. I include two measures of fiscal capacity: per capita income and the median house value. In addition, since public goods by definition are goods that are nonexcludable and nonrivalrous, the cost of providing those goods declines with population. Thus, though not measures of tax base, I include the city's population and population density as measures of the “overhead” costs of providing public services."
"29","In contrast to fiscal capacity, redistributive capacity is the community's long‐run capacity to redistribute wealth and income, which in turn is linked to that community's capacity to attract, retain, and tax wealth (tax base) sustainably (Brennan and Buchanan 1980; Savitch and Kantor 2002; Steinacker 2005). This capacity results from the cost of exit of businesses and households located in a community. Migrating households or businesses in metropolitan areas offering fewer choices will find it more difficult to replace the community in which they are located should they choose to move. To measure this, I include the number of municipalities located in the metropolitan area, and the proportion of metropolitan area residents living in the community (as a measure of centralization). In addition, some communities may offer bundles of services that may be difficult to find in other communities. To measure this, I include a measure of each community's service differentiation (the weighted sum of its median absolute deviations in per capita expenditures across eight municipal functions).3 Following Schneider (1989), I also include a measure of general expenditure differentiation (the standard deviation of per capita expenditures across the MSA).            "
"30","Measuring the impact of local political process on outcomes can be quite challenging with a large data set, since nationwide data on local political institutional arrangements are not readily available. Nevertheless, given that preferences on redistribution tend to vary across social groups, the Census of Population at least makes possible several demographic and economic measures of local policy preferences. For instance, African Americans and Latinos tend to be more supportive of redistributive programs than are whites. College education is often associated with political preferences that lean to the left and thus to support for social welfare. At the same time, homeowners and senior citizens may resist social welfare out of fear for higher crime and lower property values; businesses, which bear the costs of social welfare but obtain few benefits, may also resist social welfare. Thus, I include percentages of African Americans, Latinos, those holding at least a bachelor's degree, those over age 65, and the homeownership rate. I also include the ratio of jobs to population as a measure of the scope of the local business sector. And, I include dummy variables for region to account for regional differences in historical development of cities (Norton 1979).            "
"31","As is the case with provision, federal and state governments are likely to shape local decisions to participate in intergovernmental revenue (IGR) programs. Some federal intergovernmental programs, such as the Community Development Block Grant, make funds directly available to major cities, and thus I include a dummy variable for central cities to control for this. In addition, state governments influence local participation in intergovernmental revenues through the supply of IGRs available: the greater the pool of available funds, the more likely local governments are to find it attractive to participate. To account for this, I include the states’ per capita social welfare intergovernmental payments in the IGR participation model."
"32","Unlike provision, local decisions on IGR participation need not commit a community to long‐term receipt of funds. Indeed, there is evidence that local governments tend to treat federal intergovernmental revenues as uncertain sources of funding anyway (Stein 1984). Thus redistributive capacity is not likely to be particularly important for participation decisions. But local fiscal capacity might be expected to be important. Among those communities providing social welfare, communities with a weaker tax base might be expected to be more likely to participate. I include per capita income and median house value to measure fiscal capacity, and population and population density as measures of costs of providing services.            "
"33","As discussed earlier, however, local politics, particularly policy preferences and organized interests, may have a significant influence on participation outcomes. As in the provision decision, participation decisions could have consequences that have different material effects for different social and interest groups in a community. To determine whether this is the case, I include the political factors from the provision model in the participation model too. In addition to these variables, Stein (1981) argues that communities are more likely to participate in IGRs when the administrative costs of doing so are lower. To control for this, I include the number of municipal administrative employees per thousand people, since municipalities with greater bureaucratic slack find it less costly to research and administer intergovernmental grants.            "
"34","The manner in which a state government divides social welfare responsibilities could affect not only provision decisions but annual expenditure decisions as well, and thus the expenditure model includes municipal share of state and local social welfare spending. In addition to this, local expenditures are likely to be directly affected by the amount of intergovernmental revenues that the jurisdiction receives from state and federal governments. Intergovernmental revenues designated for social welfare set a minimum level of community spending: such funds by definition must be used for social welfare services. It is worth noting, however, the impact of such revenues on local social welfare own‐source spending may vary. Intergovernmental revenues could replace local funds for social welfare, allowing the community to instead use those funds for developmental purposes. The public choice model implies, however, that local governments make little effort that could be crowded out. If this is the case, coefficients on social welfare IGR variables should be about 1."
"35","The public choice model also suggests that community fiscal capacity will affect expenditures. As in provision, I measure this in terms of per capita income, median house value, population, and population density. In addition, a community's fiscal capacity in a given year includes general intergovernmental assistance, and thus I include federal and state nonsocial welfare intergovernmental funds. I also include two additional measures in the expenditures model that might influence a budgetary decision process: the community's budget surplus, and the local metropolitan area economic growth rate.4"
"36","Though prior research has not found strong evidence that political factors or monopoly power have a significant influence on expenditures, it is worth including these factors in the expenditures model. Possibly by controlling for the selection bias, this expenditures model may come to different conclusions. Hence, I include the measures of redistributive capacity and political factors in the expenditures model."
"37","The model in Figure 2 suggests that a jurisdiction's provision decision censors its decisions on participation in social welfare intergovernmental revenues and on expenditures. That is, communities not providing a social welfare function do not decide on how such a function should be financed or at what level, and thus we do not observe their financing and expenditure decisions. To the extent, then, that the provision decision is correlated with the IGR participation and the expenditure decisions, a probit model of participation and a linear regression model on expenditures will result in biased estimates of the coefficients.            "
"38","Consequently, the statistical model I use is a variation on the Heckman selection model. In a Heckman selection model, the selection bias resulting from censoring is controlled by incorporating a model of the censoring process with a regression model of the outcomes. Typically the censoring process is represented as a probit model of the censored observations and the outcomes as a regression of the uncensored observations, estimated simultaneously in a maximum likelihood model. I have generalized from this framework for a case when the same selection process (in this case, the provision model) censors two outcomes (IGR participation and redistributive expenditures). This method, then, not only gives us unbiased coefficient estimates for the IGR participation and the expenditure models, but also more efficient estimates of the provision (or censoring) process. The coefficients on the provision and participation models can be interpreted just like coefficients in a probit model, and the coefficients on the expenditure model can be interpreted as those of a linear regression model. The online appendix describes the formal model, shows the derivation of its likelihood function, and describes the statistical procedure."
"39","Overall, the statistical results suggest that (1) decisions on provision, IGR participation, and expenditures each follow distinctly different processes, (2) variation across communities in exit costs affects provision and perhaps even expenditure decisions, and (3) social welfare policy decisions, particularly on IGR participation, may be influenced not only by intergovernmental and capacity factors beyond local control, but by local politics and policy preferences as well. I discuss each policy decision in turn."
"40"," Table 1 shows the maximum likelihood estimates for the coefficients of the social welfare provision model for 1997 and for 2002 and the ancillary parameters for the entire maximum likelihood model. The ancillary parameters indicate that provision, IGR participation, and expenditure decisions are correlated, thus making a Heckman selection approach appropriate. In particular, the correlations (rho) between the welfare provision (w), IGR participation (p), and redistributive expenditure (r) models are at least marginally significant.5 Hence, estimating these models separately from each other, rather than using a Heckman selection model, would produce biased estimates.            "
"41","Looking at the coefficient estimates in Table 1, several things stand out about local provision decisions:            "
"42","                              "
"43"," Intergovernmental factors have a significantly larger impact on 2002 provision than they did in 1997. In 1997, none of the three intergovernmental factors is more than marginally statistically significant, and the sign on municipal social welfare share is not in the expected direction. This indicates that intergovernmental factors had little impact on provision decisions that year. In 2002, however, both municipal autonomy and intergovernmental revenue supply are statistically significant, though municipal social welfare share's sign is still not in the expected direction. That is, in 2002, communities in states giving municipalities less autonomy and supplying more social welfare IGRs were more likely to provide social welfare than those in other states.                     "
"44","One explanation for this may lie in changes in federal intergovernmental institutions after 1997. Most notably, a significant portion of management over public welfare functions shifted from the federal government to states with the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. Thus, state‐level arrangements for the provision of public welfare may have become more consequential to local provision decisions."
"45"," Greater monopoly power makes provision more likely, but fiscal capacity has no clear effect. Per capita income is insignificant in both 1997 and 2002, and median house value, while marginally significant in both years, has an unexpected sign in 2002. The only fiscal capacity measure that is statistically significant in both years is population, indicating that communities are more likely to provide when the costs can be spread over a larger population.                     "
"46","Redistributive capacity, however, does seem to significantly affect provision. All four redistributive capacity measures are significant in 1997, and service differentiation and proportion of MSA population are both significant in 2002."
"47"," Local political preferences and interests have little impact on provision decisions. Even though communities with greater redistributive capacity are more likely to provide social welfare, it does not seem that local politics has a consistently significant effect on the provision decision. The coefficients on race, ethnicity, age, education, income, and business community are in the wrong direction or are statistically insignificant. Only homeownership in 2002 is statistically significant and in the expected direction.                     "
"48","Consequently, the main set of factors driving local social welfare provision decisions is the economic capacity of the community to sustain social welfare spending in the long run and, more recently, the state's social welfare arrangements and relationship with municipalities. Interestingly, the community's fiscal capacity, whether measured by home values or per capita income, seems to have little effect. This seems logical for provision: unlike an expenditure decision, where funds are paid out of current revenues, a provision decision represents a longer‐term commitment to a policy. But the increasing importance of intergovernmental arrangements suggests that autonomy for local governments may be shrinking, whatever their redistributive capacity, possibly because of increased devolution."
"49"," Table 2 shows the maximum likelihood coefficients for the sample‐selected probit model of IGR participation for 1997 and 2002. Some results that stand out include:            "
"50","                              "
"51"," Intergovernmental factors have a significant, but mixed, impact on IGR participation. As expected, central cities, which tend to be entitlement cities, are much more likely to participate in IGRs than others, even controlling for population, population density, income, race, and other factors. Interestingly, however, communities in states with a greater supply of intergovernmental revenues were less likely to participate in IGR programs than those in other states. Possibly this indicates that states offering greater assistance to local governments target their efforts at particular communities rather than make funds generally available.                     "
"52"," Fiscal capacity has a significant, but mixed, impact on IGR participation. Communities with lower per capita income values are more likely to participate in intergovernmental revenues, as one might expect based on both economic necessity and political support from lower‐income residents. Interestingly, however, communities with greater fiscal capacity as measured in terms of median house values were more likely to participate in social welfare IGRs. This could suggest that communities with higher property values prefer to avoid the strings that come along with accepting federal or state assistance.                     "
"53"," Political support is an important factor in IGR participation. Though mostly unassociated with social welfare provision, several indicators of the socioeconomic makeup of the community have a significant impact on IGR participation. In both 1997 and 2002, communities with more African Americans and Latinos were more likely to participate, and those with greater homeownership and a stronger business community (as measured by number of jobs) were less likely to participate.                     "
"54","Thus, the general picture that the IGR participation model paints is that IGR participation tends to reflect the local policy preferences of the community. In communities with greater need for social welfare and with significant groups that tend to support redistribution (e.g., Latinos and African Americans), participation in IGRs is more likely. And in communities where interests opposed to redistribution are more prevalent, such as homeowners and businesses, participation is less likely. This suggests, too, that IGRs only offset some of the costs of redistribution, i.e., the direct costs. Consistent with Danielson's (1976) politics of exclusion and with Fischel's (2001)“homevoter” hypothesis, homeowners and businesses may fear that they will face what they perceive to be additional costs in the future from social welfare functions, either through lower property values, change in the “character of the community” (such as in race or ethnicity), or responsibility for programs after federal or state support ends.            "
"55"," Table 3 shows coefficient estimates for the linear regression model of per capita redistributive expenditures for 1997 and 2002. Again, we find some distinct features of outcomes from the annual budget process:            "
"56","                              "
"57"," Intergovernmental influences are strong. As in the case of IGR participation and provision (at least in 2002), intergovernmental factors are highly significant in explaining local social welfare expenditures. The levels of state and federal IGRs received are highly significant in both 1997 and 2002. Moreover, it is notable that the coefficients on both state and federal IGRs in both 1997 and 2002 are either 1 or quite close to 1, suggesting that there is little local social welfare effort being crowded out. Hence, either own‐source local social welfare spending is not really aimed at being redistributive, or there is simply little own‐source social welfare spending period.                     "
"58","It is also worth noting that the impact of federal grants declined between 1997 and 2002, while that of state grants seems to have increased. In addition, the impact of the state's municipal share of state and local social welfare spending also increased. Both of these observations are consistent with a federal social welfare system that devolved authority from federal to state governments between 1997 and 2002."
"59"," Fiscal and redistributive capacity have mixed effects. Peterson (1981) argued that communities with greater fiscal capacity would be more likely to provide social welfare services. Consistent with this, median house values are positively associated with social welfare expenditures in 1997. But at the same time, 1997 per capita income is negatively associated with expenditures, and in 2002 neither fiscal capacity measure has statistical significance.                     "
"60","Likewise, there is little consistent evidence that redistributive capacity has a significant impact on social welfare spending. The coefficients on expenditure differentiation, proportion of MSA population, and number of municipalities are either statistically insignificant or are not in the expected direction. The exception to this is service differentiation: as with provision, communities that allocate money differently from their neighbors tend to have greater social welfare expenditures."
"61"," Political factors have little impact on social welfare expenditures. For the most part, the coefficients on the socioeconomic variables measuring local political preferences are either statistically insignificant or have the wrong sign. The exception to this is the ratio of jobs to population: communities with a relatively larger business community, as measured by employment, tend to have lower redistributive expenditures, as we might expect.                     "
"62"," Table 3 suggests, then, that local redistributive expenditures are largely a function of intergovernmental factors, particularly intergovernmental revenues. Not only are federal and state IGR amounts statistically significant, but also the coefficients are large enough to suggest that local effort in the absence of IGRs is limited. At the same time, it is notable that intergovernmental factors are really the only main factor that matters: redistributive capacity and political factors have little impact. This distinguishes expenditure decisions from provision decisions, in which the community's capacity to use its tax base sustainably for redistribution is significant, and from IGR participation, in which local political preferences may matter. The conventional wisdom that social welfare expenditure decisions are highly constrained and largely the outcome of intergovernmental rather than local factors thus holds, even when this wisdom does not seem to strictly apply to provision and participation decisions.            "
"63","These results challenge the conventional wisdom that local governments are “junior partners” to federal and state government in social welfare policymaking. Though local social welfare expenditures are largely consistent with this view, local governments also make decisions on whether to provide social welfare functions and, if so, whether to participate in federal and state social welfare intergovernmental revenue programs. As found above, local governments facing lower exit costs are significantly more likely to provide social welfare functions. Moreover, local decisions on participating in intergovernmental revenues tend to be responsive to the policy preferences of the community. This suggests, then, that local governments exercise a greater degree of autonomy over these provision and IGR participation decisions than we would expect under the fiscal federalism model."
"64","More generally, these results demonstrate that the political process driving decisions that shape institutional arrangements (i.e., “constitutional level” decisions) are quite different from year‐to‐year policy decisions (such as budgetary decisions; Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker 1994). In the case of local social welfare policy, provision, finance, and expenditure decisions constitute distinctly different policy arenas in local redistributive policymaking. While intergovernmental influences are significant in explaining all three sorts of decisions, expenditure decisions are affected by little else. Hence, if one were to look only at expenditures, one could conclude that local governments exercise little control over social welfare policy. In contrast, it is notable that factors related to the long‐run capacity of local governments to exploit tax base were significant in explaining the provision decisions. This suggests that local governments consider their competitive position before committing to redistributive programs that may not be sustainable.         "
"65","It is also notable that local decisions on IGR participation largely depend on the extent of local political support for redistribution, particularly the relative size of racial and ethnic groups, scope of the business community, and the homeownership rate. That is, while level of political support and demand for redistribution does not appear to be relevant for the decision to provide social welfare services, it is highly relevant for decisions on how to finance those services. What this suggests is that participation in social welfare intergovernmental revenues commits a local government to a higher degree of redistribution than if it were to provide social welfare services out of own‐source revenues, with no intergovernmental revenue strings. Consequently, communities that provide social welfare services but that have lower political support for redistribution are not as likely to participate in intergovernmental revenue programs, suggesting that in these cases social welfare may consist of activities that are only partially redistributive (such as community development focused on moderate‐income, first‐time homebuyers)."
"66","These findings have significant implications for how we should treat local governments in the study of U.S. social welfare policy. Rather than simply being “junior partners” to federal and state governments, some local governments possess considerable autonomy in addressing local poverty. Local governments make provision and finance decisions that shape budgetary decisions, and these decisions are influenced by local political context and economic capacity, not just by federal and state policy. The variation we observe in local social welfare provision and financing arrangements is at least in part attributable to the capacity of some local governments to sustain redistribution over the long run. Fiscal federalism encourages us to take a top‐down approach to the study of American welfare policy. But while the federal and state roles are dominant, neither can we neglect the role of local governments. Policy issues related to poverty often manifest themselves at a local level, and many local governments have some capacity to address these issues independently. Indeed, in an era of devolution they are increasingly required to do so. Thus, we face an increasingly pressing obligation to “bring the city back in” to the analysis of American social welfare policy."
