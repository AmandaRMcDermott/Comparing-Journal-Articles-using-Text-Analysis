"1","Increasingly, scientists and policy practitioners are recognizing that many environmental problems have regional or global consequences and thus must be addressed through regional or global policies and institutions (Vig and Axelrod 1999). By one count, more than 90 international environmental agreements have been negotiated since the 1972 U.N. Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, Sweden (Chasek 2001). The main objective of these agreements is to guarantee compliance with established rules, norms, standards, and policies in the absence of world government.         "
"2","While international agreements are becoming increasingly common tools for addressing environmental problems, designing these agreements and their associated implementing institutions is no easy task. Policy makers who would tackle environmental problems in this manner face a familiar dilemma: while the global environment would benefit from compliance with IEAs (i.e., there are collective gains from cooperation), there is an even greater incentive for nations to defect, gambling that they might obtain the benefits of the agreement through free riding. The most commonly used tools for combating free riding—sanctions—are rarely available to the architects of international environmental agreements and are even seen as counterproductive by some scholars (Levy 1993). Indeed, the overwhelming majority of IEAs are voluntary, with few sanctions for noncompliance or free riding other than expressions of dissatisfaction within the international community. Under these conditions, it is reasonable to ask how environmental agreements are supposed to solve international environmental problems; i.e., how they can motivate nations to exceed pollution control activities that they would take in the absence of the agreements, thereby obtaining gains from collective action.3"
"3","Scholars have offered a variety of reasons why voluntary IEAs might induce states to pursue environmental protection more aggressively. At the national level, effectively addressing environmental problems requires (a) increased governmental concern regarding the issue; (b) a hospitable contractual environment emphasizing monitoring and credible commitments; and (c) the governing capacity necessary to change policy. International environmental agreements can affect all of these elements through the generation and dissemination of scientific research, the creation of monitoring networks, and the generation of public pressure (Helm 1998). Nations might also act more aggressively in pursuing environmental protection if such actions could be tied to other foreign policy issues like trade, and international agreements provide an avenue for these types of cross‐policy linkages (Haas 1993). Finally, Keohane, Haas, and Levy (1993) argue that these agreements provide a channel for the productive expression of domestic political demands for environmental protection.            "
"4"," Downs (2000) provides an excellent summary of the various perspectives on how voluntary international agreements might generate collective environmental benefits. Downs argues that these agreements might be able to reshape national preferences through the processes of legitimation, role redefinition, and reflection. Through legitimation, national leaders who regard the rules and provisions of international regimes as legitimate will follow the regime's rules without a full cost‐benefit calculation (i.e., they will be less likely to free‐ride). Regimes become more legitimate by maximizing participation, through the use of consensus‐based decision rules, and as they age (older regimes are seen as more legitimate). Through role redefinition, international environmental regimes define new roles for participating nations, and these new roles cause nations to redefine their identities (e.g., as “trustworthy environmental stewards”) and attempt to live up to these identities. Finally, the “reflectivist appraisal process” generates cooperation through repeated interactions with other nations. Such repeated interaction brings a better understanding of other nations, builds trust among participants, and fosters positive feedback as successful cooperation engenders more cooperation. In order to capture these cooperative benefits, “constructivist” international environmental regimes should be inclusive (to maximize legitimation and role redefinition effects), have weak rules (to maximize participation and discourage abstentions), employ consensual decision‐making processes, and eschew sanctions and other coercive enforcement mechanisms (as these interfere with legitimation and the positive feedback aspects of reflectivism; Downs 2000; see also Levy 1993).            "
"5","While international environmental agreements may be effective, not all agreements are equal in this regard. One of the best developed frameworks focusing on this question is that of Arild Underdal. In brief, Underdal (2002) posits that the effectiveness of international environmental agreements is a product of the interaction between problem malignancy and the institutional setting created to address the problem. The core element of problem malignancy is incongruity, or the extent to which rational action on the part of individual nations produces a suboptimal outcome for all nations. The key element of the institutional setting is capacity, or the ability of these institutions to generate resources, establish rules and goals without unanimity among participants, and enforce the terms of the agreement (a very nonconstructivist position). Regimes that address malign problems with low levels of institutional capacity are less likely to be effective, and vice versa.            "
"6","The discussion above demonstrates that there are plausible causal arguments for the effectiveness of IEAs. Counterpoints to these arguments come from four directions. From a broadly theoretical standpoint, questions regarding the effectiveness of international environmental agreements invoke debates about international cooperation in general. The prospects for the emergence, maintenance, and success of such regimes form the core of a theoretical discourse dominated by the realist and the neoliberal schools of political thought. According to the realist explanation of world politics, cooperation is almost impossible to achieve and even more difficult to sustain in a world of egoistic nation‐states that act rationally under circumstances of prevailing anarchy. National leaders' main concerns are how to increase absolute gains when interacting with others in order to keep powerful positions and guarantee national security. In this world of uncertainty, states are not attracted to the idea of cooperation because of the potential for relative gains by competitors‐cum‐partners who may use these gains to their advantage (Grieco 1993). Maintaining cooperation would be even more difficult because of the high probability for cheating and noncompliance with the established rules. Applying this logic to environmental protection, commitment to a pollution control regime may decrease capacities for economic growth and competitiveness that exceed the uncertain benefits of improving international air quality. At the same time, other countries may decide to free ride and increase their political and economic capabilities at the expense of ratifying nations. Realists, therefore, are skeptical of the effectiveness of international environmental agreements (see Mearsheimer 1995).            "
"7","Formal theorists have also expressed reservations about the effectiveness of IEAs. For these scholars, the essential feature of voluntary agreements is that they must be self‐enforcing. With no sanctions, international governing bodies must make joining the agreement attractive to all relevant nations and provide incentives for these nations to abide by the terms of the agreement. Barrett (2003) concludes that international environmental regimes may achieve a high degree of cooperation among nations, but only if the difference in net benefits between the regime and no‐regime situations is small. When agreements pursue improvements in environmental quality far beyond what would be possible in a noncooperative world, cooperation can not be sustained among a large number of countries. Downs (2000) and Downs, Rocke, and Barsoom (1996) concur, noting that international environmental regimes are almost always shallow and rarely require states to do more than they would have done without the agreement. Thus, self‐enforcing international agreements may not be able to improve much upon noncooperative outcomes in environmental protection.            "
"8","Third, some scholars question the effectiveness of policy tools in general, particularly those developed by international organizations. A leading proponent of this perspective sums up the argument this way: “ … the material, institutional and socio‐cultural capacity of a country are more relevant in determining the outcome of environmental policies than its choice of policy instruments” (Jänicke 1992, 47).4 Stated differently, it matters little what environmental policies nations adopt; success in protecting the environment is a function of economic development, the political system, social values, and the cultural framework of the country. Together, these contribute to a “capacity for modernization” that countries must posses to be able to deal effectively with modern problems like environmental protection.5 According to this argument, international environmental agreements that are initiated by supranational organizations and implemented downward are often ineffective mechanisms for protecting and improving environmental quality (for a supporting view, see Ostrom 1990). Such an approach to environmental protection “hardly works” because “the higher the international level, the more the environmental policy is reduced to verbal declarations” (Jänicke 1992, 57).            "
"9","Finally, international environmental agreements embody few of the characteristics typically associated with effective public policies (see Mazmanian and Sabatier 1989).6 When studying air pollution control in the United States, for example, Ringquist (1993) finds that a basic formula for improving air quality is to enact stringent regulations, fund them adequately, and enforce them. Magat and Viscusi (1990) concur, finding that regulatory inspection and enforcement are critical to the success of water pollution control regulation in the United States. For all their shortcomings, prescriptive and coercive regulatory programs have often proven effective at reducing pollution (Gunningham, Kagan, and Thornon 2003; Knoepfel and Weidner 1982; White 1982). The environmental standards found in voluntary international agreements are seldom backed up with inspection programs or sanctions for noncompliance, and the institutions charged with overseeing the implementation of these agreements almost never have resources adequate to the task. Even advocates of these agreements note that there is good reason for skepticism regarding their effectiveness, since nations retain control of policymaking and implementation and the international institutions charged with overseeing the agreements are weak (Keohane, Haas, and Levy 1993). Thus, traditional policy scholars also might be skeptical of the effectiveness of IEAs.            "
"10","In the 1970s, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN ECE) identified the environment as an area of potential East‐West cooperation during the Cold War (see Wettestad 2002). The first product of this cooperation was the Convention on Long‐Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP, or “the Convention”) signed by 34 governments and the European Community in November 1979. According to the convention, the signatories agreed to reduce air pollution through balanced development and the use of the best available technology (UN ECE 1986, ix).            "
"11","While the framework agreed to at the convention covered all types of transboundary air pollutants, priority was given to the abatement of sulfur dioxide pollution with the signing of the Helsinki Protocol in July 1985 (later protocols covered particulate emissions, nitrous oxide emissions, emissions of volatile organic compounds, and various other pollutants). The idea for the protocol was introduced by Sweden, Norway, and Finland in 1983 and later supported by West Germany. A binding agreement was reached that called for reducing the sulfur dioxide emissions of each signatory by at least 30% compared to 1980 levels “as soon as possible and at the latest by 1993” (UN ECE 1986, ix). The Protocol entered in to force in early 1987, and 20 parties to the convention have ratified the Protocol, with some of them (e.g., Austria, Canada, France, and Sweden) having already made unilateral commitments for larger reductions (McCormick 1998). Several convention signatories refused to sign the Helsinki Protocol, including Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.            "
"12","Using Underdal's (2002) framework, the problem of reducing sulfur dioxide is highly malignant; the transboundary character of the pollutant and the resulting public good nature of pollution control creates a large incentive for nations to free ride. With respect to institutional capacity, the CLRTAP and the Helsinki Protocol are “designed for weakness,” in the constructivist tradition (Wettestad 2002, 214; for a concurring view, see Barrett 2003). The convention identified the transboundary air pollution problem and affirmed the responsibilities of individual nations for air quality management in a global plan, but imposed no specific obligations or binding commitments to undertake particular measures. Emphasis was placed on building consensus on a broader and less‐specified basis, avoiding harsh rules and unambiguous obligations that would have pushed away some of the negotiating parties. The CLRTAP oversight commission has no independent source of funding, and the main responsibilities of the five air pollution staff members include planning the regular meetings of the commission (Levy 1993). The responsibilities of the oversight commission include coordinating various national air quality research programs, standardizing the measurement and monitoring of air quality, gathering information on the air pollution control policies of member nations, and collecting and disseminating scientific and policy information. The commission engages in no research of its own, relying upon member nations to conduct air quality research. Moreover, the commission has no inspection or sanctioning authority, and the implementation of the terms of the Helsinki Protocol (and the other protocols) relies wholly upon domestic policy changes enacted by ratifying governments.            "
"13","Many international relations scholars are skeptical of the effectiveness of IEAs (see above), and some of the best empirical work focusing on the Helsinki Protocol supports this skepticism. For example, when examining national goals under the Protocol, Murdoch and Sandler conclude that “most treaty participants formulated mandates that they would have abided by, even in the absence of a treaty” (Murdoch and Sandler 1997, 142). Moreover, when simultaneously evaluating the decisions of nations to ratify the Protocol and the sulfur emissions of nations under the Protocol, Murdoch, Sandler, and Vijverberg (2003) found that though nations responded positively to relatively small emission reductions in neighboring states, they tended to free ride if other nations reduce their emissions by large amounts. While neither of these studies evaluated the effectiveness of the Protocol per se, their conclusions are consistent with the proposition that international agreements are unable to produce improvements in environmental quality beyond what would be accomplished in the absence of cooperation.            "
"14","Research explicitly evaluating the effectiveness of the Helsinki Protocol comes to more optimistic conclusions. Based upon detailed case studies, Wettestad (2002) concludes that CLRTAP in general and the Helsinki Protocol in particular have met with some success. Ratification of the protocol was followed by a large amount of policy activity in ratifying states, and compliance with the agreement is high. In addition, the regime clearly contributed to a reduction in emissions, though other factors have helped reduce emissions as well. In an early quantitative assessment, Levy (1993) comes to an even more positive conclusion, finding that the Protocol was effective in improving air quality in Europe. More technical analyses have produced similar results. Using a spatial autoregressive model, Murdoch, Sandler, and Sargent (1997) find that the Helsinki Protocol reduced emissions beyond what would have been expected in the absence of the Protocol (more pessimistic conclusions from their other work notwithstanding), but that this effect was very small. Most recently, Helm and Sprinz (2000) sought to assess both the relative and absolute effectiveness of the Protocol. Helm and Sprinz take the unusual approach of establishing their no‐regime and perfect regime counterfactuals by obtaining the best judgments from experts on what emission levels would have been in the absence of the Protocol and what they would be under a perfectly effective Protocol. They then compared these predictions to actual emission levels and aggregated these figures across nations to come up with an index of program effectiveness. The effectiveness score for the Helsinki Protocol is .39, indicating that emissions are lower than they would be in the absence of the agreement (the index lower bound of 0), but higher than they would be in a perfectly effective regime (the index upper bound of 1).            "
"15","The studies summarized above have begun to answer the key question of program effectiveness regarding the Helsinki Protocol. The work by Murdoch and his colleagues (1997, 2003) and Helm and Sprinz (2000) is particularly noteworthy in that it has dramatically advanced both the theory and method of program evaluation in this area. Still, assessing the effectiveness of international environmental agreements in general, and the Helsinki Protocol in particular, could be improved by addressing three significant shortcomings in the existing research. First, none of the existing studies makes use of temporal variation when assessing program effectiveness. Murdoch, Sandler, and Sargent (1997) and Helm and Sprinz (2000) measure Protocol effectiveness by employing static change scores that assign a single value for emissions to each nation in the data set. Both pollution emissions and Protocol implementation are dynamic processes, so static models may not be adequate for assessing program effectiveness. Moreover, given that it can take a decade or more for programs to display significant impacts (Mazmanian and Sabatier 1989), the four‐year post‐Protocol time period employed by Murdoch et al. (1997, 2003) may be too short to adequately assess Protocol effects.            "
"16","Second, while these studies employ innovative methodologies, the methods generate concerns regarding the reliability and validity of empirical results. For Murdoch et al. (1997, 2003) these concerns stem from a small sample size. Since the models these authors use employ a single change score for each nation, this means that their conclusions arise from sample sizes of roughly 25 with fewer than 20 degrees of freedom. Statistical results generated under conditions of micronumerisity are notoriously unstable. For Helm and Sprinz (2000), concerns stem from the expert judgments used to generate the counterfactuals. The authors employ only one expert for each nation in their study, and a different sample of experts might generate different data. More importantly, the methodology itself may be in need of refinement, since in their analysis actual emission reductions exceeded what would be expected under a “perfect” regime in eight cases (see Young [2001] for a similar critique).            "
"17","The greatest shortcoming in the extant research seeking to evaluate the effectiveness of the Helsinki Protocol is that none of this research recognizes that nations do not ratify the Protocol at random.7 Participation in the Protocol is voluntary, which means that nations self‐select into the “treatment group” (ratifying nations) and the “control group” (nonratifying nations). Failing to account for the self‐selected nature of treatment and control groups poses grave dangers for estimates of program effectiveness. Under conditions of nonrandom assignment, we have no way of knowing if post‐Protocol differences between ratifying and nonratifying nations are due to the Protocol, or due to pre‐existing differences between these two groups of nations. Indeed, the work by Murdoch and Sandler (1997) strongly suggests the latter in the case of the Helsinki Protocol. A relatively well‐developed technical literature exists regarding the estimation of program effects from self‐selected samples. We introduce this literature, and the associated statistical techniques, in the next section.            "
"18","Assuming that the policy intervention takes place during time period k, the simplest statistical model for estimating the effects of public policies takes the following form               "
"19","With nonrandom assignment to treatment and control groups, this basic model is no longer accurate. Defining Yit as above and Y*it as the value of Yit in the absence of the policy, under nonrandom assignment;               "
"20","Including regressors in the basic policy effect equation offered above gives us the linear model most commonly estimated by social scientists,               "
"21","Various approaches have been developed that allow researchers to obtain consistent estimates of policy effects under nonrandom assignment. In this section we discuss the three most common approaches to estimating policy effects with panel data and a diagnostic tool necessary to select the best estimation routine from these options."
"22","Control Function Estimators The first class of estimators, dubbed “control function estimators” (see Heckman and Hotz 1989; Heckman and Robb 1985), assumes that differences between treatment and control groups with respect to Y*it are due to factors that are causally related to the treatment status of units, but not to the outcome of interest. This process is often termed “selection on observables,” since the factors leading to systematic differences between treatment and control groups can be observed and modeled. Murdoch and Sandler (1997) suggest that just such process operated within the context of the Helsinki Protocol. These authors posit that nations with larger forest regions, more political freedom, etc., were more likely to ratify the protocol and that these factors lead to fundamental differences between ratifiers and nonratifiers that make estimating the effects of the protocol quite problematic. The most appropriate approach under these circumstances is to include the variables related to treatment status (Z) in the equation estimating the effect of the policy, so that the full equation now takes the form                  "
"23","Fixed Effects Estimators This class of estimators assumes that the systematic differences between treatment and control groups with respect to Y*it is a function of unobserved but temporally invariant characteristics of units (e.g., persons, countries), and these characteristics are often assumed to affect both the probability of treatment and the effect of the treatment. Thus, controlling for these effects eliminates the endogeneity of the treatment noted above. The approach to generating consistent estimates of policy effects under these circumstances will be familiar to anyone experienced in estimating panel models with unit effects. The fixed‐effects model can be estimated by including cross‐sectional dummy variables so that                  "
"24","Random Trend Estimators This final class of traditional estimators assumes that the systematic differences between treatment and control groups with respect to Y*it are a function of unit‐specific rates of change in Yit, represented here as wit. This situation is highly likely with respect to the Helsinki protocol, since nation specific trends in sulfur dioxide emissions varied dramatically in the pre‐protocol period (Levy 1993). The random trend approach commonly attributes some of the differences between treatment and control groups to temporally invariant unit effects, so that the full random trend estimation model takes the following form9"
"25"," Heckman and Hotz (1989) offer a number of relatively simple statistical tests for assessing whether the models described above adequately account for differences between treatment and control groups stemming from nonrandom selection. With longitudinal data of the type employed here, these specification tests assign a policy intervention or trend variable to all members of the treatment group in the pre‐policy period, and then estimate the selection bias models using only pre‐policy data. Since no policy intervention has taken place, the parameters associated with the policy and trend variables in the pre‐policy phase should be nonsignificant. If significant “policy” effects are found in the pre‐policy phase, any differences between treatment and control groups in the post‐policy period almost certainly reflect a continuation of these pre‐policy phase differences, rather than any true policy effect.            "
"26","In this section we craft a model for investigating changes in sulfur dioxide emissions for nations that participated in the 1979 Convention on Long‐Range Transboundary Air Pollution. This model contains three elements: policy factors, external environmental factors, and national capacity and development factors. Before discussing the components of the model, however, it might be useful to reiterate two points made earlier. First, because not all nations participating in the Convention signed the Helsinki Protocol, our model compares changes in sulfur dioxide emissions between signatory and nonsignatory nations. Second, since not all signatories ratified the protocol at the same time, our model compares the relative progress made in signatory states before and after ratification."
"27","Due to various factors, we can not investigate these two questions for all of the 33 nations that participated in the Convention. First, during our time frame, both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia ceased to exist, while other newly independent nations were created. Many of these nations participated in the Convention and/or signed the Protocol. Given that the boundaries and the political, economic, and social character of these states changed dramatically, they are omitted from the analysis. Second, several of the participants to the Convention did not monitor sulfur dioxide emissions (e.g., Greece, Romania, Iceland, the Holy See). With no data for the dependent variable, we had to exclude these nations from the analysis. Finally, given our emphasis on Europe, the United States and Canada are excluded from the analysis. After these omissions, our data set includes information for 19 nations over 15 years"
"28","The Helsinki Protocol does not set targets for absolute emission levels. Rather, the protocol establishes percentage reduction goals for each nation (see above). Thus, our dependent variable is sulfur dioxide emissions in each of the 19 nations identified in the appendix, from 1980 to 1994, as a percentage of emissions in 1980.            "
"29","Policy Effects While previous research has demonstrated that, under certain conditions, public policy may be able to effectively address certain social problems, there is significant disagreement over the effectiveness of public policy in improving environmental quality. This uncertainty is particularly evident with respect to the effectiveness of international environmental agreements. In order to speak to this debate, our models of changes in air pollution must include factors representing these agreements. Traditionally, policy interventions are represented by a dummy variable taking on a value of 1 for nations in years after signing the protocol (which captures level effects), and a counter or lagged endogenous variable that takes the value of zero prior to ratification of the protocol (which captures trend effects; see Berry and Lewis‐Beck 1986; McCleary and Hay 1980). We adopt this convention here, employing a counter variable that measures the number of months since each nation ratified the protocol (UN ECE 1994). If ratification and subsequent efforts to meet the goals of the protocol reduced sulfur dioxide emissions, the coefficient for both policy variables will be negative.10"
"30","External Environmental Factors If we are to adequately assess the effects of public policy in improving environmental quality, we need to control for external environmental factors. For example, nations that consume more fossil fuels and produce a higher level of industrial output will generate more pollution, all other things equal. We represent industrial activity as the total value of industrial output in each nation, in each year, measured in millions of 1990 US dollars (European Marketing Data and Statistics 1993; Industrial Development Global Report 1995; UN ECE 1997). Because our dependent variable is measured as a percentage from a 1980 baseline, industrial activity is measured as percentages from a 1980 baseline as well. We expect that this variable will produce a positive parameter estimate.               "
"31","While our emissions model controls for industrial production, it does not control for fossil fuel consumption. The combustion of fossil fuels, particularly coal, clearly contributes to sulfur dioxide pollution. On the other hand, reducing coal consumption has been an important tactic employed by European nations seeking to reduce their emissions of sulfur (Underdal and Hanf 2000). Thus, changes in coal consumption are probably endogenous to Protocol ratification. Previous research regarding the effectiveness of air pollution control policies has estimated the direct and indirect effects of these policies through recursive causal models (Ringquist 1993). We take a different approach here, estimating a reduced form emissions model in which the parameter for the ratification of the Helsinki Protocol reflects both direct and indirect effects, including indirect effects through coal consumption. We also estimated models that included a coal consumption variable, and our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the Helsinki Protocol remained unchanged.               "
"32","National Capacity and Development There are sufficient theoretical reasons and empirical evidence to believe that national capacity and development factors will affect a nation's ability to adequately protect environmental quality. Indeed, Jänicke (1990, 1992), Sprinz (1998), and others make a compelling case for a strong relationship between national characteristics and environmental quality. When attempting to operationalize these multifaceted relationships, however, two things become clear. First, there are as yet no good over‐time measures for most of the concepts identified with a nation's institutional capacity (e.g., the cooperative nature of the political system, the ability to make long‐term commitments) or socio‐cultural capacity (e.g., public opinion data on support for environmental protection). Second, the most critical measure of national capacity is available for each nation in each year of our study—per capita gross domestic product.               "
"33","There are several reasons why we believe per capita GDP is the most critical measure of national capacity and development. First, it is the single best measure of what Jänicke (1992) calls “material capacity.” Second, given the interrelated nature of the Jänicke's three dimensions of national capacity, per capita GDP serves as a reasonable proxy for other capacity dimensions (e.g., better‐off nations find it easier to have open political systems and professional political institutions (Jänicke 1992); and public concern for environmental issues varies directly with national standards of living in Europe (Inglehart 1990)). Third, this particular measure of economic development has proven to be a powerful predictor of pollution levels (Grossman and Krueger 1995; Seldon and Song 1994).               "
"34","For these reasons, the fourth and fifth independent variables in the models that follow are per capita GDP and per capita GDP squared in each nation, in each year, measured in thousands of U.S. dollars (at 1991 price levels and purchasing power parity) (Goldman 1997; OECD 1997; UN ECE 1997). If certain environmental advocates are correct and increased economic development leads to decreased environmental quality, coefficients for both variables should be positive. On the other hand, if “Kuznet's curve” advocates are correct (e.g., Grossman 1995), the linear coefficient should be positive, while the squared term should be negative (i.e., pollution emissions decline at higher levels of economic development). Of course, the expected signs for these coefficients assume that several of the countries in our sample have not yet reached the threshold level of economic development where further development produces less pollution. Given that there are no clearly developing nations in our sample, this assumption may be misplaced. Finally, if material capacity is an important predictor of pollution levels, at a minimum the sign of the linear term should be negative. The sign of the coefficient on the squared term is less determinate. If the capacity effect experiences diminishing marginal returns, the squared term will be positive, but the entire function will never become positive within the bounds of the observed data (i.e., increased per capita GDP will never result in higher pollution levels in our sample). On the other hand, if the marginal returns to pollution reduction from economic development are linear or increasing, the coefficient for the squared term will be zero or negative.11"
"35","Strategic Behavior Controlling pollution is often viewed as an imperfect public good in that because of spillovers (i.e., pollution that crosses national boundaries), some of the value of these goods accrues to those who do not provide them. In a substantial contribution to our understanding of international behavior in environmental protection, Murdoch et al. (1997, 2003) illustrate the value of explicitly modeling the strategic behavior of nations when faced with providing these goods. For example, consider the pollution control decisions of nations i and j where a substantial amount of j's pollution falls on i. If j aggressively reduces pollution, i will benefit and thus has less incentive to reduce pollution on its own. In short, in a system characterized by spillovers, nations will attempt to free‐ride on the public good provision of others. Data on the spillovers of sulfur dioxide emissions were obtained from the sulfur transport matrix developed by the Cooperative Program for Monitoring and Evaluation of Long‐Range Transmission of Air Pollution in Europe (EMEP 2003). For each nation (i) in our data set we identified the three largest sources of sulfur dioxide spillovers (j1‐j3). We then created three variables representing the percentage of all sulfur depositions in nation i coming from nations j1‐j3, weighted by emissions as a percentage of the 1980 baseline in nations j1‐j3. If nations behave strategically, larger emissions reductions in nations j1‐j3 will generate smaller emission reductions in nation i, which will be represented by negative parameter estimates on these three strategic response variables.12"
"36","German Reunification Both before and after reunification, Germany was the largest source of sulfur dioxide emissions in Europe. Prior to reunification, Germany was also a leader in pushing for reductions in the emissions of this pollutant. After reunification, however, sulfur dioxide emissions attributable to Germany increased markedly. To control for this effect, we include a binary variable coded 1 for Germany in the years after reunification.               "
"37","Given the near equivalence of the spatial and temporal dimensions of our panel and the high probability of correlated errors across nations in the sample, we estimate all models using OLS with panel corrected standard errors (Beck and Katz 1995). All models also include year‐specific intercepts.            "
"38","The results reported in the first column of Table 1 look reasonably good. Most important for our purposes, both the estimated level and trend effect from the ratification of the Helsinki Protocol are negative and significant. In particular, the results from the base model suggest that ratifying nations saw an immediate and permanent emission reduction 8.3% greater than that experienced by nonratifying nations, and that this difference grew by roughly 3% per year (.247 × 12). In addition, almost all of the control variables have parameter estimates in the hypothesized direction (though few are statistically significant). We see that increases in per capita GDP are associated with reduced emissions, though the positive coefficient on the quadratic term signifies possible diminishing marginal returns associated with this effect. Second, the negative parameter estimates on all three strategic response variables are consistent with free‐riding behavior in emissions reduction (these variables are jointly significant in all models). Third, emissions attributable to Germany rose dramatically after reunification. Only the industrial production variable generates a parameter estimate contrary to expectations, though this estimate is effectively zero.            "
"39","To test the adequacy of this model, we estimated the model using only pre‐ratification data. This diagnostic demonstrates that any conclusions that the Helsinki Protocol has been effective are in error. While there is no difference in levels, the specification test shows that in the pre‐protocol period nations that would eventually ratify the protocol saw their sulfur dioxide emissions drop 2.5% faster each year than did nations that would not ratify the protocol. This figure is nearly identical to the post‐protocol trend reported above and illustrates that this post‐protocol difference is simply a continuation of pre‐protocol trends. Clearly, we need to move beyond this base model if we are to control for selection bias and obtain consistent estimates of protocol effects."
"40","Recall that in attempting to eliminate the dependence between the error term and the policy treatment, control function models include factors that affect the assignment to the treatment or control group but are unrelated to the outcome variable. For our purposes, this means that a control function model should include variables that affect whether a country will ratify the Helsinki Protocol, but are unrelated to sulfur dioxide emissions. Murdoch and Sandler (1997) offer a model emphasizing just these types of control factors. Specifically, nations that are heavily forested and nations whose SO2 pollution falls largely within their own borders will be more likely to ratify the protocol since such an action will produce relatively large net benefits. Similarly, governments in nations scoring high on a common index of political freedom will be more likely to ratify the protocol to avoid the political consequences of being seen as an environmental laggard. Finally, nations where the costs of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions are high will be less likely to ratify the protocol. Thus, our control function model includes variables representing the percent of each nation's land area covered by forests, the percentage of SO2 deposition in each nation originating from domestic sources, the cost of reducing SO2 pollution, and a dummy variable identifying those nations scoring high on political freedom.            "
"41","The estimated policy effect from our control function model is negative and strongly significant, indicating a level change of 10.5% for ratifying nations and that SO2 emissions in these countries fell 2.6% faster per year than SO2 emissions in countries that did not ratify the protocol. Other variables in the model also have coefficients in the hypothesized direction. Among the control function variables, our results suggest that freer nations and nations whose pollution falls largely within their own borders reduced pollution more, while the costs of pollution control are negatively associated with emission reductions, as expected.            "
"42","To test the adequacy of this model, we turn to the pre‐protocol specification tests. Once again, the test demonstrates that our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the Helsinki Protocol were in error. The specification test shows that in the pre‐protocol period, on average, nations that would eventually ratify the protocol saw their sulfur dioxide emissions drop 2.4% faster each year than did nations that would not ratify the protocol. Again, this figure is nearly identical to the estimated post‐protocol trend effect, suggesting that the post‐protocol estimate is simply the continuation of the pre‐protocol trend. These results also illustrate the inadequacy of the control function model in mitigating selection bias."
"43","The third column of Table 1 presents the results of our fixed effect approach to estimating policy effects. The estimated policy effect from this model is also negative and significant, suggesting that SO2 emissions in countries that ratified the Helsinki Protocol fell immediately by 9.9% and continued to fall 1.8% faster per year when compared with emissions in countries that did not ratify the protocol. Other variables in the model have coefficients in the hypothesized direction, though again few are statistically significant.            "
"44","The fixed effect model suggests that the Helsinki Protocol has reduced sulfur dioxide emissions in ratifying nations at a modest rate. When evaluating this conclusion using pre‐protocol data in the fixed effect and random trend frameworks, we can no longer test for pre‐program differences in levels. These tests, then, focus only upon the more important differences in trends.13 Once again, this diagnostic test demonstrates that initial conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the Helsinki Protocol were in error. The specification test shows that in the pre‐protocol period, on average, nations that would eventually ratify the protocol saw their sulfur dioxide emissions drop 1.2% faster each year than did nations that would not ratify the protocol. This suggests that any post‐protocol differences are simply continuations of pre‐protocol trends.            "
"45","The diagnostic tests above demonstrate that neither the control function model nor the fixed effects model adequately control for differences between nations that ratified the Helsinki Protocol and those that did not. In their study of job training programs, Heckman and Hotz (1989) find both the control function and fixed effects models inadequate to the task. Their analysis suggests that under conditions of self‐selection into treatment and control groups, a random trend model may be superior to these first two alternatives. Moreover, the more recent technical literature emphasizes the more general utility of random trend models (Wooldridge 2003), and the specific air pollution histories of European nations suggest that random trend models are more appropriate (Levy 1993; Murdoch and Sandler 1997). The results of our random trend model are presented in the fourth column of Table 1.            "
"46","The results from the random trend model are substantially different from previous models. The estimated level effect associated with ratification of the Helsinki Protocol is still negative, but is no longer statistically significant. Moreover, the estimated trend effect is now positive and also not significant. In short, the results from the random trend model indicate that the Helsinki Protocol has had no independent effect on reducing SO2 emissions in ratifying countries. Once again, other variables in the model have coefficients in the expected direction including, for the first time, the expected positive and significant coefficient for industrial output. Turning to the specification test, we see that the coefficient on the pre‐protocol trend variable for ratifying nations is no longer statistically significant. This illustrates that introducing unit specific levels and trends effectively controls for the bias arising from self‐selection on the part of nations and gives us confidence in the results generated by the random trend model.14"
"47","Before concluding that the Helsinki Protocol has been ineffective at reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, we should take care to rule out the most common threats to the validity of this conclusion. We see three such threats: domain restrictions on the sample, specification error, and alternative measurement of the dependent variable. In this section, we address each in turn."
"48","Controlling for Eastern Europe Several of the former Soviet Bloc nations of Eastern Europe have ratified the Helsinki Protocol. However, these nations have very different historical experiences with environmental protection, not to mention economies, political institutions, and even national cultures that are in flux. This legacy of inefficient industrial capacity, a political culture that placed little value on environmental quality, and even the use of coal for residential space heating means that the process of SO2 production and policy effects may be very different in these countries. One could plausibly argue, therefore, that the effect of protocol ratification should differ between Eastern and Western Europe.               "
"49","To test for the effects of the Helsinki Protocol in Western Europe only, we first eliminated all former Soviet bloc nations from our sample and then reestimated the fixed effects and random trend models from Table 1. These results, found in the first and third columns of Table 2, are virtually identical to those produced from the sample of all nations. The fixed effects model shows negative and significant level and trend effects from protocol ratification, but the specification test shows that this model does not adequately control for selection bias. The statistically consistent treatment effects estimates from the random trend model show no effect on emission reductions from ratification of the Helsinki Protocol.               "
"50","Controlling for National Pollution Control Efforts A different picture of the Helsinki Protocol might emerge if we could control for the domestic capacity and/or domestic investments made by each nation in pollution control. Toward this end, we included a variable measuring governmental spending for environmental protection in each nation, from 1980 to 1994, as a percentage of GDP. Expenditures are generally identified as one of the most valid indicators of the capacity of environmental policymaking institutions (Jänicke 1992; Ringquist 1993) and are often used to measure environmental policy efforts (see Lester 1995). Unfortunately, no widely available sources contain data for pollution control expenditures for all years and all countries in our study. In fact, the most complete data set available contains missing expenditure data for approximately 39% of all country/years (OECD 1997).15 We dealt with this missing data problem by employing the multiple imputation algorithm of King et al. (1999). Through the use of King et al.'s (1999)“AMELIA” missing data software, we created five sets of imputed spending data. We then used these data to reestimate the fixed effects and random trend models from Table 1, though even with this approach we could only estimate the models for 11 nations. The averages from these estimations are presented in columns 2 and 4 of Table 2, and these results illustrate that including measures of national effort in pollution control has no effect on the estimated impact of the Helsinki Protocol.16"
"51","Estimating Effects on Overall Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Finally, our conclusions regarding the ineffectiveness of the Helsinki Protocol might be a function of the dependent variable. While protocol targets are stated in terms of percentage reductions from a 1980 base level, perhaps the effectiveness of the protocol might be more apparent when looking at total sulfur dioxide emissions. We reestimated the fixed effects and random trend models from Tables 1 and 2 employing a dependent variable representing the annual SO2 emissions for each nation from 1980 to 1994, measured in thousands of tons. All independent variables previously measured as percentages or changes were also transformed to levels. The results from these models (not shown) showed no significant differences in patterns of sulfur dioxide emissions between nations that ratified the Helsinki Protocol and those that did not.               "
"52","We began our investigation of the effectiveness of the 1985 Helsinki Protocol for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions with the recognition that cross‐national data comparable over time are needed, that factors other than the Protocol affect pollution levels, and that the decisions of nations to join the regime are voluntary. Previous research evaluating the effectiveness of the Helsinki Protocol—all of which found significant Protocol effects—failed to control for one or more of these issues, which inevitably biased their assessments of policy effectiveness. After controlling for these elements, we obtain results suggesting that the 1985 Helsinki Protocol has made no difference in nations' success at reducing sulfur dioxide emissions."
"53","The findings obtained using the more traditional models of policy impact—the base, control function, and fixed effects models—indicate that nations ratifying the Helsinki Protocol reduced sulfur dioxide emissions at rates higher than nonratifiers. Not controlling for the nonrandom nature of ratification, one would conclude that the Helsinki Protocol was responsible for greater reductions in air pollution in ratifying nations. The diagnostic tests, however, demonstrate that differences in emission reduction rates between ratifying and nonratifying nations were virtually identical before and after ratification. Thus, the better environmental performance of ratifying countries can not stem from ratification of the Helsinki accord. More probably, larger reductions in sulfur dioxide in nations that ratified the protocol are attributable to domestic policies, determination, and commitments that would have occurred even in the absence of the protocol. In addition, our conclusions are consistent with those of Murdoch and Sandler (1997) in that they suggest nations that were already substantially reducing their sulfur dioxide emissions may have been more likely to ratify the protocol. These results demonstrate the importance of controlling for nonrandom selection when assessing the effectiveness of voluntary environmental agreements.         "
"54","While our results do not give us confidence in the environmental effectiveness of the Helsinki Protocol, any conclusions that international regimes in general are irrelevant for protecting the global environment are premature. First, overall evaluations of the success of the Helsinki Protocol do not stand or fall on the effectiveness of the protocol at reducing sulfur dioxide pollution. Previous research has shown that CLRTAP in general and the Helsinki Protocol in particular has had the important effects of elevating awareness of air pollution problems in Europe, establishing a system of air pollution monitors generating consistent data, reducing the uncertainty regarding the causes and extent of sulfur dioxide pollution in Europe, and facilitated the sharing of scientific information between nations (Levy 1993; Underdal and Hanf 2000; Wettestad 2002). All of these effects must be considered together when evaluating the success of the Helsinki Protocol.         "
"55","Second, while the Helsinki Protocol may not have been successful at reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, a more differentiated approach to setting regime goals may prove to be more effective. The Helsinki Protocol imposed a common pollution reduction requirement on all participants, but this protocol has been superceded by the Oslo Protocol, agreed to in 1994 and ratified by a majority of UNECE member nations in 1998. The Oslo Protocol replaces the across‐the‐board goal of a 30% reduction in sulfur emissions with a set of country‐specific emission reduction targets based upon “critical loads” for sulfur deposition in each signatory nation. Thus, the Oslo Protocol may be more effective."
"56","Third, our null results regarding the effectiveness of the Helsinki Protocol may stem from unmodeled temporal dynamics. On the one hand, replacing the industrial capital responsible for most sulfur dioxide pollution (e.g., utility and industrial boilers, though not the fuel they use) is a long‐term process. Thus, our evaluation of protocol effects may come too soon. On the other hand, ratifying nations may have changed their pollution emission behavior in anticipation of ratification of the protocol, so that some of the effects of the protocol may pre‐date ratification of the protocol itself. In this case, our evaluation of protocol effects comes too late. Either story is plausible, but we leave it to future research to assess their validity.17"
"57","Finally, the Helsinki Protocol is simply one element of one international environmental agreement (CLRTAP), and given the weakness of the CLRTAP as an institution, an argument could be made that the Helsinki Protocol was not likely to be particularly effective. In addition, the effectiveness of any environmental regime is determined not only by the characteristics of the institution, but by the malignancy of the problem addressed by the regime (Underdal 2002). The problem of sulfur dioxide pollution is highly malignant, so if the Helsinki Protocol has been ineffective at reducing sulfur dioxide pollution, this may say more about the difficulty in controlling this pollutant than it does about the overall effectiveness of international environmental agreements.         "
"58","While these caveats all present plausible arguments for the effectiveness of international environmental agreements, conclusions regarding the overall success of these agreements must wait until we have evaluations of a representative sample of the more than 90 international environmental agreements currently in existence. When conducting these evaluations, researchers should rigorously evaluate these arguments using techniques that recognize the nonrandom nature of participation in international environmental regimes."
