"1","Economic reality structures economic evaluations. This is both natural and reassuring. Little argument is required to support this claim and some evidence indeed supports it. In general, people feel more optimistic about the current and future economy when the present looks good. More specifically, when inflation rates soar or unemployment hits double digits, economic evaluations become more pessimistic (Fuhrer 1988; Krause 1997). When leading economic indicators predict good times ahead, the public's expectations of the economic future improve (MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson 1992; Blood and Phillips 1995). When interest rates rise, concerns about the present state of the economy and doubts about the future increase as well. We can cite many other examples as variations on this theme but the conclusion remains the same: economic conditions form the basis for economic evaluations.         "
"2","Our analysis, which will proceed in several steps, begins here, in an effort to show how the national economy structures the over‐time dynamics of economic evaluations. At this point, the data we use are familiar to students of macro political behavior. The Survey of Consumer Attitudes and Behavior conducted by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan has surveyed Americans regularly for over four decades. We focus on the index of consumer sentiment that is based on series of questions from this survey. The items are a mixture of forward‐looking (“what do you expect”) and backward‐looking items (“are things better now than they were”), as well as personal (“your household”) and national (“the country as a whole”). These components are correlated quite strongly, such that the over‐time dynamics of retrospections and expectations are virtually indistinguishable.2"
"3","Consumer sentiment is presented in Figure 1, with monthly observations from January 1981 through August 2002. What we see is considerable variation. Things were rather gloomy when Reagan took office and remained so for a couple years. Notice the speed of the rebound here, though. We go from a value of 62 in March of 1982 to a value of 101 in exactly two years, a 40‐point swing. We hovered in fairly positive territory for the rest of Reagan's time in office. Sentiment takes a plunge in mid‐1990 when Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait. There is a brief but enormous recovery in confidence that coincides with the success in the Gulf War. After that sentiment fades, though—and it fades rather quickly—returning to historic lows in January 1992, setting the stage for a tough “It's the economy, stupid” reelection campaign for Bush the Elder. We hit a mini‐high in December of that year, after Clinton wins but before he's sworn in. The honeymoon is brief, but then the good times of the 1990s begin to roll, and roll, and roll, making the boom of the 1980s appear tame, at least from the point of view of consumers. We begin to fall off the confidence cliff in January of 2001, just as the country finds out who really did win the election back in November. The local minimum here at the end of the series coincides with August 2001, the month before the terrorist attacks. There was a brief rally thereafter, but that rally seems to have stalled.         "
"4","                 The Index of Consumer Sentiment, 1981–2002                      "
"5","As this historical sketch implies, economic sentiment is influenced by economic reality. Periods of negative consumer sentiment coincided with the recessions at the beginning of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, and the expansions of the 1980s and mid‐1990s witnessed sustained periods of positive economic evaluations. We can move beyond the historical sketch, though, to more systematic documentation of the effects of the “ objective” economy on the “subjective” economy. Rounding up the usual economic suspects, we model consumer sentiment similarly to Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson (2002, Chapter 2), including current and lags 1 and 2 of the monthly and quarterly growth rates in lagging and coincident economic indicators, inflation, and unemployment. Current levels of unemployment are included as well.3"
"6","We want to do more than reaffirm the economic foundations of economic sentiment; we want to identify two separate components of sentiment: that due to economic conditions and that due to something else. In order to do so, we make two modeling choices. First we saturate our models of economic sentiment, including a number of lags of highly collinear economic time series. Second, we do not include a lagged dependent variable. This allows us to purge as much of the effects of the real economy from the evaluations as possible, thereby maximizing the opportunity for the economy to explain the variation in sentiment.4 This has two additional consequences. First, we see insignificant and sometimes perversely signed effects on the economic variables. Second, our estimates are inefficient. Importantly, the estimates remain unbiased and asymptotically consistent. While normally such results are distressing, in this setup they serve us well, providing an excellent ex ante forecast of economic sentiment based solely on economic conditions. Subtracting this from the original sentiment series (or simply taking the residuals from this model) leaves us with a measure of economically irrational optimism and pessimism.         "
"7","Consistent with Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson's (2002) findings, the subjective economy is driven by the objective one. Block F‐tests indicate a significant role for each of the economic indicators and the model explains over 75% of the variation in consumer sentiment (Table 1). If the subjective economy were solely a function of the objective one, then the residuals from the above models would be white noise. This is not what we find. We have plotted these residual series in Figure 2, where we see a notable absence of randomness. The zero line represents an equilibrium of sorts, where economic evaluations are perfectly in synch with objective economic conditions. In effect, what these residuals represent are periods of hyperoptimism or hyperpessimism about the American economy, for the numbers quite literally represent the degree to which expectations or recollections are too rosy or too gloomy given the objective economic situation. To borrow the words of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, we might be tempted to call this “ irrational exuberance”—that is, optimism on the part of the public beyond that which is warranted by economic conditions.         "
"8","                 Irrational Exuberance, 1981–2000                      "
"9","The flip side of that coin would be something like “ irrational pessimism,” or economic sentiment that is considerably more pessimistic than would be expected given economic reality. One such period of hypergloominess came about at the end of George H.W. Bush's Administration, while he was running for reelection. While the Clinton‐Gore team hammered away at what they called the worst economic management since Herbert Hoover's Administration—recall their campaign operatives mocking Bush's name as “George Herbert Hoover Bush”—the implicit theme of the Bush campaign seemed to be, “Things really aren't that bad.” The series portrayed in Figure 2 lends a bit of credence to that theme, because people were, indeed, systematically too pessimistic during 1992, more pessimistic than they should have been, given objective reality.         "
"10","More generally, we can see from the figure the clustering of residuals above and below the zero point. We observe, for example, a public too pessimistic at the beginning of Reagan's first term; that is, despite the fact that the economy was, objectively, in bad shape, we see here that consumer confidence was even worse off, to the tune of 10 points too pessimistic. But that hyperpessimism didn't last, and for most of the 1980s, we actually were a bit too full of our economic selves, according to the figure. In 1987, the revelations of the Reagan Administration's role in the Iran‐Contra arms‐for‐hostages swap send the public into pessimistic territory. Then things seem to equilibrate until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. (The low point is the end of 1990, just before Desert Storm.) There is a spike into hyperoptimism that coincides with the war's success, followed by a quick backslide, and more time 10 to 12 points in the “too pessimistic” region just as George H.W. Bush was seeking reelection. The positive spike here happens when Clinton is elected, but is short‐lived, and the country remains mired in hyper‐pessimism for most of Clinton's first term. But the perceived economic gloom fades into optimism, even hyper‐optimism, as the 1990s boom materializes, and we see some of Alan Greenspan's “Irrational Exuberance.” (The one downward spike coincides with the Monica Lewinsky scandal.) Examining the figure, we might expect to see some colossally positive residuals here as we move through the mid‐1990s. But they are no more positive than the hyperoptimism of the 1980s, because the economy really was smoking along then. So, comparing this figure to Figure 1, we see that consumer confidence was higher, far higher, in the 1990s boom than in the 1980s boom. What this current figure suggests is that the 1990s confidence was at least as warranted as mid‐1980s confidence; our economic heads really were no more inflated in the late 1990s than they were in the mid‐1980s.         "
"11","All of this is leading to the inescapable admission that economic sentiment is a function of things in addition to the economy. Periods of irrational exuberance or irrational gloom are systematic and often last for months and years on end. These systematic periods require a systematic explanation. We turn now to making that systematic explanation, focusing on the role that political forces play in the formation of economic sentiment.         "
"12","At the most basic level, economists recognize that policy and politics can affect economic reality, making it straightforward to infer that policy and politics provide information to citizens that should affect their subjective economic evaluations. Consider, too, that citizens hold elected officials—particularly the president—accountable for the state of the economy. Citizens blame the president for bad times and credit him for good times (Beck 1991; Bloom and Price 1975; Brody 1991; Chappell and Keech 1985; Fiorina 1981; Haller and Norpoth 1994; Hibbs 1987; Kinder and Kiewiet 1979, 1981; Markus 1988; Tufte 1978). Elected officials, in turn, know the importance of economic evaluations for their political future. They are well aware that political capital—popular support and votes—is at stake. Incumbents have incentives, then, both to follow economic policy that will improve the objective economy and to convince citizens that the economy is doing well under their management. The administration's ability to take credit (or avoid blame) for economic outcomes should therefore influence how citizens view the subjective economy. In this sense, politics affects the public's evaluations of the past, present, and future economy. Thus conceptualized, politics completes our understanding of the relationships between economic conditions and evaluations of elected officials.5"
"13","What aspects of politics influence economic evaluations? We begin as Norpoth (1996a) does by considering elections, the effects of the party in government, and war. We then consider political forces which, while more mundane, are, in our view, more important in determining economic evaluations.            "
"14","Elections buoy hopes for the future. New administrations generate opportunities for improvement in general and, more specifically, in the state of the economy (Haller and Norpoth 1994; Krause 1997; Norpoth 1996a). Politicians and citizens alike are willing to grant recent victors leeway to pursue policies championed on the campaign trail. The public's optimism surrounding election periods may be particularly warranted when the pre‐election economy is in recession and campaign promises include actions or legislation designed to stimulate the economy.            "
"15","Election results also affect economic evaluations indirectly by determining the partisanship of the president. Each party has its own supporters and detractors. In the same way that partisanship influences views of candidates and elected officials, it colors evaluations of economic reality: Republicans are more likely to think positively of the future under Republican administrations, and Democrats are less likely to do so (Conover, Feldman, and Knight 1987; Mutz 1992; Wlezien, Franklin, and Twiggs 1995). Further, Republicans (Democrats) are more likely to discount bad news under a Republican (Democratic) administration, resisting messages that reflect poorly on their party leader (Zaller 1992). Aggregate shifts in economic evaluations should thus follow changes in administrations in predictable ways.            "
"16","The expected effects of war are much less transparent. Norpoth (1996a) argues that scandals and wars create political uncertainty and heightened tension, which in turn creates economic uncertainty and may depress economic evaluations. War making may also distract incumbents from economic management and produce concerns about the future economy in the minds of citizens, and indeed Norpoth did find that economic evaluations fell with the onset of both the Gulf and Vietnam Wars and rebounded at their conclusion. (See Nadeau et al. 1999 for different findings.)            "
"17","Other political events occur with much less fanfare, but not necessarily with less significance for either the objective or subjective economy. Economists recognize that economic policy embodied in political actions can and does influence the state of the economy (Alesina, Londregan, and Rosenthal 1993; Williams 1990). Increases in federal spending produce increases in consumption and production while decreases in spending lead to similar decreases. Thus budgets provide citizens with signals about current and future economic conditions (Alt 1991).            "
"18","The budget‐making process provides two sorts of information about the future of the economy. The first type is highly technical and probably beyond the reach of the average citizen's desire or ability to comprehend. When the government runs a deficit in a particular year, it must borrow money to make up the shortfall in revenues. That translates into an increased demand for capital, which both drives up interest rates and restricts the amount of capital available for private‐sector investment. In the long run, that is bad news for the future of the economy. Although most Americans understand all too well the effects of high interest rates, it is unlikely that many could trace their cause to federal budget deficits. But economists and professional investors can. Budget deficits provide a second type of information about the economic future, however, which is more comprehensible to most citizens. When the government spends more than it takes in, it violates a fundamental law by which most families live: You can't spend more than you earn. Anyone who has struggled to balance a checkbook knows that if you spend too much for too long, you can't pay all of your bills. And that bodes poorly for the future. Rightly or wrongly, we suspect that most people impose this sensible view of family economics onto their government. When the government deficit grows substantially, people think that bad times will follow, but when deficits turn into surpluses, optimism will follow."
"19","Confidence in the government's stewardship of the economy may also influence economic evaluations. When citizens have faith in the economic competence of the administration, they may view the economic future more optimistically, because they perceive the economy to be in good hands. In contrast, if the public feels that the administration is inept or untrustworthy, this may filter into negative expectations about the economic future, or even the economic past. Regardless of the accuracy of the notion that presidents somehow “manage” the economy in a hands‐on manner, many (perhaps most) people perceive this to be the case; presidents, especially in good times, do nothing to dissuade us of this belief. And when the public has confidence in that economic stewardship, they will be more confident in the current and future trajectories of the economy."
"20","Like fiscal policy, monetary policy may also influence economic sentiment. Monetary policy involves decisions by the Federal Reserve that influence the demand for money by raising and lowering short‐term interest rates. While overtly less political than fiscal policy, scholars have argued that the independence of the Federal Reserve is illusory. Fiscal policy affects the amount of money circulating in the economy thereby affecting consumption decisions—and thus confidence—in both direct and indirect ways."
"21","In addition, politicians regularly make and the media regularly report claims about the state of the economy and what politicians are going to do about it. Statements about the economy and the use of slogans (“The War on Poverty”) or catchwords (“Reaganomics”) emanating from the White House have a great potential to shape subjective evaluations, either directly or indirectly through citizen assessments of the president's economic management. If presidents can use the mass media to convince the public that the current economy is strong and that their administration is following economic policy that will ensure a bright future, economic evaluations and expectations should be positive. Even in the face of a poor economy, we argue that politicians, especially candidates for office, have the power to shape economic evaluations by emphasizing the effort that they are (or will) put into making the economy better. Finally, when presidents use the mass media to draw comparisons with past administrations or past economic booms, they may color evaluations of present and past economic conditions in either a positive or negative manner. (We elaborate on the role of the media later.)"
"22","We expect each of these forces may have both short‐term and long‐term effects on consumer confidence. In the short run, for example, changes in the public's perception of the administration's economic competence should lead to short‐lived shifts in consumer confidence. But we also expect these variables to exist in a long‐run equilibrium relationship. High levels of confidence in the president's economic management, in our formulation, are associated with some (unknown) “natural” level of consumer confidence. If there is a sense that the president's economic stewardship is weak, but consumer confidence is strong, then there is disequilibrium, which will be naturally corrected, and consumer sentiment will become more negative."
"23","The common feature of each of these political forces is their ability to affect the way citizens perceive economic reality. Elections, the partisanship of incumbent administrations, war, fiscal and monetary policies, and approval of the government's handling of the economy each can trigger concern or stimulate optimism about the current and future economy in the same manner as economic statistics can. This is neither illogical nor naïve. Citizens hold politicians accountable for economic outcomes. Certainly politicians pursue policies designed to improve economic conditions. They also regularly communicate their views on the economy and its future. Policy efforts and presidential statements about the economy become information that citizens may cull when forming evaluations of the economy. Indeed if citizens act as “bankers” and use “all relevant information” (MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson 1992) when forming evaluations, information from the political arena should shape evaluations of the past, present, and future economy.            "
"24","Importantly, not all aspects of economics and politics are simply known by citizens; they must be communicated to and interpreted for citizens. While individual citizens are aware of their own fortunes and may have some sense of economic conditions more generally, they cannot directly experience all aspects of economic reality. Similarly, citizens cannot be aware of all of the events in Washington that might influence their economic future. Few citizens have the inclination and the ability to digest the vast quantities of information that would allow them to develop evaluations based solely on economic and political conditions. Even when citizens are aware of objective conditions, the meanings and implications are seldom clear. Economic and political reality must be mediated."
"25","The national news media is the quintessential mediator. National newspapers and television news programs regularly capture large audiences; send messages aimed at “average” Americans; and are generally seen as reliable sources of information about the state of the American political economy. The media has the opportunity to influence how Americans feel about the economy. At a minimum, news coverage of politics and economics can influence what Americans think about when they consider the state of the economy (Iyengar and Kinder 1987).            "
"26","Media influence works through two channels. First, media supply citizens with information they would not otherwise have, both economic and political. The media report the conclusions of Federal Reserve Board meetings, closing stock market prices, inflation and unemployment rates, housing starts, mortgage rates and a host of other economic statistics that paint a picture of economic reality for the electorate. Media cover the passage of important legislation and presidential speeches as well. Economic stimulus packages, debates over tax legislation, reform, and deficit spending, all make their way into the news. Second, media interpret (and perhaps obfuscate) this information. The news media often solicit economists' interpretations of and forecasts from these statistics. Political spin by administration officials or political commentators also regularly receives coverage in the news. In this way the media fill an important role; the electorate is informed about economic conditions and political events and is offered both expert and political interpretations of both. The distinction between political and nonpolitical sources in media content is one that we take seriously and elaborate more on below."
"27","What does this theory assume about the sophistication of the electorate? As MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson (1992) note, news coverage of the economy—and we add politics—relies on simple messages about better or worse conditions. We need not assume that we live in a world of “bankers,” to use MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson's phrase. Citizens do not need to follow complex aspects of economics in order to draw conclusions about the state of the current or future economy. Further, while not all citizens read a newspaper or watch the evening news, they could easily pick up information about the economy over the water cooler or the dinner table. Making distinctions between sources of information presented in the media requires more of citizens and they may not be up to the task. But we think it reasonable to assume that citizens are aware of what politicians are saying in a way similar to that manner in which they absorb other economic news. More importantly, though, this is an empirical question we will answer.6"
"28","Our theory of the subjective economy grants that economic reality forms the basis for the subjective economy. This is not controversial. The theory also grants an important role to politics and policy, a more controversial position: We argue that both what politicians do and what they say may affect economic sentiment. Citizens experience only a portion of economic and political “reality” directly, however, so that both information and interpretation must come from the media. As such, the media play an important role, relaying political and economic information to citizens. This information then shapes the subjective economy. At this point, we turn our attention to a modeling strategy for testing our theory of the subjective economy and also to the data we use to test that theory."
"29","Aside from the already documented effects of the objective economy, we have outlined five key components that might shape the subjective economy: electoral cycle, party‐in‐power effects, wars, budgetary policy, confidence in economic management, and media reporting about the economy. In this section we describe the data we will use to assess the effects of each of these components and lay out the specific hypotheses that we will test. All analyses reported in this article involve data aggregated by months from January 1981 through December 2000."
"30"," Election cycle. We measure the period leading up to and immediately following the election cycle with a counter that goes from 1 to 10 in the months leading up to the election and back down to 1 in the months following the election. This variable captures any optimism associated with the upcoming election as well as any honeymoon that might follow it.         "
"31"," War. The only armed conflict involving a substantial deployment of American troops during the period under study was the Gulf War. We create two separate interventions to capture the effect of the Gulf War. The first of these is coded 1 in August of 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The second of these corresponds to the end of the war, coded 1 in March of 1991.         "
"32"," Budget making. The Treasury Department provides monthly records of receipts and outlays (the difference of which is the surplus or deficit). Because the data are highly seasonal, for each particular month we use average of the deficits or surpluses for the previous 12 months, measured in billions of dollars.         "
"33"," Fiscal policy. We include the federal funds rate, the interest rate charged for banks to loan to each other, in our analysis. This rate is sensitive to the purchase (sale) of U.S. Treasury securities in the open market, which increase (decrease) the availability of bank reserves and put downward (upward) pressure on the federal funds rate, and other open market operations. Changes in the federal funds rate affect the decision of banks to invest or loan money and thus affect the amount of money circulating in the economy. Thus we expect that as more money enters the economy, citizens will be more optimistic about the economic future, both in the long and short run.         "
"34"," Party of the president. We code presidential administrations with a dummy variable, with 0 for Republicans and a 1 for Democrats.         "
"35"," Confidence in the president's economic management. Most scholars are familiar with the generic “Do you approve of the way President _____ is handling his job as president?” survey question. This question is at too high a level of abstraction for our purposes, which focus on confidence in economic management. MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson (1992) find, for example, that this time series does not influence sentiment. We agree, and rely instead on similar questions about the president's economic stewardship: “Do you approve or disapprove of the way (Reagan/Bush/Clinton/Bush) is handling the nation's economy?” More than the more generic approval questions, this more domain‐specific question closely approximates our conceptualization of “confidence in the president's economic stewardship.” We combine six survey houses' measures of economic approval using the method first introduced by Stimson (1991). (See the appendix for precise question wordings.)         "
"36"," Figure 3 displays economic approval (along with the general Gallup approval series for purposes of comparison). In the figure, we see that, for the period 1981:1 through 2001:12, approval of the president's handling of the economy has fluctuated substantially, with the low points, predictably, coming at the beginning of Reagan's first term and during the last half of George H.W. Bush's time in office. Confidence in the president's handling of the economy grew steadily during President Clinton's time in office and represents the highest levels of confidence in the president's economic stewardship during the period under consideration.         "
"37","There are obvious similarities, as shown in the figure, between confidence in economic stewardship and overall approval. But that similarity ought not to be overstated. The simple correlation between the two is only 0.56, which—by time‐series standards, and given the similarity in question wordings between the general and domain‐specific items—is striking for its modesty. The figure, too, provides some intuition about how the series are truly different. Notice the period during the last half of 1990 and the first half of 1991—coinciding with the build‐up and then the execution of the Gulf War. Overall approval skyrockets at the same time that approval of economic stewardship continues to erode. A more careful inspection of the figure, though, shows that this disconnection began in 1989, and seemed to coincide with the beginning of the recession. George H.W. Bush's overall approval ratings remained quite solid—and, during the war, quite spectacular—but confidence in his management of the economy eroded steadily. In addition, later in the series, the disjuncture between George W. Bush's overall approval and economic approval ratings, especially after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, reinforces this point: Americans occasionally approve of a president's overall job performance while simultaneously disapproving of his management of the economy."
"38"," Media coverage of the economy. Among the examinations of the role of the media in the American political economy, the literature is divided into studies that use and analyze actual media data, and those that use survey‐based measures of media consumption as a proxy. In the context of consumer sentiment, MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson (1992) rely on measures of the percentage of respondents who report having heard news about the economy (of any type). Haller and Norpoth (1997) use a similar distinction between high media consumers and low media consumers.7 Such proxy measures may not be reliable indicators of the effect of news content, and preclude analysis or characterization of media content in general and message source in particular, as well as how it changes over time.         "
"39","In order to assess the effects of media content and source on consumer sentiment, we need to content analyze actual media data. This is a relatively recent trend in examinations of the American political economy. Analyses of media content in the context of consumer sentiment are limited to the works of Nadeau et al. (1999), who analyze media coverage and consumer confidence as part of their work reanalyzing presidential approval, and Blood and Phillips (1995), who content analyze recession headlines in the New York Times to model a system of equations including presidential approval and consumer sentiment.8"
"40","Like these more recent analyses, our measures of media coverage of the economy will come from stories in section A of the New York Times.9 The media measure is designed to capture what is being said and done with regard to the U.S. economy. Within that framework, we examine two dimensions of coverage. First, we consider message source—whether statements are made by presidents or other political leaders or by nonpolitical actors. This focus is new and reflects our belief that different types of coverage may have different effects, as well as the theoretical importance we place on the role of politics (here expressed in the form of political rhetoric) in shaping economic evaluations. Second, we consider tone. Here we focus on good news and bad news.         "
"41","Distinguishing between media coverage about the economy that reflects political rhetoric and coverage that does not have a political origin is uncomplicated. Given the fact that all of our stories are (by definition) about the economy, we distinguish between paragraphs that contained explicit references to claims made by politicians—defined as presidents; vice presidents; presidential and vice‐presidential nominees (plus Ross Perot); members of the presidential administration such as the Budget Director and Secretaries of Commerce, Labor, Treasury, and Defense; members of Congress—and paragraphs that did not contain such references. Paragraphs of the first variety were defined as those containing political rhetoric about the economy; the remaining paragraphs were, by default, considered to be nonpolitical messages about the economy—presumably containing more objective information about economic performance."
"42","Having separated the media data into messages by political and nonpolitical sources, we examine the tone of the stories by applying an identical content‐analysis dictionary to both sets. This dictionary was constructed to count the number of messages that represented good news about the economy, as well as the number of messages conveying bad news. Good news included stories about lower unemployment; lower inflation; higher growth; higher stock markets; lower budget deficits; and a better economy in general. Bad news, conversely, revolved around higher unemployment and inflation, slower growth, and higher budget deficits; declining stock markets; and a slumping economy generally.10 For each month, we applied these dictionaries and counted the references to good news and bad news overall, as well as the subsets that emanate from political sources, and also those originating from nonpolitical sources. Both series are constructed in a deliberately simple manner, in which we subtract the number of “bad news” references from the number of “good news” references.         "
"43","Because our theoretical expectations about the political and economic forces that drive consumer confidence incorporate both long‐run and short‐run effects, and because the notion of these various series existing in a possible equilibrium relationship seems natural in this situation, we estimate the dynamic relationships using error‐correction models (see Banerjee et al. 1993). When consumer confidence and its causes are in disequilibrium—for example, when consumer confidence is “too high” given the level of confidence in the administration's economic management—the disequilibrium is corrected at a particular rate (that is estimated). The technique allows the analyst to see which forces (if any) are, in fact, in a long‐run equilibrium relationship with consumer confidence, and which (if any) have short‐run effects, in addition to or instead of long‐run effects.11"
"44","We begin in Table 2, which specifies and estimates three separately estimated single‐equation error‐correction models. The first, in the columns labeled “Equation A,” in effect replicates the regression model of Table 1, including only the economic components of consumer confidence. (Notice that long‐run and short‐run effects are entered in separate columns.) Economic conditions primarily exhibit a long‐run influence on consumer confidence—the index of coincident indicators, inflation, and unemployment are all tied to consumer confidence in the long run. Only the coincident indicator index exerts a significant short‐run effect, explaining the short‐run ups and downs in sentiment. Long‐run relationships are reassuring; they confirm accepted wisdom that consumer sentiment will not stray too high or low for any given economic conditions for any length of time. Further, when something shocks the system to disturb the equilibrium, the error‐correction coefficient (represented by lagged levels of consumer confidence) of −0.17 indicates that equilibrium errors are corrected at a rate of 17% per month. The adjusted R2 (.12) and the standard error of the estimate (3.292) give us a sense of the model's fit and serve as a comparison for the remaining models.12"
"45","The results in equation A should be regarded as something of a baseline, for we have theoretical reasons to believe that political forces, too, should drive consumer confidence. In equation B of Table 2, we begin to account for the influence of these factors. Several things are notable in equation B. First, the nature of the long‐run equilibrium driving consumer sentiment is quite different in a model that includes politics and policy. The effect of the objective economy changes with the addition of political variables; the index of coincident economic indicators has a stronger effect on the long‐run behavior of sentiment, but the effect of unemployment becomes nonsignificant. More importantly for our hypotheses, however, it is clear that politics defines the long‐run behavior of consumer sentiment. In particular, confidence in the president's ability to manage the economy is positively related, and the federal funds rate is negatively related to sentiment in the long run. In other words, consumer sentiment cannot remain optimistic in the face of poor economic conditions, low approval ratings, or high federal funds rates. Increasingly positive economic approval ratings, for example, will produce corresponding increases in consumer sentiment, as sentiment adjusts to reequilibrate. The federal deficit just misses significance (p = .11).13"
"46","In addition to redefining the equilibrium, the rate of error correction nearly doubles in this equation; accounting for politics increases the rate at which consumer sentiment changes in response to disequilibrium. Adjustments in sentiment are still, however, slow. Shocks to the economy—like the Enron scandal—may temporarily depress consumer sentiment, creating disequilibrium with economic conditions, economic approval, and the federal funds rate. But consumer sentiment will adjust, moving back toward equilibrium (growing) at a rate of about one‐third per month, virtually disappearing after about four months (all else held constant)."
"47","As we expect, politics also exhibits a short‐run effect on consumer sentiment. Economic approval and the Gulf War affect the short‐run behavior of consumer sentiment. The magnitude of the effects of economic approval is much higher in the short term; for every five percentage point gain in economic approval ratings, for example, consumer sentiment goes up an average of one point. This, too, is sensible; if sentiment is grounded in economic conditions, the bulk of the effect of politics is sensibly short‐run. Neither the election‐cycle variable (p = .18) nor the events series has an effect on sentiment.14 The party variable suggests that the Democrats (Clinton), on average, experienced lower levels of consumer sentiment over this period than the Republican presidents, after controlling for the variables in the model. Similar to Norpoth's findings regarding the effect of the Gulf War, we find its effect to be quite dramatic; sentiment dropped with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and rebounded substantially (albeit temporarily) at the end of the first Gulf War.         "
"48","How people view the president's ability to manage the economy, as well as fiscal policy, has a long‐run effect on consumer sentiment. We do not, however, find a direct effect for media coverage of the economy in Equation B, which makes no allowance for source distinctions in the news or in Equation C, which controls for message source.15 Provocatively, the sign on the coefficient for leader statements is negative, but the large standard error prohibits drawing any conclusions from the estimate. In virtually all other respects, the estimates in equation C are the same as in Equation B. The fit of Equations B and C is substantially improved over equation A; adding politics nearly triples the R2 and improves the standard error of the estimate as well. Economic conditions may be the foundation for economic sentiment, but politics explains a great deal of the variation in consumer sentiment.         "
"49","We know little about economic approval. While queried in surveys for some time, we can find no analyses of the time series itself. Yet, as we have just shown, how people view the president's ability to manage the economy has important implications for consumer sentiment. It is important to ask what drives economic approval ratings. We turn to this task next."
"50","Once again we use the error‐correction modeling framework. The argument is identical to that used above: in the long run, how people view the president's ability to manage the economy should be tied to the state of the economy and, we argue, to news coverage of the economy. In addition to these long‐run effects, the size and direction of current changes in these same variables is likely to drive changes in economic approval ratings. We also allow for different equilibrium approval ratings for each administration and for dramatic politics events to exert short‐run effects on economic approval. These results are presented in Table 3. Once again we estimate two equations. The first (Equation A) makes no source distinction in media coverage, the second (Equation B) separately models the effects of what politicians are saying and what other actors are saying about the economy.         "
"51","Our focus here is first on the effects of the economy. Note that many of the same factors that influence consumer sentiment directly also influence economic approval ratings. The coincident indicator index, along with the unemployment rate, exhibits a long run relationship with economic approval. This is natural and reassuring. Interestingly, the Gulf War exhibited a positive effect on economic approval ratings. The rally events are not significant in the approval models, and there appears to be no honeymoon in economic approval ratings.16"
"52","Unlike in the equations for consumer sentiment, news coverage of the economy significantly affects economic approval. In the long run, favorable changes in the net amount of positive news coverage lead to stronger economic approval ratings. Short‐term changes exhibit an additional effect on economic approval as well. If we further refine the measure of news coverage and examine the separate effects of statements by political actors and nonpolitical actors (Equation B), we learn something very important. In the long run, the balance of media coverage coming from nonpolitical sources drives public evaluations of the president's ability to manage the economy. In the short run these messages have an additional effect, making media an important but also nuanced predictor of economic approval. In contrast, media coverage of political sources has no long‐run effect.17 What politicians are doing and saying, as reported in the news, produces short‐run changes in economic approval, but does not affect long‐run levels of economic approval. In other words, politicians cannot successfully affect their long run economic approval ratings by talking up the economy more than is warranted by economic conditions. This is reassuring.         "
"53","The effects of economic news are richer than prior research suggests. In particular, previous analyses have ignored the role of message source. We find that citizens do distinguish economic information presented in the news based on source and that they discount news from political sources in the long run, tying sentiment instead to messages from nonpolitical sources in both the long and short run. This finding lends further support to MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson's “banker” caricature of citizens. Our findings are additionally more nuanced than published research. Media effects are filtered through assessments of the president's economic management, rather than directly affecting sentiment, as MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson (1992) and Blood and Phillips (1995) found. Specifying a more complete model of consumer confidence, a model that highlights the role of confidence in the president's economic management, removes the apparent direct effect found in previous work.18"
"54","We have long known that economic conditions influence consumer sentiment and that economic conditions and economic sentiment influence political behavior. But the effect of politics on consumer sentiment in this important set of relationships has been downplayed and only partially explored. Like Norpoth and others, we argue that the conduct of politics—both as it pertains to economic and noneconomic concerns—plays an additional and independent role in determining how consumers feel about the future of the economy. More specifically, our findings show that Norpoth is right, but that in omitting the effects of routine politics on sentiment his story is incomplete. Wars and elections are not the only aspects of politics that move consumer sentiment. Policy, economic management, and economic news systematically affect public perceptions of the economy in both the long and short run."
"55","The story is quite compelling. Controlling for economic conditions, news coverage of the economy affects how citizens view the president's ability to manage the economy, which in turn has both a long‐run and short‐run effect on consumer sentiment. Importantly and reassuringly, the source of information matters. Presidents and others who speak for them can only affect economic approval in the short run. Presidents who have presided over an economy that is weak cannot use the power of the press to maintain high approval ratings over the long haul; presidents cannot use rhetoric to consistently dupe the public."
"56","Similarly, after controlling for economic conditions, politics plays an important role in driving consumer sentiment. Economic approval and the federal funds rate are tied in the long run to consumer sentiment and exert an additional temporary effect as well. The Gulf War exerted a large short‐term effect. Politics explains a great deal of the variation in consumer sentiment. We stress here that politics is not net of economics; indeed much of what we refer to as politics is heavily laden with economics. Thus while MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson are not wrong in emphasizing the role of economic conditions in driving sentiment, nevertheless their assertion that politics matters “hardly if at all” (1996) is overstated. Importantly this has implications for how we should interpret the effects of consumer sentiment on presidential approval, election outcomes, and ultimately economic outcomes."
"57","For the past decade, political scientists have spent ever‐increasing amounts of intellectual capital documenting the effects of consumer confidence on politics. And those linkages, we think, are real. Unsurprisingly, economics affects politics. That said, one of our goals is to come full circle and emphasize that the causal arrow often runs the other way as well. Our results show that consumer confidence should not solely be used as a right‐hand‐side variable in analyses of the political economy. Politics, in a variety of forms, affects economics. Put somewhat differently, the story we tell is economic, but much of it is also political. By showing the several ways in which the political world shapes the psychological economy, we hope to gain a better understanding of the intersection between politics and economics."
