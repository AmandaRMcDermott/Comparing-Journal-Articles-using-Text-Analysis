"1","The political economy literature of developed nations consistently finds a predictable relationship between government ideology and policy outcomes. Voters choose candidates representing competing ideologies, who pursue their ideological predispositions once in office. For example, governments of the left generally prefer policies that decrease unemployment at the expense of increasing inflation, while those on the right choose policies that increase unemployment but decrease inflation (Alesina and Rosenthal 1995; Alesina and Roubini 1997; Hibbs 1977, 1987). In the United States, Democrats establish taxes and spending at higher levels of personal income than do Republicans (Alt and Lowry 1994). Even when policy choices are severely constrained by economic conditions, ideology impacts how governments pursue economic growth. Left‐leaning governments invest in human capital to raise productivity, offsetting inflationary pressures, while right‐leaning governments lower taxes to spur private savings and investment to fuel growth (Boix 1998). Thus, voters in advanced industrial democracies can go to the polls confident that they are able to choose wisely among parties offering distinct policy options, and the partisan composition of the government will have a predictable impact on the policies pursued.         "
"2","Political parties in Latin America cover the ideological spectrum (Coppedge 1998), but the connection between ideological reputation and behavior in office, so prevalent in developed countries, has been called into question in Latin America. More specifically, scholars have concluded that politicians have defrauded voters in the region, as governments controlled by parties known for their interventionist, social‐welfare ideologies implement orthodox, market‐oriented policy programs. Voters want governments to protect them from the orthodoxy of the Washington Consensus only to find that their chosen representatives reverse field and implement market‐oriented policies. Labels for this phenomenon abound, but none of them are positive.4 O'Donnell referred to several Latin American regimes as “delegative democracies” where “[t]he president is taken to be the embodiment of the nation and the main custodian and definer of its interests. The policies of his government need bear no resemblance to the promises of his campaign—has not the president been authorized to govern as he (or she) thinks best?” (1994, 59–60). Regarding neoliberal reform, this means that presidents have gained election “by promising expansionist economic policies and many other good things to come with them, only to enact severe stabilization packages” (1994, 65–6). Likewise, Conaghan cites a “deficit of democratic authenticity.” When analyzing economic policy teams, she notes that “[t]he modus operandi employed by these presidents involved the unilateral imposition of a comprehensive set of neoliberal economic reforms, implemented via an executive paquetazo … The hallmark of this decision‐making was its conscious organization as a nonconsultative process, neither parties, groups in civil society, nor the electorate were consulted in advance of the decision to go forth with the reforms” (1996, 43).         "
"3","Stokes also admits that some Latin American administrations have carried out “reform by surprise,” but she is much less critical of the practice. First, she concludes that mandate switching is “atypical” (2001, 12) or an “anomaly” (2001, 185). While politicians occasionally switched policies shortly after elections, Stokes finds this in only 12 of 42 recent Latin American elections—or less than 29 percent of the time (12). Second, Stokes points out that democratically elected presidents may betray their campaign promises for reasons other than serious shortcomings in democratic procedures. They may do so because once in office presidents become privy to information they did not previously have that convinces them that structural adjustment is in the public interest. True leadership requires executives to adopt a Burkean posture, ignoring public opinion and adopting painful economic reforms for the good of the nation (Canes‐Wrone, Herron, and Shotts 2001). Or, they may genuinely believe that market‐oriented policies are best and that voters will agree with them once the policies are in place—even if they must dissimulate during the campaign in order to get the opportunity to test their beliefs.         "
"4","There is, thus, a controversy regarding how well the historic ideological positions of parties will predict their behaviors once in office (and whether mandate switching is detrimental to democracy at all). O'Donnell (1994) and Conaghan (1996) indicate that party ideology is not a good predictor of what politicians will do once in office while Stokes (2001) concludes that pre‐electoral indications of one's intentions probably are no worse an indicator in Latin America over the last two decades than in other times and places. Using Stokes's relatively optimistic assessment of Latin American democracy and the extant literature on developed nations as the baseline, we hypothesize:         "
"5","                        "
"6"," H1: The ideological reputation of the president's party will be a good predictor of his or her economic program once in office.               "
"7","If we do find support for this hypothesis and ideology is a good predictor of policy, it will lend credence to the conclusion that Latin American voters, like voters in the developed world, can effectively send electoral mandates."
"8","What happens when a right‐of‐center president faces a legislature dominated by three left‐of‐center parties? Can congress impede the president's efforts? Conversely, when a right‐of‐center president's party is a disciplined legislative majority, does the country move further toward markets than when the president confronts an opposition or fragmented congress? There is no controversy in the extant literature on Latin America regarding the importance of legislators’ ideological mandates. O'Donnell, Conaghan, and Stokes all concur that legislatures are virtually irrelevant. Conaghan and O'Donnell are explicit about the excessive centralization of power in the executive branch and the subjugation of congress. Conaghan refers to “imperial executives” and “foundering legislatures” (1996, 34), and O'Donnell claims that for executives “other institutions—courts and legislatures—are nuisances that come attached to the domestic and international advantages of being a democratically elected president” (1994, 60). In all presidential systems, voters are likely to hold the executive relatively more accountable for the national economic program (Geddes 1994), but in the developed world, scholars have identified an independent effect for the legislative branch given the need for executives to seek approval for their programs (Binder 1999; Coleman 1999; Lohmann and O'Halloran 1994; McCubbins 1991). For example, in the United States state budget deficits are not simply a function of gubernatorial preferences, but rather of executive‐legislative negotiations (Alt and Lowry 1994). In European parliamentary democracies an increase in the number of parties in the governing coalition decreases the number of significant laws adopted (Tsebelis 1999). However, according to the extant literature on Latin America, we should expect no such effect. Legislators are unwilling or unable to check executive authority and their ideological predispositions will have no systematic impact on policy outcomes. Again, following the systematic, extant literature on the United States and Western Europe, we state our hypothesis positively:         "
"9","                        "
"10"," H2: The ideological reputation of legislators’ parties will be a good predictor of economic policy once they are in office.               "
"11","Presidents and legislatures vary in the tools at their disposal for pursuing their preferred policies. An important tool for presidents is constitutionally allocated decree authority4—the ability to issue decrees with the force of law without congressional consent (Carey and Shugart 1998; Shugart and Carey 1992; Mainwaring and Shugart 1997). Both O'Donnell (1994) and Conaghan (1996) stress executives’ tendency to act unilaterally and implement policy without debate. In contrast, Stokes (2001) argues that executives usually pursue their electoral mandates, but she fails to account for executives’ powers. We test for an interaction between ideology and the ability of the president to issue executive decrees, testing whether ideology determines one's preferences while decree authority explains one's ability to implement those preferences. If we find that both ideology and its interaction with constitutionally allocated decree power are significant determinants of economic policy, we will have extended the Stokes (2001) argument regarding the frequently faithful carrying out of electoral mandates to account for the tools which make keeping one's promises easier:         "
"12","                        "
"13"," H3: Presidential decree authority will allow presidents to better pursue economic policies reflecting their ideological preferences.               "
"14","While she concludes that mandates are most commonly pursued as promised, she does not systematically consider the tools executives have at their disposal. The failure to implement the policies expected based on one's ideological background may be an indication of mandate switching, but it might also be a function of one's institutional weakness. Interacting presidential ideology and decree authority allows us to test whether the ability to implement policy without congressional action increases a president's ability to deliver on his promises."
"15","While executive decree authority is one tool presidents may use to pursue policy preferences, it is not their only tool. Following the rationale of Stokes (2001, 90–2, 101), when the same party controls the executive and a majority of the seats in congress, we should expect increased ability to pursue that party's ideological preferences. For example, it has been found that majoritarian systems experience greater economic fluctuations as governments of the right and left alternate in power. Coalition governments engender compromise, dampening policy shifts between those stressing high inflation and low unemployment and those focused on low inflation and high unemployment (Alesina and Rosenthal 1995; Alesina and Roubini 1997). The president's partisans are closest to him ideologically, and their reelection chances depend at least partially on what the president does to the reputation of their party. During periods of divided government, the competing ideological mandates of the executive and of the congress will check and balance one another.         "
"16","                        "
"17"," H4: During periods of unified government, shared ideological preferences of the executive and legislature are more likely to be realized.               "
"18","While most research concerning structural adjustment largely overlooks the role of congress, theory and evidence from advanced, industrial democracies suggests that institutional features affecting the ease of engaging in collective action influence the ability of legislators to implement their preferences. As the number of politically relevant actors increases, the prospects for overcoming barriers to collective action decreases (Mainwaring and Shugart 1997; Tsebelis 2000). Legislatures with relatively few parties may be able to overcome collective action difficulties and have the coordination capacity to carry out programmatic policies in one direction or the other. Likewise, if legislators have incentives to behave as entrepreneurs (seeking votes based on their personal reputation, not the party's reputation) rather than as disciplined members of a party delegation, they are unlikely to be able to join together in support of programmatic changes that would take the country's economic policy to either the right or the left (Carey and Shugart 1995). Disciplined parties of the left should be able to mute the adoption of market‐oriented reforms, while disciplined parties of the right should be able to promote it.         "
"19","                        "
"20"," H5: As the effective number of parties in congress increases, the mean ideological preference of the legislature is less likely to be realized.               "
"21"," H6: As the discipline of party delegations declines, the mean ideological preference of the legislature is less likely to be realized.               "
"22","Our hypotheses, thus, range from a simple consideration of politicians’ preferences to the combination of an executive's preferences and his constitutional and partisan powers, to a consideration of what both presidents and legislators prefer and the functioning of checks and balances. The extant literature on the relationship between elections and policy outcomes in Latin America has stopped short at this middle category, and even so there is disagreement regarding the effective functioning of democratic institutions. In an effort to sort out some of these contradictions, we discern whether executive's behave as their partisan heritage would lead voters to expect and whether they implement their programs because they have congressional support or because they have centralized, proactive powers. Our final two hypotheses test the importance of congressional preferences and powers, while continuing to include indicators of presidential mandates. They most closely approximate the models that capture policy making in the developed world. If we find evidence supporting the importance of congress in adopting more‐or‐less market‐oriented policies, it will be an indication that checks and balances do function in developing nations and that voters in presidential systems can send mandates with both their presidential and legislative votes."
"23","To test the theories presented in the previous section, we utilize a sample that includes all Latin American presidential democracies for which complete and comparable data are available for the period 1985 to 1995. The countries included in our analysis are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. This includes 46 congressional terms and 35 presidential administrations, offering substantial variation on the political and economic variables of interest (see the appendix: Data and Coding). As of 1995, these countries included 86 percent of the region's population and accounted for 94 percent of the region's GDP. One country, Chile, was not a democracy until 1990, while Alberto Fujimori of Peru closed congress in the middle of the period under observation. In order to account for these nondemocratic episodes we utilize an unbalanced, pooled‐time series design, excluding authoritarian years from the analysis.4"
"24","Our dependent variable is the Structural Policy Index (SPI) developed by the Chief Economist's Office of the Inter‐American Development Bank (Lora 1997a, 1997b). The index scores policies in five areas: trade, tax collection, financial markets, privatization, and labor markets based on the degree to which economic actors react to market incentives rather than state intervention in the economy. Trade policy is a composite of a country's average tariff and the tariff spread. Tax reform measures the maximum marginal income tax on corporations and individuals, as well as the basic value‐added tax and its productivity. Financial policy reflects the freedom of interest rates on loans and deposits, the real level of reserves of bank deposits, and the quality of banking and financial oversight. Privatization sums revenue accumulated from sales and property transfers, while labor policy considers legislation covering hiring, firing after one and after ten years of work, overtime pay, and social security contributions. Each country received an annual score of 0 to 100 on each of these indicators.4 Their averages provide scores for each of the five areas of reform, which are in turn averaged to yield the overall policy index. The most state‐centric policies were scored a 0 while the most market‐oriented received a 100. Observed values on the Structural Policy Index (SPI) range from 23.2 for Peru in 1985 to 72.1 for Bolivia in 1995. Because of external pressure from the International Monetary Fund and U.S. government, there is a region‐wide trend toward increased market‐orientation. However, there were significant cross‐national variations in the extent to which governments pursued orthodox, neoliberal economic policies, and ten of the eleven nations experienced at least one year of policy retrenchment. We seek to explain these cross‐national and time‐serial variations in the extent of adjustment.         "
"25","In order to test the hypotheses regarding voters’ perceptions of a politician's partisan ideology, we draw upon Coppedge's (1997, 1998) survey of 53 country specialists. These experts classified approximately 800 Latin American political parties, accounting for 97 percent of the vote won in lower chamber legislative elections in the twentieth century. Parties of the left received a score of –100, center‐left –50, center 0, center‐right 50, and right 100. We calculated the mean ideological position of the legislature by weighting each party's ideology score by the number of seats it held in the lower chamber.4 To avoid the endogeneity issue of country experts reacting to a party's behavior once in office, we used a party's ideology score from the previous term. Thus the experts would be evaluating the party's long‐term, historical reputation and its policy preferences prior to the period we are attempting to explain. It is precisely this prior label that voters use to send their mandate (see Key 1962), and it avoids the possibility that ideology scores are a function of policy rather than vice versa. Voters’ perception of the president's ideology is simply the classification received by his party. These scores were then converted into dummy variables for legislatures and presidents (0 for leftists, 1 for non‐leftists).4"
"26","In order to test whether institutional capabilities influence politicians’ ability to implement their ideological preferences, we collected decree authority data from Carey, Amorim Neto, and Shugart (1997) and Carey and Shugart (1998). We include a binary variable for whether presidents have the ability to issue substantive decrees with the force of law without prior congressional consent (1 if they have decree authority, 0 otherwise). Electoral statistics and dates were compiled in order to calculate the effective number of parties, the size of the president's party, and the likelihood of party discipline (Nohlen 1993; South America 1995; Mainwaring and Shugart 1997; Derksen 1999). The effective number of parties, N, weights the number of parties represented in the legislature by their size. The formula is N = (pi2)−1, where pi is the share of seats of the i th party (Laakso and Taagepera 1979). We convert the size of the president's party into a dummy for whether or not the president's copartisans control a majority of the seats in the legislature.4 The final institutional variable we model is party discipline. Comparative data on the degree of party discipline maintained by legislative delegations in Latin America is simply not available for the countries and years covered in this study. However, the incentive for legislators to behave in a disciplined fashion is a function of whether or not they face intraparty competition (Carey and Shugart 1995). If legislators face intraparty competition during the nomination or general election stages of seeking office, they must attempt to distinguish themselves from one another. One way legislators can distinguish themselves is through their voting records, so maintaining party unity is difficult where incentives to cultivate a personal vote are high. Thus, we use the lack of intraparty competition as an indicator of party discipline. Where intraparty competition is the norm, we score legislators as likely to be undisciplined. Where only interparty competition is the norm, we score legislators as more likely to be disciplined (0 for undisciplined, 1 for disciplined).         "
"27","The literature detailing the suspected economic determinants of structural adjustment focuses on the basic premise that economic crisis promotes policy change.4 The rationale is that only during periods of poor economic performance do the expected medium to long‐term benefits of reforms outweigh the expected short‐term costs. Ending the crisis overrides concerns about who bears the brunt of the costs, consequently, politicians and citizens alike are more willing to accept the risks associated with structural adjustment (in particular see Gonzales de Olarte 1993; Weyland 1996, 1997, 1999). To control for previous performance we include four variables: debt, growth, inflation, and terms of trade. All economic variables were lagged one year. Debt is a ratio of debt to exports, growth is the percent increase in GDP, inflation is logged to compensate for several extreme instances found in the dataset, while terms of trade measures the value of exports compared with imports on the international market.4"
"28","The pooled, time‐serial nature of the data presents the usual concerns regarding autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity. In order to correct for these violations we follow the logic of Beck and Katz (1995, 1996), using OLS with panel‐corrected standard errors.4 We include a lagged dependent variable (not reported) to correct for autocorrelation, modeling serial correlation as a first‐order process with a common rho across panels. As noted previously, because authoritarian regimes governed some countries during some years in our sample, we utilize an unbalanced design (meaning nondemocratic years are excluded from our estimations).         "
"29","In an era of generalized international pressure to adopt market‐oriented policies, what explains cross‐national variation in the rate at which reform occurs? In Table 1 we present several models to test the hypotheses outlined above. Models 1 and 2 test the importance of ideology without controlling for the powers constitutionally allocated to presidents or the institutional incentives for legislators to engage in collective action. Without distinguishing between presidents who can issue decrees with the force of law and those who cannot, our findings support the claim that voters could not select a presidential candidate based on the ideological reputation of his party and have any confidence that their vote would constitute a predictable mandate (the coefficient for president's ideology is not statistically significant in either model). Stokes (2001) claims that mandate switching is generally atypical in democratic regimes and that it often occurs for good reasons. Those good reasons may have been more evident in Latin America in the last two decades of the twentieth century, but there is nothing inherently unique about the presidential democracies in the region. For example, once in office, presidents may learn details about the dire nature of their country's economic situation that they did not know as candidates. Confronted with such realities, one could argue they are exercising “true leadership” by implementing neoliberal policies they had not advocated previously (Canes‐Wrone, Herron, and Shotts 2001). Presidents may feel relatively free to do so because as lame ducks, relative to legislators they are not as concerned with the party's future reputation. While reelection clauses were inserted in some Latin American constitutions, none of the presidents under study here were originally elected under the impression that they would be allowed to run for immediate reelection. What is more, presidents are relatively more free than legislators to run candidate‐centered (rather than party‐centered) campaigns. Thus, presidential candidates may be held accountable for their individual campaign promises, not the historical legacies of their parties (Stokes 2001).         "
"30","Stokes may observe less mandate switching because she uses presidential candidates’ campaign pronouncements as a measure of mandates while we use the reputation of their party at the time of their campaign. Stokes’ method has the benefit of observing directly the future executive. The advantage of using party reputation is that it is a readily available piece of information that is likely to be used by even the least sophisticated of voters. In addition, by using a measure developed by other scholars, we avoid any danger of having our coding of presidential ideology tainted by our knowledge of what candidates did once in office. What is more, we do not have to be concerned with whether our sample of pronouncements is representative, what to do with contradictory statements, and the extent to which these pronouncements are actually used by voters."
"31","On the other hand, even without controlling for the prospects of legislative collective action, the legislature's mean ideology is a reliable predictor of economic policy. Controlling for the president's ideology, where the mean ideology of congress was right‐of‐center we find more market‐oriented policies. The likely composition of the legislature is less identifiable prior to the election than is the executive branch, but voters can send a predictable signal about preferred policies with their legislative vote. This runs counter to the extant literature's dismissal of legislatures as merely subject to presidential whims."
"32","In models 3 and 4 we find further support for the conclusion that presidents from left‐of‐center parties were indistinguishable from centrist or rightist presidents. Even after we control for their constitutionally allocated, legislative powers (model 3) and then both their constitutional and partisan powers (model 4), presidents from the left are not statistically discernible from those nominated by centrist and rightist parties. However, our findings do not support the claim that Latin American constitutions excessively concentrate power in the executive. Many of the reforms entailed in structural adjustment require statutory legislation or constitutional modification. Our models indicate that executive decrees are simply insufficient to impact neoliberal reform. Neither decree authority nor having a seemingly docile congress (one where the president's party is a disciplined majority) are associated with more market‐oriented policies."
"33","Given the finding that congressional ideology is a significant predictor of policy (model 2) and that power is not concentrated in the executive branch (model 4), we present model 5 with the legislature's ideology and its prospects for engaging in collective action—as well as the president's ideology and powers.4 By interacting the ideology of the president with the ability to issue decrees, we can determine whether decree authority is being used to bypass congress and, if so, by presidents from which ideological background. However, both the interaction term and president's ideology are statistically insignificant. Thus, accounting for constitutionally allocated powers does not help us discern between presidents from parties with a leftist heritage and others.4"
"34","In distinct contrast with the extant literature, we find the most powerful predictors of market‐oriented policies are congressional ideology, the legislature's propensity for collective action, and the interaction of the legislature's ideological mandate with the powers to pursue them. For example, right‐of‐center legislatures are associated with nearly 6 points greater market‐orientation, but as the effective number of parties increases rightist legislatures find it more difficult to engage in collective pursuit of their ideological mandates. The statistically significant interaction term for effective number of parties and congressional ideology tells us that every increase of one in the effective number of parties in a congress with a mean ideology right‐of‐center is associated with nearly two points less market‐orientation. Likewise, a lack of party discipline also deters legislators’ ability to pursue their mandate. Disciplined, right‐of‐center legislatures are associated with the highest level of market‐orientation and disciplined, leftist legislatures with the highest level of state‐orientation. Without disciplined parties, legislatures become much less predictable."
"35","Using model 5, we generate predicted values to clarify our findings. In Figure 1, we plot predicted values for the differences between a legislature where parties are disciplined and the mean ideology is right‐of‐center and where parties are disciplined and the mean ideology is left‐of‐center (while setting all other nominal variables at their modal value and interval level variables at their mean value). Voters where copartisans do not compete against one another in general elections can cast a vote based on party identification and know that should legislators from the same side of the ideological spectrum as their preferred candidate hold a majority, the impact on policy will be notable. The region‐wide trend is toward increased market‐orientation—undoubtedly due to international pressure based on the Washington Consensus—but where legislative factions are disciplined, the extent of change is dramatically different. For example, the highly disciplined, center‐left Acción Democrática (AD) dominated the Venezuelan legislature, and Venezuela largely resisted the region‐wide trend toward markets. President Carlos Andrés Pérez attempted to implement a shock package of orthodox reforms in 1989 and 1990. His administration is widely cited as a case of mandate switching. In a recounting of the administration's frustrations, Minister of Development, Moises Naim, cites the congress where Pérez's own AD controlled 48 percent of the seats as a major roadblock to market‐oriented policies (Naim 1993). This same congress would later impeach Pérez and remove him from office. In sharp contrast, disciplined right‐of‐center legislators dominated the Bolivian legislature throughout the period under study, leading Bolivia to the most market‐oriented economy found in our sample by 1995.         "
"36"," Disciplined Legislatures and Market‐Oriented Policies                      "
"37","Legislatures where partisan factions are undisciplined, on the other hand, are much less predictable (see Figure 2). On the whole, right‐of‐center legislatures are still more inclined to adopt market‐oriented policies. However, voters cannot be as sure that the mandate they send will be reflected in policy because there are rare occasions when our model predicts that undisciplined, leftist legislatures are associated with more market‐oriented policies than rightist legislatures. When legislators do not support the party label in a disciplined fashion, collective action on their part becomes much more complex. Legislators willing to defect from the party line are likely allies of an executive pursuing policies that the legislator's party might not typically support.         "
"38"," Undisciplined Legislative Factions and Erratic Policy                      "
"39","Coordinating collective action in the legislature is a function of the number of actors, and when the number of parties is high, the ideological preferences of the majority are more difficult to achieve. In Figure 3, we illustrate the impact of an increasing effective number of parties. For example, in the latter half of the decade under study as the number of parties in the legislature increased, we would predict that right‐of‐center congresses would be less effective at pursuing market‐oriented policies. In Brazil, where the effective number of parties is the highest in the region, highly divided and undisciplined congresses passed not entirely orthodox tax reforms only after they had extracted significant patronage resources from presidents Collor, Franco, and Cardoso (Mainwaring 1997, 98–103). Executives repeatedly found that assembling a coalition was costly—not only in terms of government spending but in terms of diluting the nature of their economic packages.         "
"40"," Legislative Collective Action, Ideology, and Market‐Oriented Policies                      "
"41","In all our models, we controlled for previous economic performance. It has been argued that where performance is at its worst, governments will be most willing to make dramatic changes in policy.4 We found no systematic evidence that performance, measured in a variety of ways, was related to degree of market orientation. There is clearly a region‐wide trend toward less state intervention into the economy, and once we control for political factors that help explain how countries react to that pressure, previous economic performance does not yield additional explanatory power.         "
"42","Our findings lend support to claims that the ideology of the president's party is not a good predictor of economic policy priorities (O'Donnell 1996; Conaghan 1998). Voters cannot use party identification to send an electoral mandate when choosing an executive. In all of our models, it was impossible to distinguish presidents from left‐of‐center parties from their centrist and rightist counterparts. However, we found no support for the notion that presidents are achieving their goals as the result of decrees that bypass legislative checks and balances. If anything, decree authority is associated with state intervention into the economy (model 5). While there is some debate in the literature on Latin America about whether executives are mandate switching, there is little debate about the secondary role of legislatures. However, our results indicate that claims regarding the subsidiary role of legislatures are largely unfounded. Instead, the ideological preferences of legislators and their institutional prospects for engaging in collective action are the most powerful determinants of economic policy. Where legislators of the same ideological background are most likely to band together, the impact on economic policy is dramatic. Legislatures where the mean ideology is left‐of‐center and the effective number of parties is low or partisan delegations are disciplined are capable of significantly resisting international pressure for a removal of the state from the economy. Conversely, legislatures where the mean ideology is right‐of‐center and the effective number of parties is low or partisan delegations are disciplined are capable of pushing through policies that more closely approximate the ideal‐typical Washington Consensus."
"43","The extant literature on the developed world uniformly finds that the electorate uses partisan cues to cast votes and that the broad, ideological mandates they send are acted upon by rational politicians. Voters that send a clear mandate by electing unified governments promote more radical policy departures, while voters that divide government between various parties curtail rapid policy shifts (Binder 1999; Coleman 1999; Edwards, Barett, and Peake 1997; Tsebelis 1999). In the developing world, including Latin America, it has been questioned whether the connection is as clear given that the quality of democratic accountability is suspect and economic policy is heavily influenced, if not dictated, by international forces. Our research indicates that voters in Latin America have a hard time predicting how presidential candidates will behave once in office. The autonomy of presidents gives some scholars pause about the efficacy of democratic elections. However, that voters can choose legislators with confidence is reassuring for two reasons. First, it indicates that voters can choose wisely with only the use of widely available information—the reputation of a legislator's party. Second, that the nature of the legislature is directly reflected in major economic policies is an indication that the separation of powers and independent origins of branches central to presidential regimes function as constitution writers intended. Institutional design plays an important role in expanding or limiting the effectiveness of politicians. Both disciplined legislative delegations and legislatures with a manageable effective number of parties are important for implementing the majority's ideological preferences. Electoral rules can be written to enhance the prospects that legislators will be disciplined followers of their party leaders and to limit the fragmentation of representation.         "
"44","As Stokes (2001) points out, having executives who are free to change their minds in the face of new information or new conditions could be beneficial. Being vague and overly optimistic in one's campaign promises is hardly unique to Latin America. In two of the more widely cited cases of mandate switching, Menem in Argentina and Fujimori in Peru, the supposedly defrauded voters reelected a president after he exposed his market‐oriented intentions. This apparent autonomy is even less troubling for the quality of democracy given that the empirical evidence indicates a determined congress can predictably check an executive's prerogatives. Seat allocation formulas, electoral cycles, and provisions for intraparty competition can be designed to encourage disciplined congressional majorities. Inherent to the nature of presidentialism, voters elect two agents—an executive and a legislature. The analysis presented here indicates that the separation of powers can work effectively in Latin American democracies despite international economic constraints and recently inaugurated regimes.         "
"45"," SPI: Lora's (1997a) Structural Policy Index. The five component parts of the measure are simple averages of various indicators of neoliberal policies. Trade reform entails policies that lower barriers to the importation of foreign goods. In Lora's measure this includes the average tariff rate and the spread between the highest and lowest tariff rates. Tax reform's goal is to reduce distortionary taxes and to improve government tax collection. This measure includes the maximum marginal tax rates for individuals and corporations, as well as the productivity of the government's value‐added tax. Financial market reform is comprised of freeing currency markets, letting markets set interest rates, and improving the quality of banking and financial oversight. Government divestment from business and industry through the sale of state‐owned enterprises is used to measure the degree to which governments privatize. Last, labor market reform is the cost of hiring and firing workers, as well as the cost of social security payments to business. SPI scores range from a low of 23.2 in 1985 Peru, to a high of 72.1 in 1995 Bolivia, with a mean of 46.7.         "
"46"," President Not Left‐of‐Center: This measure is based upon Coppedge's (1998) expert surveys of party ideology in Latin America lagged one electoral cycle. We have converted Coppedge's measure into a simple dichotomous measure, where presidents on the left are scored zero, while centrist and rightist presidents are scored 1. Countries with centrist or rightist presidents include: Argentina 1985–1989, 1995; Bolivia 1986–1989, 1994–1995; Brazil 1985–1992; Chile 1990–1995; Colombia 1985–1995; Costa Rica 1990–1993; Ecuador 1985–1988, 1993–1995; Mexico 1985–1995; Peru 1990–1991, 1995; Uruguay 1985–1995; and Venezuela 1994–1995.         "
"47"," Congress Not Left‐of‐Center: Again we draw upon Coppedge for this data. We calculated the mean for each legislature by using each of the party's ideology scores and weighting them by the number of seats each party held in the legislature. If the mean score for the legislature was zero or above it was considered centrist or rightist. Countries with centrist or rightists legislatures include: Argentina 1988–1989, 1992–1995; Bolivia 1985–1995; Brazil 1985–1995; Chile 1990–1995; Colombia 1985–1995; Costa Rica 1990–1993; Ecuador 1990–1995; Mexico 1985–1995; and Peru 1995.         "
"48"," Decree Authority: Presidents were considered to have decree authority if they can establish law without the assembly first taking action (Carey and Shugart 1998). This does not include cases where the legislature delegates decree power to the executive, as the executive would simply be the agent of the legislature. Decree authority data comes from the data appendix in Carey, Amorim Neto, and Shugart (1997) and Carey and Shugart (1998). Presidents with decree authority include: Argentina 1985–1995; Brazil 1988–1995; Chile 1990–1995; Colombia 1985–1990; Ecuador 1985–1995; and Peru 1985–1991, 1995.         "
"49"," Effective Number of Parties: This measure is taken from Laakso and Taagepera (1979) and measures the number of parties in the legislature weighted by their size. The formula is N =Σ(pi2)−1, where pi is the share of the seats of the ith party. Electoral data is taken from Derksen (1999), Nohlen (1993), and South America (1995). This ranges from a low of 1.5 in Mexico (1985), to a high of 8.7 in Brazil (1990–1994).         "
"50"," Party Discipline: As noted in the text, we use intraparty competition as our reflection of likely party discipline. Where legislators must distinguish themselves from not only members of other parties, but also members of their own they are more likely to put their own interests above those of their party. Open‐list PR or multiple lists from the same party are two examples of rules that would encourage personal vote seeking over party discipline. Countries with electoral rules that encourage party discipline include: Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Venezuela.         "
"51"," Presidential Majority: Presidents who enjoy majority support in the legislature are coded 1, while those who do not are coded 0. Presidential majorities occurred in: Argentina 1985–1987, 1992–1993; Colombia 1991–1995; Costa Rica 1985–1993; Mexico 1985–1995; Peru 1985–1990, 1995; and Venezuela 1985–1988.         "
"52"," Inflation: Inflation data was taken from the World Bank's (1997) World Development Indicators CD‐ROM. It was lagged one year and logged to account for several extremely high instances of inflation (for example, inflation was over 11,000 percent in Bolivia in 1986).         "
