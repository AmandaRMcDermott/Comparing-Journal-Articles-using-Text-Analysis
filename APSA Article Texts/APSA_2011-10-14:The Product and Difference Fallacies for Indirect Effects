"1","Before describing the situations in which the product and difference methods fail, it will be useful to describe the situation in which these methods succeed. With this goal in mind, we assume a simple linear path model with constant effects for independent observations indexed by i= 1, … , n. In this model (depicted graphically in Figure 1(a)) the explanatory variable Xi may affect both the intermediate/mediating variable Zi and the outcome variable Yi, and the intermediate variable Zi may also affect the outcome variable. In order to be explicit about the definition of indirect effects, we will write this model with potential outcomes notation as the following:            "
"2","                Linear Model with Constant Effects                      "
"3","Panel (a) represents the full model where α1 is the individual‐level effect of X on Z, β1 is the individual‐level direct effect of X on Y, and β2 is the individual‐level effect of Z on Y. Panel (b) represents the reduced‐form model where α1×β2+β1 represents the total effect of X on Y.                     "
"4","Using this notation, the observed mediator can be written as Zi=Zi(Xi), and the observed outcome can be written as Yi=Yi(Xi, Zi(Xi)). With this model and notation, we can define the reduced‐form potential outcomes and model recursively,            "
"5","Note that the second term in (3) can be interpreted as an indirect effect because it corresponds to be the change we would see if the explanatory variable had an effect on the intermediate variable, but not directly on the outcome variable (Yi(x, Zi(x+ 1)) −Yi(x, Zi(x))):            "
"6","Therefore, if we further assume that a regression of Z on X and other control variables will provide an unbiased estimate of α1 and a regression of Y on Z and X and other control variables will provide an unbiased estimate of β2, then we may consistently estimate the indirect effect with the product of these two estimates.3"
"7","Furthermore, if we assume that we can obtain an unbiased estimate of β1+β2·α1 with a regression of Y on X and other control variables, and we can obtain an unbiased estimate of β1 with a regression of Y on X and Z and other control variables, the difference of these two estimates provides an unbiased estimate of the indirect effect. Therefore, in this model (linear with constant effects), the product and difference heuristics work perfectly.         "
"8","Of course, it is well known that these product and difference methods do not provide consistent estimates for more complicated models. However, in more complicated settings, these two methods are often used as heuristics because it is frequently assumed that they will produce estimates with the correct sign and/or approximately the correct magnitude. In the following two sections, I explain why the product and difference heuristics can produce highly misleading answers, such as sign reversals and false null results, as soon as we allow for heterogeneous effects and interactions."
"9","Suppose we assume a linear path model with heterogeneous effects but no individual‐level interactions between the explanatory variable and the intermediate variable.             "
"10","As in (4), we can define the individual‐level indirect effect to be the change we would see if the explanatory variable had an effect on the intermediate variable, but not directly on the outcome variable.            "
"11","In heterogeneous effects models like this, regressions will not generally provide estimates of the individual effects (Holland 1986), so that even random assignment of the explanatory variable only identifies average effects. However, even if we assume that a regression of Z on X and other control variables provides an unbiased estimate of  and a regression of Y on Z and X and other control variables provides an unbiased estimate of , and even if we restrict our attention to the average indirect effect (), the product heuristic can provide highly misleading estimates. This is because an average of products is equal to a product of the constituent averages plus the covariance between the constituents,            "
"12","Unfortunately, because regressions do not produce individual‐level effect estimates, the covariance term in (8) cannot be identified and can therefore never be accounted for completely. However, partial tests may be available, and some values of Cov(α1, β2) will be more plausible than others. This will be easier to discuss in the context of an example.         "
"13","In an important and highly cited paper on Islam and authoritarianism, Fish (2002) presents cross‐national evidence that countries with an Islamic religious tradition tend to have more authoritarian governments. Furthermore, this paper uses the product heuristic a number of times to argue that this relationship may be partially due to the subordination of women within predominantly Muslim societies (societies with an Islamic religious tradition).            "
"14","For example, this paper presents a regression of country‐level sex ratios (number of men per 100 women) on country‐level income and on an indicator for Islamic religious tradition (IRT)—as evidence for a positive effect of IRT on sex ratios. This paper also presents a regression of Freedom House (FH) democracy scores (reversed so that higher scores indicate more democratic countries) on income, IRT, and sex ratio—as evidence for a negative effect of sex ratios on democracy scores:            "
"15","                              "
"16","...the difference in sex ratios between Muslim and Catholic countries is large and statistically significant, as is the difference between Muslim and all non‐Muslim countries. Models 3 and 4 in Table 9 show this finding. Table 10 shows that in a regression using FH scores as the dependent variable, sex ratio differences are statistically significant even when controlling for Islam and level of development. (Fish 2002, 28)                  "
"17","Are these results—a significant Muslim versus non‐Muslim effect on sex ratio and a significant sex ratio effect on FH scores—convincing evidence for the indirect effect of IRT on democracy due to female subordination? As in all observational studies, we might worry that the correct variables have not been measured (or have been measured incorrectly).5 We might worry about balance and overlap. We might worry that functional form assumptions are not appropriate. However, the fundamental problem of indirect effects is that, even if the above cited results are robust to all of these concerns, the implied indirect effect is not robust without additional assumptions.6"
"18","As a stylized example, suppose there are two types of countries. The first type has a high sex ratio if and only if it has an Islamic religious tradition (α1i > 0), but sex ratio has little effect on its democracy score (β2i≈ 0). The indirect effect is approximately zero for this type of country (α1i·β2i≈ 0). For the second type of country, Islamic religious tradition has little effect on sex ratio (α1i≈ 0), but sex ratio negatively affects the democracy score (β2i < 0). The indirect effect is also approximately zero for this type of country (α1i·β2i≈ 0). Furthermore, if the population is composed of equal amounts of these two types of countries, then the average effect of Islamic religious tradition on sex ratio is positive (), and the average effect of sex ratio on democracy score is negative (). Therefore, the product method () would suggest that the average indirect effect is negative, when in fact the indirect effect is essentially zero for all countries. The fallacy occurs in this case because the covariance between the two effects is positive (Cov(α1, β2) > 0), and this cancels with the negative estimate from the product method.            "
"19","Unfortunately, we cannot estimate the covariance between the effects. However, if we have a theoretical reason to believe that the magnitude of the covariance might be smaller within levels of stratification, then we may be able to ameliorate the effects of this covariance. For example, consider the evidence cited in Fish (2002), reproduced here in the first row of Table 1.7 Within these additive linear models, the average effect of IRT on sex ratio () is estimated to be 4.619, and the average effect of sex ratio on democracy score () is estimated to be −0.062. Using the product method, this implies an estimated average indirect effect of −0.287. However, although these models control for income in an additive manner, we might worry that there is positive correlation between the IRT and sex ratio effects, and furthermore, we might think that this covariance will be smaller within levels of income.            "
"20","As a first test, suppose that instead of conditioning on income in an additive model, we split the sample into high‐income countries (countries above the upper quintile) and lower‐income countries (countries below the upper quintile). Rows 2 and 3 of Table 1 show that when we regress sex ratio on IRT among the high‐income countries, we estimate an IRT effect of 25.230, and when we regress sex ratio on IRT among the lower‐income countries, we estimate an IRT effect of 2.342. However, even though we find evidence of heterogeneity, it is important to note that this stratification does not substantially change our impression of the original estimate of . To see this, note that when we average these two effects according to the proportion of high‐ and lower‐income countries (Row 4 of Table 1), we estimate the average effect of IRT on sex ratio () to be .2 · 25.23 + .8 · 2.342 = 6.949. Therefore, the estimate of 4.619 for the positive IRT effect is robust to the use of this interaction model (in fact, the estimated  increases by roughly 50%).            "
"21","Similarly, when we regress democracy scores on sex ratio and IRT among the high‐income countries, we estimate a sex ratio effect of 0.026, and when we regress democracy scores on sex ratio and IRT among the lower‐income countries, we estimate a sex ratio effect of −0.074—again some evidence of an interaction. However, as before when we average these two effects according to the proportion of high‐ and lower‐income countries, we estimate the average effect of sex ratio on democracy () to be .2 · 0.026 + .8 · (−0.074) =−0.054. Therefore, the estimate of −0.062 for the negative sex ratio effect is robust to the use of this interaction model (although the magnitude of the effect decreases slightly). Finally, notice that the product of our new estimates for  and  actually implies a more substantial indirect effect (6.95 ×−0.054 =−0.373).            "
"22","We might take the robustness of the estimates for these two effects ( and ) to imply robustness for our estimated indirect effect. However, the robustness of these constituent effects does not transfer to the average indirect effect. Rows 2 and 3 of Table 1 demonstrate that the estimated indirect effect (taking the products within rows) is 0.648 for high‐income countries and −0.172 for low‐income countries (note that these estimates do not bracket the original estimate of −0.287). When averaged according to the proportions of high‐ and lower‐income countries, we see that the average indirect effect is effectively zero (.2 · 0.648 + .8 · (−0.172) =−0.007). In other words, even if the estimated effects of IRT on sex ratio () and sex ratio on democracy () are robust, the estimated average indirect effect () is not robust. Notice that this lack of robustness is due to positive covariance between the constituent effects. Both of the effects are larger for the high‐income group and lower for the low‐income group. This positive covariance cancels with the negative effect produced by the product heuristic and results in an estimate near zero.            "
"23","Of course, this analysis should not be taken as definitive. Stratification on other variables might restore the negative indirect effect or might even produce a positive indirect effect. What this example demonstrates is the additional burden associated with the use of the product method for the estimation of indirect effects—it is not enough to provide robust estimates of the constituent average effects. In addition to the usual task incumbent on the analyst—arguing that the two regression coefficients approximate results from randomized experiments—the analyst must also argue that the covariance between the individual‐level constituent effects is minimal. In other words, the analyst must argue that conditions hold in addition to those that would be justified by randomized experiments.            "
"24","Given the difficulties of the product method, we might instead rely on the difference method. Using the model in (5) and (6), we can again define the total effects as a change in the explanatory variable that is allowed to propagate through both the direct and indirect channels.            "
"25","For this interaction model with heterogeneous effects, there are many possible indirect effects. Recall that in the constant effects model (4) and in the heterogeneous effects model without an interaction (7), the indirect effect was defined as Yi(x, Zi(x+ 1)) −Yi(x, Zi(x)). With an interaction between the explanatory and intermediate variables, this indirect effect becomes               "
"26","Given the model in (10) and (11), we can again define the total effects as a change in the explanatory variable that is allowed to propagate through both the direct and indirect channels, and this total effect can be decomposed using either (12) or (13):               "
"27","Therefore, if we could obtain consistent estimates for the average total effect and if we could obtain consistent estimates for the average direct effects represented in the first terms of (16) and (17), then the difference between the estimated average total effect and an estimated average direct effect would provide a consistent estimate for an average indirect effect.            "
"28","Unfortunately, many assumptions must hold in order for us to obtain consistent estimates of these average direct effects. To see this, note that the average of the direct effect in the first term of (17) can be written as the following:               "
"29","The difference fallacy stems from two sources. First, the covariance terms in (18) and (19) are analogous to the covariance term in (8). As with the product method, the difference method can produce misleading results unless the analyst manages to stratify the analysis so that these covariance terms will be substantively unimportant within strata. Second, even if these covariance terms are equal to zero, the typical practice of omitting insignificant interaction terms can result in misleading estimates from the difference method if the average effect of X on Z is large (). As before, this will be easier to discuss within the context of an example.            "
"30","In addition to using the product heuristic, Fish (2002) also utilizes the difference heuristic to make inferences about indirect effects. Using regressions of democracy scores on Islamic religious tradition (IRT) and the literacy gap between men and women, the paper finds that            "
"31","                              "
"32","The second model adds the differential in literacy rates. The variable is significant in substantive and statistical terms, and its inclusion produces a moderate reduction in the coefficient for the Muslim variable. (Fish 2002, 26)                  "
"33","Is this “moderate reduction” (i.e., a difference) evidence of a negative indirect effect? We may worry about the assumption of additivity in the regression of democracy scores on IRT and literacy gap. However, when we include the interaction in the regression, we find that the associated coefficient is not significant at the 5% level, so we might conclude that the additive model is a reasonable approximation."
"34","The first row of Table 2 replicates the results cited in the above quote. The estimated total effect of the Muslim variable is −1.686 while the estimated direct effect is −1.426, so using the difference method, the indirect effect is estimated to be −0.260. However, even if we assume that linear models are appropriate, and that the control variables were sufficient for these regression results to be accurate, and that the covariance terms in (18) and (19) are negligible, the difference method can produce misleading results for at least one of the average indirect effects ((14) and (15)).            "
"35","Because the Muslim variable (IRT) is binary, (14) simplifies to . This can be interpreted as the indirect effect of IRT if the direct influence of IRT is held fixed as IRT = 0 (non‐Muslim). Similarly, (15) simplifies to . This can be interpreted as the indirect effect of IRT if the direct influence of IRT is held fixed as IRT = 1 (Muslim). Table 2 presents estimates of (14) and (15). The first row uses the difference method (via the additive models in Fish 2002). The first column presents the estimated total effect of IRT on democracy score based on Model 1 from Table 10 of Fish (2002). The second and fourth columns present the estimated direct effect of IRT on democracy from Model 2 of Table 10. The third and fifth columns present the estimated indirect effect of IRT on democracy using the difference method (subtracting the direct effect from the total effect). The entries in the second and fourth columns and the third and fifth columns are identical because the regressions are additive.            "
"36","Although the interaction term is insignificant, the inclusion of the interaction for this model shows that the difference method produces a misleading estimate for (15) because  is large enough to overcome this insignificance. The interaction estimates are produced by adding the interaction term between IRT and literacy gap in Model 2 from Table 10 of Fish (2002) in order to estimate  and . We estimate  and  with Model 2 from Table 9 of Fish (2002) ( is estimated by setting the control variables to their average values). Finally, if we assume that the covariances in (18) and (19) are zero, the direct effects in the second and fourth columns of Table 2 can be estimated according to the following formulas,               "
"37","There are two things to notice in this table. First, the estimate of  in the first row appears to be robust to the inclusion of the interaction between IRT and literacy gap in the model. Second, the estimate of  in the first row is not robust to the inclusion of the interaction between IRT and literacy gap in the model. Despite the insignificance of the interaction term, the difference method with interactive models (row 2) produces a sign reversal for the estimate of —a positive (although insignificant) estimate for this indirect effect, while the difference method with additive models (row 1) produces a significant negative estimate for the indirect effect.            "
"38","However, as in the previous section, these new results should not be taken as definitive. The interactive estimates rely on the equations in (20) and (21), and if the covariance terms in (18) and (19) are substantial, these will be inaccurate. As before, what this example demonstrates is the additional burden associated with the estimation of indirect effects. Results that appear to be robust in constituent regressions do not imply that estimated indirect effects are robust.            "
"39","The previous sections have demonstrated that the product and difference methods can produce misleading results—even when randomized experiments are possible. Add to this the fact that for many political science applications, it is not possible to randomize the explanatory variable or the intermediate variable, and we might question whether it is possible to estimate indirect effects in a reliable manner."
"40","One partial solution is to restrict inference to subpopulations. The restriction to subpopulations can make the necessary assumptions more credible, and in some cases, the restriction may also more closely match the substantive question of interest. For example, one useful type of subpopulation is defined by particular values of the explanatory variable, and in the case of a binary explanatory variable, we might estimate the following two subpopulation average indirect effects:             "
"41","Switching to the estimand in (23) has a number of benefits. First, the average Yi(1, Zi(1)) for the treated units is simply the average Yi for the treated units, and can be calculated directly. Second, if the control units outnumber the treated units, we may be able to use matching to prune less comparable control units from the analysis, thus decreasing model dependence (Ho et al. 2007). Third, this switch allows us to focus on estimating , which we will write as . Note that using the heterogeneous interaction model of (10) and (11), this quantity can be written as the following:            "
"42","In addition to sex ratio and literacy gap, Fish (2002) also uses a measure of the percentage of women in high levels of government (WG) to assess the subjugation of women in each country. The analysis presented in Model 6 from Tables 9 and 10 of that paper implies an indirect effect of −0.44 for the effect of Islamic religious tradition on democracy scores (due to women in government). In the additive model, this can be taken as an estimate of the average indirect effect for the Muslim countries.         "
"43","In order to estimate the average indirect effect on the treated, we first calculate the average democracy score among Muslim countries as 2.613. The remaining task is to estimate . Because we are estimating the effect for the Muslim countries, we can use the MatchIt procedure (Ho et al. 2009) to prune non‐Muslim countries from the data set that are less comparable in terms of income. Figure 2 presents the pruned data as a scatterplot for the Income and WG variables. Muslim countries (IRT = 1) are plotted with solid points. Non‐Muslim countries (IRT = 0) are plotted with open circles.         "
"44","                Analyzing Overlap for the Estimation of Indirect Effects                      "
"45","Scatterplot of percent women in government (WG) and income (measured as log GDP). The solid points are the Muslim countries (IRT = 1). The open circles are the remaining non‐Muslim countries (IRT = 0) after non‐Muslim countries with less comparable incomes were pruned. The dashed line represents the linear regression for the non‐Muslim countries. The open triangles represent the predicted percent of women in government for the Muslim countries if they had not been Muslim. Due to the pruning based on income, the overlap between Muslim and non‐Muslim on the income variable is fairly good for the prediction of WG. However, the scatterplot also represents the predictor space for the second stage prediction of democracy, and overlap problems are apparent for this prediction. In general, there are very few solid points near the dashed line, and for some ranges (e.g., income greater than 3.6), there are none."
"46","Using the pruned data, the next task is to predict the WG variable for each Muslim country as if it had been non‐Muslim. Within the linear regression framework, this is done by fitting a regression line for the non‐Muslim countries (the dashed line) and fitting each of the Muslim countries to that line. These predictions (for each Muslim country) are represented by the open triangles on the dashed line."
"47","In order to complete estimation of , we need to predict the democracy scores that the Muslim countries would have had if their WG percentages had been as they would have been had they been non‐Muslim. This involves first using the data on the Muslim countries to fit a regression of democracy scores on Income and WG. In other words, regress democracy scores for Muslim countries on the predictor space defined by the scatterplot of solid points in Figure 2. Finally, we use this regression to predict democracy scores for each Muslim country on the basis of income and predicted percentage of women in government (i.e., use the results from the Muslim country regression of Democracy on Income and WG to predict democracy scores according to the (x,y) coordinates of the triangles in Figure 2). These predicted democracy scores are then averaged to estimate .         "
"48","Because the estimation of indirect effects involves the use of two regressions, we should check balance and overlap twice: once for the regression of Z on X (with controls) and once for the regression of Y on Z and X (with controls). Our matching on income was reasonably successful in achieving balance and overlap on the Income variable for the first regression. Unfortunately, when the effect of X on Z is strong, we are more likely to see overlap problems for the regression of Y on Z and X. The lack of overlap for this second regression is apparent in Figure 2, where the distribution of solid points doesn’t overlap sufficiently with the dashed regression line. In particular, note that for income values above 3.6, there are no Muslim countries anywhere near the line. This means that when we attempt to predict democracy scores, these predictions will represent an extrapolation outside the range of the Muslim data—it is not possible to reliably predict Yi(1, Zi(0)) for Muslim countries with incomes greater than 3.6. We might also worry about extrapolation for incomes less than 2.3.         "
"49","Lack of overlap for the second regression means that we might want to further restrict the subpopulation of interest. For example, we might decide that we can only estimate the average indirect effect for moderate‐income Muslim countries. If we rerun the entire analysis after removing the countries with extreme incomes (less than 2.3 or greater than 3.6), this procedure provides an estimated indirect effect of −0.27 (a slight reduction in the estimate). Removing the extreme income countries has the added benefit of reducing the residual variance from the regression of WG on the non‐Muslim countries (our estimate of Var(α0)X= 1), so the potential bias due to Cov(β2+β3, α0)X= 1 should also be reduced.         "
"50","However, even if the restriction to moderate‐income countries has reduced extrapolation and perhaps the covariance term in (24), we may still worry about the interpolation implicit in the procedure. For example, we might want to fit the second‐stage regression (Democracy on Income and WG for Muslim countries) using only solid points close to the dashed regression line (i.e., pruning for the second‐stage regression). However, there are very few solid points near the dashed regression line, so we cannot prune, and our estimate of −0.27 is highly dependent on the linearity assumption. Furthermore, the dearth of Muslim country observations near the dashed line means that we essentially cannot include additional variables in the analysis (either to control for confounding or to limit the covariance term). In particular, stratifying the analysis on an additional control variable would only exacerbate the overlap problem.         "
"51","This article has demonstrated that even when a linear model is appropriate at the individual level, and when control variables are sufficient to approximate randomized experiments, the product and difference heuristics can produce highly misleading estimates of the indirect effect. It was shown that stratification and the inclusion of interactions can ameliorate some of this problem, but unless we are willing to make untestable assumptions about the covariance terms in (8), (18), (19), and (24), we will be unable to identify the average indirect effects.         "
"52","Furthermore, this article has demonstrated that by restricting inference to subpopulations, some of the assumptions underlying the estimation of indirect effects can be checked. In particular, by restricting the population of interest to the treated units, balance and overlap can be more easily achieved for the regression of Z on X (by pruning noncomparable control units), and balance and overlap can be more easily checked for the regression of Y on Z and X. Unfortunately, if the effect of X on Z is strong, it may be impossible to achieve balance and overlap for the regression of Y on Z and X."
"53","The implications of this work for future research design are threefold. First, as demonstrated in this article, it is easy enough to stratify and include interactions so as to reduce the problems associated with effect heterogeneity and the untestable covariance terms. Furthermore, although linear models were used in this article in order to simplify presentation, the procedures described do not depend on the use of linear regression. See Pearl (2011) and Imai et al. (2010b) (with its associated R package [Imai et al. 2010c]) for approaches with nonlinear models.         "
"54","Second, if the explanatory variable is binary, inference should be restricted to the treated (or control units)—even if only as a first step. It is especially important to assess overlap problems that may occur for the regression of Y on X and Z when the effect of X on Z is strong. If the explanatory variable is continuous, model dependence will likely be unavoidable, and this should be acknowledged."
"55","Third, because randomization is not sufficient to identify average indirect effects (see Bullock et al. 2010; and Bullock and Ha 2011; Green et al. 2010; Robins and Greenland 1992; and Sobel 2008 for additional discussion), the analyst should explicitly acknowledge the additional assumptions implicit in the analysis of indirect effects. In this article, these assumptions were presented in terms of the covariances in (8), (18), (19), and (24). If these assumptions are suspect, then it may be necessary to perform a sensitivity analysis on the basis of these covariances. Recent work provides an alternative approach to sensitivity analysis and bounding (Imai et al. 2010a, 2010b, 2010c, 2010d).         "
