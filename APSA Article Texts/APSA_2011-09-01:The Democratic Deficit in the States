"1","Early analyses indeed found virtually no relationship between political variables and the ideological direction of state policy (inter alia, Dye 1966; Plotnick and Winters 1985). Treadway (1985), in an influential review of the state policy literature, blamed voters’ lack of knowledge and interest in state politics. More recent scholarship, however, dramatically shifted the debate, showing evidence of a linkage between state policy and voter preferences. Erikson, Wright, and McIver estimated voter liberalness in each state by pooling national surveys over a 12‐year period and found that the more liberal a state’s voters, the more liberal the state scored on a policy index: “even under adverse conditions such as the limited interest and information that the average voter has regarding state politics, public opinion can serve to influence state policy” (1993, 253). Subsequent research, employing a similar methodological approach, has confirmed these findings, and other work, such as Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson (2002), has shown aggregate responsiveness at the national level. To be sure, some policies map quite nicely to general ideology, but some do not (Norrander 2001). Others connect general attitudes (e.g., toward homosexuals or feminism) to related policies and outcomes (e.g., gay marriage bans or number of abortions; Brace et al. 2002; Haider‐Markel and Kaufman 2006).         "
"2","As we noted in the introduction, one concern with using ideology (and even general attitudes) is that we do not know the latent mapping from the diffuse measure to actual policy choice. Some scholars focus on attitudes and ideology because they think it too demanding to expect detailed policy preferences from voters and too demanding to expect statehouse democracy to function on the basis of voters’ detailed preferences. But another reason is practical, not theoretical: the lack of comparable opinion polls across states. To compensate for this, studies typically estimate opinion using disaggregation, a technique that pools national polls (typically over many years) until there are a sufficient number of survey respondents to calculate opinion percentages in each state. Unfortunately, polling firms do not usually ask policy‐specific questions frequently enough to generate reliable estimates of policy‐specific preferences. Researchers have instead had to limit themselves to those questions that have been asked in dozens of compatible surveys (the occasional policy question but usually only ideology or attitudes). This limits generalizability across policies and can render conclusions about congruence impossible."
"3","A small number of single‐issue studies have directly estimated voters’ preferred policy choices and compared those to actual state policies adopted. For example, Gerber (1996, 1999) pools several national surveys to estimate state‐level support for the death penalty and abortion restrictions; Lax and Phillips (2009b) estimate public support for eight policies regulating gay and lesbian rights; Lupia et al. (2010) uses state polls to study state constitutional bans on same‐sex marriage; and Norrander (2000) ties death penalty–specific opinion and policy. While these studies found evidence of responsiveness, results may be difficult to generalize (Burnstein 2003). These studies focus on highly salient morality policy issues, and, as Lax and Phillips (2009b) demonstrate, responsiveness to majority opinion is greatly enhanced by salience.         "
"4","We address the various concerns above by estimating state‐level opinion across a wide range of issues using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP). MRP is a technique presented by Gelman and Little (1997), validated by Park, Gelman, and Bafumi (2006) and Lax and Phillips (2009a), and extended in Berkman and Plutzer (2005), Lax and Phillips (2009b), and Kastellec, Lax, and Phillips (2010), inter alia. It has been shown to produce highly accurate estimates even with a single national poll and simple demographic‐geographic models (simpler than we use herein). There are two stages to MRP. First, individual survey response is modeled as a function of a nuanced demographic and geographic typology, using multilevel regression. For each demographic‐geographic type of voter, predicted policy support is estimated. The second step is poststratification: the estimates for each demographic‐geographic type are weighted by the percentages of each type in actual state populations using Census data, so that we can estimate the percentage of respondents within each state who take a particular position. This yields estimates of explicit policy support, explicit opposition, and, thereby, policy support among those with an opinion, for each policy, and for each state. For full details of this method, see Lax and Phillips (2009a, 2009b). The demographic predictors used here are age, education, race, and gender. The state‐level variables are percentage religious conservatives and 2004 Democratic presidential vote share, with state and region modeled effects. Below we use percentage support out of those with an opinion.         "
"5","We use MRP to estimate opinion for 39 policies that are set by state governments. These policies are drawn from eight issue areas: immigration, abortion, criminal justice, health care, gay rights, electoral reform, gaming, and education. These are all issue areas that are salient and over which opinion and policy vary across states. While some, such as abortion, have been the subject of numerous inquiries in the opinion literature, others, such as health care and education, have not. By considering such a diverse set of policies, we can explore whether and how responsiveness and congruence vary across issue areas."
"6","The policies used here are clearly not a random sample, and so some caution must be taken in generalizing our findings.1 However, policies were not purposefully selected on substantive grounds or because they lined up with traditional measures of ideology. Rather, the policies included here are all those for which we were able to obtain state policy data and at least one large national opinion survey (though for most policies we rely on multiple surveys). We conducted our search for survey data using iPoll from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research (see Supporting Information [SI] for details). State policy data were obtained as of 2008 from various sources (SI Table 5), including advocacy groups, policy foundations, and research organizations.         "
"7","Policy and opinion are both dichotomous, so that they share a directly common metric (e.g., “Does the law require women seeking an abortion to wait 24 hours” and “Do you favor a law requiring women seeking abortions to wait 24 hours?”). Policy and opinion are coded to point in the liberal direction (e.g., having the death penalty is coded as 0; having affirmative action is coded as 1; codings verified through factor analysis). Policies are listed below (SI Table 5 has details):         "
"8","            "
"9","Abortion—Require doctors to counsel patients on abortion alternatives; Require parental consent for teenagers; Require parental notification for teenagers; Ban late‐term abortions; Require a 24‐hour waiting period for an abortion.                  "
"10","Education—Ban race‐based affirmative action for admissions in higher education; Allow charter schools; Require students to pass a standardized test before graduating from high school; Allow tax‐funded vouchers to be used for private or religious schools.                  "
"11","Electoral Reform—Limit corporate/union campaign contributions; Limit individual contributions; Require a photo ID to vote; Allow recall elections; Mandate legislative term limits.                  "

"

"17","Table 1 shows the number of liberal policies and average liberal opinion by state. Table 2 shows the same by issue area. Opinion and policy are mapped in Figure 1.         "
"18","                Distribution of Policy and Opinion MajoritiesThe maps show the number of liberal opinion majorities (darker = liberal; Montana is at the median), number of policies that are liberal (darker = liberal; Pennsylvania is at the median), number of policies that are congruent (darker = congruent; Florida is at the median), and the net liberal incongruence policy bias (darker = liberal; Maine is balanced). The histogram shows the distribution of counts of liberal opinion majorities and of liberal policies. The remaining panels on the lower right show the percentage of incongruence that is liberal for each state against state voter ideology and then against partisan control of government. The dashed regression line shows the southern states and the solid line the rest.                     "
"19","We begin by considering responsiveness at the level of individual policies. Each graph in Figure 2 takes a policy and plots the probability of policy adoption on the y‐axis, against our estimates of state opinion on the x‐axis. The small tick marks along the top (bottom) axis show the opinion in states that have (do not have) the liberal policy. We show the logit regression curve for each panel. A policy is strongly responsive if it has a steep positively sloped curve. Bold solid curves indicate a statistically significant responsiveness coefficient (at the 95% level). Otherwise, a dashed curve is plotted. Overall, we find strong evidence of responsiveness, a finding that is strengthened later by multivariate analysis. In all but four graphs, the probability of having liberal policy is positively correlated to policy‐specific opinion. However, responsiveness does vary across policies.            "
"20","                Basic RelationshipsEach graph plots the probability of policy adoption from a logistic regression curve given state opinion. Each x‐ and y‐axis runs from 0 to 100% for opinion and the probability of policy adoption, respectively. Opinion in states with the policy in question are plotted (in a “rug”) on the top axis and those without on the bottom. Dotted lines show the 50% marks in opinion support and policy probability. Panels are ordered by policy group. Bold solid lines indicate a relationship significant at 95% (two‐tailed). The percentage in each panel is the degree of congruence across states between the policy and the opinion majority (rug marks in the top‐right and bottom‐left quadrants are congruent).                        "
"21","First, the strength of the opinion‐policy relationship differs, as is indicated by variation in the steepness of the regression curves. Second, policymaking often has either a liberal or conservative bias. To see this, consider the location of the logit curves, which are sometimes shifted left or right of center, meaning either less or more liberal opinion is needed, respectively, to bring about policy adoption. The dotted lines extending from the x‐ and y‐axes indicate (respectively) where public support and the probability of policy adoption each reach 50%. The point at which the regression curve intersects the vertical dotted line reveals (read on the y‐axis) the predicted probability of policy adoption when public support is 50%. The point at which the regression curve intersects the horizontal dotted line reveals (read on the x‐axis) the needed level of support for the predicted probability of adoption to reach 50%. The crosshair at the intersection of the two dotted lines marks the point at which 50% public support corresponds to a 50% chance of policy adoption."
"22","For perfect majoritarian responsiveness, the slope of the estimated logit curve would be very steep at 50% and go through the crosshair within each panel. Even when you have responsiveness, there are two ways to get incongruence then. The more obvious possibility is that the curve goes through the crosshairs but is insufficiently steep. The other way is policy bias: when the curve is shifted to the right of the crosshair, it means that a large level of liberal opinion (likely more than a majority) is needed to bring about policy adoption. This indicates a conservative bias in policymaking (underresponsiveness to liberal opinion). When the curve is to the left of the crosshairs, it indicates the opposite. Even a cursory glance at Figure 2 shows that we rarely observe perfect majoritarian control.            "
"23","As noted above, when policy responsiveness is weak or biased relative to majority opinion, the consequence is at least some incongruence. Indeed, our results show clear examples of strong responsiveness (a steep curve) coinciding with frequent mismatches between majority will and policy, due to a biased policy curve. “Health Care: Medical Marijuana” and “Health Care: SCHIP” both show a significant positive relationship between opinion and policy and have similarly steep responsiveness curves. When plotted, however, the curve for the latter passes through the 50% crosshair while the former is shifted noticeably to the right. This shift means that support for medical marijuana has to be far above 50% (approximately 70%) to have a 50% chance of policy adoption. The consequence is that congruence for medical marijuana policy is relatively low—only 26% compared with 86% for SCHIP."
"24","The percentages listed in each plot in Figure 2 are the share of states with policies that match the opinion majority (tick marks in the top‐right and bottom‐left quadrants are congruent). Congruence by policy and issue area is also shown in Table 2. Across policies, congruence ranges from 6% (“Immigration: Bilingual”) to 86% (“Gaming: Lottery”). The issue areas in which policy most frequently matches majority opinion are gay rights and gaming, which have congruence rates of 57% and 56%, respectively. That we uncover such relatively high rates of congruence in these two areas seems to confirm the long‐standing expectation that issues dealing with morality policy will be particularly responsive to public opinion (Mooney and Lee 1995). Indeed, if we group all policies that potentially address morality, we observe a congruence rate of 53% compared to 44% for all others. The issue area with the lowest congruence is immigration, where policy only matches majority opinion 33% of the time. There is also significant variation across states. Congruence by state (see Table 1 and the maps in Figure 1) ranges from 33% (New Hampshire, inter alia) to 69% (California and Louisiana).            "
"25","The bottom line is a great deal of incongruence in state policymaking.2 Despite the fact that policy is generally responsive to opinion, it only matches opinion 48% of the time. Especially for bare majorities, some incongruence might not be particularly worrisome (given that neither we nor political elites measure opinion perfectly)—but the democratic deficit persists even with larger opinion majorities. For majorities of size 60% or larger, only 52% of policies are congruent. Even for majorities of 70%, only 57% of policies are congruent. Limited congruence in the presence of responsiveness (which is what we typically observe) shows a limited degree of popular control—influence without sovereignty.3"
"26","Democracy delayed or democracy denied?  One possibility is that the incongruence we observe is a temporal anomaly, with newer agenda items not yet in alignment with opinion. Baumgartner and Jones (1993) argue that policymaking is an evolutionary process: change is slow and new issues create instability, taking time to move into equilibrium. Of policies that have largely entered state policy agendas during the last decade or so, only 46% are congruent, compared to 50% for all remaining policies. This is compatible with the view that it takes time for policy to move into congruence with opinion. On the other hand, that so much incongruence remains even for policies that have long been on state agendas (e.g., recall elections, gun restrictions, etc.) suggests strongly that the democratic deficit we document is not simply a short‐run phenomenon.               "
"27","Polarized Policy, Unpolarized Voters.  Incongruence can occur when policy is liberal and the opinion majority is conservative or vice versa—and so the direction of incongruence can vary and not just the extent thereof. When the policy curve goes through the 50‐50 crosshair but is insufficiently steep, incongruence will be balanced between the liberal and conservative directions. When the curve does not hit this crosshair, incongruence will not be so balanced, and indeed this is what we usually observe. The ideological tendency of state incongruence is shown in the rightmost columns of Tables 1 and 2 (also see the bottom map in Figure 1). Of overall incongruence, 55% is conservative in direction, suggesting a conservative bias relative to opinion majorities. The opinion majority is conservative and policy liberal 448 times (of 1,950 state‐policy comparisons); the opinion majority is liberal and policy conservative 558 times (so net bias due to incongruence is 110 conservative policies).4"
"28","At first glance, the ideological direction of incongruence correlates to the popular “red” versus “blue” state division of conservative and liberal states: see the bottom‐left map in Figure 1, which shades states based on net liberal incongruence (e.g., a liberal state like Washington is quite dark because it has four more liberal incongruent policies than conservative incongruent policies; Oklahoma, a conservative state, is much lighter because it has eight more conservative incongruent policies than it has liberal incongruent policies). Indeed, the middle‐right graph in Figure 1 shows that the percentage of incongruence that is liberal correlates to voter ideology (we develop this analysis later).               "
"29","In fact, blue states tend to go “too far” in adopting liberal policies and the red states go “too far” in the other direction. The consequences can be seen in simple counts of liberal opinion majorities and liberal policies. Histograms of these counts are shown in the top right of Figure 1. The policy count histogram is bimodal and spread out relative to the more concentrated (darkly shaded) opinion count. All but two states have between 15 and 25 liberal opinion majorities, yet 29 states have liberal policy counts outside this central region. That is, two states are “extreme” in the number of liberal opinion majorities and 29 are “extreme” in actual policy. Of these 29, 22 lie outside this range by being more conservative than the moderate region; seven lie outside to the liberal side.5 To put it simply, policy is polarized relative to public opinion, which varies much less across states. This polarization can also be seen by comparing the top‐left policy and opinion maps in Figure 1. There are many states with middling gray levels of opinion liberalism, whereas the policy maps show a clearer split between light and dark states. (The lighter tone overall suggests a slight conservative policy bias.)               "
"30","Our findings are consistent with a world in which states implement either a largely liberal or largely conservative slate of policies, rather than a policy‐by‐policy median voter world, in which it is possible to mix and match policies as preferred by opinion majorities. This polarization also suggests that incongruence is not random error, but rather systematic."
"31","We now explore factors that potentially shape responsiveness and congruence, starting with salience."
"32","Salience.  The strength of the opinion‐policy linkage should be conditioned by the salience of the policy, that is, its importance to the public and its prominence in public discourse. For salient policies, citizens are more likely to hold strong opinions, to convey those opinions to their representatives, and to hold their representatives accountable (Page and Shapiro 1983). When salience is low, however, officials may be unaware of their constituents’ preferences, and so might follow cues such as ideology to fill in the gaps (Druckman and Jacobs 2006). Finally, by giving voters what they want on salient policies, legislators may be more free in making other less salient policy choices, so long as they are responsive “enough.”            "
"33","To measure Salience, we conducted a Proquest search of New York Times articles counting how often the policy was mentioned in some form (details available by request), averaging within each issue area, and taking the log number of such stories. Although obviously crude, this technique performs reasonably well, and similar measures have been used with success (Haider‐Markel and Meier 1996; Lax and Phillips 2009b). It is not designed to capture variation in state media coverage; such coverage might be endogenous to policy adoption by state, whereas the national measure will more cleanly capture the relative visibility of each issue. The specific issues we study vary widely in terms of their salience. Some, such as same‐sex marriage laws and abortion restrictions, have been at the center of recent political conflict in the United States, whereas others have been less important (though none have been entirely absent from media coverage or state policy agendas).            "
"34","Ideology.  As we noted, politicians might cue off of voter ideology in lieu of specific policy preferences, and they no doubt want to fulfill their own ideological goals. Thus, we compare the impact of policy‐specific Opinion estimates against voter and government ideology. Voter Liberalism is based on Erikson, Wright, and McIver’s ideology scores (1993): the self‐identified liberalism/conservatism of voters in national survey data. Opinion does not reduce to ideology, though they do correlate. This relationship varies by policy (mean correlation is .56, ranging from −.83 for charter schools to +.83 for stem cell). Also, while every state has more self‐identified conservatives than liberals, 49% of opinion majorities are liberal. Government Liberalism is the Berry et al. (1998) ideology score for state elected officials, based on the partisan configuration of state government and interest group ratings of the state congressional delegation (averaged 1995–2005). Higher numbers on both scores are more liberal.            "
"35","Institutions.  Many of the largest debates in the state politics literature involve which, if any, institutional features of state government enhance or undercut the relationship between policy and opinion. One feature is the citizen initiative, which exists in 24 states. There are two ways it might enhance the effects of opinion. First, when a majority of voters prefer an alternative policy to that of the status quo, they can circumvent elected officials and enact their preferred policy outright. Second, the initiative may function as a “gun behind the door,” even if it is never used. Interest groups or citizens can, in response to legislative inaction or unpopular legislation, threaten to pursue their policy goals via the initiative. This threat may then spur elected officials to make changes in their policy choices as a means of avoiding a ballot measure. Even in the absence of an explicit threat, officials may anticipate the behavior of potential initiative authors and draft laws in a manner that preempt future ballot measures. Both effects are likely to be median enhancing (Gerber 1996, 1999).            "
"36","Some disagree, given the costs of the initiative process; the role that interest groups play in writing, qualifying, and financing ballot measures; and the limited understanding that voters have of policy questions on which they are asked to vote (Lascher, Hagen, and Rochlin 1996). Some studies find evidence supporting the initiative effect, at least in some policy areas (Arceneaux 2002; Gerber 1996, 1999; Matsusaka 2010; Phillips 2008), whereas others do not find an effect (Monogan, Gray, and Lowery 2009; Lascher, Hagen, and Rochlin 1996; Lax and Phillips 2009b). Our policy‐specific opinion measures might help resolve this thorny debate. Citizen Initiative is an indicator for states that allow either constitutional or statutory citizen initiatives.            "
"37","Next, we expect that legislative professionalization will enhance the effects of public opinion. Some states use highly professional chambers that resemble the U.S. House of Representatives (e.g., California and New York), whereas others rely on “citizen” chambers (e.g., New Hampshire). Professionalized legislatures are well paid, meet in lengthy sessions, and employ numerous nonelected staff. This allows lawmakers to treat their legislative service as a career. In citizen chambers, in contrast, the number of days legislators are allowed to meet is often constitutionally restricted (in extreme cases, 60 or 90 days biennially); compensation is low; there are few staff; and legislators hold outside jobs. Professional chambers should have a greater capacity and resources to assess and respond to public opinion. Longer sessions allow them to consider more issues, including those of relatively lower salience, and outside employment is less likely to constrain attention to constituents. Seats in professional chambers are also more valuable, so there are greater incentives for lawmakers to be responsive (Maestas 2000). We thus expect to see greater responsiveness and more congruence in states with professionalized legislatures.            "
"38","On the other hand, some argue that professionalization leads to elite capture of the governing apparatus (Weber 1999) and that citizen legislatures will be more in touch with the people. Still, we are not aware of any systematic evidence that professionalization undercuts the link between the people and policy. Our Legislative Professionalization measure comes from Squire (2007). It is a weighted combination of salary, days in session, and staff per legislator, as compared to those in Congress the same year.            "
"39","Next, term limits may reduce the capacity of lawmakers to assess and respond to opinion by reducing experience (Kousser 2005) and may reduce incentives to respond to public opinion by limiting the value of a legislative seat. On the other hand, as proponents of term limits argue, to the extent term limits induce greater turnover, they might lead to legislators who better reflect current constituents’ preferences directly and might reduce the extent to which legislators are “captured” by interest groups or political insiders. Additionally, they might shift a legislator’s attention to future statewide races (Carey, Niemi, and Powell 2000). Term Limits is our indicator for states that currently have such limits for legislative office.            "
"40","Finally, we also might expect to observe greater responsiveness and congruence in states that elect their high court judges (39 states require judges to be approved by voters via a partisan, nonpartisan, or retention election). Judicial decisions on important social issues often play a significant role in such elections. Elected Court is our indicator for states that elect the judges in their highest court (including partisan, nonpartisan, and retention elections; other codings yielded the same findings).            "
"41","Interest Groups.  All states have numerous interest groups, with hundreds or even thousands of registered lobbyists, representing a wide array of economic and social concerns (Lowery and Gray 1995, 2004). The political power of these groups varies strongly across states (Thomas and Hrebenar 2008). To be sure, interest groups need not be seen as purely counterdemocratic. These groups can even strengthen the effect of opinion. There can be policies for which lawmakers are unaware of constituent opinion. Furthermore, given limitations on agenda space, lawmakers simply may not have the time to consider all policies preferred by voters. Organized interests can act as information providers and can use their resources to pressure lawmakers to place popular measures on the agenda. They can also undertake activities to raise the salience of a particular policy. In direct democracy states, they can circumvent the legislature entirely and pursue popular measures via the initiative process. All of these could strengthen the policy‐opinion relationship.            "
"42","On the other hand, powerful interest groups may use their resources to block popular policies, and elected officials may be pressured to satisfy such groups instead of the median voter (to garner campaign contributions or other types of support). Overall, we expect that responsiveness and congruence will be conditioned by the net balance of powerful interest groups in a state targeting a particular policy. When the interest group and the popular majority are aligned, we should expect greater policy congruence than when the two are opposed. If there are such groups on both sides, they can cancel out."
"43","Powerful Interest Group Balance captures whether there is a powerful interest group in the state pushing for the liberal policy (+1) or conservative policy (−1). Specifically, the score is the sum of these forces within a state on a policy (so it ranges from −1 to 1, with opposing groups canceling out at 0). First, we identified powerful interest groups using an updated list by Thomas and Hrebenar (2008, original list), which provides an expert qualitative evaluation of interest groups by state. We then identified which of them would normally be associated with each policy, and likely position on them (see the SI). For example, we code the pharmaceutical industry (“powerful” in eight states) as preferring to allow stem cell research; and social conservative groups (“powerful” in 24 states) to oppose it. Given overlap, four states get scored +1; 20 at −1; and 26 at 0 (due to neither or both being powerful in the state).            "
"44","Party Politics.  Finally, there is the role of elite party politics, namely the impact of party control of the legislature and governorship. We would expect that the stronger the hold of the Republican (Democratic) party on the state government, the more conservative (liberal) state policy will be, holding policy support constant. When party pressures and public preferences both push for a particular policy, we should be far more likely to see congruence. Besides party, we also control for the ideological liberalness of state governments. Closely related to partisan control is electoral competition. When one party dominates the electoral landscape, monopolizing the reins of government, we would expect public influence to be more limited than when the parties are actively competing for support.            "
"45","We calculated the Democrats’ mean share of state legislative seats (averaging the two chambers) over the period 1990 to 2007, as well as the amount of time they controlled the governorship in each state. We call these Democratic Legislature % and Democratic Governor %. We next calculate, by state, the number of years of unified Democratic control and the number of years of unified Republican control. One‐Party Dominance is the absolute value of the difference between them (a state has a low score if it rarely has unified government or does have it but party control flips back and forth; if it usually has unified partisan control by one party and not the other, it will have a high score).            "
"46","Finally, we control for another aspect of political context, Turnout averaged over the last three presidential elections (broader participation might induce greater congruence).            "
"47","Explaining Responsiveness and Congruence.  We move now to multilevel logistic regression models of responsiveness and congruence. For congruence models, we use Size of Majority (from 50% to 100%). The larger the opinion majority, the stronger the signal sent to political actors, and so the greater the likelihood of congruence. Variables coded with an ideological direction in congruence regressions are centered and flipped around their means as necessary so that coding is in the direction opposite that of the opinion majority (e.g., for a conservative opinion majority, greater voter liberalism is coded as negative). When the scores are positive, they make congruence less likely; when negative, they point in the same direction as the opinion majority, making congruence more likely. These predictors are then labeled as Opposition (e.g., Voter Ideological Opposition). We standardize continuous variables to compare relative impact: a one‐unit change is a two standard deviation shift for each variable, and each is centered at its mean. Continuous predictors and dichotomous ones are now roughly on the same scale, and the “base” term given an interaction effect shows the effect at the average value of the interacted predictor, when it takes the value zero and thus drops out. See the SI for an assortment of robustness checks and supplemental results.               "
"48","For responsiveness, the dependent variable is an indicator for whether each state policy is liberal, and a key independent variable can be an interaction between a predictor and an opinion. This captures whether there is more or less responsiveness to opinion (a steeper or more shallow slope) under different conditions. For congruence models, the dependent variable is an indicator for the state policy matching the opinion majority. Interactions are not necessary as the predictors are directly related to congruence. Those predictors that were not interacted in the responsiveness models, however, must for congruence be oriented properly in terms of direction with the opinion majority. That is, for responsiveness, we ask whether term limits increase the slope of policy with respect to opinion; for congruence, we ask whether term limits increase or decrease the absolute likelihood of having congruence."
"49","Tables 3 and 4 show the full results. We show results from six model variants, to check robustness across specifications. For each table, Model 1 includes only opinion and salience; Model 2 adds voter ideology; Model 3 adds government ideology and partisanship measures; Model 4 instead uses institutional variables; Model 5 instead uses political context variables; and Model 6, the main model, includes all the variables except for Elected Court (we explain why below). For both responsiveness and congruence, the most complete model has the best fit. Findings remain robust to these and other variations (including limiting analysis to only larger states, for which one might expect the most precise opinion estimates).               "
"50","The basic relationship between policy and opinion is very clear: states with a higher level of policy support are far more likely to have the policy. All responsive models show that policy‐specific opinion has a significant and strong effect on policy adoption independent of elected elites, voter ideology (liberalism), and other factors; all congruence models show the strong impact of majority size. The average effect of policy‐specific opinion is over twice that of diffuse voter ideology. The latter still has a substantively and statistically significant effect on policy and congruence. Consistent with our expectations, higher salience does increase the impact of policy‐specific opinion, as shown by the large interaction term. At average/zero values, one additional point of policy‐specific opinion increases the chance of policy adoption by close to two percentage points. Salience one standard deviation above average almost doubles that (SI Figure 4 compares effect sizes). When the state government is more liberal and under Democratic control more of the time, liberal opinion majorities are more likely to get what they want. Government liberalism (but not party control in the responsiveness model) operates as predicted.6"
"51","Of the institutions, only legislative professionalization and term limits enhance responsiveness. The interaction terms show substantively and statistically significant effects on the marginal effect of opinion (increasing the responsiveness slope) and similar effects on congruence. A one standard deviation increase in professionalization increases the marginal effect of opinion by about 28% (the shift in congruence is 5 percentage points over this range). Term limits increase the marginal impact of opinion by 44% and increase the probability of congruence by up to 15 percentage points. We explored professionalization further, showing that it operates primarily through increasing agenda space rather than through salary or staff resources (see SI). Elected courts seem to increase responsiveness and congruence, but we find this effect to be spurious. When we control for policy areas in which court involvement is more likely, there is no increased responsiveness when courts are elected (the coefficient approaches zero), but rather only in areas where courts are not usually involved. The citizen initiative does not enhance responsiveness (indeed it is incorrectly signed; alternative measures leading to the same conclusion are explored in the SI). To be sure, only Louisiana has term limits without also having direct democracy, and 61% of states with direct democracy have term limits. This suggests that the direct democracy might have an indirect effect on responsiveness, by making term limits more likely—but this is the only evidence we find for a citizen initiative effect.7"
"52","This leaves political context. Turnout and one‐party dominance have effectively zero effect on responsiveness and congruence, but the interest group environment matters a great deal. Having a powerful interest group on the same (opposite) side as the opinion majority increases (decreases) the chance of congruence by up to 18%. A liberal (conservative) interest group increases (decreases) the likelihood of having the liberal policy, all else equal, by up to 14%. To put this in context, one would have to increase policy support by about nine percentage points to make up for having a powerful interest group opposed to the policy; for congruence, the majority size would have to increase by nine points to make up for a powerful interest group opposed to the majority. (See the SI for a supplemental result showing the density/number of interest groups does not affect responsiveness or congruence significantly.)               "
"53","We next expand on these regression results to account for both the magnitude and the ideological direction of the democratic deficit."
"54","We can use our model of congruence to apportion the “blame” for the democratic deficit across the possible culprits. Recall that 48% of policies are congruent with opinion majorities; our model also predicts 48%. If we decrease salience to the minimum across issue areas, or increase it to the maximum, congruence hits 26% and 56%, respectively. Suppose that we maximized professionalization, making every state the equivalent of California in this regard. Our point prediction based on our final model is that congruence would then occur 62% of the time. Giving every state term limits would increase congruence to 57%. Doing both would increase it to 71%."
"55","If we remove interest group effects, congruence would be a whopping 49%. How can dropping interest groups have no effect? Powerful interest groups restrain opinion majorities from achieving congruence; they also enable them when aligned in their favor. For the policies we study, aggregating across states and policies, we find no net effect. If we consider congruence at the state level (aggregating over policies within each state), however, the picture is more complicated. Some states do better, others worse. Without interest group effects, the average increase in congruence is about 4%, and the average decrease is about 4%. We find a similar canceling out for elite partisan effects and voter ideology effects.            "
"56","In short, overall congruence (summed across all states) is most affected by professionalization, term limits, and salience, but not by ideology, partisanship, and interest group pressure, which only affect the degree of incongruence within each state (sometimes helping, sometimes hurting). Nor do interest groups or voter ideology affect net policy liberalism (summed across states). An average state has 19 liberal opinion majorities, and our main responsiveness model predicts it will have 16 liberal policies. Dropping out interest group effects or voter ideology effects leaves this nearly unchanged."
"57","What about the type of incongruence? Some basic relationships are shown in Figure 1. The middle‐right panel shows the percentage of incongruence that is liberal for each state against state voter ideology, and the bottom‐right panel shows liberal incongruence against the party control. The dashed regression line shows the southern states and the solid line the rest. Controlling for region, there is a clear, strong relationship between ideological incongruence and each predictor. A pooled regression line ignoring the southern intercept shift in the bottom‐right panel would falsely suggest party control did not matter.            "
"58","We can more fully model the percentage of incongruence that is in the liberal direction by state as follows (OLS regression): Liberal Incongruence (including a liberal opinion index here shows no effect). Even after controlling for partisan control, voter ideology, and interest groups, “South” is a strong and significant determinant of how much of the democratic deficit in the state is conservative policy (overall, southern states have almost exactly the same level of congruence). Interest groups have a small but significant impact. Ideology and party control have roughly similar impact. Five additional years of Democratic control correlates to 2% more incongruence in the liberal (rather than conservative) direction. Again, the direction of incongruence is separable from the incongruence. For example, years of unified control (or even uncompetitive one‐party dominance) do not seem to lead to more congruence, yet unified partisan control does predict the form of incongruence.            "
"59","Conditional on there being incongruence, ideological or partisan factors affect the direction of incongruence. And the result is polarized policy. The histograms in Figure 1 showed the wider spread of liberal policy counts relative to the spread of liberal opinion majorities. One way to measure polarization is the standard deviation of the liberal policy count relative to that of the liberal opinion majority count. The current policy count standard deviation is 7.0. Removing interest group effects only reduces this to 6.7. Removing voter ideology effects, on the other hand, would reduce the standard deviation of state policy counts to 3.8, much closer to the 3.4 standard deviation in liberal opinion majority counts. Overresponsiveness to ideology is thus responsible for most of the polarization we observe.            "
"60","What do our results tell us about the quality of democratic government at the state level? First, state governments are generally responsive to voter preferences across a wide range of issue areas, particularly when salience is high, even after controlling for the ideology of state voters and elected elites. Policy‐specific opinion often has the largest substantive impact, indicating that it is indeed a key driver of policymaking."
"61","We agree that “state political structures appear to do a good job in delivering more liberal policies to more liberal states and more conservative policies to more conservative states” (Erikson, Wright, and McIver, 1993, 95). Our findings, however, suggest a far deeper form of representation than simple ideological correspondence. It is not only that more liberal states have more liberal policies, but that states with voters who want a specific policy are more likely to get it.         "
"62","That policy‐specific opinion is such a strong predictor of policy seems reassuring as to the ability of state government to reflect constituent will. Indeed, it suggests that the states should earn a rather respectable grade for the responsiveness portion of the democratic performance test. However, we have also uncovered a clear “democratic deficit”—states effectively translate majority opinion into policy only about half the time, a clear “failing” grade on the congruence test. This is true even when majorities are large and when salience is high, which raises significant questions about the democratic performance of state government.8"
"63","For aggregate congruence, salience and (some) institutional effects are far more important than interest group or partisan effects. That said, these forces do tell us in which ideological direction policy will “err” within each state when it does not match opinion majorities. It is not that conservative states have only conservative opinion majorities, and thus only liberal incongruence. Rather, they instead have too many conservative policies relative to their number of conservative opinion majorities. The ideological direction of incongruence correlates to the standard red‐state/blue‐state map. In states where voters are ideologically conservative, policy, when incongruent with opinion majorities, tends to be more conservative than preferred by the median voter on that policy (that is, incongruence occurs in the form of liberal opinion majorities and conservative policy). In liberal states, the opposite is true. Thus, states tend to “overshoot” relative to the median voter’s specific policy preferences. This leads to greater policy polarization than is warranted by such preferences, caused primarily by over‐“responsiveness” to voter ideology. The bottom line is polarized (ideologically sorted) state policy slates, relative to less polarized (ideologically mixed) opinion majorities.9 Perhaps this is a consequence of a well‐ordered two‐party system, in which the parties form distinct blocs.         "
"64","Clearly, responsiveness to voter ideology is still an important form of responsiveness, even if we might think responsiveness to policy‐specific opinion preferable at least some of the time. State lawmakers might be doing the best they can to represent their constituents given insufficient information about preferences. Indeed, given the limits of specific responsiveness, overresponsiveness to ideology can sometimes be helpful, particularly when opinion majorities are in line with ideology. Of course, politicians could simply be satisfying their ideological base in spite of majority opinion. The median voter simply might not have sufficient intensity of opinion for some policies, so that politicians know they can shirk. Again, the two‐party system makes it more difficult to hold lawmakers accountable policy by policy. Finally, some policies may be easier to frame and defend to the public in symbolic or ideological terms, rather than policy‐specific terms."
"65","Institutional design can enhance responsiveness and congruence. We find that legislative professionalization has a strong, robust, and positive effect on both responsiveness and congruence. To the extent that professionalization leads to disadvantages such as insulation of legislators, this effect seems overridden by its responsiveness‐enhancing effects. Interestingly, some have pushed to roll back professionalization to punish unpopular legislators and in response to perceived state government failure (e.g., a ballot measure in California called the “Citizen Legislature Act” to make its legislature part‐time). Ironically, then, concerns about shortfalls in government performance may lead to greater shortfalls in government performance. Indeed, we find that the length of legislative sessions is the key component of professionalization (so that the California ballot measure would be particularly counterproductive). The only other institutional feature found to increase responsiveness and congruence is term limits. On the other hand, the citizen initiative (even at high levels of use) and an elected judiciary do not seem to do much for majoritarianism. The term limits effect may be an indirect effect of the citizen initiative, to the extent that term limits are almost never enacted in states without the initiative.10"
"66","The opinion‐policy relationship is also affected by interest group balance, but our policy‐specific interest group scores show that the effects are not black‐and‐white. Interest groups can enable or block opinion majorities. Because of this and because the balance of interest groups is the key, interest groups have only a small impact on the net amount of incongruence and net number of liberal policies. They do have a disparate impact across states: whereas some states would have higher congruence without interest groups, other states would have lower congruence.         "
"67","Finally, our analysis has important implications for our assessment of American federalism. Some argue that state governments, being closer to the people, are better able to tailor public policy to the preferences of their constituents than is the national government. Allowing states to set policy thus accommodates heterogeneous preferences across jurisdictions and improves aggregate welfare. The strength of this claim, however, rests upon the heretofore untested assumption that state elected officials effectively match policy to local opinion. We show clear evidence to the contrary. While a strong relationship between state ideology and government policy is certainly suggestive of of good democratic performance as well as suggesting federalism is welfare improving, we show that even this strong relationship can mask potentially significant shortcomings in statehouse democracy.11"
