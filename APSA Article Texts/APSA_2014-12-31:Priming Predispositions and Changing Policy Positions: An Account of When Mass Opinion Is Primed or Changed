"1","Priming research has often paid scant attention to attitude crystallization. Yet the extent to which political communications prime or change mass opinion should depend in large part on how crystallized citizens’ particular opinions are. Attitude crystallization, as noted by Sears (1975, 1983, 1993), generally refers to (1) the stability of an attitude over time, (2) the constraint or consistency between an attitude and different but linked objects, and (3) the power or influence that attitude exerts over new evaluations. Petty and Krosnick (1995) similarly describe “strong attitudes” as those that persist over time, resist new information, impact information processing, and guide behavior.5 By definition, then, crystallized/strong attitudes are unlikely to change in response to mass communications. Crystallized/strong attitudes should, however, often be primed by new information since they bias information processing, influence new evaluations, and guide behavior. Weaker attitudes, on the other hand, are more likely to be changed than primed because they are inherently malleable.         "
"2","Political and social attitudes vary substantially in their levels of crystallization and strength. “Individual attitudes,” according to Sears (1983, 83), “can therefore be thought of as falling somewhere along a dimension of affective strength running from an ‘enduring’ or ‘symbolic’ predisposition to a non‐attitude.” These enduring predispositions are presumably acquired during preadult socialization from intense communication flows, obtain their affective strength from attachments to easily identifiable symbols (e.g., political parties, social groups, and the nation‐state), and persist rather stably throughout the life cycle (Sears 1983, 1993). This early learning yields such strongly held predispositions as party identification, racial prejudice, ethnic/religious identities, and basic values (Sears 1993, 2001). Attitudes rooted in these predispositions also tend to be crystallized (Boninger, Krosnick, et al. 1995; Converse and Markus 1979), whereas attitudes that are not salient during childhood, and attitudes that are difficult to connect to relevant symbols and/or predispositions, tend to fall on the nonattitude side of the crystallization spectrum (Sears and Levy 2003).         "
"3","Since predispositions learned early typically persist rather stably throughout the life cycle, citizens are not expected to change their underlying predispositions to those championed by preferred political figures.6 Individuals should change their opinions of political figures to maintain consistency with their predispositions, though, as crystallized attitudes heavily condition the influence of new information on subsequent political evaluations (Bartels 2008; Krosnick 1988; Petty and Krosnick 1995; Sears 1993; Zaller 1992).         "
"4","Most public policy preferences stand in stark contrast with these crystallized predispositions. Students of public opinion, in fact, have long shown that a substantial majority of Americans lack well‐developed beliefs about public policies. Instead, mass issue preferences are largely informed by cues that citizens take from groups and politicians who share their values (Berinsky 2009; Cohen 2003; Converse 1964; Laymen and Carsey 2002; Levendusky 2009; Lupia 1994; Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991; Zaller 1992). Unlike predispositions, then, public policy preferences are heavily influenced by elite communications (Zaller 1992). This line of research, therefore, suggests that an influx of attention to specific issues should result in issue opinion change, not issue priming. More specifically, prominent campaign issues like governmental health insurance in the 2012 presidential election should cause voters to alter their less crystallized policy positions to comport with those advocated by their chosen candidates; few, however, are expected to change votes in accordance with their weakly held issue preferences.         "
"5","To be sure, there are some notable exceptions to this broad contention that campaign and media content tends to prime predispositions and change policy positions. Issues deeply rooted in racial and moral/religious predispositions, such as race‐targeted policies and abortion, exhibit unusually high stability for policy preferences (Converse and Markus 1979; Kinder and Sanders 1996). We might, therefore, expect campaign and media content to prime those crystallized issue preferences. Similarly, weaker predispositions such as ideological self‐placement should be more likely to change in response to campaign content than highly crystallized ones like partisanship, group‐based attitudes, and religiosity.7 For the most part, though, predispositions are generally crystallized and mass policy preferences are not. The upshot of those differences, by my account, is predisposition priming and policy position change in response to political communications.         "
"6","Disentangling priming from opinion change requires panel surveys that interview the same respondents before and after an issue becomes salient. For, as noted above, the phenomenon whereby voters adjust their underlying opinions about issues to comport with their vote intentions can increase correlations between the two for reasons that have nothing to do with priming. If, however, the impact of previously measured attitudes—that is, measures from earlier panel waves conducted before new information could have caused citizens to change their underlying views—increases in response to campaign and media content, then the results support the priming hypothesis. Lenz (2009, 2012) effectively uses measures from prior panel waves to show that earlier vote preferences predict changes in issue preferences more powerfully than earlier issues influence changes in candidate evaluations. Greater attention to specific issues, therefore, generally changes rather than primes mass policy preferences.         "
"7","There are important instances of predisposition priming in panel studies not referenced by Lenz (2009), though. (1) Sears and Funk's (1999) test of how antiblack sentiments, as measured in the 1940 wave of the Terman Longitudinal Study, affected panelists’ partisan and ideological identifications in 1940, 1950, 1960, and 1977 is especially relevant. Much like the account proffered above, these authors argue that Americans’ well‐crystallized racial attitudes should have been primed by the new partisan division over race‐related issues that emerged in the 1960s. Consistent with that expectation, Sears and Funk show that panelists’ feelings about “Negroes” in 1940 had a noticeably larger impact on their political orientations in 1977 than they had in prior panel waves.         "
"8","Several additional studies, which utilize measurements from prior panel waves, provide further evidence that predispositions are often primed by new information. These results include the following:"
"9","(2) The 9/11 terrorist attacks prime 2000 measures of ethnocentrism—a predisposition that exhibits “impressive” over‐time stability (Kinder and Kam 2009)—in panelists' 2002 assessments of George W. Bush (Kam and Kinder 2007). (3) Hillygus and Jackman's (2003) panel results similarly suggest that precampaign measurements of party identification—a predisposition considered to be the most crystallized of all political attitudes (Campbell et al. 1960; Converse 1964; Converse and Markus 1979; Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002)—were primed by party conventions and debates during the 2000 presidential cycle. (4/5) Precampaign measures of partisanship were also activated in Americans’ vote choices over the course of the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns (Sides and Vavreck 2013; Tesler and Sears 2010), with the results in this article's supporting information showing that partisan activation was more prevalent than partisan change during the 2008 campaign. (6/7) Relatedly, prior work (Tesler 2014; Tesler and Sears 2010) shows that precampaign measures of racial resentment—another highly stable predisposition (Henry and Sears 2009; Kinder and Sanders 1996)—became much more important determinants of John McCain and Mitt Romney favorability ratings over the course of the 2008 and 2012 election years after their presidential campaigns were increasingly contrasted with Barack Obama's racialized candidacy; (8) racial resentment, as measured in 2011, also became a stronger predictor of 2012 primary support for Newt Gingrich immediately after his contention that African Americans “should demand jobs, not food stamps” was subjected to intense media scrutiny (Tesler 2012a); (9) and this 2011 measure of racial conservatism was experimentally activated in Romney evaluations by his campaign's August 2012 welfare ad (Tesler 2012b). Recent experiments provide even more evidence of racial priming, as (10) pretreatment assessments of white identity were activated in Obama disapproval by manipulating racial threat (Hutchings et al. 2011), and (11) experimentally drawing attention to charges of racist opposition against Obama activated pretreatment measures of old‐fashioned racism in his presidential disapproval ratings (Tesler 2014). (12) Finally, Lenz (2007) shows that 1986 measures of moral traditionalism were primed by the 1987 revelation of Gary Hart's sex scandal with Donna Rice (see also Stoker 1993).         "
"10","A much different story emerges for issue priming in panel studies, however. Lenz (2012) examines 11 examples in which the correlations between policy positions and political evaluations increased in repeated cross‐sectional data. Yet his results show that those priming effects disappear in all but one case when using measurements from panel waves conducted before an issue became especially prominent.8 So, while there are several notable examples of predisposition priming in panel studies, there is almost no prior evidence that less crystallized issue preferences are primed by new information.         "
"11","Based on both theoretical expectations and the results from prior panel studies, we should expect media, campaigns, and notable events to prime such predispositions as partisanship, group‐based affect/antagonism, and religious/moral beliefs and change less crystallized policy positions. I test this hypothesis below with five new cases in which attention to specific aspects in political life could have either primed or changed Americans’ underlying attitudes."
"12","These studies estimate multiple models from the data. The first model examines the influence of attitudes measured before an issue became prominent on both pre‐ and postprominence dependent variables. Study 1, for instance, explores the influence of attitudes about Catholics—measured in the 1956 wave of the 1956–60 ANES panel before John F. Kennedy's religion made Catholicism a major issue during his campaign for president—on vote choice in the 1956 and 1960 presidential elections. This method effectively rules out the possibility that the enhanced over‐time influence of various considerations on political evaluations were brought about by opinion change since attitudes were assessed before events could have prompted respondents to alter them."
"13","Those results, however, do not rule out the possibility that some citizens might also change their attitudes in response to new information. I estimate two simple change models, therefore, to test how much candidate evaluations changed in accordance with prior attitudes and how much these attitudes changed to comport with prior presidential preferences. If my account is accurate, then prior predispositions should predict changes in candidate preferences more powerfully than prior candidate preferences predicted changes in those strongly held attitudes. Moreover, prior candidate preferences should predict changes in policy positions more powerfully than prior issue positions predicted changes in presidential preferences."
"14","All of those models include controls for such relevant factors as party identification, ideological self‐placement (when available), and standard demographics; results from the models are presented graphically to ease interpretation, with full tables, variable coding, and confidence bands provided in the supporting information.9"
"15","“When a candidate is seen as standing for or against a certain social group,” according to Kinder and Dale‐Riddle's theory of group‐based voting (2012, 23), “voters will be attracted or driven away, depending on their attitude toward the group in question.” A candidate's most visible signal of social group sympathy is perhaps group membership itself, especially when his or her identity is the subject of intense media scrutiny (Kinder and Dale‐Riddle 2012). Sustained attention to candidates’ social identities, then, should be ripe for activating group‐based considerations in Americans’ voting behavior.         "
"16","By this account, we would expect that attitudes toward Catholics were primed by John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign to become the country's first Roman Catholic president. After all, Kennedy's religious affiliation received tremendous media attention during both the 1960 primary and general election campaigns (Kinder and Dale‐Riddle 2012; White 1961)—so much so that 64% of the American public could correctly identify Kennedy as Catholic by February 1960, with that number jumping to 84% in July, and 92% in the ANES's pre‐election survey. Only 36% of Americans, by contrast, could correctly identify John Kerry as a Catholic in August 2004.10 That knowledge seemed to be on the top of many voters’ heads too. Nearly 40% of ANES respondents voluntarily introduced Kennedy's religion into the conversation before any direct probing by interviewers (Converse et al. 1961). “Since this figure certainly understates the proportion of the population for whom religion was a salient concern,” Converse et al. (1961, 276) conclude that “it testifies rather eloquently to the importance of the factor in conscious political motivations during the fall campaign.”         "
"17","It is not particularly surprising, then, that prior studies found religion to be a major factor in 1960 presidential voting. Catholics and Protestants were more divided in their general election vote choices that year than they were at any time before or have been any time since (Converse et al. 1961; Kinder and Dale‐Riddle 2012). Moreover, this Catholic‐Protestant voting schism was most pronounced between Catholics who identified strongly with their religion and Protestants who distrusted Catholic groups (Kinder and Dale‐Riddle 2012). These prior analyses, however, do not address how much stronger the effect of attitudes toward Catholics were in 1960 than other election years. Nor do they test whether such attitudes changed in response to Kennedy's presidential campaign. In other words, did the 1960 campaign prime or change attitudes toward Catholics?         "
"18","My account of priming and opinion change predicts the latter. Religion has long set the standard for preadult socialization and attitude stability (Green et al. 2002; Hyman 1959). In fact, most panel studies like the 1956–60 ANES do not even ask about religious affiliation again in later survey waves because religion is presumed to be so crystallized (Green et al. 2002). Like other group‐based attitudes, feelings toward prominent religious groups are also well grounded in ethnocentrism (Kam and Kinder 2012). With feelings toward religious groups deeply rooted in both religious and ethnocentric predispositions, we would expect those attitudes to be relatively crystallized. It is not surprising, then, that Catholic Church thermometer ratings continue to exhibit substantially more individual‐level stability than most policy preferences, even in a modern era where religious divisions are not nearly as salient as they were when Kennedy was running for president.11 Those crystallized attitudes, by my account, should not have changed in response to Kennedy's candidacy. We should, however, expect that citizens changed their vote choices in accordance with their underlying feelings toward Catholics since Kennedy's religion was a strong signal that his presidency might be particularly sympathetic to that group.         "
"19","Consistent with that expectation, the first panel of Figure 1 suggests that Kennedy's religious background powerfully primed attitudes toward Catholics in the 1960 election. That display graphs the relationship between attitudes toward Catholic groups, as measured in the 1956 wave of the 1956–60 ANES, and presidential vote choice in 1956 and 1960 among the 794 panelists who voted in both elections. As can be seen, there was hardly any impact of attitudes toward Catholics on 1956 vote preferences. Figure 1, however, shows that this 1956 measure of Catholic‐group trust was a powerful predictor of the exact same respondents’ vote choices in the 1960 presidential election. After controlling for party identification and standard demographic factors, the display indicates that changing from distrusting Catholic groups to trusting them increased average Americans’ support for the Democratic candidate by roughly 10 percentage points in 1956 and over 50 points in 1960—a highly significant difference (p < .001; see Table A1 of the supporting information).

"22","Source: 1956–60 ANES.                     "
"23","The first panel of Figure 1, however, does not tell us how many panelists changed sides from the previous presidential election to comport with their feelings toward Catholics; nor does it tell us how many changed their minds about Catholics because the new leader of the Democratic Party was a member of that group. The bottom two panels of Figure 1 indicate this contest decisively favored changing sides. The first of those two panels discloses that 1956 attitudes toward Catholics were a highly significant (T = 8.1) predictor of change in Democratic presidential support from 1956 to 1960. All else being equal, panelists who trusted Catholic groups in 1956 were nearly 40 points more likely to change to Kennedy than those who distrusted them. The final panel of Figure 1, however, shows that there was virtually no aggregate change in attitudes about Catholics from 1956 to 1960. Moreover, prior vote preferences had no influence over the individual‐level change that occurred.         "
"24","All told, then, the evidence demonstrates that Kennedy's religious background primed Americans’ underlying attitudes toward Catholics in presidential voting without changing them. Those results therefore support the contention that predispositions such as group‐based loyalties are primed, rather than changed, by events and communications that make them salient."
"25","A candidate need not embody group membership to activate group‐specific considerations. Candidates’ prominent policy proposals provide another visible signal about whether they will or will not be sympathetic to specific social groups while in office. An influx of attention to issue positions that disproportionately help or hurt notable social groups is therefore also expected to activate group‐based predispositions in candidate evaluations (e.g., Sears and Funk 1999 with racial attitudes).         "
"26","Republicans’ anti–gay marriage efforts in 2004 fit well into that paradigm. A series of events in February 2004, which included both the Massachusetts Supreme Court's ruling that gay marriage bans were unconstitutional and the mayor of San Francisco's order to grant marriage licenses to same‐sex couples, catapulted the issue to the lead news story in the country (Fiorina 2006, 111).         "
"27","President Bush quickly aligned himself against those liberalizing events in a February 24, 2004, televised speech from the White House, which called upon Congress “to promptly pass, and to send to the states for ratification, an amendment to our Constitution defining and protecting marriage as a union of man and woman as husband and wife.”12"
"28","That proposed Federal Marriage Amendment eventually came up short in a July 2004 Senate vote. Yet the appearance of anti–gay marriage ballot initiatives in 11 states ensured that the issue would remain salient throughout the election year."
"29","After every one of those initiatives passed, many speculated that the president's strong opposition to same‐sex marriage made the difference in his reelection bid. The popular media narrative about gay marriage's crucial role in reelecting Bush has been criticized by political scientists, though, who point out that he did not systematically outperform his 2000 vote tallies in the gay marriage initiative states (Fiorina 2006). Yet the absence of aggregate evidence in these studies does not preclude the possibility that attitudes about gays were more closely related to public support for George W. Bush in 2004 than they had been in the past. It could be, for instance, that the president's well‐publicized antigay position increased his support among Americans harboring homophobic attitudes while diminishing his support among those who felt warmer toward gays and lesbians.         "
"30","Even if the prominence of gay marriage in 2004 made homophobia a stronger correlate of Bush support than it had been beforehand, we would still not know whether that enhanced relationship was caused by priming or opinion change. Much like attitudes about Catholics in the previous study, there is reason to suspect that priming was more prevalent than opinion change in this case. As mentioned above, attitudes like homophobia that are rooted in religious and moral predispositions tend to be much more crystallized than policy preferences. Moreover, Kinder and Kam (2009) show that attitudes toward gays and lesbians are also well grounded in a broader ethnocentrism. Consequently, thermometer ratings of homosexuals exhibited substantially more individual‐level stability than policy preferences in the 1990s.13 That relative individual‐level crystallization of affect toward gays and lesbians, by my account, suggests that this attitude was more likely to have been primed than changed after Republican efforts to ban gay marriage during the 2004 campaign were subjected to intense media scrutiny.         "
"31","Figure 2 tests that expectation with data from the 2000–2002–2004 ANES Panel Study, which fortuitously asked respondents to rate homosexuals on a 0–100 thermometer scale in all three panel waves. The first panel examines the influence of the 2000 thermometer rating on Bush vote choice in 2000 and 2004 among the 591 panelists who voted in both elections. That figure suggests that homophobia was primed by the 2004 campaign. After controlling for our base model variables, the display shows that changing from the coldest to the warmest gay thermometer rating decreased Bush's vote share by nearly 25 points in 2000 and 50 points in 2004. Yet it is important to note that this increase in effects was not statistically significant.         "

"
"34","Source: 2000–2002–2004 ANES.                     "
"35","The test illustrated in the second panel of Figure 2, however, yielded significant (p = .02; see Table A3) and robust priming effects. That display graphs the relationship between panelists' 2002 gay thermometer ratings and presidential approval in 2002 and 2004. After controlling for partisanship, ideology, and demographics, moving from the coldest to the warmest gay thermometer rating had a slight, but nonsignificant, positive association with Bush approval in 2002. That same change in 2002 attitudes, however, substantially lowered support for Bush in 2004. It appears, then, that the president's visible opposition to same‐sex marriage over the course of the 2004 election year activated attitudes toward gays and lesbians in mass evaluations of his presidency.         "
"36","The bottom two panels also suggest that this priming effect occurred without changing panelists’ underlying attitudes toward gays and lesbians. The third panel of Figure 2, for example, shows that 2002 thermometer ratings were a significant negative predictor of presidential approval change between 2002 and 2004 (p = .002). All else being equal, panelists who rated gays and lesbians 100 on the thermometer grew nearly 25 points less supportive of Bush between 2002 and 2004 than those who rated them 0. The fourth and final panel of the display, however, indicates that there was hardly any aggregate change in gay thermometer ratings between 2002 and 2004. More importantly, Bush's 2002 approval rating failed to predict what little individual‐level change occurred over that 2‐year time period.         "
"37","Once again, then, this case suggests that predisposition priming is more prevalent than predisposition change when political communications make them salient."
"38","President Obama's highly publicized May 9, 2012, announcement that he supports same‐sex marriage might be expected to prime attitudes toward gays and lesbians in presidential approval even more powerfully than George W. Bush's 2004 opposition. Unlike Bush, who was merely refocusing attention on his gay marriage beliefs, Obama's announcement represented a historic position change. That “evolution” to become the first sitting president to openly support gay marriage could have prompted Americans to change their attitudes toward his presidency to comport with their underlying homophobic (or lack thereof) attitudes, and/or change their feelings about gays and lesbians in accordance with prior feelings toward the president. For reasons just discussed in the previous study, we should expect priming to be more prevalent than opinion change in response to Obama's announcement."
"39","Fortunately, some unique data collected by YouGov for the 2012 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project (CCAP; Jackman et al. 2012) allow us to confidently discern whether Obama's announcement primed underlying attitudes toward gays and lesbians. The CCAP began with a massive profile wave of YouGov panelists in December 2011. It then reinterviewed a different nationally representative sample of these panelists each week of the campaign. The upshot is a weekly two‐wave panel of 1,000 individuals. We can leverage that design to assess the impact of 2011 gay thermometer ratings, which were assessed in the profile, on Obama's weekly 2012 job approval ratings. If my priming account is accurate, there should be a significant increase in the effects of gay thermometer ratings on presidential approval immediately after Obama's support for marriage equality."
"40","That expectation is borne out in Figure 3. The figure displays the effects of moving from the coldest to the warmest rating of gays and lesbians on Obama's five‐category approval ratings (net of partisanship, ideology, demographics, and 2011 Obama approval) before, during, and after his same‐sex marriage announcement received so much attention. As can be seen, this change in 2011 attitudes had a small but significant effect on Obama's approval in pooled CCAP surveys conducted between January 1 and May 5, 2012. That preannouncement influence of gay thermometer ratings more than tripled, though, in the two weekly CCAP surveys conducted immediately after Obama's May 9 position change—a highly significant difference in effect sizes (p < .001; see Table A5).         "

"43","Source: 2011–12 CCAP.                     "
"44","The results in Figure 3 also demonstrate the flip side of priming. The priming hypothesis implies that communication effects decay as the cognitive accessibility of primed considerations fades (Gerber et al. 2011, 148). Obama's announcement dominated the headlines for a few days, but that media attention quickly gave way to other campaign events (see Figure A5 of the supporting information for media content trends). Consequently, Figure 3 shows that the priming effects significantly receded (p < .001) as Obama's announcement was replaced by new information. Obama's statement primed underlying attitudes about gays and lesbians, then, but that significant priming effect decayed shortly after new events made other considerations salient.         "
"45","Along with decay, the CCAP's unique design allows us to test whether priming effects were most pronounced among respondents who felt strongly about gay rights. The CCAP's 2011 baseline fortuitously asked how important the issue of gay rights was for every respondent. Since personally important attitudes possess the four aforementioned features of attitude strength (Boninger, Krosnick, and Berent 1995; Boninger, Krosnick, et al. 1995), we would expect Obama's announcement to produce stronger priming effects among panelists who said gay rights were “very important.” Consistent with that expectation, the interaction coefficients for Thermometer × Announcement in Table 1 show that the priming effects of Obama's marriage equality announcement were most pronounced among panelists who thought gay rights were “very important.” All else being equal, the pre‐ to postannouncement relationship between the 2011 gay thermometer and Obama approval increased by 15% of the approval scale's range among this group—a significant difference in pre‐ to postannouncement effects (p = .01)—and about 4% to 6% among the remainder of the sample.         "
"46","The three‐way interaction coefficients in Table 1 go on to show that Obama's announcement produced a marginally significant stronger priming effect for panelists who thought gay rights were “very important” than it did for respondents who thought gay rights were somewhat/not very important (p < .10). This is likely a conservative test of attitude importance, too, since respondents’ gay thermometer ratings were highly correlated (r = .49) with their perceptions of gay rights’ importance. Moreover, the results presented in this article's supporting information similarly show that partisan activation over the course of the 2008 presidential campaign was significantly more powerful for strong partisans than weak identifiers (see Figure A8). Consistent with our theoretical expectations, then, it appears that attitude strength/crystallization is an important moderator of priming effects.         "
"47","Unfortunately, the CCAP did not reasses thermometer ratings of gays and lesbians in its weekly panel surveys. Therefore, we cannot discern how much panelists’ underlying attitudes toward this group changed to comport with their previous support for Obama. Both our theoretical expectations and the results from the prior study, in which gay thermometer ratings were not changed by Republicans’ 2004 efforts to ban same‐sex marriage, suggest that few Americans altered their crystallized group‐based attitudes in accordance with Obama's position change."
"48","Unlike Obama's fleeting gay marriage announcement, some differences between major party candidates are persistently highlighted over prolonged periods of time (e.g., racial attitudes; Carmines and Stimson 1989).         "
"49","The two parties’ religious personas, for example, underwent substantial and sustained changes in recent decades. The increased influence of the religious right in GOP politics during the 1980s and 1990s, the growing polarization of partisan elites over moral issues like abortion, and the 1992 Democratic nomination of a morally “progressive” candidate in Bill Clinton, all helped establish Republicans as the more religious party (Fiorina 2006). As a result, several studies document an evolving relationship between religiosity—a predisposition typically measured by how much guidance respondents receive from religion and/or how often they attend religious services—and support for the Republican Party. Those enhanced over‐time correlations extended to partisanship and presidential vote choice, with both increasingly polarized by religious commitments since the 1980s (Campbell 2002; Fiorina 2006; Gelman 2010; Laymen 2001; Putnam and Campbell 2010).         "
"50","Priming and opinion change could have each contributed to that enhanced over‐time relationship in cross‐sectional data.14 Yet it seems unlikely that Americans would have dramatically altered their religious commitments to comport with their preexisting partisan preferences. As noted above, religion has long set the standard for preadult socialization and attitude stability. In keeping with that reputation, religiosity was one of the most stable predispositions in the 2006–08 General Social Survey Panel Study.15"
"51","Moreover, Sears and Henry (2008, 111) speculate that religiosity's unusually strong aggregate stability over one's college years may be the product of an even earlier and more profound socialization than other crystallized predispositions like party identification. We should expect from this established crystallization that Americans were primarily changing their candidate preferences over the past few decades to comport with their well‐crystalized religious predispositions rather than changing their underlying religious commitments in accordance with their previous political preferences.         "
"52","Figure 4 tests that expectation with the Youth‐Parent Socialization Study—a unique panel survey that reinterviewed over 900 respondents in both 1982 and 1997 who had been previously surveyed as high school seniors in 1965. The first panel in the figure displays the relationship between religious service attendance, as measured in the 1982 panel wave, and presidential vote choice in 1980 and 1996 among the 486 panelists who voted in both elections. As can be seen, there was hardly any impact of religiosity on panelists’ 1980 vote preferences. Yet this 1982 measure of religiosity was a highly significant predictor of the exact same panelists’ vote choices in the 1996 presidential election. After controlling for our base model variables, the display discloses that changing from never attending religious services to frequently attending them increased average panelists’ support for the Republican presidential candidate by 10 percentage points in 1980 and 30 points in 1996—a difference in effects approaching significance (p = .11). The second panel of the display shows a similarly sized increase in the effects of 1982 religious attendance on the relative thermometer ratings of recent Republican and Democratic presidential candidates from 1982 to 1997, though those differences in effects were statistically significant (p = .02; see Table A7).

"56","The bottom two displays of Figure 4 also suggest that this predisposition priming effect occurred without changing panelists’ underlying religiosity. The third panel, for example, shows that 1982 religiosity was a highly significant predictor of changing presidential support between the 1980 and 1996 presidential elections (p < .001). All else being equal, the most devout panelists were roughly 20 points less likely to change to the Democrats than their least observant counterparts. The fourth panel of the display, however, indicates that there was little aggregate change in church attendance among these panelists between 1982 and 1997. And, more importantly, 1980 presidential support did not predict individual‐level changes in religiosity during that time period.         "
"57","The results presented thus far suggest that predispositions, and crystallized attitudes strongly rooted in them, are often primed by new information. Yet, those findings test only half of the “priming predispositions and changing policy positions” account. For the theory to be valid, public policy debates should not prime weakly held issue preferences in candidate evaluations. Rather, as Lenz (2009, 2012) shows, Americans should change their policy positions to maintain consistency with their preferred presidential candidates when those issues are subjected to intense media scrutiny.         "
"58","Governmental health insurance and support for President Obama provide an ideal test of this argument. Health care reform was the defining issue of Barack Obama's first presidential term. The issue received so much attention that the debate over health care reform was one of the most reported on news stories in America every single week from early July 2009 through the remainder of the calendar year.16 As a result of the heavy media coverage, up to 49% of Americans reported following the health care reform debate “very closely” in 2009 (Pew Research Center 2009).         "
"59","Health care reform would go on to become the central policy issue in the 2012 campaign, too, with the leading Republican presidential challengers all vowing to repeal Obama's signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Of course, health care reform legislation was so closely linked to President Obama that the ACA is probably better known by its other name, “Obamacare.”"
"60","This close association between President Obama and health care reform could have primed Americans’ prior opinions about the government's proper role in providing health insurance. At the same time, however, the debate over health care reform may have also prompted Americans to change their issue opinions to maintain consistency with their earlier evaluations of Barack Obama. Once again, our expectations about whether priming or opinion change was more prevalent depend on how crystallized Americans’ underlying health care opinions were prior to the prolonged debate about Obamacare. But unlike our earlier examples, Americans did not have well‐crystallized beliefs about the government's role in providing health insurance before Obama became president. In fact, the test‐retest correlation between panelists’ support for government health insurance in the 2006–08 General Social Survey Panel Study was just .35. With most Americans lacking crystallized positions about governmental health insurance before the issue received so much attention, we would expect policy position change to have been more prevalent than issue priming during Obama's presidency."
"61","The analyses below test that expectation with an original panel survey commissioned during the 2012 campaign (Tesler et al. 2012).         "
"62","In July 2012, we reinterviewed a nationally representative subsample of 3,000 registered voters who completed the March 2008 wave of the original 2007–08 CCAP (Jackman and Vavreck 2008). Both of these panel waves contained an identical three‐category health care question about the government's proper role in providing health insurance. Both surveys also measured general election vote preference, with an Obama‐McCain item in March 2008 and an Obama‐Romney question in the 2012 reinterviews, nd both contained identical five‐category Obama favorability questions.         "
"63","Figure 5 utilizes those data to first test whether March 2008 government health care preferences were primed in 2012 support for Barack Obama. As can be seen, the top two displays show no priming effects whatsoever. March 2008 health care preferences had almost the exact same relationship with Obama vote intention and Obama favorability ratings during the 2012 campaign as they had before Barack Obama became the face of governmental health insurance. Interestingly, and also consistent with the priming predispositions account, March 2008 party identification was the only variable that became a significantly more powerful predictor of both 2012 Obama vote intention and Obama favorability than it had been in March 2008 (see Table A9)—a likely upshot of becoming his party's standard bearer after clinching the Democratic nomination in June 2008.

"

"67","The bottom two displays of Figure 5 further test whether Americans were more likely to change their 2008 support for governmental health insurance to comport with their earliest measured support for Barack Obama or vice versa. The third panel shows a slight but significant effect of 2008 health care preferences on changing support for Obama. That modest relationship, however, pales in comparison to the effect of March 2008 vote intention on changing support for government health care. The final panel of the display shows that respondents were nearly three times more likely to change their 2012 health care preferences to comport with their March 2008 vote intentions than to change their 2012 vote intentions to comport with their prior health care preferences. All else being equal, panelists who previously preferred McCain grew nearly 25 points less supportive of governmental health insurance between March 2008 and July 2012 than those who preferred Obama.         "
"68","It is important to note that the exact same pattern was found with public support for top‐bracket tax increases in the 2008–12 CCAP reinterviews—another prominent issue during the 2012 campaign that Americans did not have well‐developed opinions about prior to Obama's presidency (Bartels 2005).17 That is, tax policy preferences were much more likely to change than be primed during Obama's presidency. Unlike our earlier results, then, it appears that Americans’ less crystallized issue positions are rarely primed, but frequently changed, by new information—a result consistent with the priming predispositions and changing policy positions account of when mass opinion is primed and changed.         "
"69","Taken together, the theoretical expectations, results from previous panel studies, and findings presented above from our new cases all suggest that predispositions are often primed by political communications. The results from these cases also suggest that crystallized attitudes remain mostly unchanged even after communications make them salient. Those findings stand in stark contrast to both recent research (Lenz 2009, 2012) and our Study 5 results, which show policy preferences are more likely to change than be primed by new information.         "
"70","To be sure, these results do not imply that priming will occur every time politicians appeal to crystallized predispositions. I failed to find significant partisan activation, for example, in panel studies conducted before and after the 2000 and 2004 presidential nominating conventions despite the fact that these events are designed to make party identification salient.18 Nor does it mean that the public will alter their issue positions in accordance with prior beliefs whenever a particular fiscal issue becomes salient. And, as shown in Table 1, opinions can be primed among different segments of the population (see also Carsey and Laymen 2006; Dancey and Goren 2010). Generally speaking, though, the more crystallized an attitude is, the more likely it will be primed, rather than changed, by political communications.19"
"71","This conclusion that media and campaign content tends to prime predispositions and change policy positions has important implications for both electoral politics and those who research it. The priming hypothesis has received so much scholarly interest in large part because its contention that political communications possess the capacity to alter the standards of public evaluations opens the door for campaigns and the media to affect the overall popularity of incumbents and candidates for elected office. Many in the field have become skeptical of that assumption, however, after Lenz (2009, 2012) convincingly demonstrated that instances previously interpreted as issue priming were actually issue opinion change.         "
"72","My exposition of the evidence suggests that such skepticism is both warranted and premature. Enhanced relationships in repeated cross‐sectional data between vote intention and prominent campaign issues like governmental health insurance should be subjected to the utmost scrutiny. For, as Lenz's (2009, 2012) findings demonstrate, and Figure 5 further confirms, attention to public policies that Americans do not have well‐developed opinions about generally leads to policy position change, not issue priming. We should be much more confident, however, that increased over‐time effects of predispositions in response to political communications were primarily caused by priming.         "
"73","Take, for example, the extensive literature on racial priming (see Mendelberg 2008 for a review). Based upon my account, voters would not have altered their long‐standing attitudes toward African Americans simply because recent presidential candidates employed racial appeals. Instead, the increased effects of racial attitudes on presidential preferences found in response to such campaign content (Kinder and Sanders 1996; Mendelberg 2001; Valentino 1999; Valentino, Hutchings, and White 2002; Valentino and Sears 2005) were likely produced by citizens changing their opinions about presidential candidates to maintain consistency with crystallized racial predispositions. This same reasoning applies to increased over‐time effects of other predispositions like partisanship, ethnocentrism, religiosity, and moral beliefs as well.         "
"74","From a methodological standpoint, then, researchers need not utilize panel data in tests of priming. To be sure, it is always best to conduct such tests with measures from prior panel waves taken before new information could have prompted individuals to change their underlying attitudes (or lack thereof). Yet, in the typical absence of such ideal data, researchers should still look for priming in repeated cross‐sectional data when testing for increased effects of crystallized predispositions in response to political communications. Those effects, according to my account, will result much more from predisposition priming than predisposition change."
"75","The results above have potentially important normative implications too. The findings presented suggest that there are significant limitations on the power of partisan appeals to change Americans’ underlying attitudes. Campaign appeals, as Lenz shows, exert a strong influence on Americans’ issue opinions. Yet party‐sponsored communication does not run roughshod over all political attitudes. Appeals to deeply rooted predispositions, in fact, lead more voters to change their candidates than to change their attitudes. Those results may, therefore, alleviate some prominent concerns about public opinion and democratic accountability. Bartels (2003), for example, is largely pessimistic about what the lack of crystallized issue preferences means for a liberal Democratic theory premised on the notion that citizens have meaningful opinions about government and policy. Lenz (2012, 19) similarly concludes that “at least on policy issues, democracy appears to be inverted: instead of politicians following the will of the people, the people seem to be following the will of politicians.” The results presented above suggest that those concerns may be overstated, though. For citizens can and will hold their leaders accountable if and when politicians take positions out of step with their constituents’ more strongly held predispositions.         "
