"1","Although it is typically desirable for public resources to be allocated based on need or efficiency, there is now a widespread consensus that in fact political criteria frequently play a central role in allocation decisions. In particular, a now vast body of work shows that public resources in a variety of contexts are distributed along partisan lines (e.g., Berry, Burden, and Howell 2010; Brollo and Nannicini 2012; Dahlberg and Johnson 2002; Diaz‐Cayeros, Estévez, and Magaloni 2016; Jensenius and Chhibber 2016; Levitt and Snyder 1995; Rodden and Wilkinson 2005; Stokes 2005; Stokes et al. 2013; See Golden and Min 2013 for a summary). Yet, despite this widespread evidence of partisan criteria shaping distribution, the possible explanations for these biases have not been fully explored. Specifically, existing studies have focused primarily on two main explanations for such biases. The first centers on the motivations of politicians to cater to voters who are supportive of their party (i.e., core supporter logic). The second centers on the motivations of politicians to target intergovernmental transfers to representatives at lower levels of government who share their partisan affiliation and can then claim credit for spending the resources they receive from higher levels of government (i.e., credit claiming logic). Both arguments suggest that the partisan allocation of pork is motivated by the desire of politicians to benefit certain groups of ordinary citizens who will in turn be motivated to vote for the politician who is seen to be providing these benefits.         "
"2","While each of the above logics is plausible and empirically supported, the goal of this research is to develop and test an alternative, though complementary, explanation to account for partisan biases in the allocation of public resources. This alternative explanation posits that in addition to being used to directly sway the votes of ordinary citizens, politicians also often distribute pork with the goal of securing the cooperation of political elites at lower levels of government (i.e., elite cooperation logic). Since state or local representatives often exert control over the government machinery at their level, the elite co‐operaton logic builds on the premise that the cooperation and assistance of these lower‐level representatives in implementing development projects could often prove valuable to national politicians. In turn, the pork allocated by national politicians could not only offer lower‐level representatives opportunities to engage in rent seeking but also, consistent with previous work on clientelism (e.g., Auerbach 2016; Stokes et al. 2013; Szwarcberg 2015), could offer lower‐level representatives the ability to grant targeted favors to individuals within their network who act as their “brokers.” National politicians should thus, the logic suggests, target pork to constituencies of co‐partisans at lower levels of government under conditions that would help them secure their partisan colleagues' future cooperation in the implementation of local development projects. Meanwhile, their partisan colleagues should be able to use the pork they receive from national politicians at least in part to offer targeted rewards to specific individuals in their political networks.         "
"3","The implications of this elite cooperation logic are tested using detailed data on projects sanctioned by members of parliament (MPs) in India under a scheme known as the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS), which grants a fixed annual allotment to MPs to be spent on development within their constituencies. These data are useful for testing the argument since they allow for a focus on the characteristics of project proposals (rather than project implementation) that are outcomes of an individual legislator's efforts (rather than outcomes of group decision making). Thus, they shed clear light on individual politicians' motivations behind targeting. At the same time, while previous studies have emphasized the importance of voter characteristics in influencing constituency fund allocations both in India and elsewhere (e.g., Hicken and Ravanilla 2015; Jensenius and Chhibber 2016; Keefer and Khemani 2009), this article shows how the characteristics of representatives at lower levels of government also significantly shape these allocations.         "
"4","The data used in the present study consist of over 70,000 public works projects proposed between 1999 and 2014 spread over 204 national parliamentary constituencies in seven states in North India.1 India has a parliamentary system of government at both the national and state levels. The head of government at the state level is the chief minister, whose position is analogous to that of a prime minister. Members of the lower house of the national parliament (MPs) are directly elected from single‐member “parliamentary” constituencies. Each Indian state has a state legislative assembly whose members (members of the legislative assembly, or MLAs) are directly elected from single‐member “assembly” constituencies. To examine the phenomenon of co‐partisan elite targeting, the analysis focuses on how the characteristics of projects proposed by a national legislator or MP are shaped by the partisanship of the MLAs who represent the smaller assembly constituencies that fall within the MP's larger parliamentary constituency.         "
"5","Since the relationship between partisan alignment between the MLA and MP and targeting could be confounded by a range of possible factors, this study makes use of a quasi‐experiment relying on close races in which an MLA candidate belonging to the local MP's party just won or just lost the most recent state election. In particular, a regression discontinuity (RD) design relying on these close races is used to identify the causal effect of partisan alignment between the MLA and MP on the characteristics of projects proposed under the MPLADS. Using this RD design, the article examines four hypotheses designed to test the argument that a key motivation for MPs in targeting resources to co‐partisan MLAs is to win over the MLAs' cooperation when it comes to the implementation of development projects. The results confirm all four of these hypotheses, thereby providing robust evidence to support the elite cooperation logic advanced in the present research. Moreover, since the RD design helps to rule out the possibility that the evidence of favoritism toward co‐partisan MLAs is actually driven by favoritism toward co‐partisan voters, the use of this method increases confidence that the results are not driven by the alternative logics emphasized in the existing literature on distributive politics."
"6","The key contribution of this research is thus to develop and test the elite cooperation logic—an explanation for partisan biases in resource allocation that has received little scholarly attention in previous studies both within and outside the Indian context. Indeed, although it has been documented across a range of countries that politicians at higher‐level governments seek to systematically target spending to co‐partisans at lower levels of government, previous studies have largely explained these patterns using either the “core supporter” or the “credit claiming” logics (e.g., Brollo and Nannicini 2012; Dahlberg and Johnson 2002; Larcinese, Rizzo, and Testa 2006; Migueis 2013; Rodden and Wilkinson 2005; Solé‐Ollé and Sorribas‐Navarro 2008; Weitz‐Shapiro 2006).         "
"7","In developing and testing the elite cooperation logic, this research contributes an alternative framework that should prove useful for understanding distributive politics not only in India but also in other multilevel systems‐such as Brazil, Mexico, or Indonesia‐ where subnational governments play a role in the implementation of national programs or policy and where clientelism is prevalent (e.g., Allen 2015; Cornelius 2000; Magaloni, Diaz‐Cayeros, and Estévez 2007; Samuels 2000). Moreover, while previous studies show evidence of co‐partisan elite targeting in the context of intergovernmental transfers, the elite cooperation logic illuminates why co‐partisan elite targeting might occur in such contexts even when it comes to resources that do not take the form of intergovernmental transfers. Thus, the logic suggests that subnational incumbents play a much more important role in shaping the allocation of public resources than has been previously recognized in the literature.         "
"8","The present study also contributes to the literature on clientelism, which has long recognized that patron–client relationships are often sustained through political machines that have a pyramid‐like structure, extending from “the summits of national politics down to the municipal level” (Kitschelt 2000, 849). Recent work has greatly advanced our understanding of how these machines work by shedding light on the question of how party leaders ensure the cooperation of brokers (e.g., Stokes et al. 2013; Szwarcberg 2015). However, while existing work largely focuses on brokers at the grassroots level, the present study sheds light on the vertical links within parties between national and state legislators.         "
"9","In turn, this focus on state legislators‐as opposed to grassroots actors‐ is theoretically important because state legislators are typically both clients as well as patrons. Indeed, the results of the present study are consistent with the possibility that state legislators act as clients of their co‐partisan local MPs, showing in particular that MPs allocate resources to state legislators from their party in a manner consistent with the goal of obtaining the state legislators' future cooperation and that state legislators indeed provide this cooperation by improving the implementation of public works projects in the run‐up to the MPs' election. At the same time, this study offers suggestive evidence that these state legislators also acted as patrons to lower‐level brokers in their constituency by helping to target benefits to specific individuals within their constituency in the period immediately after a state election."
"10","Thus far, there have been two main explanations for partisan biases in resource allocation in the literature. The first set of explanations seeks to account for why the distribution of resources is shaped by the partisan affiliation of voters. In particular, inspired by some influential theories (e.g. Cox and McCubbins 1986; Dixit and Londregan 1996), several studies have built on the core supporter logic to argue that politicians seek to allocate resources with the motive of swaying weakly supportive “swing” voters or of encouraging already loyal “core” supporters to turn out (e.g., Jensenius and Chhibber 2016; Nichter 2008; Stokes 2005; Vaishnav and Sircar 2010; Weitz‐Shapiro 2006).         "
"11","The second set of explanations seeks to account for why higher‐level governments target intergovernmental transfers to lower‐level governments whose representatives share their partisan affiliation (e.g., Brollo and Nannicini 2012; Dahlberg and Johnson 2002; Migueis 2013; Rodden and Wilkinson 2005; Solé‐Ollé and Sorribas‐Navarro 2008). These studies explain such targeting primarily by arguing that incumbents at lower levels of government are able to claim credit among ordinary voters for the spending of grants that they receive from higher‐level governments. Moreover, they emphasize that higher‐level politicians experience positive (negative) credit spillovers when co‐partisans (members of the opposition) at lower levels of government receive transfers (e.g., Brollo and Nannicini 2012; Solé‐Ollé and Sorribas‐Navarro 2008). Thus, partisan biases according to this logic are driven in part by national politicians' reluctance to strengthen rival parties at lower levels of government. The credit claiming logic is well suited to explaining why co‐partisan elite targeting occurs in the context of intergovernmental transfers. However, it leaves open the puzzle of why higher‐level governments should engage in co‐partisan elite targeting when it comes to other kinds of resources. Meanwhile, the elite cooperation logic developed below addresses this puzzle.         "
"12","The elite cooperation logic posits that a key motivation for co‐partisan elite targeting by national politicians is to secure the cooperation of politicians from their own party holding office at the state or local level. Earning the cooperation of politicians holding office at lower levels of government could be valuable for higher‐level politicians for many reasons (e.g., Brollo and Nannicini 2012; Dunning and Nilekani 2013). A key reason emphasized here is that a state legislator with direct or indirect control over her state's governmental machinery could play a crucial role in ensuring that development projects are implemented according to the preferences of the national legislator in her constituency.         "
"13","There are several reasons why a state legislator or MLA may prefer to cooperate with a co‐partisan MP than with an MP from another party. Shared partisanship may increase the likelihood of repeated interaction, and party leaders may also play an important role in facilitating cooperation between national and state legislators within the same party."
"14","At the same time, however, offering an MP assistance with the implementation of development projects could impose a range of costs on a state legislator: effort, political capital, opportunity costs in terms of lost rents, or lost opportunities to build a political base. Thus, an MLA may often be unwilling to incur the costs associated with helping an MP ‐ even if the MP is from her own party ‐ if this MP does not look out for her interests. For example, a state legislator and minister in Andhra Pradesh belonging to the Congress party was reportedly “at loggerheads” with the local MP, also from the Congress, who represented his constituency in part because the MP was “neglecting the interests of the seven Assembly segments under his Lok Sabha constituency.”2 Thus, similar to a grassroots broker, an MLA may expect to receive benefits from higher‐level politicians in order to be willing to cooperate with them (e.g., Stokes et al. 2013; Szwarcberg 2015).         "
"15","What kinds of benefits could MPs provide to MLAs to win over their cooperation? Although MPs could potentially boost a co‐partisan MLA's reelection chances by targeting resources to the MLA's constituency, there are two reasons why the incentives to do so may be weak for resources that fall outside the rubric of intergovernmental transfers. First, lower‐level representatives may find it difficult to claim credit among voters at large for spending allocations that are clearly designated to be under the control of national politicians.3 Second, since the resources in question are not earmarked for lower‐level governments, using these resources to benefit MLAs rather than for other purposes bears an opportunity cost for an MP. In turn, while winning over an MLA's cooperation may require a relatively low proportion of the MP's overall funds, it may be prohibitively costly for the MP to spend the significant proportion of funds that would likely be required to sway an MLA's reelection prospects.         "
"16","At the same time, however, an MLA could benefit in a number of ways from her constituency's receiving allocations from the MP's development fund even if she cannot successfully claim credit among ordinary voters for these allocations. First, an MLA could use these MPLADS allocations to extract private rents, often in the form of kickbacks from contractors hired to execute the projects.4 Such opportunities for rent seeking are particularly rife when it comes to road construction projects, where reports have found that MPLADS funds were being used to fund repeat expenditures for repairing roads that had already been fixed,5 to fund roads that ended up as missing,6 and to fund excess payments to contractors hired to execute the road projects.7"
"17","Second, since MLAs themselves often rely on lower‐level brokers to get elected (e.g., Auerbach 2016; Dunning and Nilekani 2013; Krishna 2011), an MLA could use the projects allocated to her constituency to reward these lower‐level brokers on an individual basis, thus allowing her to build her political network over the longer term. Thus, an MLA may lobby her local co‐partisan MP to recommend projects to benefit these specific individuals in the MLA's constituency, and agreeing to these requests may be an important way for the MP to win over the cooperation of the MLA.         "
"18","A first implication of the elite cooperation logic is that co‐partisan elite targeting should occur toward the beginning of the local MLA's electoral term. If an MP instead targets resources to the local MLA's constituency at the end of her term, there is typically a considerable risk that the current MLA will not get reelected (e.g., Uppal 2009), which, in turn, would cut short the benefits that the MP could derive from the current MLA's cooperation. Conversely, if the MP were to engage in co‐partisan elite targeting toward the beginning of the MLA's term, this could extend the duration of the current MLA's potential cooperation with the MP. Moreover, if national and state elections are staggered, this could help ensure that the MLA who is targeted with the pork is the same person who will be in office when the MP herself faces reelection. Meanwhile, an MLA could benefit from receiving pork toward the beginning of her electoral term since it could help her to reward individuals who assisted her in the most recent election. If the pork is used to help the MLA engage in rent seeking, then the MLA could use it to help recoup or pay back the resources she expended during her recent electoral campaign. For these reasons, the elite cooperation logic suggests that co‐partisan elite targeting should be most prevalent toward the beginning of a state legislator's electoral term (H1).            "
"19","While the elite cooperation logic implies that co‐partisan elite targeting should occur shortly after the state legislator is elected, the credit claiming logic implies that co‐partisan elite targeting from MPs to MLAs should occur primarily in the run‐up to state elections. Meanwhile, the core supporter logic suggests that co‐partisan elite targeting should be most likely to occur in the run‐up to a national election. However, while MPs may indeed increase spending in the run‐up to their own elections to appeal to voters, the elite cooperation logic suggests that they should not increase their allocations to the constituencies of co‐partisan MLAs during this period.            "
"20","A second implication is that MPs should be especially inclined to favor the constituencies of co‐partisan MLAs when it comes to the allocation of particularistic benefits. If state legislators find it difficult to claim credit among voters at large for public works funded by an MP's resources, then these public works may not be particularly beneficial for MLAs if they benefit a broad swathe of voters in the constituency. Conversely, however, MLAs could lobby the MP for public works that could be targeted to specific individuals in her constituency. MLAs could use these individually targeted projects to reward lower‐level brokers who have provided them with assistance in the most recent state election which, in turn, could help MLAs maintain their political networks. Thus, the elite cooperation logic implies that in the period just after the state election, national politicians should—all else equal—be more likely to target projects that yield localized individual benefits to the constituencies of their co‐partisan state legislators (H2). This implication is not consistent with the credit claiming logic, which suggests that targeting should be more likely when it comes to broader‐based projects that would allow state legislators to claim credit from a larger number of voters. Moreover, since the implication is that the constituencies of co‐partisan state legislators are targeted “all else equal”—that is, regardless of the distribution of core supporters in the constituency—this hypothesis is also not consistent with the core supporter logic.            "
"21","A third implication of the elite cooperation logic is that MPs should engage in co‐partisan elite targeting in situations where cooperation by co‐partisan state legislators in the context of implementing development projects is especially valuable. Since MLAs who are aligned with the party of the state chief minister are able to exercise significant leverage over the local bureaucracy through the chief minister's backing (e.g., Golden and Min 2013; Iyer and Mani 2012), they are well positioned to use this leverage to influence the implementation of development projects—including those sanctioned under MPLADS—in a way that would either personally or politically benefit the MP. Meanwhile, MLAs who are not aligned with the state chief minister's party have much less leverage over the bureaucracy and, thus, their cooperation when it comes to implementing development projects is typically less valuable to an MP. Thus, the argument suggests that in the period just after the state election, national politicians should seek to engage in co‐partisan elite targeting especially when they belong to their state's ruling party (H3). If membership in the state ruling party facilitates credit claiming or if it facilitates the targeting of core supporters, this implication could be consistent with the core supporter (credit claiming) logic if such targeting occurred just before the national (state) elections. However, neither logic can account for such targeting in the period after a state election.            "
"22","Finally, the elite cooperation logic implies that MLAs who belong to the state's ruling party should use their control over the government machinery in their constituencies to help a co‐partisan MP implement development projects more effectively in the run‐up to national election—which is when the MP's need to appeal to voters is the most immediate. While this argument should apply in general, it should also apply to the development projects sanctioned under MPLADS. Since one way to capture the effective implementation of development projects is simply to capture whether or not they were successfully completed, the argument suggests that when an MP belongs to her state's ruling party, projects proposed in the one year period prior to a national election are less likely to remain incomplete if they are located in a co‐partisan MLA's constituency than if they are located in a constituency of an MLA from another party (H4). Meanwhile, neither the core supporter nor the credit claiming logic suggests that MPs should receive assistance from co‐partisan MLAs with the implementation of development projects.            "
"23","The above hypotheses are tested using project‐level data from the MPLADS. The scheme was launched in 1993 and since then has allowed for a fixed annual allocation of funds to each single‐member parliamentary constituency in India to be spent on specific public works projects recommended by the member of parliament (MP)."
"24","The present study focuses on allocations to MPs in the Lok Sabha ‐ which is the directly elected lower house of the national parliament. From 1998 to 2012, the maximum annual allotment per MP constituency was 20 million rupees, and from 2012 onward, this annual allotment increased to 50 million rupees.8 Any money that goes unspent in a given MP's constituency in a given year is carried forward to the next year and, if there is an unspent balance at the time that an MP leaves office, this balance accrues to her successor in the constituency (Keefer and Khemani 2009).         "
"25","A central government ministry is responsible for the release of funds and for monitoring the implementation of the scheme, and a department in each state is given responsibility for the supervision, coordination, and monitoring of MPLADS within the state.9 Ultimately, the funds are released to district authorities within each state who carry out the works in their districts mainly through local governments or other government agencies.         "
"26","Since the scheme's inception, the majority of sanctioned works have been roads, pathways, and bridges, composing 33% of the total works, followed by “other public facilities,” which compose 28%.10 The other works fall into sectors such as drinking water, education, electrification, and irrigation. The time span of the analysis covers the 13th, 14th, and 15th Lok Sabhas that were each in power for 5‐year terms from 1999 to 2004, 2004 to 2009, and 2009 to 2014, respectively.11"
"27","State legislators or MLAs have no formal role either in terms of recommending or implementing projects under the scheme. However, state governments—and state chief ministers in particular—have control over the careers of the district bureaucracy responsible for implementing MPLADS development projects in their respective states (Iyer and Mani 2012). Thus, members of the state government and those who are aligned with them could choose to use this control to exert influence over the implementation of MPLADS, although they are not required to do so. Meanwhile, although MPs have the sole authority to recommend projects under the MPLADS, they do not have direct control over the careers of local (i.e., district level and below) bureaucrats and thus have less direct influence over how development projects are implemented.12"
"28","The analysis presented in this article focuses on seven states in North India—Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand—that together compose over 40% of India's overall population. These states have historically lagged behind in terms of human development and have been categorized as BIMARU states—an acronym playing on the Hindi word for sickness. A focus on these states is useful since public works programs such as the MPLADS have a particular salience in these states, owing to their historically poor levels of service provision compared with other parts of India. At the same time, the socioeconomic similarities that these states share allow for an analysis of the causal effect of co‐partisanship across fairly homogenous units."
"29","The data used in the analyses were scraped from the publicly available online works monitoring system containing details on individual projects sanctioned under MPLADS by each MP.13 These details are uploaded by the district authorities responsible for carrying out the public works projects at the district level and are subject to verification by independent bodies.14"
"30","Since the MPLADS online system does not provide information on the state assembly constituency in which the project is located, information on the village cluster or urban ward in which the project was located was used in conjunction with GIS software to determine the state assembly constituency that received the project. Section A.1 in the supporting information (SI) describes in detail the procedure used to match the project locations with the state assembly constituencies. Information on the date of receipt of the project proposal was used to match each project to the electoral term of the relevant state legislators.            "
"31","A host of factors could confound the association between the partisan alignment of state legislators with their local MPs and the implementation of public works programs. For example, partisan alignment between state and national legislators may be more commonly found in areas with a more vertically integrated bureaucracy or in areas with a greater prevalence of a given party's core supporters. Consequently, a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression would likely lead to a biased estimate of the effect of co‐partisanship between state and national legislators on the characteristics of public works projects."
"32","To remedy this problem, this article uses a regression discontinuity (RD) design (Imbens and Lemieux 2008) relying on close races in which a state‐level candidate affiliated with the local MP's party either won or lost by a small margin. Thus, the “forcing” variable is the vote margin share (expressed as a proportion) of the MP's party's state‐level candidate in the given constituency i in the most recent election. The variable is positive when the MP's party's candidate just won the most recent state election and negative when the MP's party's candidate just lost the most recent state election. Constituencies where an MLA candidate from the local MP's party was neither the winner nor the runner‐up are dropped from the analysis. The cut point of the forcing variable is a 0% vote margin, which separates constituencies with an MLA aligned with the party of the local MP from constituencies with an MLA who was not aligned with the party of the local MP. Thus, the design involves comparing constituencies in which an MLA candidate aligned with the party of the local MP barely won the most recent state election to constituencies in which an MLA candidate who was not aligned with the party of the local MP barely won the most recent state election (against an MLA candidate aligned with the party of the local MP).         "
"33","The use of the RD design relies on the assumption of as‐if‐random assignment of the treatment across constituencies close to the cut point. Section A.4 in the SI describes a series of diagnostic tests undertaken to assess the validity of this assumption. These tests affirm confidence in the RD design, showing in particular that there are no significant differences in the values of several pretreatment covariates for constituencies on either side of the cut point (SI Table A3) and that there is no evidence of strategic sorting around the cut point (SI Figure A2).         "
"34","To test Hypotheses 1 and 3, the dependent variable Project Expenditure is the amount of funds sanctioned for a given project i proposed at time t in a given state assembly constituency s. Specifically, t refers to the date the proposal for the given project that was drawn up by the national MP was received by the district authority responsible for executing the project.         "
"35","To test Hypothesis 2, the dependent variable Individual Benefit is used. This is a dummy coded 1 if the project i initiated at time t in state assembly constituency s is a public work described as benefiting the home of a specific individual named in the work description and 0 otherwise. Examples of descriptions that received a code of 1 include “Electrification from Main line to house of Rajbahadur S/o Thakur Prasad,” “Establish of tube well at G.P. Narmadapur near of Dalbeer sarpanch house,” and “Construction of Toilet inside Surendra Yadav House in Rariyaha of Ghailard Block.”         "
"36","Finally, to test Hypothesis 4, the dependent variable Incomplete Project is used, which is coded 1 if a project's status in the online system at the time of data collection15 was described as “ongoing,” “discontinued,” or “not yet started” and 0 if the project's status was recorded as complete or if the project's status was not reported. Robustness is also checked with a slightly altered coding of this variable,16 which omits the projects whose status is not reported in the system.         "
"37","The key treatment of interest T is a dummy indicating whether the MLA representing assembly constituency s at time t belongs to the same party as the MP at time t representing the parliamentary constituency p that contains the assembly constituency s. Denoting the forcing variable (Forcing) by V, the RD design involves estimating an equation of the following form:            "
"38","The order of the polynomial chosen is p. The interaction of T with each term in the polynomial allows for a separate estimation of the relationship between  and V to the left and right of the cut point. The estimated coefficient  identifies the treatment effect right at the cut point of 0 and provides an estimate of the causal effect of an MLA's affiliation with the party of the local MP.         "
"39","In order to test the key hypotheses laid out earlier regarding the conditions under which co‐partisan elite targeting occurs, Equation 1 is estimated for different subsamples that meet the conditions specified in the hypotheses.17 Thus, testing the hypotheses involves examining the heterogeneity of the treatment effect across different conditions.         "
"40","Specifically, to test the hypotheses concerning election timing, Equation 1 is estimated for different subsamples depending on whether t fell in a period before or after an election in the state in which project i was located or before or after a national election. Section A.2 in the SI shows the timing of state elections for the states in the sample and how they relate to national elections. Note that although there is some overlap between the period after a state election and the period before a national election, the correlation in the sample is minimal,18 thus ensuring that the relevant subsamples are substantially different.         "
"41","Table 1 shows results from the RD design that help shed light on Hypothesis 1. Table 1, column 1 estimates Equation 1 for all the years in the sample, and columns 2, 3, and 4 estimate Equation 1 in the 2‐year period after the state elections, in the 2‐year period before the state elections, and in the 2‐year period before the national elections, respectively. The results in column 2 show that, in the 2‐year period after a state election, MPs allocated projects with significantly higher expenditure to constituencies in which a co‐partisan state candidate barely won the election than to constituencies in which a co‐partisan state candidate barely lost the election.19 Specifically, the results show that, in this period just following a state election, MPs allocated an average of 59,000 Indian rupees (approximately 1,000 USD in today's exchange rate) more to individual projects located in constituencies of state legislators belonging to their own party than to individual projects located in constituencies of state legislators from other parties.         "
"42","Section A.5 in the SI confirms that these results hold even when using several alternative nonparametric local polynomial estimation strategies. Figure 1 utilizes the optimal data‐driven RD plots developed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015) to allow for a corresponding visual examination of the discontinuity at the cut point. Consistent with the results in Table 1, column 2, Figure 1 shows visual evidence of a clear discontinuity at the cut point for projects proposed in the 2‐year period after a state election.         "
"43","RD Plot: The Effect of Co‐Partisanship on Project Expenditure in the 2‐Year Period after State Elections"
"44","Note: The figure shows an RD plot generated using the data‐driven method recommended by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015). The x‐axis shows the vote margin of the state candidate from the local MP's party. The y‐axis shows the residuals of a regression of the project expenditure on control variables used to estimate Equation (1) as described in the Methodology section. Residuals in the top first and bottom first percentile are dropped. The dots represent the mean of the residuals within bins of the forcing variable whose widths are chosen by the evenly spaced bin selection method recommended by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015).                     "
"45","While the 2‐year time frame is somewhat arbitrary, additional results in Section A.16 and Table A17 in the SI show that the effect of co‐partisanship on project expenditure remains statistically significant even when we consider alternative time frames of 6 months and 1 year after a state election. Meanwhile, the results in Table 1 show that there is no evidence of co‐partisan elite targeting in the overall sample (column 1), in the 2‐year period before a state election (column 3), or in the 2‐year period before a national election (column 4).         "
"46","One possible explanation for the lack of evidence of co‐partisan elite targeting for projects proposed in the 2‐year period prior to state and national elections is that MPs may have needed to propose projects earlier than the 2‐year period in order to ensure their completion prior to an election. However, the available information on projects that were complete at the time of data collection shows that 60% of projects proposed within 2 years prior to data collection were marked as complete (see SI Figure A3). Thus, MPs could reasonably expect that a project proposed within a 2‐year period before an election would have a good chance of being completed prior to the election.         "
"47","Moreover, even if we allow for the possibility that MPs anticipate a completion time between 1 and 3 years, the available evidence does not support the credit claiming logic either in general, or as an explanation for co‐partisan elite targeting. First, SI Table A7 shows no evidence of an increase in overall expenditures under MPLADS in the 3‐year period prior to a state election. Second, additional results show that there is no evidence of co‐partisan elite targeting in the 3‐year period prior to a state election (SI Table A8) or in the third year prior to a state election (SI Table A9).         "
"48","Interestingly, SI Table A7 does show evidence of higher project expenditures overall in the 3‐year period prior to a national election indicating—not surprisingly—that MPs may in fact be allocating project expenditures to boost their own electoral prospects independent of their co‐partisans at the state level. At the same time, however, SI Table A8, column 1 shows that there is no evidence of higher expenditures being targeted to the constituencies of co‐partisan MLAs for projects proposed within the 3‐year period prior to a national election. These results cast further doubt on the possibility that MPs' primary motivations for co‐partisan elite targeting were to directly appeal to voters.         "
"49","Table 2 turns to examining Hypothesis 2 using Equation 1, but substituting in the dependent variable Individual Benefit indicating whether the given public work project was designed to benefit the home of a specific individual. Since the argument implies that individualized targeting should occur very shortly in the aftermath of a state election, the results focus on allocations made in the first year after the state election. The results in column 2 indicate that MPs favored the constituencies of their co‐partisan MLAs when it came to allocating localized projects that were designed to benefit the homes of specific individuals in the 1‐year period after a state election.20 SI Table A10 confirms that these results hold even when using nonparametric estimation methods, and SI Figure A4 shows visual evidence of a discontinuity in the probability that a project yields an individual benefit at the cut point of the forcing variable.         "
"50","Turning to other periods, however, the results in Table 2, columns 1, 3, and 4 show no evidence of co‐partisan elite targeting of individual benefits in the full sample or in the 1‐year period prior to the state or national election. SI Table A13 shows no evidence of such targeting in the 2‐year period prior to a state or national election, and SI Table A8 shows similar results for the 3‐year period prior to a state or national election.         "
"51","Interestingly, SI Table A13, column 3 shows that the significance of co‐partisanship on the targeting of individual benefits disappears if we broaden the sample to the 2‐year period after state elections, indicating that the systematic targeting of individualized benefits to co‐partisan state legislators is most prevalent only in the period just after the state election—which is consistent with the argument that state legislators used these benefits to reward individuals who assisted them in the most recent state election. In fact, SI Table A13, column 4 indicates that the effect of co‐partisanship on the receipt of a project with an individual benefit is negative and significant in the second year after a state election, suggesting that MPs may seek to subsequently even out the distribution of particularistic benefits after the initial period following the state election.         "
"52","Note that since the dependent variable in Table 2 is a dummy coded 1 if the project yields an individualized benefit and 0 if it does not, the results in Table 2, column 2 imply that co‐partisan MLA constituencies are less likely to receive a project with broader‐based benefits in the year after a state election than non‐co‐partisan MLA constituencies. This is the opposite of what we would expect with the credit claiming logic, which suggests that projects should be designed to appeal to a large number of voters.         "
"53","At the same time, additional results in SI Section A.11 show that the broader‐based projects that co‐partisan MLAs' constituencies do receive are of higher value on average than the broader‐based projects received by the constituencies of non‐co‐partisan MLAs. Since projects with greater value typically allow for greater opportunities for rent seeking, this result—which holds for the 1‐year period and the 2‐year period after a state election (see SI Table A11, columns 1 and 3)—is consistent with the elite cooperation logic. Further results in SI Table A11, columns 2 and 4 show that this targeting of higher expenditures is particularly prevalent for broader‐based projects that involve road construction, which, in turn, are often vehicles for rent seeking as described earlier. Taken together, these results offer suggestive support for the idea that the propensity of MPs to target broader‐based projects to co‐partisan MLAs could be driven by MPs' inclination to funnel rent‐seeking opportunities to their party colleagues to win over their cooperation.         "
"54","To test Hypothesis 3, Table 3 examines whether the occurrence of co‐partisan elite targeting after a state election depends on whether the MP belongs to the state ruling party (i.e., the party of her state's chief minister). Column 1 shows the results for the cases in which the MP in question belongs to the state ruling party, and Column 2 shows the results for the cases in which the MP does not belong to the state ruling party. The results support Hypothesis 3, showing that although the effect of co‐partisanship is positive and significant in column 1, it is insignificant in column 2 and less than a quarter of the magnitude of the coefficient in column 1.21 Additional analyses in SI Table A18 show that the the effect of co‐partisanship on project expenditure when the MP belongs to the state ruling party remains statistically significant even when we consider alternative time frames of 6 months and 1 year after a state election.         "
"55","Turning to Hypothesis 4, Table 4 examines when and whether co‐partisan alignment affects the likelihood that a project remains incomplete at the time of data collection using the dependent variable Incomplete Project. Table 4 shows the results of this estimation for different time periods and based on whether or not the MP is a member of her state's ruling party. Consistent with Hypothesis 4, the results in column 3 show that when the MP belongs to her state's ruling party, projects proposed in the 1‐year period prior to a national election are significantly less likely to remain incomplete if they are located in a co‐partisan MLA's constituency than if they are located in a constituency of an MLA from another party. Meanwhile, this effect does not hold when the MP does not belong to her state's ruling party (column 4).22 These results are consistent with the argument that the cooperation of a co‐partisan state legislator who belongs to the ruling party is politically valuable to an MP because it allows for more effective implementation of development projects in the run‐up to a national election. Note that the results in Table 4, column 2 show no evidence that MPs enjoyed an increased completion rate of projects proposed during the period after state elections. Thus, the results are consistent with the argument that MPs engage in co‐partisan elite targeting in order to secure the cooperation of these colleagues in improving project completion rates in the future.         "
"56","The findings are thus suggestive of a quid pro quo exchange between MPs and MLAs of the same party. MPs from their state's ruling party appear to have engaged in co‐partisan elite targeting to buy off the cooperation of co‐partisan MLAs early on in the MLAs' electoral term. These MLAs used the pork to maintain their political networks by rewarding individuals who assisted them in the most recent state election with targeted benefits. Later, when national elections came around, these MLAs appear to have provided assistance to their local MPs by helping them deliver development projects to their constituents more effectively at election time."
"57","Taken together, the findings provide robust support for the elite cooperation logic advanced in this research. Moreover, Figure 2 illustrates how each of the key findings supporting the elite cooperation logic cannot be accounted for by the two dominant existing explanations for partisan biases in resource allocation in the literature—the core supporter logic or the credit claiming logic. In turn, distinguishing these logics is important because each has different normative implications. Specifically, although partisan biases in resource allocation may be inefficient or intrinsically unfair (e.g., Stokes et al. 2013), the existing explanations suggest that these biases are driven by the desire of politicians to cater to the preferences of ordinary voters, or at least certain groups of them. In particular, the core supporter logic suggests that the types of projects that national politicians implement will be strongly shaped by the needs and preferences of ordinary voters who form the core support base of their party. Meanwhile, the credit claiming logic suggests that national politicians will seek to implement projects that cater to the preferences of those ordinary voters who are constituents of co‐partisan representatives at lower levels of government. Thus, both logics imply that the chain of accountability between politicians and at least certain groups of ordinary voters remains intact.         "
"58","The elite cooperation logic suggests, however, that this aforementioned chain of accountability between politicians and ordinary voters may be weakened in multilevel systems by the incentives of national politicians to cater to the preferences of co‐partisan state representatives at the expense of ordinary voters. Specifically, the logic suggests that national politicians will seek to win over the cooperation of co‐partisan state representatives not by allocating projects that help them cater to ordinary voters' preferences, but by allocating projects that offer opportunities for state representatives to grant favors to individual brokers or projects that offer opportunities for state representatives to engage in rent seeking. In turn, although these types of projects may personally benefit state representatives, they would typically result in a diversion of resources away from projects that would have a greater direct benefit to ordinary voters. Thus, although certain ordinary voters may benefit from improved project implementation under the elite cooperation logic,23 ordinary voters would—all else equal—typically be worse off under the elite cooperation logic than under existing logics in terms of the degree to which resources are devoted to projects that cater to their preferences.         "
"59","Although the results are based on data from India, they help shed light on a logic of distributive politics that has received little attention in the literature thus far. Exploring the applicability of this logic in other multilevel systems would thus be a fruitful avenue for future research. The findings also suggest an important though perverse way that decentralization could impact democratic accountability. They suggest that increasing the power of subnational governments could enhance national politicians' inclinations to divert resources for the purpose of winning over the cooperation of political elites rather than for the purpose of directly appealing to voters."
