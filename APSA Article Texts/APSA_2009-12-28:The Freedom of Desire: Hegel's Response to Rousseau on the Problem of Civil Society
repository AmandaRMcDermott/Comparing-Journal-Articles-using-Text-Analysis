"1","We should begin with the phenomenon that causes so many problems in the modern age, according to Rousseau: desire or “self‐love”[amour‐propre]. For Hegel, whose account of desire is indebted to Rousseau, there are three parts to any desire and its satisfaction: first, the initial feeling of incompleteness that fuels action (impulse), second, a sense of what kind of object would satisfy this feeling (the means), and, third, the acquisition of this object and hence the feeling of completeness or satisfaction (the end). Additionally, for Hegel, there are two kinds of desires, animal or natural desire and human or spiritual desire.5 For Hegel, animals have “needs”[Bedürfnisse] which are “limited” and circumscribed, and thus can be completely satisfied (PR, 190).6 Nature supplies the feeling of incompleteness (e.g., hunger), the sense of what would sate this desire (e.g., wild berries), and then the ability to completely satisfy this feeling (e.g., the bodily strength and capacity to gather food and eat it).         "
"2","“Natural need” is very different from and actually grows into “imagined” or “spiritual need” in developed human societies (PRA, 98). In “imagined need,” nature no longer dictates the character and end of desires, but rather a human intellect, imagination, and reason insert themselves into the process of the formation and satisfaction of desire. Hegel's understanding of this transformation owes a lot to Rousseau, and it contrasts markedly with the regnant thought at the time.7 The reigning tradition, which includes Hobbes and Hume, conceptualized desire and reason as utterly separate. Desire stems from nature, whereas reason remains suitably objective and separated from the natural passions. Desire motivates individuals, while reason finds the best way for desire to satisfy itself (reason is the “slave” or, somewhat nobler, the “scout and spy” of the passions). Yet this division of duties means that desire is the sole engine of human activity, while reason is incapable of providing the impetus for any activity at all.8"
"3","By contrast, for Rousseau, reasoning always involves some interested or desiring activity, and all desire has rational content. Desire, in short, is fundamentally suffused with general or rational norms. For Rousseau, reason becomes implicated with desire in amour‐propre, the love of oneself in developing human societies.9 An individual animated by amour‐propre does not seek material satisfaction, but rather the approval of others within society.10 In Hegel's terms, the object of these spiritual or imagined desires is the “recognition”[Anerkennung], or approving opinion, of others.11 In order to satisfy the desire for recognition, one's desire must be formed and animated by the proper norms of behavior so as to curry the approving opinion of others. Since individuals seek the recognition of others, their desires will be animated by the same general norms by which they are judged. If these individuals are successful in following these norms, they will be recognized as being a “somebody” (PR, 207Z). If they fail in following them, or otherwise repudiate them, they will not garner recognition from others.         "
"4","As such, desire is not simply “given” by nature, but rather its character and end are constituted by generally shared social and political norms. Thus, the means of satisfying my incompleteness is to become a “somebody.” Becoming a somebody requires that I be recognized as such by others, and hence my desire must be always already constituted by a judgment as to what norms such recognition requires me to follow. The end of a spiritual desire involves an assessment of whether or not the recognition I attained is sufficient to satisfy my desire for recognition. Thus, the satisfaction of a desire does not follow the “natural desire” model in which some distinct material good sates a hungry feeling I have. Rather, the satisfaction of a spiritual desire consists in a cognitive judgment bound by general norms. For instance, desiring the recognition for being a philanthropist requires knowledge about the norms of how to conduct oneself as such, and the satisfaction of such a desire requires that one make a judgment based on these norms about whether or not one has gained sufficient recognition for one's philanthropic activity."
"5","The norms that constitute a genuine communal life—what determines what is right and proper, noble and base, good and conscientious—are housed concretely within the mores and institutions of social and political life (PR, 144). An individual's desires are thus fundamentally formed and satisfied in his participation in such institutions. For example, a university professor gains a desire to be recognized as an expert in his or her field. This desire is formed, regulated, and satisfied by the norms of the institution of higher education and the proper activity of its members. When this institution changes, adopting a new function, meaning, and norms, then the desires of the members within it change as well. For Rousseau and Hegel, communities and institutions are essential for the satisfaction of spiritual desire, since they provide not just the norms by which desire is created and animated, but also the fellowship and “honor” that can satisfy the desire for “recognition [Anerkennung] in his own eyes and in the eyes of others” (PR, 207). The dissolution of communities and institutions dries up the sources of spiritual desire and renders this desire incapable of satisfaction.         "
"6","Thus far, we have seen that Hegel follows Rousseau's account of the nature of spiritual desires. Additionally, however, Hegel follows Rousseau in accounting for the problems these spiritual desires can cause. Rousseau shows us that there are distinct problems internal to the nature of spiritual desire which arise most pointedly in the modern age and prevent its smooth and complete satisfaction. As the human intellect progresses, human desire expands and thus requires additional sources of satisfaction. Furthermore, the putative liberation of desires in the modern market economy tends to lead to selfishness and corruption, which themselves undermine individual attachment to institutions or communities, the necessary spheres of recognition. Eventually, human community dissolves such that individuals find themselves alienated and alone, yet enslaved to the corrupt opinion and goods of others.12 Genuine communities are replaced by corrupt imitations of communities built on the norms of vanity, “boundless extravagance,” and wealth (PR, 185Z). These new, corrupt forms of community—whose standards many must pretend to satisfy—are not really communities at all because they provide only hollow forms of recognition. The hollowness of these communities reinforces how alone each individual truly is. The modern atomization of individuals then leaves individuals bereft of any genuine communal, normative standards to judge their desires as satisfied. In short, as Rousseau and Hegel worry, the internal tendency of many of the forces of modern economic and social life is toward dissatisfaction, corruption and alienation, and finally “misery” (PR, 185).         "
"7","How do these human desires expand in the modern age according to Rousseau and Hegel? Rousseau argues that human needs expand over time in two ways: first, through the division of labor and the increasing dependence of human beings on one another and second, through our socially determined desires to outdo all others.13 Hegel discusses these two forms of expansion introduced by Rousseau in his “System of Needs” section in the Philosophy of Right. As Hegel puts it, needs expand first “by dividing and differentiating the concrete need into individual parts and aspects which then become different needs,” and second, “by multiplying … needs” (PR, 190).         "
"8","The first way needs expand according to Hegel is through the division or differentiation of concrete needs into more refined and abstract needs. The differentiation of needs occurs in order to satisfy needs more effectively. Using our intellect, human beings break the means to satisfy their desires down into different parts, assign different people to concern themselves with these different parts, and then the group reunites to share the common effort. Hegel here has in mind a basic division of labor system. The need for shelter is more easily satisfied if one individual works on building the foundation while another works on the walls and roof. The breaking down of this basic need thus gives rise to more abstract desires: instead of desires for a shady grove for shelter, a more developed human being desires to gather sturdy wood to construct a wall which is part of a larger project to keep out the natural elements. Hegel points out that this differentiation is in principle an “infinite process,” since any particular need can be broken down into its component parts and labor can be further specialized to satisfy this need more effectively (PR, 191)."
"9","As a result, human desire becomes at once more refined and more abstract. Desire expands as it grows more refined because our natural desires can be broken down into their constituent parts by human reason. Each particular part of this desire can be satisfied in an increasingly potent way. Individuals cultivate a “taste” by recognizing the different parts of those objects that satisfy our naturally given desires and seeking out those products of human labor that can best satisfy a refined taste. Thus, primitive individuals may have sated their appetite with unseasoned meat, but the development of human labor produces spices, herbs, and better means of food preparation. Taste can be refined so that a more developed human palate can enjoy a tender cut of filet mignon."
"10","The disadvantage of this increasing division of labor is that our labor grows increasingly specialized, so that individuals are no longer self‐sufficient, but more and more dependent on the work of others. Rousseau in particular bemoans the increasing dependence of human beings on one another, seeing the feeling of economic dependence of individuals feeding into the alienating need for desiring the favor of others in society. Depending on other individuals for my livelihood can lead to an increasing dependence on others’ opinion for my own self‐esteem, Rousseau ([1754] 1987, 67) argues.         "
"11","Whereas the first means of expanding desire stemmed from economic production, the second means comes from the social interaction of human beings. Needs are multiplied as individuals within society attempt to see themselves as equal to all others within a society, and as different from them as well (PR, 193). In order to be recognized, individuals must be “similar” or “equal with others” in the sense that they follow the same general norms as all other individuals (PRA, 95A). Yet recognition also requires that we distinguish one individual from another, which requires that we recognize differences among them (PRA, 96). The desire for recognition, then, provides individuals with two separate normative criteria—sameness and difference—which animate desire and provide the touchstones for judging this same desire satisfied or not."
"12","In order to be recognized as equal, individuals desire to follow all the customary norms by affecting the popular traits of others, such as wearing the fashionable clothes of the time and eating at all the right restaurants. Individuals attempt to display all the symbols of commonality, but also of success and prosperity in a community. As such, all “particular” aspects of human life—even down to the mundane—take “on a social character” (PR, 192Z). An individual's success at following these general norms ensures recognition of his equality, recognition that, yes, he is one of us, he is a “somebody.” This desire for equality multiplies needs because it prompts individuals to live outside of themselves in society, in the sense that they glean their desires from societal norms and acquire a self‐consciousness of what the satisfaction of such desires could be from these same norms. The desire for equality creates a multitude of desires for similar dress, habit, comportment, and so forth, so that one can fit in among all others. Rousseau bemoans this development, arguing that human beings become alienated from themselves through the incessant need to be recognized based on shared norms of behavior. Furthermore, if individuals cannot live up to the norms hovering over them (or, rather, more precisely, within them), they need to “affect them,” which introduces cunning, vice, and deception into human affairs ([1754] 1987, 67).         "
"13","This disciplining of desires would not expand desires were it not for the fact that it exists in a dialectical relationship with the need for individuals to assert their difference from all others. Individuals are not content with mere similarity or equality to all others, since they are not factory products, but unique beings. Particular human beings are distinct from one another in many ways, and so an individual seeks “to assert [himself] through some distinctive quality” (PR, 193). Yet this assertion of particularity introduces an element of competition into society, another point inherited from Rousseau. Individuals are not simply content to display their difference as a curiosity for others to wonder at—rather, they employ their difference in service of displaying their superiority over the other members of the pack. Rousseau portrays this development in terms of the “one who sang or danced the best, the handsomest, the strongest, the most adroit or the most eloquent became the most highly regarded” ([1754] 1987, 64). The desire for particularity multiplies desire because one must seek ways to assert oneself as different from and superior to others. The need for recognition, then, creates two different kinds of desires. On the one hand, we need to be recognized as one of the crowd, but on the other hand we need to be the first among equals. These two kinds of desires, then, exist in a dialectical relationship with one another. The satisfaction of the desire to be like all others creates a sense that one is too similar to other people, and thus prompts one to differentiate oneself from others. When one strays too far from the pack, a desire grows to rejoin it. Desire, then, follows one's imagination and one's judgments about one's relative similarity and difference to others, and hence is infinitely expansive, since human beings can always dream up new ways to be both similar and different to one another.         "
"14","In Hegel's explication of Rousseau's views of desire expansion, we can already discern the beginnings of Hegel's break from Rousseau. Rousseau at some points seems to treat human sociality as if it were a disease, especially when he argues that following generally accepted norms of proper social behavior is alienating. Hegel is careful to distinguish the expansion and refinement of desire itself from the excessive or pathological expansion of desire. For Hegel, after all, human sociality is not across the board a disease, but rather a fundamental condition for the possibility of distinctively human interactions. In fact, the creation of general norms that bind individuals together is itself a rational development (PR, 194A). One of Hegel's favorite examples of the rational benefit of social norms is those norms of fashion (PR, 192Z). For Hegel, it is desirable for human beings to share a common norm of fashion, so that we can rationally debate matters of the intellect, those matters befitting a human, rational mind, rather than busying ourselves with figuring out how properly to dress myself or with debating fashion norms. Hegel argues that a sign of a civilized society is one in which individuals do not concern themselves with their “particular” differences, but rather with the “general” norms they share in common (PRA, 96A).14 In short, these general norms that regulate day‐to‐day affairs and seem to alienate individuals from themselves actually “liberate” individuals to concern themselves with higher tasks (PR, 194).15"
"15","Despite these disagreements, Hegel indeed shares Rousseau's worry about the pathological tendencies of modern endlessly expansive desires. For Hegel, if we are not careful, we can enslave ourselves to the unattainable goal of satisfying our infinitely expansive desires.16 Individuals’ desires eventually outstrip their ability to satisfy them, because, in living outside themselves in the eyes of others, individuals never find contentment with what they have. They can always experience the limitation of what they have, since there is always some additional way they imagine in which they can attain more similarity or difference from others. The problem here is that their judgments of what constitutes proper recognition set a standard that always falls outside of the reach of their efforts. Social recognition of the equality or distinctness of individuals can never be fully met, because it is a relational and hence infinitely expansive norm. Human imagination can always come up with better and more expensive handbags, watches, TVs, or cars. Human desires are inflamed by this relational norm and hence are infinitely expansive because this relational norm is embedded in the formation and satisfaction of the desire itself. Individuals thus find themselves utterly incapable of finding satisfaction for their desires.         "
"16","These comparative desires do not begin as insatiable, according to Rousseau and Hegel, but rather develop in different institutional settings to be so. We can understand the development of desire in three stages, moving from the simplest to the most complex.17 First, comparisons begin among workers with similar occupations, because the simplest comparison concerns those who have identical functions within an institution. For example, bakers compete with other bakers for the general recognition of who makes the best bread. The baker's own desires are derived socially from how others perceive him in relation to his competitors. The judgment of what counts as enough recognition also comes from the community's circumscribed norms of what makes a good baker. In such a close‐knit community, such desire can be satisfied.         "
"17","Second, the increased division of labor, which leads to heightened productivity, frees human beings from constant manual labor. Human beings find themselves with leisure time free from the exigencies of nature so that they can engage in enjoyment, games, conversations, and competitions with others. Individuals can step back from constant laboring and reflect on the tasks they have accomplished and the leisurely activities they engage in.18 Rousseau imagines here that games and competitions arise to test individual ability in strength, intelligence, courage, wit, and so forth. Desires arise from collective social norms, which are based ultimately on what are valuable traits to cultivate pursuant to the common good. Unmoored from the limitations of nature, these social, leisurely desires are in principle infinitely expansive; as Hegel puts it, “there is no limit to this proliferation of needs” (PRA, 98). Even here, however, spontaneous social communities emerge around the desire to play this or that game, and these communities provide norms for the successful completion of these games, and thus for the sufficient recognition of those who play the games correctly and well.         "
"18","The problem comes with the third and greatest source of the expansion of needs, which emerges from the introduction of private property in an abstract and impersonal market economy. Money, as an abstract means of making commensurable the contribution of every occupation to the general good, is at the heart of the institutional problem. With this development, the baker does not simply desire to make good bread. Nor does he simply desire to make better bread than a competitor. Rather, he desires to make a great deal of money in order to prove himself better than other contributors to the common good, such as those of the moneylender or merchant or lawyer.19 The introduction of money increases the expansion of desires exponentially by making all occupations commensurable, and thus dissolving all concrete ties of community, rendering abstract all relationships among individuals. In other words, good bread ceases to be an end in itself, but rather it becomes instrumental to the pursuit of an abstract good, one that is quantitative (and hence without limit) in nature, rather than qualitative. This abstract or quantitative good atomizes individuals by tearing them away from their identification with their particular occupation and its internal competition. Money hence has the effect of undermining stable institutional means of providing recognition for individuals. With the introduction of money and the development of an advanced industrial economy, the worker hence becomes increasingly alienated from his occupation and hence from all communal and institutional ties.         "
"19","In its utter abstractness, money does not provide the recognition implicit in concrete, local communities, but casts individuals in an endless cycle of perpetual accumulation, a “false” or unhappy “infinite,” to use Hegel's phrase. This highly artificial cycle itself bears an unhappy resemblance to the initial natural cycle of desire and consumption described in the Phenomenology of Spirit.20 These cycles lead to human incompleteness because these individuals become concerned with material consumption or abstract accumulation, while never being able to satisfy these material desires because they cannot find recognition through this activity. At the same time, money also undermines individuals’ attachment to the common good by thrusting them always back into selfishness. This state of selfishness is what Hegel calls the moment of “particularity” divorced from concrete community or general forms of “ethical life.” The severing of “particularity” from the other “moments” of ethical life, most notably the “universal” will or common good, leads to what Hegel calls a “false infinite.” The false infinite is a series of particulars in which the “perpetual continuation of the alternation” between one particular and another prevents the appearance of a standard internal to the series that would render that series intelligible as a whole (EL, 94).21"
"20","In the first case, individuals in a “false infinite” can never find satisfaction, because they do not belong to a concrete community that can provide them with recognition. Rather, they find themselves competing with a faceless crowd of selfish individuals who will never offer recognition but only will defeat every effort of the individual to find completeness—the “false infinite” appears as an infinite series of desires without an internal principle of satisfaction.22 In the second case, as individuals become more abstract and discrete from one another, and as they become increasingly consumed with personal material desires, they become less concerned with the common good. Indeed, Hegel even worries about the rise of a certain juvenile “notion” according to which individuals recognize the commitment to institutions larger than themselves “as a limitation … and as a purely external necessity.” Hegel argues that this view is a “consequence of abstract thinking,” which itself is a consequence of the gradual atomization and alienation of individuals from a shared life and of the attachment to the abstract ideal of money (PR, 207A).         "
"21","For Hegel, then, the classical liberal position does not overcome the problem of desire posed by Rousseau's critique, but, on the contrary, exacerbates it. The classical liberal view not only misunderstands the relationship among freedom, desire, and institutions, but also its misunderstanding is pernicious. The traditional liberal view of freedom as “negative liberty” is that desires or interests are free when they are unchecked or undetermined by social and political institutions. This understanding of the freedom of desire stems from the notion that desire is a given natural force, separated from reason and other forms of human interaction. The “will finds itself naturally determined” by its “drives, desires, and inclinations,” in Hegel's terms (PR, 11). Yet, as Rousseau and Hegel argue, desire can only be formed—and more importantly, satisfied—in the context of human interactions animated by shared norms of behavior. These norms are housed within institutions in which individuals participate in common activities with others. Liberals thus miss the ways in which human desire is always already formed in the context of social interactions and institutions."
"22","Yet, further, the liberal view is pernicious because the separation of desire from institution actually destroys any way to satisfy desire itself. The desire is left grasping in its own void, as it were, without any means of reconnecting to human communities and institutions which are the sources of recognition and hence satisfaction of spiritual desires.23 Desire unchecked by institutions is actually unfree desire. One becomes enslaved to oneself in this situation. By contrast, Hegel argues that the limitation of unruly or unfettered desire is actually the “liberation”[Befreiung] of desire itself.24 He argues that instead of being enslaved to “external necessity, to inner contingency, and to arbitrariness [Willkür],” as the liberals would have it, we should submit ourselves to our “own opinion, which is universal, and to a necessity imposed by [ourselves] alone” (PR, 194). Our own opinion is shaped by shared, recognized norms, which are themselves subject to rational scrutiny and revision. This self‐aware, reflective participation of individuals within community hence fulfills the kind of freedom of the will Hegel outlines at the very outset of the Philosophy of Right (PR, 7), the freedom of “individuality.” That is, the individual combines the freedom as concrete participation within a determinate normative community (PR, 6) with freedom as self‐determination (PR, 5), as reflectively deciding for oneself which community I should join and why I should join it.         "
"23","In other words, only in the common participation in institutions of modern communal life can desires be free, satisfied by the mutual recognition of common goals and goods.25 Only within a community can I subject myself to my own autonomous judgment, since within this community I glean the general—or, as Hegel puts it, “universal”—norms of proper judgment for the satisfaction of desire. Only within such a community can the “false infinite” become a “true infinite,” in which the series of my desires becomes intelligible as a whole based on the common good that issues from it (EL, 95). For Hegel, maintaining the internal relationship between my particular desires and the universal or common good through my local or individual communities is the essence of freedom, since it is the only way to realize such freedom without falling into a “false infinite.” In short, Hegel sees that Rousseau's critique poses a fundamental problem to classical liberalism that must be overcome by introducing more robust institutions within civil society as part of any theory of liberal democracy.         "
"24","How, then, does Hegel imagine the mediating institutions of civil society solving our two main problems, that of insatiable selfishness and of the dissolution of civic responsibility? One of Hegel's main contributions to institutional theory of civil society is to think clearly through the origin, nature, and function of the mediating institutions necessary to respond to Rousseau's criticisms. First, then, what is the origin of these mediating institutions? Hegel argues that proper mediating institutions should be rooted fundamentally in the economic life of the community. Modern life has fundamentally transformed human life through the liberation of particular, arbitrary desires that Hegel thinks “indulge [themselves] in all directions” (PR, 185). In the modern state, rather than seeking collective goals or common goods, citizens are mostly motivated by private gain and by the freedom to pursue their own private good. Thus, any attempt to reestablish individual interest in communal goods must first appeal to these basic, private interests. Hegel sees that these interests are initially formed in the choice of one's career and in one's economic interactions with others. As such, he argues that the associations of civil society must be rooted in a community's economic landscape.26 Rooting these associations fundamentally in economic life will allow them to channel and transform basic economic interests such that they become rational and satiable. These associations must at the same time, however, allow for free individual choice both to enter the association and to leave it, thus assuring each individual that he has free control over his destiny. No one should be “born into” or fettered to these institutions (PR, 206). This is one reason the modern phenomenon of the “rabble”[Pöbel] is so problematic, according to Hegel—the class of the poor are systematically disadvantaged by the modern market such that they perceive themselves as “infinite, free” beings yet as utterly without control of their own destiny (cited in PR, 453).         "
"25","Having argued that these institutions must be economic in nature, Hegel further argues that civil society should be fundamentally divided into three “estates”[Stände] based on natural divisions within its economic landscape: the agrarian, manufacturing or commercial, and civil service estates. According to Hegel, the organically developing system of divided labor eventually “converges”—and should be explicitly recognized in the legal form as—discrete institutions with their identities, tasks, and forms of education (PR, 201). Hegel argues that the bourgeois estate of manufacturing and commerce, as the estate of commerce and “abstract profit,” is most susceptible to Rousseau's charge and hence endures the most internal division and fragmentation (PRA, 104). Hence it must contain an internal system of guild‐like “corporations” to foster and shore up a communal spirit within this estate.27 Hegel argued that his tripartite institutional structure was itself a necessary development of the logic of modern civil society. However, as Harris (1983) has argued, we need not simply accept Hegel's tripartite view in the face of a rapidly changing economic landscape. Nonetheless, we can still incorporate his insights as to the functions of these associations to help understand other possible economic landscapes, such as our own.28"
"26","The estates and corporations’ central aim is to supply their members with norms of proper behavior and hence with the capacity to recognize a worker as a “somebody.” Thus, although these institutions are founded in economic life, they quickly structure social interactions as well. For instance, a farmer in Hegel's substantial estate is recognized by other farmers not just by doing his job well, but also by acting like a farmer, by loving his family and by trusting his monarch. The social consequence of these economic institutions is particularly important for solving the problem of endlessly expanding desires. Furthermore, Hegel argues that these institutions that fundamentally structure civil society should structure political life as well. The different estates should constitute an “Estates Assembly,” which makes up the legislative branch of the country. The elegant institutional structure Hegel has in mind aims to transform otherwise unruly or irrational desire, such that it will be (a) satiable, (b) rational, and (c) free."
"27","These results follow from the three main functions of these mediating institutions.29 The first function (a) solves the first problem endemic to modern civil society, that of the perpetual incompleteness of human desire. Thus these institutions make desire satiable by providing the individual with an identity and a circumscribed arena in which his desires are limited and transformed. These desires thereby become satiable because the individual “gains recognition [Anerkennung] in his own eyes and in the eyes of others” in these institutions (PR, 207).         "
"28","These institutions provide such recognition in a few ways. Most fundamentally, the estates and corporations establish institutional norms of proper behavior. As we saw in Hegel's description of the “substantial estate,” Hegel argues that this estate establishes norms of family attachment and trust because the kind of labor the members are engaged in leads to a certain comportment toward fellow workers (i.e., laboring on nature thrusts these individuals back upon the natural source of their own generation; PR, 203). These norms thus dictate not only the object of our desires, but also the standard for judging what sufficient recognition consists in. As such, individual desire is “liberated” in that it has a distinct object and can be satisfied. It is no longer enslaved to its endlessly expanding selfish desires."
"29","The estates, then, channel individual desire for recognition from the abstract whole of society to the particular estates, since individual identity and interest are tied down more concretely to the individual's own institution. As such, bakers no longer compete with merchants by comparing wealth, but they compete with other bakers within an estate. The baker's desire returns more immediately and particularly to his work at hand, so as to maintain a primary interest and honor in making bread as opposed to accumulating wealth. This baker's desire for recognition can be satisfied, because of the intimate attachment of his self‐consciousness to the consciousness of the whole community. The baker “makes himself a member of one of the moments of civil society through his activity, diligence, and skill, and supports himself in this capacity.” Maintaining estates within the state prevents the slide into abstract atomism, selfishness, and slavery that Rousseau feared by supplying sufficient “recognition” to satisfy the workers’ desires (PR, 207)."
"30","These institutions, then, foster recognition by cultivating individual attachment to the institutions, and hence a sense that individuals jointly and freely come together for the common good. These institutions cultivate such attachment by caring for individuals as their “second family” (PR, 252). Hegel reasons that as individuals become adults in the modern age, they can no longer rely on their natural families for material and spiritual support—instead, the mediating institutions of civil society must provide such care (PR, 181). The corporation becomes the “second family” for individuals who have become alienated from their natural families due to the contingencies of the market and its effects on their occupation (e.g., relocation, long work days; PR, 252–53). Furthermore, the estate and corporation provide education for the worker “so as to make [him] eligible for membership,” thus allowing him to understand the main tasks of the association as a whole, how to do them, and thus how to gain recognition for doing a good job (PR, 252). Finally, these associations provide social support for otherwise alienated individuals by gathering together individuals with similar desires and normative judgments, setting them to work, and allowing them leisure as a group. Individuals are much more willing to recognize others and receive recognition from them when everyone has similar needs, opinions, and goals—when there is sufficient “similarity” or “equality”[Gleichheit] among members (PR, 193).         "
"31","This desire to work for the common good, then, cultivates a sense of honor in one's work and estate (PR, 253). Individuals recognize one another in their common task within the institution, but, importantly, they also see that their work, along with the labor of all others, contributes to an overall good produced by the estate as a whole. Moreover, they see that they are responsible for this overall good produced. This feeling of responsibility is important because it fills the individual with a sense of honor in his own work and the work of the whole. This honor stems from the individual's sense that his own autonomous activity has led to something permanent or good in the world. The honor disappears if the individual realizes that he was not truly free in his activity after all, or if his activity did not actually contribute one whit to the common good. Freedom of “self‐determination” fills the individual with honor because he recognizes himself in the fruits of his labor, that he has accomplished this important aim (PR, 207). Finally, the individual's desire for superiority over and difference from others diminishes as the individual comes to feel that this mutual honor and equality among his colleagues are necessary for his self‐expression and self‐control.30"
"32","Hegel asks us to consider by contrast the psychological state of the “rabble” who do not enjoy the education, support, and self‐determination brought on by being a member of a particular community. The poor person cannot feel honor in his situation because he is not recognized as a “somebody.” He does not enjoy the dignity of recognizing the success of his own agency in the fruits of his efforts. He does not feel a sense of belongingness with others in working for this common effort and shared good toward which they are jointly tending. He feels himself to be a “nobody.” Instead, the poor need to depend on the “contingency” of goodwill and charity, which does not encourage an ethic of self‐determination, but dependence, passivity, and “laziness” (PR, 244Z). Such a cycle makes the poor increasingly unfit for membership in a community by rendering each individual with an ever more attenuated sense of one's “self‐dependence” and of the “feeling of standing on [one's] own feet” (PRA, 118)."
"33","The second function (b) of these institutions builds on the honor the institution has cultivated among the members of communities. These institutions render the now‐satiable desires rational. They transform the individual's desire such that it accords with the rational or general will. This task is particularly problematic in the modern age as civil society becomes more complex and differentiated, for under these conditions, the possibility of a single general good appears remote, and thus individuals have less inclination and ability to work for the fulfillment of the common good as “citizens have only a limited share in the universal business of the state” (PR, 255Z). Individuals feel less of an investment in the political formation of a general will, and hence may view a general will as an ideology foisted upon them from above. Estates and corporations serve to mediate the relation between the individual and the whole, so that individuals experience a reconnection to the whole that they had lost when the political whole began to expand beyond Rousseau's romantic vision of a small, homogeneous republic. In this way, these institutions can harmonize individual desire and common good by making the latter immanent to the desire itself, by embedding the common good within the desire structure of the individual."
"34","Hegel's strategy is the following: the mediating institutions generate individual honor in the collective task of the whole institution, thereby transforming individual desire. Individuals desire the good of the whole because they see their free self‐government in the overall activity of this institution, and all individuals recognize one another freely and jointly contributing to the whole. That is, an individual recognizes himself as free and rational, and other individuals recognize him as free and rational. Estates and corporations can thus build on this sentiment of honor through a kind of principle of transitivity. The corporation transfers the individual attachment it has generated for itself to the state by demonstrating to its members that it is a microcosm of the state. The member “belongs to a whole which is itself a member of society in general, and [so] he has an interest in, and endeavors to promote, the less selfish end of this whole” (PR, 253)."
"35","Thus individual desire is transformed and educated to the common good in a few ways. The mediating institution reveals to the individual that the corporation stands toward the state as the individual stands toward the corporation. The state distinguishes between corporations which are “legally recognized”[berechtigen] and those which are not (PR, 253A). The state regulates the interactions among different institutions with its police power (PR, 235–36). So corporations, like individuals, are made possible through the regulation of the state—without such regulation and hence without a common good toward which all institutions aim, these corporations would not fulfill their aims nor interact justly with one another. The state's law needs to set down an explicit system of norms for the interaction of institutions, just as the corporation sets down a system of customs and norms for the recognition of individuals. This relationship of mediating institution to state means that the mediating institutions themselves are enjoined to work for the common good rather than for the private good of their members. The corporation, then, depends on the state just as the individual depends on the corporation. As such, just as the individual feels honor for the corporation, so too should the individual feel honor for the state as a whole.31"
"36","At the same time, then, the corporation educates and spurs the individual to collective activity, because the individual realizes that his free activity is responsible not just for the common good of the association of which he is a part, but also for the common good of the nation as a whole (PR, 255). As we have seen, an individual feels honor in her estate because it is the product of her own free labor. If, then, the efforts of the estates and corporations constitute and make possible the common good of the nation as a whole, then the individual can feel honor in the nation as a whole. As Tocqueville puts the same point, this individual is “glorified in the glory of the nation; in the success that it obtains he believes he recognizes his own work, and he is uplifted by it; he rejoices in the general prosperity from which he profits” ([1835] 2000, 90). Hegel further asks us to consider again the contrasting case of the “rabble” who do not belong to a particular community, hence do not find their agency expressed in the activity of the community, and hence lash out “against the rich, against society, the government” in a general feeling of resentment with their lot (PR, 244Z). Rather than seeing themselves as a part of the public they have created, they see the public institutions of modern life as a distant alien “arbitrary will” oppressing them (cited in PR, 453).         "
"37","The two functions of these mediating institutions we have seen thus far largely concern the formation and development of individual desire in society. The third function (c) of these institutions is directly political. These associations ensure that the state does not encroach upon individual identity, thereby homogenizing and enervating the populace. This function complements the first two functions in the following way. These mediating institutions seek to maintain the distinctiveness or particularity of their members’ identities while at the same time elevating them to a general harmony. In this way, the mediating institutions replay at an institutional level the dialectic between equality and particularity we saw in the context of the development of social, spiritual desire."
"38","In transforming individual desire, the corporation elevates desire but also prevents the state from completely consuming individual identity as Rousseau's Social Contract would, and as the Terror did as a consequence of Rousseau's philosophy, according to Hegel.32 It accomplishes this task in two ways—first, through explicit legal checks against the general government that are effective because of its ability to garner immediate individual attachment as over and against the state. The corporation drives a wedge between the state and the individual. It has the institutional responsibility to check state encroachments on individual freedom,33 and it is at the same time responsible for organizing the mass of individuals into a coherent, differentiated, efficient group, rather than a mob (PR, 315–18). The mediating institutions play an important role, then, in marshalling group power to meet the encroachments of the state.34"
"39","Second, Hegel's mediating institutions allow for an important element of self‐government at local levels. The activity of marshalling group power to meet the encroachments of the state can be itself an instance of self‐government. Individuals, through these institutions, express their own autonomy in responding to state encroachment. Yet at the same time, Hegel defends administrative subsidiarity, suggesting that the administration of public affairs should occur at the level closest to the particular individual. The estates and corporations, as legally recognized groups, as the most powerful, most organized associations in the country, naturally seem to be the associations that would tackle these kinds of local administrative problems. Hegel does not himself work out the institutional details, but the ideal of self‐government is surely a plausible inference to make, given Hegel's desire elsewhere to uphold the value of self‐determination at the individual level, realized in large part by the spontaneous, local, organic self‐government of the ancients.35 As Hartmann (1984) plausibly argues, the principle of subsidiarity underlies Hegel's analysis of these mediating institutions, such that, for Hegel, the most local chapter possible of each organization would assume responsibility for the administrative affairs.         "
"40","In examining the landscape of American political culture, one cannot help but find some truth in Rousseau's spirited criticisms, expressed most recently by communitarians like Michael Sandel and Amitai Etzioni. American politics has over time become ever more characterized by the bargaining of special interest groups, lobbyists, and Wall Street bankers, all attempting to pressure policy makers to satisfy their employer's “interests.” Earmarks and “pork‐barrel” projects aimed at satisfying the “interests” of constituents have appeared as routine and inescapable components of the policymaking process. Politics understood as the pursuit of the common good or as the realization of collective sovereignty has gradually been eclipsed by an economic model of the exchange and satisfaction of “interests” or needs. At the same time, this model of economic exchange has led to a doleful condition in which the average individual cannot compete with the enormous power and resources of lobbying groups and hence turns away from politics in frustration and with a sense of futility."
"41","One of the goals of this article has been to elicit Hegel's normative defense of these modern institutions even while recognizing the merit of these criticisms. Hegel famously argued that it is easy to discern the faults of any society—the blemishes of empirical contingency are plain and obvious—but not easy to see the rationality of human institutions (PR, 268Z). For Hegel, the institutions of modern civil society—even contemporary American civil society—have the resources to mitigate the problems of insatiable selfishness and of a dissolving civic life. The persistence and indeed success of bourgeois, liberal democracy over the past 150 years is a testament to modern commercial society's capacity to alleviate the pathologies Rousseau pointed to as indications of the inevitable demise of modern life."
"42","However, Hegel is far from suggesting that we should rest content with our institutions as they exist now. Indeed, Hegel argues that actual modern civil societies may succeed to a greater or lesser degree in answering Rousseau's criticisms.36 Our institutions may thus fail to live up to the standards implicit in Hegel's defense. As such, Hegel's project is essentially no conservative one, encouraging us simply to justify the principles and institutions of our time. Rather, Hegel defends progress and improvement in the institutions of modern civil society, so that they live up to the standards of what we know good modern institutions can be. My second goal in this article has been to offer Hegel's theory of institutional design as a guideline for improving our own thinking about associations of civic life.         "
"43","Hegel's theory can help guide contemporary thinkers who try to locate and reinforce associations that give voice to public spiritedness and efficacy to collective sovereignty in the face of a civil society dominated by corporate interests. At the same time, however, Hegel's specific set of institutions differs from those proposed by many of these contemporary thinkers in that Hegel roots these institutions of civil society in our economic life, rather than seeing them as separate from, and even opposed to, the market.37 Hegel's first contribution to the contemporary literature on civil society, then, is to provide strong reasons for bringing economic associations—like trade unions, professional associations, and similar institutions—into our considerations of how to design civic‐minded mediating institutions. As we have seen, for Hegel, economic associations are a powerful resource for building strong institutions, since individuals’ identities and desires are lodged deeply in their occupations, the source of their very livelihood. Without involving these economic associations, the associations of civil society tend to be rather “free‐floating” and without a grounding in the material desires of individuals.         "
"44","The second, and more fundamental, contribution Hegel makes to this literature is his theoretical account of the origin, nature, and purpose of these institutions. Hegel offers us a deep understanding of the origin of these institutions—rooted in the desire for recognition rather than the convergence of “interest”—as well as of the reasons for the strength of these institutions—from the individual perception that he is recognized as a “somebody” and that his association is recognized as an essential part of the whole or collective effort of the community. Finally, Hegel provides an account of the purpose of these associations of civil society, which is not primarily as an advocacy or pressure group inclined to satisfy pregiven interest. Rather, an association should be one that “educates” human desire by asking us to consider the good political life from a perspective higher than our or even our group's selfish interests.38 In the modern age, there is a kind of natural gravitational pull of individuals and groups toward thinking of themselves as defined by their interests and single‐mindedly pursuing this interest. The associations of civil society should, therefore, be deliberately designed to resist this natural gravity and encourage us to consider political action from a broader perspective than we are used to, one that helps us live together under the exercise of collective sovereignty rather than existing side‐by‐side in a relationship of economic interest. For Hegel, this educative component of good associations of civil life staves off the ills of commercial selfishness while also inching us toward the ideal of the Rousseauan “general will,” all without accepting Rousseau's solution of giving up the personal freedoms gained by the modern age and sacrificing oneself entirely to service to the state.         "
"45","These are ambitious demands Hegel places on us, and surely Hegel's specific institutional landscape—with its basis in quasi‐feudal “estates” and “corporations”—is no longer directly applicable to the contemporary world. We need an institutional design that is much more plastic and dynamic in character, as well as global in scope, to fit the demands of our very different age. Despite Hegel's outmoded specifics, however, his theoretical account of the origin, nature, and purpose of these associations can still help ground and guide the proper design for mediating institutions of our own age."
