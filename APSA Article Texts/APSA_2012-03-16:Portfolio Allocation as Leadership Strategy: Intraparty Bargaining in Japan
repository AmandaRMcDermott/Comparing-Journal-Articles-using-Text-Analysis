"1","There has been an extensive amount of research on portfolio allocations at the level of parties in coalition governments. Some research predicts that cabinet portfolios will be allocated in proportion to a member party's seat share in the coalition (Browne and Franklin 1973; Browne and Frendreis 1980; Gamson 1961). Other research predicts that the formateur party—the party formally given the first opportunity to build a coalition and typically the party from which the prime minister hails—will gain a share of portfolios that is more than proportional to its seat share (Baron and Ferejohn 1989). Scholars disagree over whether the formateur party takes a larger share of portfolios than other coalition partners do (Ansolabehere et al. 2005; Diermeier and Morton 2005; Fréchette, Kagel, and Morelli 2005; Morelli 1999), but empirical studies show that parties overall receive shares of portfolios proportional to the share of seats they contribute to the coalition (Druckman and Warwick 2005; Warwick and Druckman 2001, 2006).         "
"2","This finding is relevant to understanding portfolio allocation among factions within a party because the competition for cabinet positions induces party factions to think about office payoffs in very much the same manner as do political parties in coalition governments (Mershon 2001, 280). Leiserson (1968) argues that, similar to the cases of coalition governments elsewhere, in Japan cabinet portfolios are widely allocated among LDP factions in order to pass government bills in the parliament.3 However, subsequent studies have shown that the allocation outcomes in the LDP are not always proportional. Empirical studies of the LDP demonstrate that the mainstream factions—the set of factions that endorsed the eventual winners in the party's presidential elections (Kato and Mershon 2006, 82)—received more portfolios than their seat shares at the expense of other factions until the 1960s, but that these factions began to receive a proportional share of portfolios after the 1970s (Kohno 1997; Sato and Matsuzaki 1986). Scholars have explained this shift in the allocation pattern as a consequence of the development of a proportionality norm within the LDP (Sato and Matsuzaki 1986) or as a result of the party leader's rational adjustment to the optimal strategy (Kohno 1997).4"
"3","These existing studies examine the overall trend of portfolio shares given to the mainstream factions. However, the mainstream factions are not unitary and monolithic actors. Factional alliances are invisible to voters, and they can be reshuffled at the faction level depending on the prevailing political conditions even after a party leader is chosen. Moreover, the identity of mainstream factions is not as explicit as assumed in the existing literature because party leaders are not always chosen at the national convention. Indeed, many party presidents of the LDP have been chosen without ever having to contest elections at the party's national convention.5 Since it is not always evident which factions are a part of the mainstream and which are not, the exclusive focus on mainstream factions could obscure the allocation mechanisms within the party. On the other hand, it is always evident which faction is the party leader's faction. In the LDP government, a single party leader, who is typically a faction leader, concurrently assumes the position of prime minister and wields unilateral authority to allocate cabinet portfolios. The leader always wants to reward his faction's members as much as possible in allocating portfolios because they are his primary supporters within the party. Hence, a closer examination of the portfolio share given to the party leader's faction should reveal a more accurate picture of the mechanisms at work in portfolio allocation within the party.         "
"4","An exclusive focus on the party leader's faction shows that there is considerable variation in its portfolio share over time. Figure 1 shows the share of portfolios given to the party leader's faction between 1960 and 2007.6 The horizontal axis indicates the party leader's name in chronological order. The vertical axis indicates the party leader faction's share of portfolios relative to its share of seats within the party.7 A positive value on this axis implies that the party leader's faction received more portfolios than its seat share within the party. The vertical dotted lines on this figure show the times when the power balance between factions changed due to parliamentary elections. The results shown in Figure 1 provide three important implications for the study of portfolio allocation. First, the party leader's faction tends to take more portfolios than its seat share within the party, which appears to be consistent with the argument about formateur advantage in the coalition government literature. Second, there is also considerable variation over time. The party leader's faction does not always receive many more portfolios than its seat share. On occasion the party leader's faction even receives fewer portfolios than its seat share. These deviations from proportionality are not generated by the “lumpiness” in translating seat shares into portfolios or by the salience of particular portfolios: the pattern of allocation is almost identical even when portfolios are weighted by their salience. Third, many of these allocations occur without new elections. The party leader often reshuffles the cabinet and alters the allocation even when the power balance between factions remains the same. These results imply that factors other than the seat share also affect intraparty portfolio allocation.         "

"6","Note: The vertical dotted lines indicate the times when the power balance between factions changed due to parliamentary elections.                     "
"7","Mershon (2001) examines portfolio allocations among factions in the Italian Christian Democratic Party. She argues that factions’ ideological locations as well as their choice of coalition partners influence their shares of cabinet portfolios because the cost of building a coalition government with other parties is different among factions. However, her explanation does not apply to the variation in portfolio allocations within the LDP, because it has maintained a single‐party majority for a long time and had little need to establish a coalition government. In the next section, I develop a theoretical framework that accounts for variation in intraparty allocation outcomes. I then present hypotheses for testing the theoretical predictions.         "
"8","In many parties, party members give authority to a leader to overcome collective action dilemmas because rational behavior for individual members may lead to undesirable outcomes in the legislature (Aldrich 1995; Cox and McCubbins 1993). In order to enforce party discipline, the leader facilitates coordination among party members who are formally equal members in the parliament. However, the leader is not necessarily able to control the party and punish defectors effectively because he always faces challenges from internal rivals who also want to become party leader (Strøm and Müller 1999). Even after party members choose a party leader, internal rivals can replace the incumbent leader at any time if they secure support from a majority of the party. Furthermore, they can also block the passage of their party's bills in the parliament to cause some political embarrassment for the leader.         "
"9","The party leader is not helpless, however. For one thing, he can strategically allocate cabinet portfolios among his party's members to prevent challenges from internal rivals. The cabinet positions work as selective incentives for party members, because holding these positions increases their political influence in the party as well as the government. It is also indispensable for party members to gain experience in several important positions if they want to be promoted to a higher rank in the party.8 Hence, the leaders of party factions strive to distribute as many portfolios as possible to their members in order to earn faction members’ loyalty. Similarly, by allocating cabinet portfolios, the party leader can attempt to gain sufficient support from faction leaders to control the party. In other words, the party leader can use his authority to allocate portfolios as an instrument to fend off challenges from internal rivals; therefore, the likelihood of challenge from rivals should affect the allocation of cabinet portfolios within the party.         "
"10","The political strategy explanation predicts a clear pattern of behavior: the fear of being replaced motivates the party leader to surrender many cabinet portfolios to his rival factions. The party leader wants to give preferential treatment to his fellow faction members, but he cannot always do what he wants due to the fear of replacement. Thus, the party leader provides his faction's members with many portfolios when he is strong enough to fend off challenges from internal rivals, but he gives up some portfolios in order to prevent his rivals from usurping his power when he is not strong enough to control the party. Consequently, the party leader's faction receives fewer portfolios as the risk of internal threats increases."
"11","The likelihood of being challenged by internal rivals can be affected by the environment in which the party leader is competing. In the case of the LDP, the leader is chosen through a competition between rival factions. In selecting a party leader, faction leaders mobilize their faction members to provide support for a particular candidate by helping them with their reelection and career advancement (Cox, Rosenbluth, and Thies 2000; Curtis 1988; Ramseyer and Rosenbluth 1993).9 The party leader is able to control the party and remain in power so long as no other rivals command a majority in the party. When no faction has a majority by itself, removing the party leader from power requires cooperation among rival factions. It is not always an easy task for rival factions to cooperate, however, because they are also in competition with one another for influence. By deploying portfolios as selective incentives, the incumbent leader can play one faction against another to prevent them from becoming united against him. The difficulty of cooperation among rival factions should also increase along with the number of factions: the more factions, the more alternatives to the incumbent leader, and the more susceptible rival factions become to the manipulation by the incumbent leader. In other words, when the party is fragmented into many factions, internal rivals cannot jointly organize a challenge to the incumbent leader as easily. Hence, the fear of replacement becomes weaker as the number of factions increases. This line of argument generates the following hypothesis:            "
"12","                              "
"13","Hypothesis 1: An increase in the number of party factions increases the party leader faction's portfolio share.                  "
"14","The party leader's characteristics also affect the likelihood he faces challenges from internal rivals. A party leader is elected either at the party's national convention or as a result of backroom negotiation between faction leaders. In either case, a candidate for the party leadership position has to form a factional alliance within the party in order to win (see Leiserson 1968). Barriers of various sorts between some factions, such as personal enmity, historical lineage, and some minor differences in policy orientation, may prevent them from entering a coalition together. However, every candidate mobilizes his or her faction's members as a first step toward commanding a majority and only then attempts to gain support from other factions.10 If the party leader's faction is in an advantageous position to assemble a majority in the party, other rivals cannot easily replace the incumbent leader. Therefore, the party leader who leads a faction with strong bargaining power should be less likely to face challenges from internal rivals.            "
"15","The party leader's internal strength, however, does not conclusively determine the fate of party leaders. The party leader's external popularity also affects the likelihood of his being challenged from internal rivals because even internally weak leaders can stay in power by gaining massive public support. A party leader's popularity among voters is one of his most important political assets for controlling the party and staying in power. In hiring and firing a party leader, party members care about the public attitude toward their party because the party's brand name affects their chances of reelection. The party leader plays a significant role in maintaining the party's brand name and attempts to impress the electorate in order to win the trust of voters (see Bean and Mughan 1989; Ramseyer and Rosenbluth 1993). Indeed, the opinion poll data on the LDP indicate the party leader's reputation boosts the party's popularity, but not the other way around (Burden 2005). Hence, a popular party leader can prevent his rivals from usurping his power, and a party leader should be less likely to face challenges from internal rivals when he is a popular figure among the broader public.            "
"16","The two characteristics of the party leader—his internal strength in commanding a majority of the party and his external popularity among the broader public—can affect the chance of his being replaced by internal rivals. Moreover, these characteristics are tied together to the fate of the party leader in an interactive manner because having either one of them is sufficient to prevent his internal rivals from usurping his power. When the party leader's faction is internally strong, he is unlikely to face challenges from internal rivals even if he is not externally popular among the public. This is because internal rivals cannot easily assemble a majority within the party to replace the incumbent leader; thus, unpopular leaders can cope effectively with challenges from internal rivals by having a solid support base within the party. In this case, therefore, the party leader's external popularity has only a small additive effect on the likelihood of his being challenged by internal rivals. Indeed, Eisaku Sato—an internally strong but externally unpopular leader of the LDP—remained in power longer than any other LDP leader.11 In contrast, when the party leader's faction is internally weak, the leader can prevent challenges from internal rivals only if he enjoys massive popularity among the public. Typically, a party leader who is popular in the broader public is unlikely to be deposed from the leadership position because internal rivals do not want to devalue their party's public reputation by replacing a popular leader. For instance, Yasuhiro Nakasone—an internally weak leader of the LDP in the 1980s—successfully prevented challenges from his rivals for a long time by maintaining great external popularity. Thus, the effect of the party leader's external popularity on the likelihood of replacement should vary depending on the internal strength of the party leader's faction, and vice versa. This line of argument generates the following hypotheses:            "
"17","                              "
"18","Hypothesis 2a: If the party leader leads an internally strong faction, his faction's portfolio share increases.                  "
"19","Hypothesis 2b: Even if the party leader leads an internally weak faction, his faction's portfolio share increases if the party leader is externally popular in the public.                  "
"20","In order to test the hypotheses, I assembled data on all portfolio allocations in the LDP government between 1960 and 2007. The dataset includes reshuffled cabinets as well as original ones but excludes cabinets in which the LDP did not hold the premiership. Information about the factional affiliation of LDP members was collected using the directory of members in Kokkai Binran, which has been issued at least twice a year since 1954.         "
"21","The dependent variable is Portfolio share—the share of cabinet portfolios given to the party leader's faction. In calculating the number of cabinet portfolios, I include party executive positions, such as Vice Party President (Fukusosai), Chief Secretary (Kanjicho), Chief Executive Council (Somu kaicho), and Policy Affairs Chief (Seicho kaicho), because these positions have been considered to be equivalent to or more important than cabinet ministers (Sato and Matsuzaki 1986, 51).12 The positions that are given to nonparliamentary members, upper house members, and independents—party members with no factional affiliation—are excluded because the dynamic of allocation for these members is different.13 The existing literature also excludes these members from the analysis (Ishikawa 1984; Kawato 1996).14 Thus, I focus only on the positions given to the lower house members who affiliate with any one of the factions.            "
"22","There is some concern about treating every cabinet portfolio equally in the dependent variable, because it may not accurately reflect the power allocated by a party leader. For instance, some cabinet positions may be more important than others. Indeed, the result of an expert survey conducted by Kato and Laver (1998) indicates that such positions as Finance Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister are given relatively higher salience scores compared to other positions in Japan.15 In order to take into account the relative importance of cabinet positions in assessing the faction's share of power that party leaders and factions most care about, I employ the following two weighted measures as well as one measure without any weights.            "
"23","The two weighted measures are constructed from seniority of LDP members appointed to cabinet positions between 1960 and 2007. Seniority—the degree to which the members have experience in national politics—is measured by the number of terms that they have previously served in the parliament.16 Most cabinet ministers are chosen from among the members of parliament. Moreover, seniority determines their career advancement. Among LDP members, more experienced senior members tend to be assigned to more important positions. They usually serve as a junior minister or as a committee chair in the parliament until they become a senior member (Epstein et al. 1997), and then they are offered a cabinet post in their sixth term or later (Curtis 1988; Sato and Matsuzaki 1986). Similar kinds of seniority rules exist in many parliamentary democracies. For instance, in Western European countries, cabinet ministers are often chosen from among senior members in the parliament. According to de Winter (1991), the average length of their previous experience as a member of parliament is about nine years. Hence, I believe it is reasonable to assume that the seniority of members who serve as cabinet ministers reflects the importance of cabinet portfolios.            "
"24","I construct the weighted measures by using the seniority information in two distinct ways: (1) salience scores and (2) relative seniority. The first measure attaches a salience score, which is drawn from the average seniority among members who have been assigned to the position between 1960 and 2007, to each cabinet portfolio. Since the Central Government Reform in 2001 greatly changed cabinet‐level ministries and agencies, I produce salience scores before and after the reform separately. Table 1 summarizes the average seniority, standard deviation, and salience score for each portfolio. In this measure, the salience score of an average portfolio has been normalized to one. The salience score is above one for a more important position and below one for a less important position.17 The resulting salience scores are highly correlated with the ones based on an expert survey conducted by Kato and Laver (1998).18 This high‐correlation outcome suggests that my objective measure of salience based on seniority closely reflects the subjective perception among country experts about the prestige of the post.            "
"25","The second measure creates a weighted portfolio share by calculating the relative seniority of members appointed from individual factions in each cabinet. In contrast to the first measurement, which assumes the relative importance of a cabinet position is uniform across cabinets, the second measure directly applies the seniority of members appointed in each cabinet as a weight assuming that the relative importance may vary across cabinets over time. Table 2 presents an example drawn from the allocation made by the leader of the LDP in 1978. The table shows the number of portfolios assigned to all factions and to the party leader's faction for each category of seniority. In this example, the party leader's faction sends six members to the cabinet, and their seniority is 41 in total. Since the total seniority of all members in this cabinet is 177, the weighted share of the party leader's faction is given as 23%. I calculate the weighted portfolio share in the same manner for each cabinet.            "
"26","There are three explanatory variables. The first variable is Party fragmentation, which is described by the number of factions within the party. A party leader is able to enjoy some advantage when the party is highly fragmented because it is difficult for internal rivals to jointly organize a challenge to the leader. Hence, the number of factions within the party affects its competitive environment. Since each faction is not an equally powerful actor, I adopt the effective number of factions that takes each faction's size into account (Laakso and Taagepera 1979) as a measure of party fragmentation. The effective number of factions is calculated as follows:  where pi is the parliamentary seat share of the ith faction within the party.19"
"27","The second explanatory variable is Internal strength, which describes how much of an advantage the party leader's faction has in assembling a majority coalition within the party. In this article, I employ the Shapley‐Shubik index (Shapley and Shubik 1954)—one of the best‐known measures of bargaining power in the tradition of cooperative game theory—to describe the party leader's internal strength.20 This power index lies in the range of zero to one, and its value gets closer to one as a faction becomes more critical to winning a majority in the party.21 The power‐index scores are calculated based on the number of faction members who have seats in the parliament, as they are the main actors in selecting a party leader of the LDP.            "
"28","The third explanatory variable is External popularity, which describes the party leader's external popularity among the broader public. The external popularity is measured by the results of public opinion polls conducted at the time when the portfolio allocation was made (Jiji tsushinsha 1981, 1992). The party leader's popularity sometimes drops, but it does not immediately lead to the replacement of the leader. The possibility of removal rises when an unpopular leader devalues the party's brand name. That is, the party leader faces challenges from internal rivals when his approval rating falls below the party's approval rating (see Burden 2005).22 Thus, I take the difference between the party leader's approval rating and the party's approval rating to measure the extent to which the party leader is popular relative to the party.23"
"29","I employ Seat share—the seat share of the party leader's faction—as a control variable in order to control the effect of the party leader faction's size, because the size of the party leader's faction tends to decrease as the number of factions increases.24 Moreover, seat share has been a main explanatory variable in the literature on portfolio allocation. I use the number of seats that the party holds in the lower house as a denominator to calculate the seat share.25"
"30","I test my hypotheses using beta maximum‐likelihood estimation because the dependent variable is a proportion (see Paolino 2001).26 As a dependent variable, I use three measures of the party leader faction's portfolio share: one measure without weights and two measures with weights. There are four models for each type of dependent variable. The results of all 12 models are shown in Table 3, with robust standard errors where individual party leaders are the clusters.27"
"31","The first message from the results in Table 3 is that the seat share does not fully explain the share of cabinet portfolios that goes to the party leader's faction. The findings suggest that the party leader faction's portfolio share increases with its seat share; however, unlike the prediction made by Gamson's Law, the party leader faction's portfolio share does not appear to be proportional to its seat share. The coefficient estimate of seat share shows that a 10‐percentage‐point increase in the seat share leads to only about a 5‐percentage‐point increase in the portfolio share. This difference implies that, in addition to the faction's seat share, there are other factors that explain portfolio allocations within the party.28"
"32","The second message drawn from the results in Table 3 is that the party leader's faction takes more portfolios as the number of factions increases. The coefficient estimate of party fragmentation is positive and statistically significant. The difference between the party leader faction's portfolio share when the number of factions is maximum and when it is minimum is about 10 percentage points, which implies that high party fragmentation provides the party leader's faction with up to two additional portfolios. This effect is substantially large enough to conclude that the evidence supports Hypothesis 1. This result suggests that the party leader can be a powerful actor where his party's members are not effectively organizing themselves.         "
"33","The third message drawn from Table 3 is about the effect of the party leader's characteristics on his faction's portfolio share. The interpretation of the two coefficients describing the party leader's characteristics is not simple because there is an interaction between them. The coefficient estimate of internal strength describes the effect of the party leader's internal strength on his faction's portfolio share when the party leader's external popularity is zero (i.e., the lowest value in the sample). Similarly, the coefficient estimate of external popularity describes the effect of the party leader's external popularity on his faction's portfolio share when the party leader's internal strength is zero (i.e., the smallest value in the sample). My theory suggests that these coefficients should be positive because these factors increase the party leader's portfolio share when the other factor is absent. For instance, the party leader's external popularity increases his faction's portfolio share when the party leader is internally weak. The results show that both coefficients are positive as predicted and statistically significant.         "
"34","These results support Hypotheses 2a and 2b, but they are not sufficient to confirm these hypotheses because they further predict that the effect of the party leader's external popularity on his faction's portfolio share should vary depending on the party leader's internal strength. Since the effect of one factor is mediated by the presence of the other factor, I illustrate graphically the marginal effect of the party leader's external popularity on his faction's portfolio share across the range of his faction's internal strength in Figure 2.29 The black sloped line in each figure indicates how the marginal effect of the party leader's external popularity changes as his faction gains more internal strength. The upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval are drawn along the black line. The three figures correspond to the results of the three full models (Model 4, Model 8, and Model 12) in Table 3, respectively. Besides the marginal effect figures, Figure 2 also provides figures of the predicted portfolio share that goes to the party leader's faction, while holding the value of his external popularity at 1.5 standard deviations above the average (Line A) and at 1.5 standard deviations below the average (Line B). Other variables are held constant at their mean values. The gray shaded area displays the region where the predicted portfolio share is lower than the proportional share.         "
"35","                Marginal Effect of External Popularity and Predicted Portfolio Share."
"36","Note: Gray area shows the region where the predicted portfolio share is below the proportional share.                     "
"37","Figure 2 demonstrates that when the party leader's faction is internally strong, the party leader's external popularity makes only a small (or no significant) difference to his faction's portfolio share; however, as the party leader leads an internally weaker faction, his external popularity has a larger positive effect on his faction's portfolio share. That is to say, as shown in the predicted figures, the party leader's faction takes fewer portfolios than its seat share when his faction is internally weak and when he is not popular in the public; however, the party leader's faction gains more portfolios than its seat share either when his faction is internally strong or when he is externally popular. These results demonstrate that Hypotheses 2a and 2b are strongly supported by the evidence, suggesting that the party leader changes the allocation of cabinet portfolios depending on the likelihood of his being challenged from internal rivals and surrenders more portfolios as he becomes more vulnerable to challenges.30"
"38","The main message of this study is that portfolio allocation is an important means for party leaders to overcome internal divisions within the party. Party leaders seek to enforce discipline among their party's members to ensure their cooperation in the parliament. However, they are not always able to punish defectors effectively, because party members have the option of supporting an alternative leader who may give them a better deal. To prevent rivals from usurping their power, party leaders use the allocation of cabinet portfolios as a form of selective incentive. The threat of removal from the leadership position, therefore, affects intraparty portfolio allocation."
"39","In support of this argument, this study examined original data on portfolio allocations in the LDP of Japan that measured the party leader's characteristics as well as the competitive environment within the party. The case of the LDP is particularly useful because it enables us to conduct an extensive empirical analysis on portfolio allocation within a single party over a long period of time. Moreover, since the LDP has explicit internal divisions in the form of factions, the interests of the party's members are distinguishable from one another in a very systematic manner in analyzing the intraparty bargaining. The findings suggest that, in contrast to the existing literature on portfolio allocation, cabinet portfolios are not simply allocated among party factions depending on their parliamentary seat shares; in fact, the party leader's faction surrenders more portfolios as he becomes more vulnerable to challenges posed by internal rivals. The results support the idea that party leaders use their authority to allocate portfolios strategically to prevent defections and challenges from internal rivals.31"
"40","This study's theoretical framework informs our understanding of the bargaining dynamics in other political parties that do not share the particular characteristics of the LDP. For instance, in the LDP, highly institutionalized factions fight for intraparty control. Yet, similar intraparty disputes exist even within parties that do not have institutionalized factions, because some party members still have to suppress their policy preferences for the sake of party unity. Thus, all party leaders face challenges posed by internal rivals who seek their positions. The findings of this study suggest that party leaders give many portfolios to their own supporters when serious internal rivals are absent or when internal rivals have failed to unify party members to organize a challenge against the leader. Moreover, publicly popular leaders also provide many portfolios to their intraparty supporters. This was indeed the case when Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister between 1979 and 1990, allocated cabinet portfolios within the Conservative Party (Indridason and Kam 2008; Kam and Indridason 2005; Norton 1990). Consistent with the logic of this study, while Thatcher surrendered many cabinet posts to the members of her rival groups in her first term, she weeded out these disloyal members from her cabinet as she became a more popular and powerful figure within the party.32"
"41","The LDP's leaders are also minimally constrained by policy considerations in the process of portfolio allocation because LDP factions cannot easily be distinguished in terms of policy. In contrast, in some parties, intraparty factions are organized around policy lines.33 For instance, factions in the Italian Christian Democrats had clear differences in their policy preferences (Zuckerman 1979). The party leader's policy position may affect how much power he can wield within the party in this case because, as suggested in the study of coalition governments (Martin and Stevenson 2001), a faction should have the most leverage when its policy position is located at the center of the party. Indeed, the left‐right median factions in the Christian Democrats tended to sacrifice the least in portfolio allocations (Mershon 2001). Although the strength of party leaders in such a case may be derived differently than in the LDP, party leaders still have to deal with internal rivals and allocate portfolios with consideration to their relative strength.         "
"42","The strength of party leaders may also be different due to institutional factors. In the LDP government, one person holds both the party presidency and the nation's premiership. This simultaneous occupancy of powerful positions allows the leader to wield unilateral authority to allocate portfolios. In some parliamentary democracies, however, the party presidency and the premiership are held by different leaders (e.g., the Christian Democrats in Italy). When one powerful individual at the helm of one faction occupies the premiership and another heading a rival faction holds the party presidency, portfolio allocation will be a tug‐of‐war between these leaders with different intraparty supporters as they fight for control of the party. The allocation mechanism should still work according to the logic of this study. A similar dynamic can be observed in semipresidential systems (Amorim Neto and Strøm 2006), where two different leaders who share powerful positions compete to exert influence on portfolio allocation. The leaders use portfolio allocation to fend off challenges to their power.         "
"43","Capitalizing on the characteristics of the LDP, this study argued and demonstrated that the leader of a governing party tries to use portfolio allocation—an intrinsic part of the government formation process—as a tool to stave off internal challenges to his power. The use of that tool affects the share of portfolios given to his (more or less institutionalized) segment of the party. Furthermore, the use of that tool varies according to the leader's external popularity, since the leader does much to protect and communicate his party's brand name. Testing the argument is most straightforward for parties in single‐party government with highly institutionalized factions, but could in principle be carried out for other parties. While the institutionalization of internal divisions varies across parties and while the sources of party leaders’ strength vary to some degree across parties, all party leaders face internal rivals within the party and must be attentive to their external support in the electorate. Thus, the argument should hold for parliamentary democracies in general."
