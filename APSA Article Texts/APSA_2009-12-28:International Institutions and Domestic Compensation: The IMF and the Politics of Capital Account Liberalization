"1","There is substantial cross‐national and temporal variation in financial liberalization since the decline of the Bretton Woods international monetary system in the early 1970s.2 Whereas most countries gradually relaxed their controls on capital flows during the 1980s and 1990s, the advanced democracies remain more open, on average, than developing countries (see Figure 1). Developing countries also demonstrate more variation in their liberalization efforts compared to the advanced countries, which today are largely free of de jure capital controls.         "

"4","How can we explain the extent and timing of financial liberalization around the world since the 1970s? Scholars have examined international pressures as well as domestic interest groups, ideologies, and political institutions. At the systemic level, scholars have identified increasing international interdependence—including increased trade and the “exogenous easing of international exchange”—along with balance‐of‐payments difficulties as drivers of liberalization (Frieden and Rogowski 1996; Goodman and Pauly 1993; Haggard and Maxfield 1996). However, systemic‐level arguments are unable to explain the wide variation in the timing and extent of liberalization across the world. A more recent line of scholarship suggests that international diffusion—in which countries are influenced by their “peers” due to geographical proximity, emulation, or financial market pressures—is a powerful determinant of capital account liberalization (Brune and Guisinger 2007; Garrett et al. 2001; Simmons and Elkins 2004). And finally, scholars have focused on a variety of domestic political and institutional characteristics, such as partisanship (e.g., Brooks and Kurtz 2007; Kastner and Rector 2003; Quinn 1997; Quinn and Inclán 1997), societal interest groups and voter preferences (e.g., Frieden 1991; Li and Smith 2002a, 2002b; Quinn and Toyoda 2007; Sobel 1994), epistemic communities (Chwieroth 2007a), and rent‐seeking politicians (Leblang 1997).         "
"5","The IMF generally enters the literature in simplistic fashion as a coercive influence, often as one of a litany of control variables. A few studies, including Abiad and Mody (2005), Brune and Guisinger (2007), Quinn and Toyoda (2007), and Simmons and Elkins (2004), include a dichotomous control variable for country participation in an IMF program, with the assumption that the IMF might require liberalization as a condition for continued borrowing. It is important to note that these studies do not account for countries’ nonrandom participation in IMF programs or the magnitude of those programs. Simmons and Elkins (2004), for example, find that the extension of IMF credit is associated with transitions to more restrictive capital controls, but note that this finding most likely reflects the conditions that caused the country to seek IMF assistance rather than the influence of the IMF itself. On the other hand, Chwieroth (2005) finds that a dichotomous measure of participation in an IMF program is associated with capital account liberalization after controlling for selection bias in a relatively small sample of 34 countries over a 13‐year period; the magnitude of IMF assistance, however, is not statistically significant.         "
"6","It is not unreasonable to think that IMF programs should be associated with financial liberalization. In its early days, the IMF was a champion of capital controls, but its stance began to change in the early 1980s as economists in the United States and Europe came to appreciate the benefits of capital mobility for economic efficiency and risk management (Abdelal 2007; Chwieroth 2007b, 2008). Despite the shift in its policy stance, the IMF has rarely imposed capital account liberalization as an explicit condition for financial assistance (IMF 2005a; Quinn and Toyoda 2007).3 This fact leads to the question: how, if at all, does the IMF exert influence on financial openness in borrowing countries?         "
"7","To answer this question, we argue that IMF programs provide a political shield for governments to relax capital flow restrictions. As an IMF program is being negotiated, political leaders use the opportunity to promulgate economic reforms that they otherwise would not have the political capital to implement. The logic can be called “political cover”: governments can shift blame for these costly reforms onto the IMF, thereby shielding themselves (at least partially) against political opposition (Remmer 1986; Vreeland 2003).4 As Vreeland notes, “the executive can push through more of its reform program with the additional bargaining leverage that an IMF agreement brings” (2003, 14). In many cases, governments use “letters of intent” (LOIs) as a tool to commit to these reforms (IMF 2005a). LOIs describe the policy changes that governments plan to make in the context of their request for emergency financial assistance. Governments generally confirm the formal conditions imposed by the IMF in these letters, but they also have an opportunity to commit to additional reforms. The fact that these reforms are clearly delineated in the letters implies that governments can legitimately claim that their “hands are tied” ex post. Governments can also make such commitments in memoranda attached to LOIs and in supplementary program documents (IMF 2005a).         "
"8","As an example, consider the relationship between India and the IMF in 1991. India was in the midst of a severe fiscal crisis, and the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi during the May election campaign led to the emergence of a fragile minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao. The new government requested an IMF Stand‐by arrangement later that year. As Stephan Haggard (1995) notes, the Rao government was not in a strong position to initiate substantial economic reforms, but the publicity surrounding the negotiations with the IMF provided Rao with much‐needed political cover. Indeed, the IMF loan plan—along with speculations about the austere reforms that the IMF would demand—was front‐page news for several days.5 The IMF did in fact include fiscal austerity, regulatory reform, and a revamping of industrial policy as formal conditions in its loan program, but it was the Indian government itself that made an additional commitment to gradual capital account liberalization in its LOI (IMF 2005a). For the public at large, there was no discernible distinction between the IMF's formal conditions and the Indian government's own reform commitments. In a speech to the nation, Prime Minister Rao stated that an IMF rescue was the only viable remedy for the financial crisis and that opening India's borders to foreign investment was one of the many reforms that the government would undertake as part of the IMF program.6"
"9","Of course, not all IMF programs are as large and prominent as India's 1991 Stand‐by arrangement. India's rescue package was sufficiently large—more than $3 billion—to provide the necessary political cover for the government's reform efforts.7 In general, large IMF loans attract international and domestic publicity and thereby provide a window of opportunity for governments to act.8 For example, when modest‐sized Uruguay received a whopping $3 billion loan from the IMF in 2002, the government faced tremendous pressure from international investors and rating agencies to reform the economy and generate the foreign exchange necessary to service the debt. Smaller IMF rescue packages are less effective as political shields, because it is more difficult for governments to contribute their own unpopular reform commitments to programs that garner less public attention—especially when these programs contain fewer or less strenuous formal conditions.         "
"10","We argue that political cover is a necessary but not sufficient condition for liberalization. The relaxation of capital controls often leads to a variety of disruptions, including spikes in unemployment, increases in income volatility, interest‐rate increases, and banking instability (Brooks 2004; Eichengreen 1999; Wibbels 2006; Wihlborg and Willett 1997). These distributional costs could easily outweigh the economic benefits of financial liberalization. For this reason, we expect that a government's decision to relax capital controls under an IMF program will reflect its capacity and commitment to compensate domestic groups that are harmed by liberalization. Government spending on welfare—including pensions, family allowances, and other redistributive fiscal programs—mitigates the negative impact of liberalization. For example, liberalization can lead to a sudden inflow of capital and a subsequent appreciation of the real exchange rate, which could translate into higher prices for domestic consumers and declining profits for exporters. A government‐supplied safety net can help to offset the resulting volatility in household income and attenuate domestic opposition. Moreover, when a system of welfare expenditures is firmly in place, a government's promises to compensate the losers from liberalization will be credible ex ante. As Brooks notes, “where social insurance mechanisms are underfunded, however, governments will have scarce means to ameliorate the social costs of financial openness, and thus may risk a powerful social backlash and loss of political support unless capital account liberalization is attenuated” (2004, 408). Indeed, we argue that welfare spending is a key enabling factor for the influence of the IMF.         "
"11","We posit that the interaction between the IMF and a borrowing country unfolds as follows. First, a country experiences a balance‐of‐payments crisis for exogenous reasons and seeks assistance from the IMF. The IMF offers a stabilization program whose amount is determined in part by the magnitude of the borrowing country's financial troubles, but mostly by a variety of geopolitical and global financial factors, including the exposure of U.S. financial institutions to the country's markets, the composition of the country's debts, the availability of supplementary financing, and the country's extent of trade and finance with the “G‐5” countries (see, e.g., Broz 2005; Broz and Hawes 2006; Copelovitch forthcoming; Gould 2003; Oatley and Yackee 2004; Stone 2008). In certain circumstances the IMF has provided loans that exceed the amount that borrowing countries are eligible to receive based on their “quotas,” while at other times the IMF has been relatively stingy in its financial assistance. Copelovitch (forthcoming) notes that the correlation between IMF loan size and external debt as a percentage of GDP (a key measure of a country's financial difficulties) is in fact slightly negative. Moreover, repeat borrowers receive varying amounts of funding from the IMF over time, not necessarily in line with the severity of their funding shortages. The size of a loan, in short, is not a simple indicator of the magnitude of the country's current financial difficulties.         "
"12","Regardless of its determinants, a loan from the IMF must be repaid. A large loan triggers not only a need for foreign capital to shore up the borrower's financial position, but also a heightened degree of attention from international actors and high expectations for policy reform. This environment provides an opportunity for governments to initiate reforms above and beyond those required by the IMF. For example, when Hungary received a $1.6 billion stand‐by arrangement in 1991, Hungarian policy makers seized upon the highly politicized environment to open the domestic banking sector to foreign direct investment and enact other reform measures that exceeded what the IMF had formally required (IMF 2005a). The Hungarian government, in short, wielded the burden of a sizeable loan from the IMF as a shield against interest groups that favored financial closure and used its letter of intent to commit to liberalization. But not all governments will seize the opportunity to enact additional reforms. Given the political cover of an IMF program, a government's response will reflect its domestic welfare system. Hungary, for example, had a substantial welfare system (with expenditures in excess of 15% of GDP) during the 1990s. In short, a large loan opens a window of opportunity for a borrowing government to enact unpopular reforms, and it creates its own incentives to attract foreign capital to help repay the loan; whether or not the government seizes the opportunity to liberalize depends on its capacity for offsetting the negative distributional consequences of financial openness.9 The preceding discussion leads to our main hypothesis:         "
"13","                        "
"14"," H1: IMF loans will have a positive effect on the level of capital account liberalization conditional upon the level of welfare spending in borrowing countries.                  "
"15","As mentioned earlier, the challenge in ascertaining the influence of the IMF on a government's policy choices is that an IMF program itself may be epiphenomenal: that is, the factors that lead a country to select into an IMF program may also determine its subsequent policy behavior. We also noted that participation of countries in IMF programs is not random and that countries select into IMF programs when they experience macroeconomic difficulties. Moreover, IMF loans are offered to nations only after they choose to participate in IMF programs. We therefore require a modeling strategy that accounts for countries’ nonrandom participation in IMF programs. A typical strategy for controlling for selection bias is to use a Heckman selection model (e.g., Vreeland 2003). However, in addition to selection bias, we face two econometric challenges.         "
"16","First, some scholars claim that geographic (i.e., spatial) proximity affects the diffusion of capital account liberalization because countries are influenced by the policy actions of neighboring countries (Brune and Guisinger 2007; Simmons and Elkins 2004). Tests reveal the presence of spatial dependence in financial liberalization across the countries in our sample (described below), and therefore it is imperative that we account for spatial dependence in our model.10 Second, tests conducted on our data indicate that country participation in IMF programs exhibits regional clustering.11 For example, many Latin American nations participated in IMF programs in the mid‐1980s and mid‐1990s; similarly, many Southeast Asian countries participated in IMF programs in the late 1990s. Since participation of countries in IMF programs is potentially characterized by clustering, we should control for this possibility as well to avoid bias.         "
"17","To address these challenges, we estimate a spatial autoregressive errors sample selection model (hereafter SAE selection model) that specifies spatially autocorrelated disturbances in both the selection and outcome equations. This model is defined (see Flores‐Lagunes and Schnier 2006) after dropping subscript t for time for notational convenience, as:            "
"18","Researchers suggest that a key component of the diffusion mechanism operates via geographic proximity (e.g., Franzese and Hays 2006). Because geographic proximity may be a driver of the diffusion of financial liberalization, we operationalize spatial contiguity as the inverse distance between states i and j, where cij = 1/dij. As the distance between i and j increases (decreases), cij decreases (increases), giving less (more) spatial weight to the state pair when i ≠ j. We use a “minimum distance database” of the shortest distance between the two closest physical locations for every pair of independent polities in the world.13 The results remain robust when using alternative measures of diffusion that are described below.         "
"19","We adopt the Heckman procedure within a generalized method of moments (GMM) framework to estimate the statistical model in equations (1) and (2) (see Flores‐Lagunes and Schnier 2006). Stated briefly, we estimate the selection equation, which predicts participation in IMF programs via a spatial probit model.14 Using the estimates from the selection equation, we compute the “spatial adjusted” inverse Mills ratio (IMR), , which is included in the model's outcome equation to correct for selection bias that may occur because of nonrandom participation of countries in IMF programs.15 We include country fixed effects in the outcome equation to control for unobserved country‐specific heterogeneity.16"
"20","We construct a time‐series cross‐sectional (TSCS) dataset of 87 countries observed from 1975 to 2002 to test Hypothesis 1. The countries in our sample are listed in Table 1. We operationalize the dependent variable in the outcome equation, capital account liberalization, which is denoted as capital liberalization, using a recently developed continuous index by Chinn and Ito (2006). The index is derived from four indicators reported in the IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions: the existence of multiple exchange rates, restrictions on capital account transactions, restrictions on current account transactions, and requirements to surrender export proceeds. The resulting measure is a 0–5 continuous index for all country‐years in our sample.17 Higher values indicate greater degrees of liberalization.18 Although the Chinn and Ito (2006) index is widely used by scholars to measure capital account openness (e.g., Brooks and Kurtz 2007), we checked the robustness of our results by employing two alternative measures of the dependent variable. These robustness test results are discussed in the next section.         "
"21","We also require a dichotomous measure for the incidence of an IMF program, which constitutes the dependent variable in the selection equation. The IMF provides loans to countries under eight main types of stabilization programs: Stand‐by and extended stand‐by arrangement, Supplementary Reserve Facility, Extended Fund Facility, Contingency Funding Facility, Buffer Stock Funding Facility, Currency Stabilization Facility, Structural Adjustment Fund, and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.19 We thus code the dependent variable in the selection equation, IMF Program, as 1 when the IMF offers loans under any of these eight types of programs, and 0 otherwise. Data for IMF Program are from Barro and Lee (2002), Hutchison (2001), IMF (2004), and Vreeland (2003).         "
"22","The first independent variable, IMF Loan, is operationalized as the IMF's loan amount as a percent of the borrowing country's GDP. Data for this variable come from World Bank (2006, 2007) and IMF (2004, 2006, 2007) and include each of the eight types of IMF programs listed above. The second independent variable is the level of welfare spending, Welfare, which we operationalize as government expenditure on social security and welfare as a percentage of GDP.20 Data for this variable come from World Bank (2007) and IMF (2007). We expect that IMF loans will have a positive effect on the level of capital account liberalization conditional upon the level of welfare spending in borrowing countries. To test this hypothesis, we interact IMF Loan with Welfare and introduce the interaction term IMF Loan × Welfare as well as its individual components in the outcome equation. We expect that the coefficient of the interaction term will be positive.            "
"23","We include several control variables in the selection and outcome equations. We suggested earlier that countries that experience serious macroeconomic problems are more likely to participate in IMF programs. We thus include three macroeconomic variables in the selection equation. First, we include Output Loss measured as the magnitude of growth contraction relative to the underlying growth trend where a Hodrick‐Prescott filter was used to estimate the underlying growth trend.21 This measure is commonly used in the financial economics literature (see Boyd, Sungkyu, and Smith 2005). Second, we include the dummy variable Banking Crisis which equals 1 if the country is experiencing a systemic banking crisis and zero otherwise; this variable is based on Dell’Ariccia, Detragiache, and Rajan's (2008) operationalization of systemic banking crises as situations where nonperforming loans reach at least 10% of total financial assets and when emergency measures—such as bank holidays, deposit freezes, etc.—are taken to assist the banking system.22 Third, we include the variable Terms of Trade Shock measured for each country‐year in the selection equation.23 Terms of trade shocks may engender macroeconomic imbalances that encourage governments to self‐select into IMF programs.            "
"24","We also incorporate several control variables identified in the existing literature on the determinants of IMF program participation. First, we include the dummy variable Lagged IMF Program (Bird 2003; Vreeland 2003). We also include the following economic variables in the selection equation: Log GDP per capita, Current Account, Log Reserves, and Log Inflation.24 Following Vreeland's (2004) suggestion that veto players are positively associated with IMF program participation, we incorporate the measure Veto Players, which is drawn from the “Checks” variable in World Bank (2008).            "
"25","Several political variables are included in the outcome equation to capture societal demands for liberalization and institutional constraints on policy makers. First, some scholars suggest that right‐leaning governments are more likely to pursue open capital accounts than left‐leaning governments (Brooks and Kurtz 2007; Kastner and Rector 2005). We therefore include a measure of government Partisanship from World Bank (2008) that codes the occupant of the executive's office as either left, center, or right. Scholars also suggest that a relatively large and well‐developed financial sector may put pressure on the government to liberalize the capital account (Frieden 1991; Sobel 1994). We thus include a measure of the size of the banking sector (Banking Sector), which is operationalized as deposit money bank assets as a share of GDP. Data for this variable are from Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2003) and Bank for International Settlements (2006). Finally, we control for Veto Players (Kastner and Rector 2003) and the level of Democracy (Marshall and Jaggers 2007).            "
"26","With respect to economic controls in the outcome equation, we follow extant studies and control for Log GDP and the log of GDP per capita. We introduce the lag of the dependent variable in the outcome equation as well as controls for Current Account, Trade Openness, and Budget Balance, all measured as a percentage of GDP. Since it is possible to obtain spurious correlations between data series that are trended, we include a linear Time Trend in the outcome equation. Existing research postulates a regional diffusion effect in which countries emulate capital account reforms adopted by neighboring nations (e.g., Simmons and Elkins 2004). We account for these dynamics in the outcome equation by controlling for the gap between the lag of the maximum level of capital liberalization in each region and the lagged level of each country's level of capital account openness, which we label Emulation.25 We also control for other mechanisms of diffusion and conduct a battery of robustness checks; these results are presented after our main results.            "
"27","We first present the estimates from the selection equation and then discuss the results from the outcome equation. Table 2 reports the selection equation results in which the dependent variable is the IMF program dummy. As indicated in the table, the specification for each selection equation performs well, correctly predicting about 90% of all observations in the sample. As expected, previous participation in IMF programs is the best predictor of current participation in IMF programs. Our expectation that countries are more likely to participate in IMF programs when they experience serious domestic macroeconomic problems is also borne out by the results in the selection equation since Banking Crisis and Output Loss are consistently positive and significant, while Terms of Trade Shock is weakly significant. Other factors with statistically significant effects include the log of GDP per capita, Log Reserves, and Log Inflation. However, Current Account and Veto Players do not statistically influence IMF participation. The estimate of the spatial autoregressive error parameter  in each selection equation is positive and statistically significant, indicating spatial dependence with respect to IMF program participation.         "
"28","Model 1 in Table 3 presents the results from the outcome equation where the dependent variable is Capital Liberalization. The coefficient of the interaction term IMF Loan × Welfare is positive and highly significant in model 1, which includes country fixed effects. Thus, as predicted in Hypothesis 1, it is the interaction of these two variables that statistically matters for capital account liberalization. We also estimated the model on a sample that excludes 21 advanced industrial OECD democracies since IMF loans are provided primarily to developing countries. The outcome equation results from this exercise for 67 developing countries are reported in Table 3 model 2, which includes fixed effects. The estimate of the interaction term IMF Loan × Welfare remains positive and highly significant at the 1% level in the outcome equation.         "
"29","To gain a full appreciation of the impact of IMF Loan × Welfare on capital account liberalization, we derive and analyze its substantive effect by using the results from the sample of developing countries in model 2 and the standard formula for computing the effect of interaction terms.26 We proceed in two steps. First, we find that increasing the level of IMF Loan by one standard deviation above its mean, while holding its companion variable Welfare and the other variables at their respective means in the sample, increases the degree of capital account liberalization by a substantial 15.3%. This result is significant at the 95% confidence level. Second, we illustrate the substantive effect of IMF Loan × Welfare in Figure 2, which displays the marginal effect and statistical significance of the IMF Loan variable over the range of values of the Welfare variable; this figure also indicates that the effect of the interaction term IMF Loan × Welfare is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.         "
"30","                 Effect of IMF Loan × Welfare on Capital Liberalization in Developing Countries                      "
"31","Unlike the strong statistical support for our main hypothesis, the estimate of the variable Democracy is statistically insignificant. The positive estimate of Partisanship is consistently significant in Table 3. This suggests that right‐leaning governments tend to favor higher levels of capital account openness. The estimate of Veto Players is negative but weakly significant, which supports Kastner and Rector's (2003) finding in a smaller sample that veto players tend to reduce or block change of capital account policies that favor liberalization. This finding is also consistent with Chwieroth's (2007a) argument that more veto players provide greater voice to domestic opposition to financial reform.         "
"32","The economic control variables, Log GDP per capita and Trade Openness, are significant and in the predicted direction while Log GDP is insignificant. The coefficient of Budget Balance is weakly significant in some models, while Lag Capital Liberalization is positive and highly significant. The estimate of Emulation and the spatial autoregressive parameter, , are positive and weakly significant in all the models, providing tentative evidence of the diffusion of capital account liberalization. Furthermore, the estimate of the adjusted IMR parameter is also significant in the outcome equation of the estimated models, which suggests that it is appropriate to account for the nonrandom participation of countries in IMF programs via an SAE selection model to avoid selection bias problems.         "
"33","For robustness tests we include the following additional controls: Log Reserves, Log Inflation, and GDP growth rate in the outcome equation; and Banking Sector and GDP growth rate in the selection equation. The last two columns in Table 2 report the results from the expanded selection equation for the full and developing countries sample, respectively. The estimates from the augmented outcome equation are reported in Table 3 for the full (model 3) and developing countries sample (model 4). Our main results remain robust.         "
"34","We also estimated additional models for the full and developing countries samples after adding diffusion variables, including Export Competition and bilateral investment treaty partner policies, in the outcome equation.27 We also included a currency crisis dummy28 and three other controls that proxy for the economic interests of G‐5 countries: the exposure of G‐5 commercial banks to each borrowing country's market,29 G‐5 foreign aid commitments,30 and voting affinity within the UN General Assembly between G‐5 nations and borrowing countries.31 We incorporated additional controls in the selection equation including the currency crisis dummy, Partisanship, Budget Balance, Log Investment, and Debt Service as a percentage of GDP. We do not report the results obtained after including these additional controls to save space, but our main results were unchanged.32"
"35","Due to the limitations of the Chinn and Ito index, we checked whether our results hold when we employ an alternative measure of the dependent variable.33 We used a simple binary measure of the presence or absence of capital controls, using the raw data from Chinn and Ito (2006). Results for the outcome equation indicate that the main results are substantively unchanged for the full and developing countries samples (Table 3, models 5 and 6).34"
"36","Diagnostic tests reveal that none of the models suffers from severe multicollinearity, serial correlation, or omitted variable bias, and that the residuals are normally distributed.35 Also, out of an abundance of caution, we implement Hurlin and Venet's (2003) Granger causality test for panel data to assess the potential endogenous relationship between the dependent variable and each of the two independent variables in our empirical analysis: IMF Loan and Welfare. F‐statistics from the Hurlin and Venet (2003) tests conducted for the full and developing countries sample indicate that the dependent variable does not statistically influence IMF Loan and Welfare.         "
"37","We further address the possibility of endogeneity by testing Hypothesis 1 via a “system GMM” model that combines a regression in first‐differences and a regression in levels; estimating the two equations (levels and differences) in a single system leads to consistent and efficient estimates (Blundell and Bond 1998). This approach corrects for potential endogeneity by using moment conditions to derive a set of valid instruments for the potentially endogenous explanatory variables. It also corrects for serial correlation, controls for country fixed effects, and accounts for heteroskedasticity via White's heteroskedasticity robust standard errors. Results from the system‐GMM model that include all the variables in the outcome equation listed earlier (not reported to save space) confirm our main findings.36 Finally, we explored the possibility that governments—especially right‐leaning governments—could use the cover of an IMF program to reduce their current welfare expenditures.37Figure 3, which depicts average welfare spending in the years before, during, and after an IMF program, provides no support for this hypothesis.38"
"38","                 Average Welfare Spending Before, During, and After an IMF Program                      "
"39","How can we explain the timing and extent of capital account liberalization since the 1970s? We offer a nuanced argument about the interactive impact of IMF stabilization programs and domestic welfare expenditures. Substantial loans from the IMF provide a window of opportunity for policy makers to enact liberalizing reforms with negative distributional consequences; an existing system of substantial welfare expenditures enables policy makers to seize this opportunity. Our analytical framework reflects the exhortation by Martin and Simmons to explore the effects of international institutions conditional upon domestic considerations; in particular, they argue that scholars should “move toward genuinely interactive theories of domestic politics and international institutions” (1998, 749). Results from a variety of statistical models provide robust evidence of the interactive impact of IMF stabilization programs and welfare expenditures on capital account liberalization."
"40","Researchers have made substantial progress in addressing selection bias when evaluating the impact of IMF programs (Nooruddin and Simmons 2006; Vreeland 2003). However, prior scholarship underestimates the possibility that country participation in IMF programs displays clustering—a condition that should be accounted for when estimating the IMF's impact on domestic policies. We use a novel statistical estimator, the spatial autoregressive error sample selection model, which accounts for these spatial effects as well as selection bias and the influence of diffusion on capital account liberalization.         "
"41","Two main policy implications emerge from this study. First, our results suggest that governments that publicly provide compensation to domestic groups that experience income shocks have more agency to implement capital account reforms. This finding contributes to the debate about the degree of complementarity or tension between the size of the welfare state and the pressures from global markets (see, e.g., Burgoon 2001; Kaufman and Segura‐Ubiergo 2001; Rickard 2008; Rodrik 1998; Rudra 2002; Walter forthcoming; Wibbels 2006). The evidence presented in this study confirms the findings in Brooks (2004) that higher welfare spending facilitates globalization by enhancing the political feasibility of policy reforms.         "
"42","Second, our results suggest that the IMF does not implement a “one size fits all” approach to capital account liberalization in borrowing countries, contrary to the assertions of IMF critics. In fact, it appears that governments use the IMF as political cover to enact reforms that would otherwise be politically costly. Scholars and pundits who seek to reform the IMF should consider the organization's role as an enabler of capital account reform from the bottom up, rather than a top‐down enforcer of liberalization."
"43","Notwithstanding the implications of this study, more work needs to be done to fully comprehend the link between IMF loans, domestic politics in program recipient nations, and policy liberalization. For instance, valuable theoretical insights may be gained from analyzing how bargaining between domestic groups and a program participating government under the shadow of IMF loans may affect the prospects for capital account liberalization. The research presented here may also be extended to explore whether the interaction of IMF loans and welfare spending affects other issue areas, such as privatization of state‐owned banks and equity market liberalization. We hope that this study spurs future research on how policy instruments used by international institutions interact with domestic interests and institutions to influence government policy outcomes."
