"1","Logit and probit models are designed to model a phenomenon of interest that is discrete: i.e., it occurs (Y = 1) or it does not (Y = 0). In both models, whether the event occurs has a Bernoulli distribution described by the parameter Pr(Y)—the probability that the event occurs (Beck, King, and Zeng 2000, 24). Pr(Y) is assumed to be determined by a set of independent variables {X1, X2, … , Xk}, and a corresponding set of parameters {β0, β1, β2, … , βk}, through a nonlinear link function, G, that maps the unbounded index Y*=β0+β1X1+β2X2+ ⋯ +βkXk into the bounded probability space [0, 1]:            "
"2","These link functions are graphed in Figure 1, which shows their great similarity. Both map a Y* value of 0 into a probability of 0.5. Both are maximally sloped at this point but decline in slope as Y* departs from 0 and Pr(Y) departs from 0.5 (in either direction), approaching a slope of 0 as Pr(Y) approaches its floor of 0 or its ceiling of 1 and Y* approaches ±∞. Note that both curves are nearly linear in the range near Y*= 0 and when Y* is either very large or small, but are strongly nonlinear when Y* assumes other values. Although Pr(Y) is the ultimate dependent variable in the logit or probit model, Y* can also be conceived as a latent (or unobserved) dependent variable influenced by the model's independent variables (since Y*=β0+β1X1+β2X2+ ⋯ +βkXk). However, the variables Pr(Y) and Y* are of fundamentally different character: Pr(Y) is constrained to the range [0, 1] while Y* is unbounded. Moreover, although the metric for Pr(Y) is evident, the scale for Y* is unknown.         "
"3","                 The Logit and Probit Link Functions                      "
"4","In both the logit and probit models, for any independent variable (say, X1), one can determine the marginal (or instantaneous) effect of X1 on Pr(Y)—the derivative, ∂Pr(Y)/∂X1—at any set of values for the independent variables by calculating:            "
"5","When there are no product terms among the independent variables, equation (1) takes the form:            "
"6","Consider, for example, a simple logit model with constant term −4, and two independent variables, X1 and X2, both having βi coefficients of 1:            "
"7","                 Logit Models Illustrating How Marginal Effects on Pr(Y) Vary with the Values of Independent Variables                      "
"8","Panel A depicts the model Pr(Y) = G (– 4 + X1+ X2). Panel B depicts the model Pr(Y) = G (– 4 + X1+ X2– 0.30X1X2). In both cases, G() is the logit link function. Arrows indicate the marginal effect (m.e.) of the curve, i.e., ∂Pr(Y)/∂X1, at the indicated point.                     "
"9","For any of the three curves, start at the point where Pr(Y) = 0.5. As X1 moves in either direction from this point and pushes Pr(Y) closer to 1 or 0, X1's marginal effect on Pr(Y)—the slope of the curve—decreases. The rate of change in the marginal effect is small (i.e., the curve is nearly linear) at first, and becomes small again when X1 gets either very large or very small (especially outside the range of X1 values plotted). But at points in between, the slope of the curve changes more quickly. This change in slope is an inherent feature of logit's functional form that keeps Pr(Y) within the [0, 1] boundaries of probability even as X1 and X2 approach ±∞.         "
"10","Thus, in any logit or probit model, the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) depends on the values of all independent variables; this marginal effect is greatest when Pr(Y) is 0.5 and declines when a change in either variable pushes Pr(Y) toward 0 or 1. We refer to the phenomenon in which the marginal effect of a variable on Pr(Y) is strongest at some value of Pr(Y) [P(max)] between 0 and 1, and declines in strength as Pr(Y) gets smaller or larger as compression, because deviations of Pr(Y) away from P(max) compress further possible change in Pr(Y) to ever‐smaller ranges. But compression is not unique to logit and probit; when independent variables are unbounded, compression will be present in any statistical model in which the link function mapping the index Y* into Pr(Y) is monotonic.8"
"11","Now consider a logit model that includes a product term, X1X2, so that Y*=β0+β1X1+β2X2+βpX1X2+β3X3+ ⋯ +βkXk. For this model,            "
"12","To illustrate the implications of a product term, consider a logit model that adds an X1X2 term to equation (2) with coefficient −0.30:            "
"13","The discussion above makes clear that for any two variables (e.g., X1 and X2) in a logit or probit model, the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) will vary with X2—i.e., there will be some interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing Pr(Y)—even when the model includes no product term, due to what we have called compression. Indeed, in a model without a product term, there is no interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing the unbounded variable, Y*, and all interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing Pr(Y) is due exclusively to compression. Adding an X1X2 term to the model allows for interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing the unbounded variable, Y*, and creates an additional source of variation in the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) owing to the fact that the marginal effect of X1 on Y* (∂Y*/∂X1) is no longer constant. Importantly, as we will show below, depending on the range of values for the independent variables in the population being studied, the interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing Pr(Y) can be extensive—with the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) varying substantially with the value of X2—or it can be trivially small—with the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) varying only slightly as X2 changes.         "
"14","Typical practice is to treat a statistically significant product term as a necessary condition for concluding that X1 and X2 interact in influencing Pr(Y). This practice rests on the contention that interaction between X1 and X2 that is due to compression is not substantively relevant. Two reasons have been offered in the literature to support this view.         "
"15","                        "
"16","Compression is inherent in any logit or probit model, making interaction due to compression an artifact of the model and thus substantively meaningless."
"17","There have been several cases in which political scientists finding evidence of what we have termed compression in a logit or probit model have reported their results as indicative of substantively meaningful interaction and been criticized. In one instance, Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980) analyzed voter turnout in the 1972 presidential election using probit. These researchers were interested in, among other things, the relationship between voter turnout and how easy it was for citizens to register to vote. By comparing the estimated marginal effect of voter registration provisions on the probability that someone will vote at different values of education, Wolfinger and Rosenstone concluded that “[l]iberalizing registration provisions would have by far the greatest impact on the least educated and relatively little effect on well‐educated people” (1980, 79). As there were no product terms involving education and any of the voter registration provisions in their model, the decline in the marginal impact of voter registration provisions on the probability of voting as education increased must be due to what we have termed compression, something the authors of the study understood.9"
"18","In a widely cited AJPS article, Nagler argues that Wolfinger and Rosenstone's claim of interaction “does not necessarily follow from [their] data analysis and is instead an artifact of the methodology used” (Nagler 1991, 1393):         "
"19","                        "
"20","Since persons with the lowest education level are those who on average are closest to having .5 probability of voting, estimates of change based on that group will necessarily be larger than estimates of change for any other group. Thus, the smaller effects of [registration restrictions] on better‐educated groups is simply an artifact of the changing slope of the normal density curve, not a result of a unique relationship between individuals’ education and state registration requirements. Hence, to infer substantive interaction between registration laws and education based on the differing estimated impacts is incorrect. This interaction is assumed by the model specification. (Nagler 1991, 1397)               "
"21","A similar exchange occurred between Berry and Berry (1990) and Frant (1991). Berry and Berry published conclusions that independent variables interact in influencing the probability of a lottery adoption by an American state based on results from a probit model including no product terms. Frant argued that Berry and Berry's interaction findings were not substantively meaningful:         "
"22","                        "
"23","[Berry and Berry] present as empirical results what are in reality artifacts of the way the model is specified. …  They find, for example, that the effect [on the probability of a lottery adoption] associated with an election year is greater (in absolute terms) when the state is in poor fiscal health than when it is in good fiscal health. This sounds like a conclusion (and the authors treat it as such); but actually, it is an assumption of the model. … This is a plausible assumption, but it is only an assumption. When we employ a probit (or logit) model, this assumption is built in. (Frant 1991, 571)               "
"24","Nagler's and Frant's positions reflect a message common in the political methodology literature that any interaction in influencing Pr(Y) detected by a logit or probit model without a product term is an artifact of the estimation procedure, and not a substantively meaningful phenomenon that should be interpreted as causal interaction. Recently, Brambor, Clark, and Golder advised readers that compression occurs “whether the analyst's hypothesis is conditional or not—it is just part and parcel of deciding to use a nonlinear model such as probit; it is always there. If one wants to test a conditional hypothesis in a meaningful way, then the analyst has to include an explicit interaction term … ” (2006, 77; see also Huang and Shields 2000).         "
"25","                        "
"26","In a logit or probit model, compression is not relevant to an assessment of interaction between two specific variables because compression creates interaction among all independent variables. Product terms, by contrast, capture variable‐specific interaction.                  "
"27","Compression is present in a logit or probit model because as Pr(Y) approaches its limits of 1 and 0, even powerful causal variables cannot increase/decrease the probability of an event beyond the upper/lower limit that probabilities can assume. In a model in which three or more variables influence Pr(Y), these limits may be approached via the influence of varying combinations of variables. Suppose, for example, that Y is influenced by three variables, X1, X2, and X3, as in the following logit model:            "
"28","In this model, when X1= X2= X3= 0, the unbounded index Y*= X1+ 0.5X2+ 0.25X3 equals 0, a value that is transformed by the logit link function to Pr(Y) = 0.5. At this point, the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) is maximized at 0.25. If X1 and X3 are left at 0 but X2 is increased to 4.5, the index Y* grows to 2.25, at which point Pr(Y) = 0.905, and the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) declines to 0.086. Thus, compression in the logit model makes it so that the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) declines by 0.164 (= 0.25 – 0.086) as X2 increases from 0 to 4.5 while X1 and X3 are held constant at zero. One might therefore claim that X1 and X2 interact in influencing Pr(Y). But one could also claim that X1 interacts with X3 in influencing Pr(Y) using identical logic: starting at X1= X2= X3= 0, if X1 and X2 are held constant but X3 is increased to 9, once again Y* grows to 2.25, Pr(Y) = 0.905, and the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) declines to 0.086.         "
"29"," Nagler (1991, 1994) argues that because compression forces the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) to vary with the value of every independent variable in the model, researchers should not interpret compression as relevant to causal interaction between any specific pair of variables. He invokes this criticism to challenge Wolfinger and Rosenstone's (1980) claim that voter registration provisions interact with education in influencing the probability of voting:         "
"30","                        "
"31","… to the extent that those with less education are nearest to the .5 mark in their expected probability of voting (or become nearest to the .5 mark in their expected probability of voting after altering a different independent variable), they will be more affected than those with higher education levels by changes in any independent variable. (Nagler 1991, 1397)               "
"32","To Nagler (1994, 249), the only substantively relevant interaction between two variables is what he calls “variable‐specific interaction,” and he makes clear his belief that product terms are needed to capture this kind of interaction:         "
"33","                        "
"34","If adding [a product term to a model] leads to an improvement in the model, then I would argue that we have “variable‐specific” interaction between [two variables], as opposed to interaction imposed between all the variables by the functional form of the model. (249–50)"
"35","Since the publication of Nagler's 1991 article, political scientists have rarely published claims that variables interact in influencing the probability that an event will occur based on a logit or probit model without a statistically significant product term. This suggests that most political scientists have been convinced that compression does not reflect substantively meaningful interaction, and that as a result, a statistically significant product term is necessary to confirm that X1 and X2 interact in influencing Pr(Y).         "
"36","Contrary to the prevailing view, we argue that in the BDV setting when one is interested in the effects of independent variables on Pr(Y), compression creates substantively relevant interaction. When substantial compression is present, it is a fundamental feature of the data generating process (DGP); as such, taking it into account is essential to accurately describe how the marginal effect of one variable, X1, on Pr(Y) varies with the value of another variable, X2, and thus essential to validly test a hypothesis that X1 and X2 interact in influencing Pr(Y). Sometimes, but not always, a product term is needed to correctly specify the nature of interaction between two variables. But whether there is a product term in the model or not, compression effects cannot be ignored. Our argument involves seven points, most of which represent a challenge to widely held views about interaction in BDV models.         "
"37","In our discussion we will frequently refer to the notion of substantively meaningful interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing Pr(Y). By this we mean a situation in which (1) the interaction is statistically significant, i.e., the effect of one variable, say X1, on Pr(Y) varies with the value of the other (X2) to a statistically significant degree, and (2) the estimated magnitude of the interaction is large enough to be deemed consequential, i.e., the estimated response of the effect of X1 on Pr(Y) to a change in X2 is of nontrivial magnitude.10 If substantively meaningful interaction in influencing Pr(Y) is detected by a logit or probit model without a product term, the interaction is due solely to compression. In a model including an X1X2 term (with a nonzero coefficient), the interaction is due to some combination of variable‐specific interaction in influencing the unbounded latent variable Y* (as reflected by the product term coefficient) and compression.         "
"38","                        "
"39","Compression in a logit or probit model should not be viewed as theoretically irrelevant. It is an appropriate theoretical rationale for expecting interaction between independent variables in their joint influence on Pr(Y).                  "
"40","Compression in a logit or probit model is often held to be theoretically irrelevant due to the fact that it occurs simply because logit and probit always constrain the dependent variable, Pr(Y), to be between 0 and 1 regardless of the event being studied. However, the restricted range of Pr(Y) in a logit or probit model should not be viewed as an assumption imposed on Pr(Y) by the specific statistical model chosen by the researcher. Rather, no matter what event is being studied, any researcher who wants to correctly specify the DGP must choose a model that constrains Pr(Y) to the [0, 1] range because this range is a fundamental characteristic of the DGP. Probability values of 1.5 and −0.3 are impossible, as an event cannot occur 150 times out of 100 or –30 times out of 100, and any statistical model inconsistent with a dependent variable constrained to the [0, 1] range must ipso facto misspecify the DGP. Indeed, the primary reason logit and probit are viewed as an improvement over a linear probability model [LPM] (i.e., OLS regression with a BDV) is that with an LPM, predicted Pr(Y) values for some observations may fall outside [0, 1]. Logit and probit force the marginal effects of independent variables to decline as Pr(Y) nears its limits, thereby avoiding these meaningless predictions.         "
"41","Compression should not be viewed as theoretically irrelevant. Indeed, it can be a strong theoretical rationale for expecting interaction between variables in their influence on Pr(Y). Consider, for example, the factors determining whether countries will go to war. Two variables found to negatively affect the probability that a pair of countries (or dyad) will fight a war are the geographic distance between the countries (e.g., Bremer 1992; Diehl 1985) and the joint level of democracy in the dyad (e.g., Oneal and Russett 1997; Ray 1998).11 The “democratic peace” effect has been found to be so strong that the probability of war is nearly zero when the level of democracy is very high (i.e., both countries are fully democratic) and no other variable takes an extreme value (e.g., Levy 1988; Maoz 1998). Imagine first that some dyad is not highly democratic. With all other variables held at their mean, increasing the distance between the countries should lead to a substantial decrease in the likelihood of war: the states may conflict over an issue, but the farther they are from each other the more expensive war becomes, thereby decreasing the utility of war to the countries. Now imagine that the same dyad is highly democratic. This lowers the probability of war to nearly zero. It is still reasonable to expect that a change in the distance between the states would prompt a sizeable change in the (unbounded) utility to the countries of a war, but because the countries are highly democratic, the utility of war to them is already so low that a marginal change in utility should not appreciably change the near zero probability of war. This rationale justifies the hypothesis that the distance between countries and their level of joint democracy interact in influencing their probability of going to war: as the level of democracy rises, the negative effect of distance on the probability of war decreases in magnitude.         "
"42","Similarly, Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980) rely on the [0, 1] restriction of a probability to defend their proposition that influences on an individual's decision to vote are conditional on the individual's level of education. For example, the authors write, “ … a high‐status occupation or a high income has less impact on a college graduate, who is 90 percent likely to vote, than it has on a high school dropout, who is only 55 percent likely to vote” (1980, 11). These variables have “very little impact on those who are either very unlikely or nearly certain to vote. [They have] the greatest impact in the middle of the distribution, on those who are between 40 and 60 percent likely to vote and are most susceptible to the forces pushing them to vote or not to vote” (1980, 11).12"
"43","                        "
"44","Logit and probit will find compression of nontrivial magnitude only when it is actually there; if just trivial compression is present in the data generating process, logit and probit will not mistakenly make it appear more substantial.                  "
"45","It is true that with any logit or probit model, if independent variables are unbounded, a sufficiently extreme value for any independent variable having a nonzero coefficient will move Pr(Y) close enough to one of its boundaries that the possible marginal impact of any independent variable will be severely restricted. But we must not confuse the logit and probit models as mathematical functions—which are defined for all positive and negative values for each independent variable, regardless of how large or small—with these models when they are used by political scientists to characterize data generating processes in real‐world populations. In the latter situation, the values for independent variables will always be confined to finite ranges. When independent variables are constrained to finite ranges, a DGP for an event that is accurately specified by a logit or probit model need not be characterized by substantial (i.e., more than trivial) compression. Consider, for example, the two‐independent variable DGP reflected in the logit equation plotted in Figure 3A, in which all cases in the population have values for X1 and X2 that are between 0 and 8.13 In this DGP, there is substantial compression, as evidenced in the greater rate of ascent of the surface near its center than when both X1 and X2 assume their lowest values, or when both variables are at their highest. The DGP in Figure 3B, in which population values for X1 and X2 are also constrained to the [0, 8] range, is a logit equation as well. But despite this, the surface is very nearly flat, as the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) [i.e., ∂Pr(Y)/∂X1] is always between 0.025 and 0.031 (a very narrow range). Thus, in the case of this DGP that takes the form of a logit model, it would be reasonable to claim that the effects of X1 and X2 on Pr(Y) are essentially linear and additive, and that nearly no compression is present.         "
"46","                 Logit Models with and without Appreciable Compression                      "
"47","Panel A depicts the model Pr(Y) = G (– 8 + X1+ X2), and panel B illustrates the model Pr(Y) = G (–1 + 0.125X1+ 0.125X2), both for DGPs in which X1 and X2 are confined to the [0, 8] range.                     "
"48","Is there any reason to fear that if we estimated a logit model with independent variables X1 and X2 using a data set generated from the DGP represented in Figure 3B we will be led to conclude there is substantively meaningful interaction due to compression even though very little compression is actually present? The answer must be no. The true model is a logit equation and it is well known that an accurately specified logit model yields consistent parameter estimates (Aldrich and Nelson 1984). Consistent parameter estimates will generate consistent estimates of the marginal effects of independent variables on Pr(Y). Thus, with a sufficiently large random sample, estimated marginal effects on Pr(Y) will, on average, be on target. Since the true marginal effects of X1 and X2 are nearly constant over the range of values for X1 and X2 in the population, estimated marginal effects on Pr(Y) can also be expected to be nearly constant.14 Note, however, that this claim holds only if we confine estimates of marginal effects to the actual range of X1 and X2 in the population being studied; if we predict marginal effects outside this range, we may mistakenly conclude that there is substantial compression. Of course, predictions outside the bounds of available data (i.e., inferences about counterfactuals) are dangerous regardless of the econometric technique employed (King and Zeng 2006).         "
"49","In sum, a logit or probit model will not mistakenly detect substantial compression where little is present in the DGP as long as the model accurately specifies the DGP. Except to the normal extent we would expect due to estimation uncertainty in finite samples, logit and probit will find nontrivial compression in the data only when there is nontrivial compression in the true model."
"50","                        "
"51","The large number of researchers who use logit or probit to test a hypothesis of interaction and, as part of their procedure, report how the estimated effect of one variable on Pr(Y) varies with the value of another variable are treating compression effects as substantively meaningful, even if they do not explicitly recognize that they are doing so.                  "
"52","In the introduction, we describe a widely used procedure for testing a hypothesis that X1 and X2 interact in influencing Pr(Y) that involves calculating how the estimated effect of X1 on Pr(Y) varies with X2. We applaud the practice of reporting estimated effects on Pr(Y), but simply note that when one does this, one is tacitly acknowledging that compression is substantively relevant. As long as a probit or logit model accurately specifies the true DGP, any estimate of the effect of a variable on Pr(Y) derived from the model's coefficients will reflect whatever compression is present in the DGP. Indeed, the only way for a user of probit or logit to avoid reporting effects of independent variables that take into account compression is to restrict attention to effects on the unbounded latent variable Y*—i.e., to limit attention to the model's coefficients—and say nothing about impacts on Pr(Y).         "
"53","                        "
"54","In a logit or probit model, a statistically significant product term is not a necessary condition for substantively meaningful interaction among independent variables in their influence on Pr(Y).                  "
"55","If a large product term coefficient were necessary for substantial interaction among independent variables in influencing Pr(Y), then a logit or probit model with no product term (i.e., one in which the product term's coefficient is constrained to be zero) would never exhibit substantial interaction among variables in their effects on Pr(Y). But our earlier examination of the model depicted in Figure 2A made clear that even in a model without a product term, compression can lead to substantial variation in the marginal effect of one variable on Pr(Y) across different values of another variable. For example, when X1= 6, a shift in X2 from 0 to 2 reduces the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) from 0.105 to 0.018; this constitutes a nontrivial amount of interaction between the independent variables.15"
"56","Of course, we do not know, in practice, how often political scientists who rejected a hypothesis of interaction based on a statistically insignificant product term and did not calculate estimated effects on Pr(Y) would have found interaction had they done so. Yet replicating one study drawn from our search of recent issues of journals (see note 1) reveals a case in which a test based on the product term coefficient and a test based on effects on Pr(Y) yield different conclusions about the statistical significance of interaction. Heller and Mershon's (2005) study of party switching in the Italian Chamber of Deputies examines whether electoral rules (first‐past‐the‐post [FPTP] vs. proportional representation [PR]) and the nature of a legislator's party label (blurred vs. clear) interact in influencing the probability that the legislator will switch across political blocs [Pr(switched)]. The authors estimate a logit model including electoral rules, party label, electoral rules * party label, and other variables. In the first column of their Table 4 (2005, 550), they report an estimated product term coefficient of −1.44 that is not statistically significant at the .05 level (Z =−1.09), having a 95% confidence interval of [−4.02, 1.14].16 This provides statistical grounds for rejecting a hypothesis of interaction between electoral rules and party label in influencing the unbounded latent dependent variable, Y*. But Heller and Mershon's hypotheses relate to effects on Pr(switched). To see whether there is statistically significant interaction between electoral rules and party label in influencing this probability, we use CLARIFY to estimate a second difference in Pr(switched) showing the change in the impact of electoral rules on Pr(switched) when party label shifts from clear to blurred, but all other independent variables are fixed at their mean:            "
"57","                        "
"58","In a logit or probit model, a statistically significant product term is not a sufficient condition for substantively meaningful interaction among independent variables in their influence on Pr(Y).                  "
"59","Consider the logit model of Figure 2B, which includes a product term of nontrivial magnitude. There are certainly many values for X1 and X2 at which there is strong interaction between X1 and X2. For instance, when X1= 4, the slopes of the three curves are quite different (∂Pr(Y)/∂X1= 0.25, 0.173, and 0.096, respectively), indicating that the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) changes considerably as X2 rises from 0 to 2. But there are other values for the independent variables at which there is little interaction. When X1= 1, for example, the slopes of the three curves are very similar (∂Pr(Y)/∂X1= 0.045, 0.058, and 0.056, respectively). Indeed, if in the population of interest both X1 and X2 were constrained to the [0, 2] range, the three curves are close enough to being parallel that we would be comfortable rejecting a hypothesis of interaction and concluding that the effects of X1 and X2 are approximately additive despite the large negative coefficient for the product term.18"
"60","We can offer a substantive illustration that interaction between two variables in their effect on Pr(Y) can fail to be statistically significant even when their corresponding product term is significant by replicating a study identified by our content analysis of recent issues of journals (see note 1). Marinov's (2005) research on the effectiveness of international economic sanctions in destabilizing the governments they target seeks to determine whether the presence of sanctions (a dichotomous variable indicating whether a country is subject to sanctions in a year) and the nature of political institutions (whether the country is a democracy) interact in influencing the probability that the country's leaders will survive in office [Pr(survive)]. The author estimates a logit model including sanctions, democracy, sanctions * democracy, and other covariates. We estimate a slightly revised model and obtain a product term coefficient of 1.22, which is statistically significant even at the .01 level (Z = 3.27) and has a 95% confidence interval of [0.49, 1.95].19 We use CLARIFY to estimate a second difference in Pr(survive) showing the change in the impact of sanctions on Pr(survive) when one moves from a nondemocratic target country to one that is democratic, when all other independent variables are fixed at their mean:20"

"62","In a logit or probit model, the sign of the coefficient for a product term may give a misleading signal about the “direction” of the interaction between independent variables in influencing Pr(Y). Put differently, the direction of interaction among independent variables in influencing the unbounded latent variable Y* can be different from the direction of interaction in influencing Pr(Y).                  "
"63","By the direction of interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing some dependent variable, V, we refer to the sign (positive or negative) of the “difference between differences” in note 3. Stated verbally, the direction of interaction refers to whether the effect of X1 on V (1) increases (i.e., becomes either more positive or less negative) as X2 increases (making the direction of interaction positive), or (2) decreases (i.e., becomes less positive or more negative) as X2 increases (making the direction of interaction negative). Given a logit or probit model including a product term, X1X2, so that Y*=β0+β1X1+β2X2+βpX1X2+β3X3+ ⋯ +βkXk, the magnitude of the interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing the latent dependent variable Y* (as measured by the second derivative, ∂2Y*/∂X1∂X2) is βp at all values for X1 and X2: at all values, a unit increase in X2 prompts a change of βp in the marginal effect of X1 on Y*.21 For the same model, as Norton, Wang, and Ai (2004, 158) have shown, the magnitude of interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing Pr(Y) is given by            "
"64","Demonstrating that the direction of the interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing Pr(Y) can be different than the sign of the coefficient for the product term for some values of X1 and X2 does not provide evidence that this occurs with any frequency in the research setting. Indeed, we suspect that it is more common in political science applications of logit and probit for the sign of the product term coefficient estimate to be the same as the direction of interaction in influencing Pr(Y) over the relevant values for the independent variables. But we can point to an example in which this is not the case. Scholz and Wang (2006) posit that the strength of local institutions [institutions] interacts with the liberalism of state elites [liberalism] in influencing the probability of a violation of the Clean Water Act by a plant regulated by a state environmental agency [Pr(violation)], predicting that the negative effect of institutions on Pr(violation) becomes weaker (i.e., less negative) as liberalism increases (i.e., positive interaction). They estimate a probit model including institutions, liberalism, institutions * liberalism, and other variables (with a sample of nearly 38,000 cases); and use the coefficients to compute a second difference in Pr(violation) involving changes in liberalism and institutions from one standard deviation below their mean to one standard deviation above, when the other independent variables are held at central values:22"
"65","                        "
"66","The fact that in a logit or probit model the marginal effect of each independent variable on Pr(Y) varies with the values of all independent variables does not invalidate the substantive importance of interaction between a pair of these variables of theoretical interest.                  "
"67","One argument for not regarding interaction due to compression as meaningful [point (b) discussed above] is that the variation in the marginal effect of a variable associated with compression is not “variable specific” (Nagler 1994): in a logit or probit model, the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) will change when any variable in the model changes, and therefore, one ought not interpret the change in this marginal effect as some other specific variable changes as substantively meaningful.         "
"68","We contend that this position falsely equates (for a model with k independent variables) the hypothesis that X1 and X2 interact with the hypothesis that X1 does not interact with any of X3, X4, … , Xk. In fact, advancing the former hypothesis does not imply a belief that the latter is true. To continue with the voting turnout example of Wolfinger and Rosenstone, a claim that high levels of education desensitize a person to changes in voter registration requirements (because highly educated people are already very likely to vote) does not imply that extreme values of other variables (e.g., a high age) do not cause a similar desensitization (because senior citizens are also highly likely to vote).         "
"69","Even when all variation in the marginal effects of variables on Pr(Y) is due to compression—as in a model with no product term—an analyst interested in whether X1 and X2 interact in influencing Pr(Y) is perfectly justified in measuring and reporting how the marginal effect of X1 on Pr(Y) varies with the value of X2 when X3, … , Xk are held constant at specified values (e.g., their mean), and describing substantial variation in the effect of X1 as indicating interaction between X1 and X2. Indeed, to do otherwise would involve mischaracterizing the nature of these variables’ effects. Given an accurately specified logit or probit model, the only way for an analyst to assess the amount of interaction present in a way that excludes from consideration interaction due to compression and takes into account just variable‐specific interaction would be to abandon all interest in effects on Pr(Y) and restrict attention to impacts on the unbounded latent variable, Y*.         "
"70","We have argued that in a logit or probit model, a statistically significant product term is neither necessary nor sufficient for concluding that there is substantively meaningful interaction among independent variables in their influence on Pr(Y). How, then, should a researcher positing interaction among independent variables in influencing Pr(Y) decide whether to include a product term? We believe that this decision must be based on an explicit theory about the effects of variables on the unbounded latent dependent variable, Y*, assumed by the model.25 This is because even though the researcher's hypothesis is about the effects of variables on Pr(Y), in both logit and probit it is Y*—rather than Pr(Y)—that is specified as a linear function of the independent variables (i.e., Y*=β0+β1X1+β2X2+ ⋯ +βkXk).         "
"71","If one's theory predicts that the independent variables interact in influencing Y*, a logit or probit model specifying the interaction with one or more product terms should be estimated, and the statistical significance of these terms should be determined to test for interaction; here the statistical tests for interaction advocated by Nagler (1991) are appropriate.26 If the expected interaction in influencing Y* is confirmed, the researcher should use the coefficients for the model to compute estimated effects of variables on Pr(Y) suitable for testing her hypothesis about interaction in influencing Pr(Y). For this purpose she can calculate second differences measuring how the response of Pr(Y) to a discrete change in one variable varies with the value of another variable, perhaps using CLARIFY (King, Tomz, and Wittenberg 2000). Alternatively, she can construct plots showing how the marginal effect of one variable on Pr(Y) varies with the value of another variable, as suggested by Brambor, Clark, and Golder (2006). If the expected interaction in influencing Y* is not found, the researcher may still derive estimates of the impacts of variables on Pr(Y) to test her hypothesis, but she should recognize that one element of the theory underlying the hypothesis has been called into question.27 Nevertheless, compression may produce the expected interaction among variables in influencing Pr(Y) even if these variables do not interact in their influence on Y*.         "
"72","On the other hand, a researcher may have no reason to believe that the effects of independent variables on the latent variable Y* are interactive and may base his hypothesis that independent variables interact in influencing Pr(Y) strictly on an expectation of compression. In this case, there is no need to include a product term in the model. Put differently, no product term is required if the analyst's only reason for positing interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing Pr(Y) is an expectation that when the value of X1 is extreme, Pr(Y) is near its limit of zero or one and thus there is little room for Pr(Y) to change as X2 changes.28 In any event, the analyst should use the parameter estimates for the model (with no product term) to generate estimates of the effects of variables on Pr(Y) to test his hypothesis; the same tools used for models with a product term—second differences or marginal effect plots—can be employed.29"
"73","Consider, for example, the case of voting. A utility maximization theory of election turnout assumes that a citizen votes when the expected utility of voting is greater than the expected utility of not voting, i.e., E[Uvote]– E[Uno vote] > 0. This net utility of voting, E[Uvote]– E[Uno vote], is an unbounded variable, and a theory about the determinants of this net utility can provide the basis for a theoretically informed decision about whether to include a product term in a logit model designed to test hypotheses about the determinants of the probability that someone will vote. If the net utility of voting is subject to an error component, ɛ, then a citizen votes whenever            "
"74","Pr(E[Uno vote]– E[Uvote] < ɛ) is the probability that a citizen turns out to vote. The distribution of ɛ determines the form of the appropriate statistical model; a Gaussian normal ɛ implies probit, while a logistic ɛ implies logit.30 The quantity E[Uno vote]– E[Uvote] corresponds to the index Y*=β0+β1X1+β2X2+ ⋯ +βkXk, where observable X variables (like education or voter registration laws) are influences on the size of this net utility.         "
"75","If one's theory predicts interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing the net utility of voting, a logit or probit model should include an X1X2 term. If one does not expect interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing the net utility of voting, and all interaction between X1 and X2 is expected to be due to compression, a product term is not needed. In either case, the logit coefficients do not directly provide information about interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing the probability of voting; one must use the model's coefficients to compute estimated effects on this probability. These estimated effects would incorporate not only any interaction between X1 and X2 in influencing the net utility of voting, as reflected in a nonzero coefficient for X1X2, but whatever compression is present in the DGP as well.         "
"76","To illustrate our recommendations, we examine the relationship among education, voter registration provisions, and the probability of voting in a presidential election [to be denoted Pr(vote)] initially investigated by Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980), and later analyzed by Nagler (1991, 1994) and Huang and Shields (2000); we consider the hypothesis that education and voter registration provisions interact in influencing the probability of voting, such that “[l]iberalizing registration provisions would have by far the greatest impact on the least educated and relatively little effect on well‐educated people” (Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980, 79). We employ 1984 Current Population Survey data (n = 99,676) from a replication data set for Nagler's (1994) study provided by Altman and McDonald (2003). The operational definition of voter registration provisions is closing date, the number of days before an election at which registration is closed.31 The variable education measures number of years of schooling collapsed into eight categories, coded 1 (0–4 years), 2 (5–7 years), 3 (8 years), 4 (9–11 years), 5 (12 years), 6 (1–3 years of college), 7 (4 years of college), and 8 (5 or more years of college). The control variables are a respondent's age, whether the respondent lives in the south, and whether a gubernatorial election occurred in the respondent's state during the presidential election year.         "
"77"," Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980) test the proposition that education and closing date interact in influencing Pr(vote) using a probit model without product terms; Nagler (1991) tests the hypothesis with a model including two product terms: closing date * education and closing date * education2. Which specification is correct hinges on the theory underlying the empirical analysis: only a theory about the effects of these independent variables on a latent unbounded variable, Y*, for which the BDV is assumed to be an indicator (such as the utility of voting) can reasonably guide the choice about whether to include product terms.         "
"78","Although they do not explicitly offer these theories, the specifications chosen by Nagler and Wolfinger and Rosenstone are consistent with different utility maximization theories about the influence of education and voter registration provisions on the utility of voting. Wolfinger and Rosenstone's specification is consistent with a theory that the independent variables in the model have additive effects on the (unbounded) utility of voting, and thus that any interaction between education and voter registration provisions in influencing the (bounded) probability of voting results from compression. In this explanation, people at all levels of education derive the same utility from a relaxation of voter registration restrictions, but the behavior of less‐educated people—whether they vote—is more likely to be affected by such a relaxation because these are the individuals who are most likely to be nearly indifferent between voting and not voting. The utility highly educated people derive from voting is already so likely to be above the threshold necessary to justify voting that additional benefit from easier voter registration will probably not make these people appreciably more likely to vote. This theory predicts that the coefficients for the product terms involving education and closing date should be zero. In contrast, Nagler's specification is consistent with a theory that the independent variables interact in their influence on the latent utility of voting: the magnitude of the effect of voter registration provisions on an individual's utility of voting declines as her level of education rises.32 This theory predicts nonzero coefficients for the product terms.         "
"79"," Table 1 presents parameter estimates from the probit model containing closing date * education and closing date * education2 (reflecting Nagler's specification) in column 1, and from the model excluding these two product terms (reflecting Wolfinger and Rosenstone's specification) in column 2. A likelihood‐ratio test comparing the unrestricted model (containing product terms) to the restricted model (omitting them) shows that the two product terms fail to be jointly significant at the .05 level (p = .06). When we drop closing date * education2 from the model—thereby constraining the relationship between education and the magnitude of the effect of closing date on the utility of voting to be linear—we get a similar result: the coefficient for closing date * education is statistically insignificant (p = .15).33 Thus, there is no empirical evidence that education and voter registration provisions interact in influencing the latent utility of voting. On this basis, we reject the theory predicting such interaction. However, the data are consistent with Wolfinger and Rosenstone's specification assuming that closing date and education have additive effects on the utility of voting, and consequently that any interaction between these variables in influencing the probability of voting is due to compression. This specification yields the coefficients in column 2. Therefore, to test Wolfinger and Rosenstone's hypothesis that voter registration provisions have their strongest impact on the probability of voting among the least educated Americans, we use the coefficients for the model in column 2 to derive the predicted probabilities of voting reported below.         "
"80","We test the Wolfinger and Rosenstone hypothesis by analyzing second differences in Pr(vote) using CLARIFY. We begin by calculating at each level of education a first difference: the estimated effect on the probability of voting of relaxing the stringency of voter registration provisions (i.e., closing date) from its mean (registration closes 24.8 days before the election) to 0 (registration is allowed right up to the day of the election) when all other variables are fixed at central values (dichotomous variables at their mode, all others at their mean).34 For someone with 0–4 years of schooling (education = 1), this relaxation in voter registration provisions increases the probability of voting by 0.068, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.060, 0.076]. Figure 4 presents a graph showing this first difference in Pr(vote) at all eight levels of education.         "
"81","                 First Difference Measuring the Effect of Closing Date on Pr(Vote) at All Levels of Education                      "
"82","Results are generated using CLARIFY based on the probit model in column 2 of Table 1. All first differences assume that all independent variables except education and closing date are fixed at central values.                     "
"83","The figure shows that the effect of voter registration provisions on the probability of voting is maximized at eight years of schooling (i.e., education = 3). As education increases from this level, the effect of closing date on Pr(vote) declines substantially. Specifically, an increase in education from eight years to its maximum yields a decline in the first difference measuring the effect of closing date on the probability of voting of 0.054 (= 0.077 – 0.024). This second difference has a 95% confidence interval of [0.047, 0.060]; since this interval excludes zero, the difference is statistically significant at the .05 level. As education decreases from eight years, the impact of closing date on the probability of voting also declines, but at a much lower rate. For example, a decrease in education from eight years to 0–4 years prompts a decline in the first difference measuring the effect of closing date on Pr(vote) of only 0.009 (= 0.077 – 0.068). This second difference is also statistically significant at the .05 level (with a 95% confidence interval of [0.008, 0.011]), but its magnitude is small. Indeed, 9–11 years of schooling (education = 4) seems to be a critical threshold: above this point, as education rises there is a steady and substantial decline in the impact of closing date on the probability of voting; below this point, the consequences of lowering closing date from its mean to zero is nearly constant, always increasing the probability of voting by an amount between 0.068 and 0.077.         "
"84","In summation, although there is no evidence of interaction between education and voter registration provisions in influencing the latent utility of voting, there is evidence of substantial interaction between these variables in influencing the probability of voting. When all other independent variables are fixed at central values, reducing the number of days before an election at which registration is closed from its mean to zero results in an increase in the probability of voting at any level of education. But the magnitude of the effect of voting registration provisions on this probability increases substantially as education declines from its highest level to eight years of schooling. In contrast, the effect of voting registration provisions on the probability of voting is nearly the same at eight years of education as it is at all lower levels. Since there are no product terms in the probit model used to derive these results, this interaction between education and voting registration provisions in influencing the probability of voting is due strictly to compression: when other independent variables are at central values, highly educated persons derive sufficient utility from voting to give them a high probability of turning out to vote even when voter registration provisions are fairly restrictive.         "
"85","We have argued that one can glean no definitive information about the nature of interaction among independent variables in influencing Pr(Y) from the sign and magnitude of a product term coefficient in a binary logit or probit model. This is because (1) there can be substantial interaction among independent variables in influencing Pr(Y) even when the coefficient for all product terms is zero, (2) there can be little interaction among independent variables in influencing Pr(Y) even when product term coefficients are large, and (3) when there is both strong interaction between two independent variables in influencing Pr(Y) and a statistically significant product term, the direction of their interaction in influencing Pr(Y) can be opposite from the direction of their interaction in influencing the unbounded latent variable Y* (as indicated by the sign of the product term coefficient). Testing the statistical significance of the product term is necessary to confirm a hypothesis that independent variables interact in influencing the unbounded latent dependent variable. But this test does not shed light on the nature of the interaction between the variables in influencing Pr(Y). Whether the variables interact in influencing Pr(Y) should be tested by direct examination of estimated effects on Pr(Y).         "
