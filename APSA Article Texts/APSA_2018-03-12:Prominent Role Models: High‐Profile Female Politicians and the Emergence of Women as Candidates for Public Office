"1","On November 6, 1990, Ann Richards was elected governor of Texas in a close, bitter contest against millionaire businessman Clayton Williams. The choice between a man and a woman for the state's highest office greatly influenced the makeup of issues that defined the campaign (Suro 1990). Indeed, Richards's victory marked a success for the feminist movement because of the policy agenda she brought to the office. However, Richards may also have had a subtler, long‐term effect on women in Texas politics. Her candidacy was lauded by groups such as the National Women's Political Caucus, which declared that she was “emblematic of the political progress of women and inspirational to other female candidates” (Toner 1990, 1). Data from Texas support this contention. In the six election cycles prior to 1990, 11% of the candidates running for the state's legislature were women. The next six elections after her victory saw that figure increase to 18%. Here, we examine whether this evidence reflects a systematic pattern: Does a woman's ascension to a prominent political office cause other women to enter politics?         "
"2","The lack of women in politics has long been a problem in the United States as well as in other countries. Women's presence in American government has grown over the last several decades, but men still dominate many political institutions. For example, women only hold 19% of seats in the U.S. Congress and 25% in state legislatures (Center for American Women and Politics 2017). These patterns yield crucial questions for scholars as well as for normative assessments of the quality of democracy. Past research points to the emergence of female political candidates as an area of particular concern. We take up this line of inquiry here with a focus on whether a woman's holding a key position can mobilize other women to seek political office.         "
"3","Although women's involvement in government is a worldwide issue, we focus on the American states for our empirical analyses because they display considerable variation in female candidates as well as women in high‐profile offices. Specifically, we estimate the causal effects of a woman's holding the position of governor or U.S. senator in a state on the proportion of women who run for that state's legislative offices. We theorize that the presence of a woman in one of these prominent positions places a highly visible role model in front of women in the state, which holds symbolic and/or practical value for women considering a political career. We expect that the presence of a prominent role model encourages more women in the pool of potential candidates to run for state legislature, either as a source of inspiration or via increased recruitment efforts."
"4","We employ a dynamic causal identification strategy to estimate the effects of female governors and senators on female candidate emergence. Through this analysis, we find evidence that a woman in a prominent political office exerts a substantively large positive effect on women running for state legislature. We demonstrate that, for an average election, a female governor or senator adds about seven female candidates for office. We also assess how this effect occurs, finding the most support for the contention that high‐profile female politicians play a symbolic role in motivating other women to run. Overall, we conclude that electing women to prominent political offices is crucial to improving the substantive and descriptive representation of women, because doing so can potentially have a direct policy impact and motivate more women to enter politics.         "
"5","The key normative significance of this research stems from the capacity for female candidates to influence women's political representation. Our analysis primarily emphasizes descriptive representation, which refers to a resemblance or correspondence between the representative and the represented. Pitkin (1967) discusses this concept in terms of how similar the representative body is to the larger group it is intended to represent. For our purposes, the composition of candidates for office influences the degree to which a legislative body resembles its constituency. Substantive representation, or the actions taken by representatives on behalf of constituents, is also important to our work. Regardless of their numbers in government, women often (though not always) emphasize the policy priorities of women (for a review, see Osborn 2012). Substantive representation likely increases when a woman wins any office, whether it is a prominent one or not. Indeed, an assumption implicit in the normative goal of increasing women's descriptive representation is that doing so would improve attention to their substantive interests (Mansbridge 1999).         "
"6","Another relevant conceptualization is symbolic representation, in which the representative evokes an emotional or affective response in constituents, leading them to feel represented (Pitkin 1967, 100). This perspective is an extension of descriptive representation, in which shared heritage and/or experience with a representative strengthens the sentiment that the represented have a voice in government (e.g., Tate 2003). Symbolic representation has been described as the representative serving as a role model for the represented (e.g., Clayton, Josefsson, and Wang 2014, 380). We draw from this point to establish one possible causal mechanism connecting high‐profile female politicians to female candidates. Whereas descriptive representation is the most readily observable consequence of our hypothesized effects, symbolism may be what animates the process.         "
"7","A great deal of research shows that men and women fare similarly well in elections (Seltzer, Newman, and Leighton 1997). Accordingly, scholars have turned their attention to female candidacy for office. If women face electoral favorability similar to men, why are they not running for office at the same rate? Lower interest in politics and familial roles have long been cited as explanations (see Dolan, Deckman, and Swers 2007). Additionally, the development of interest in running for office in women often occurs through channels distinct from those of men. Women tend to do so after having been involved in the political process in another way, particularly through single‐issue advocacy work (Windett 2014).            "
"8","In a series of seminal works, Richard L. Fox and Jennifer L. Lawless have explored the many factors that produce sex‐based disparities in running for office (e.g., Lawless and Fox 2010b). One major finding from their research is that even when women possess the same qualifications as men, they feel less qualified to run (Fox and Lawless 2011). These authors also demonstrate that political socialization and the importance placed on meeting the qualifications for office vary by sex. In more recent work, they uncover evidence of sex‐based differences in political ambition in high school and college students, suggesting that this socialization process begins early in life (Fox and Lawless 2014). They also note that women are less likely to be recruited by political parties to run for office, although the recent emergence of women's groups dedicated to recruitment efforts may mitigate that issue (Lawless and Fox 2010a).            "
"9","Context‐specific conditions also matter for female candidate emergence. Scholars find that the incumbency advantage allows men to remain in office and hinders women's ability to run (e.g., Schwindt‐Bayer 2005). However, beyond entrenched male incumbents, context still affects women differently compared to men. Women tend to be more risk averse than men, which means they are less likely to see the costs of running as justified by the chance of success (Kanthak and Woon 2015). Thus, women are more negatively affected by perceptions of electoral conditions, on average, which manifests as fewer women running for office.            "
"10","Past research also identifies societal factors that influence women's candidate emergence. One crucial problem is that stereotypes may hurt women more than help them. Traditionally masculine traits are rewarded more than feminine traits, which makes garnering support among voters and party organizations more difficult (Huddy and Terkildsen 1993). Additionally, a masculine culture dominates many legislatures (Thomas 1994), resulting in the potential for bias toward women in those institutions. Similarly, the culture toward women in politics greatly affects women's ability to enter politics (Windett 2011). There may also be partisan differences across states in which the incentive structures are different for Democratic and Republican women (Reingold and Harrell 2010; Sanbonmatsu 2002).            "
"11","Institutions can play an important role in women's entrance into politics. The adoption of quotas for female lawmakers in many countries since the 1990s is a direct attempt at addressing the problem of underrepresentation. An extensive literature finds that they generally have positive effects on the number of women in the legislature (at least initially), attention to women's issues, and other outcomes (for a review, see O'Brien and Rickne 2016). However, quotas' effects may not always be normatively positive. Increases in the presence of women in politics can also lead to backlash and/or problems with coordinating policy agendas as women begin to assert more political power (Kanthak and Krause 2012). Additionally, there is some evidence that they decrease women's engagement in politics (Clayton 2015).            "
"12","A subset of the literature on female candidate emergence addresses the effect of female officeholders on women's interest in entering politics. However, this existing research primarily focuses on peer effects—the influence of women in a governing body on female candidates for seats in that same institution—and yields mixed findings. For instance, recent evidence from India leverages the institution of quotas to show that women in office cause an increase in the likelihood that more women will hold office and improve attitudes toward women in politics (Beaman et al. 2009; Bhavnani 2009). However, this positive effect may be limited to incumbent women remaining in office rather than new women entering politics (Bhalotra, Clots‐Figueras, and Iyer 2017). Gilardi (2015) demonstrates with data from municipalities in Zurich that the presence of women in neighboring municipalities is positively associated with the number of female candidates. However, the pattern appears quite different in the American context. Broockman (2014) concludes that the election of women to state legislatures exerts no effect on women's running in other districts.            "
"13","By focusing on peer effects, this research overlooks how women officeholders in one institution can affect those in a different institution. Yet women who have moved up in government are a logical source of motivation for others who are early in their careers. Here, we focus on the effect of a woman's occupying the major political offices of governor and U.S. senator. We contend that the gravity of a prominent woman in office is more substantial than the presence of women within the same institution. Specifically, prominent women may serve as role models for women interested in running for office themselves."
"14","Several scholars argue that female politicians can serve as role models, helping other women to see themselves as part of the political system (e.g., Dovi 2002; Mariani, Marshall, and Mathews‐Schultz 2015). However, nearly all of this work focuses on individual‐level political behavior. Women are better able to identify female politicians than male politicians (Burns, Schlozman, and Verba 2001). Women living in states with statewide female elected officials have higher levels of political knowledge, interest, efficacy, and activity (Burns, Schlozman, and Verba 2001; Fridkin and Kenney 2014). The presence of female politicians leads to greater interest in politics, especially among adolescent women (Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; Wolbrecht and Campbell 2017). In general, when women see someone who looks like them in office, they feel more connected to the political system and are more likely to participate in it, although this connection is conditional on party congruency (Reingold and Harrell 2010).            "
"15","Despite its many insights, this literature does not have much to say about whether the effect of role models extends to women's decisions to directly enter politics. Answering that question is important because, as is discussed above, the decision to run is the primary roadblock to improving women's descriptive representation in American government. While increased political engagement could certainly benefit women's policy priorities via increased communication with politicians already in office, increases in women's running for office would likely provide more direct benefits. In short, scholars have not yet examined the influence of female role models on one of the most politically consequential outcomes."
"16","To review, a myriad of factors influence women's decisions to run for office, and the presence of other female politicians may be one of them. However, most research that examines female politicians' effects on female candidates does so in the context of women in the same governing institution. It does not consider the possible effects of a high‐profile female role model—a woman in a prominent office—on potential candidates for lower offices. At the same time, much of the research on female role models focuses on their influence on women's political behavior rather than the choice to directly enter politics. We use these gaps in the literature as our starting point. We develop and test theoretical expectations of a positive effect of prominent female officeholders on female state legislative candidates."
"17","We examine female governors' and U.S. senators' influence on candidates for state legislature rather than other offices that women might hold because these offices are unambiguously prominent in American politics. The presence of a female role model in a major office makes a strong statement about women's political voice in that state and beyond. We study the effects of women in major offices on women's running for state legislature because that is where most women start their political careers (Windett 2011). Additionally, we do not claim that a high‐profile female official influences all women in the population. Instead, we expect that the effect of a prominent female official primarily operates on the subset of women who are sufficiently interested in a political career; we posit that it is a “tipping point” effect on the pool of potential women politicians.         "
"18","A common theme in past research is that female role models impact women's political behavior. While for many women this might simply increase interest in voting or campaigning, we expect that for the subset of women potentially interested in a political career, the role model effect also extends to the decision to run. We posit that, for these women, seeing another woman win a major political office shows clear validation of women in the political process. Thus, running for office is worth the investment of time and other resources. This process is perhaps most easily conceptualized as occurring all within a single state; a woman ascends to a high‐profile office, which sends a clear signal of legitimacy to other women interested in running for office in that state. However, the influence of a prominent woman is not necessarily limited by state borders. A woman who rises to prominence in one state could motivate women to run for office in another state. We consider this possibility in our empirical analyses."
"19","Moreover, one major difference in our application of the role model framework compared to its use in studies of political behavior centers on the fact that our conceptualization of a role model is not just any woman in office, but a woman who rises to significant prominence due to her office. The decision to run is a much bigger commitment than the decision to vote or help a campaign, requiring a great deal of time and resources. Accordingly, we contend that to motivate women enough to take on the work of seeking to enter politics directly, the role model must represent a major political success for women. Although any woman's winning an office could be seen as a success, a woman's ascending to a high‐profile office is a particularly noteworthy event. In all of American history, only 39 women have ever served as governor and 50 as U.S. senators (Center for American Women and Politics 2017). Women who hold the office of governor or senator have notched a major victory for women in politics by winning offices that are highly sought after by experienced, high‐quality candidates. Their successes are often viewed by political observers as positive signals about society's general views toward women in politics.         "
"20","Consequently, we contend that a woman's winning a major office carries greater weight than women's winning lower‐level offices because it places a woman in a position of major power and garners more public attention. This latter aspect is especially important because, as Campbell and Wolbrecht (2006, 237) note, “the visibility of female politicians is crucial…[the role model effect] is at least partly a function of the degree to which attention is drawn to the uniqueness of female politicians.” We posit that only a female politician in a prominent office is in a position to influence a choice as significant as the decision to run for office.         "
"21","We consider two possible means by which the role model effect of a female governor or senator may operate: through symbolic inspiration and motivation or via practical efforts in recruiting.1 First, the causal pathway may be based in the symbolic implications of a high‐profile female politician. In such a case, women see a female role model in office and make the decision to run on their own. This mechanism is similar to findings discussed above, in which women's feelings of efficacy increase due to the presence of a role model. It is the most straightforward process by which a prominent female politician influences women's emergence as candidates; it simply involves women receiving inspiration and motivation to run upon observing the success of the role model. It may be the most likely characterization of the process for women who have already thought a lot about a career in politics and perhaps have even taken some steps toward achieving that goal.            "
"22","However, the effect may also work via multiple steps in which the female official's major role is to increase the recruitment of female candidates. Crowder‐Meyer (2013) demonstrates that a crucial roadblock to electing women to office in state politics is that the networks of party leaders—many of whom are men—include few women as potential candidates. She also finds that female party leaders have wider networks with respect to sex compared to their male counterparts. Placing a woman in charge of a state's party may facilitate the use of expanded recruitment networks among those who recruit new candidates. If a female governor or senator values the presence of women in government, she may seek out or encourage other women in her own network to run for office. Furthermore, she may encourage other party leaders to expand their networks in searching for candidates.            "
"23","We expect that the result of the theoretical framework discussed above is an aggregate increase in the proportion of women entering races, which we formalize with our first hypothesis.               "
"24","We also expect that the positive effect of a female governor or senator is stronger in the lower chambers of state legislatures compared to the upper chambers. A prominent role model likely holds the strongest influence over first‐time candidates. Women with experience in politics have already crossed the threshold of running for office, and thus they may not need a symbolic source of inspiration or recruitment from a party to the same extent as potential candidates with no experience. If a female role model encourages many novice women to run, the focus for most of them is likely to be the lower house because that chamber typically is seen as an entry‐level job in state politics (Windett 2011). In contrast, upper chamber races often include more experienced candidates who have their own backgrounds in politics to draw on when deciding to run (or run again). Thus, even after accounting for the fact that there are more opportunities to win a lower chamber seat, we expect that the positive effect of a female governor (senator) is concentrated in the lower house.               "
"25","Our objective in testing the theoretical framework described above is to estimate the causal effects of the presence of a female governor and U.S. senator on the proportion of women who run for state legislature. To do so, we employ observational, time‐series cross‐sectional (TSCS) data covering election years from 1978 to 2012. These data represent a dynamic setting: Some states may become treated with a female governor or senator sooner, some may be treated later, some not at all, and some more than once. Several methods exist for securing causal inferences with observational data, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here, we employ a weighting approach that allows us to estimate causal effects in a dynamic framework."
"26","Our outcome variables come from the State Legislative Elections Returns data (SLER; see Klarner et al. 2013). This data set contains a wealth of information on state legislative candidates dating back to the late 1960s, although we restrict our analysis to 1978–2012 due to data availability for some covariates.2 Using the list of candidates' first names, middle names, and nicknames, we compiled counts of women who were candidates in the general elections in each state.3 We coded names using the  package gender (Mullen, Blevins, and Schmidt 2015), which predicts sex by name using historical data from the Social Security Administration. While this is an automated approach, a validation exercise we conducted with manual human coding shows that the package correctly identifies the sex for 99% of a random sample of the data (see the supporting information).            "
"27","After classifying names, we then computed our outcome measure as the proportion of candidates in each state‐year coded as female. We utilize several versions of this variable. First, we construct the measure with all candidates running in the general election in a given year, which yields a test of our central hypothesis (Hypothesis 1). To test Hypothesis 2, we compute our measure within each chamber, using total candidates within each chamber as the denominator. Finally, we construct our measure as the number of female general election winners divided by the number of seats in the legislature. While not directly part of our theory, this version allows us to assess how high‐profile women directly affect women's descriptive representation in the legislature.            "
"28","The method we employ is a semiparametric modeling framework that uses inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) to balance treated and untreated observations. It was developed in biostatistics (Robins, Hernán, and Brumback 2000) and is becoming increasingly popular in political science (Blackwell 2013). The basis for this approach is that the longitudinal nature of our data structure creates two competing threats to causal inference: omitted variable bias and posttreatment bias. A variable may be correlated with both treatment status and the outcome, supporting the need to include it as a control. But if part of the causal effect of treatment travels through that variable, controlling for it will block that part of the effect (see Blackwell 2013, 507–8). IPTW estimators give the analyst a way out of this problem. The logic is to address the omitted variable bias by reweighting the data.            "
"29","The first step in this process is to estimate the weights. To do so, we model treatment status in a given year—which we define as a female governor (senator) in office for the majority of the year4—as a function of several groups of covariates in a logistic regression. We employ regional fixed effects to account for baseline differences in the probability of a prominent woman in office.5 Next, we include treatment history. For the governors analysis, this variable is an indicator for whether a state has ever had a female governor in the current year. This strategy causes separation issues with the senators data, so for that analysis, we use a 6‐year (one term) lag of the treatment variable as the measure of treatment history. Finally, we include several time‐varying covariates, which we describe below. We then use these weights in a model of the outcome of interest that includes state fixed effects, but does not include the time‐varying control variables (Blackwell 2013). This process produces balance in the reweighted data but also allows the analyst to avoid the posttreatment bias that comes from including those covariates in the specification.            "
"30","The IPTW approach allows us to make use of the temporal structure of the data in estimating the causal effects. First, we estimate the contemporaneous effect of treatment (CET). For time periods denoted by t, Blackwell and Glynn (2014, 6) define this estimand as “the effect of treatment in period t on the outcome in period t, averaging across all of the treatment histories.” In other words, the CET is the effect of switching a random state's governor or senator from a man to a woman in period t, averaging over whether the state has had a female governor (senator) prior to t. The CET is a useful estimand because it is simple to conceptualize. Additionally, because treatment histories before period t are essentially ignored, counterfactuals are readily available in the data. However, the CET is also restrictive because by ignoring treatment histories, it assumes that the entire effect of a female governor (senator) is contemporaneous.               "
"31","An alternative estimand is the more general average treatment history effect (ATHE). Consider two treatment histories: (1) one in which a state has a female governor (senator) in every period up to t and (2) one in which the governor (senator) is a man in every period up to time t. The ATHE is defined as “the average difference between the world where all units had [history 1] and the world where all units had [history 2]” (Blackwell and Glynn 2014, 5). The histories being compared can be any combination of treatment; thus, there are actually many different possible ATHEs that could, in theory, be estimated. However, data constraints may limit many of these ATHEs due to the availability of counterfactuals and the fact that complex ATHEs may require model specification with many lags of the treatment variable. We focus specifically on the cumulative ATHE, which is constructed by summing the number of time periods up to time t for which a state has had a female governor (senator). Blackwell and Glynn (2014) recommend this approach as a low‐dimensional means of accounting for a state's full treatment history on the outcome. With this estimand—which we conceptualize as capturing a “legacy effect”—we no longer assume that the effect of a female governor (senator) only occurs in the current time period. However, we do assume that “only the sum of treatments affects the mean outcome in time t” (Blackwell and Glynn 2014, 15).               "
"32","The ATHE is not simply a sum of CETs, nor is it constrained to be equal to the CET. The two estimands represent different perspectives about how to estimate the causal effect and come from separate model specifications. Whereas the CET captures the causal effect of a prominent woman in a single election year, the cumulative ATHE comes from a measure of the total number of election cycles in which the state had a female governor or senator. Thus, a given ATHE could be greater than, less than, or similar to the CET estimate (Blackwell and Glynn 2014). Both the CET and ATHE are useful estimands to consider, and either one could be used on its own to evaluate support for our hypotheses. Accordingly, we present both sets of results. However, our own preference between the two is the ATHE. From a theoretical perspective, we view the potential impact of a high‐profile female politician as one that could operate beyond just the next election cycle. Put simply, we think history matters in this process; a legacy of female governors in recent years might motivate a woman to seek office above and beyond the effect of a current female governor. The definition of the cumulative ATHE fits well with this possibility.               "
"33","It is important to note that our approach to estimating the causal effect of female governors (senators) involves two critical assumptions. First, we assume sequential ignorability. This assumption states that the presence of an elected female governor (senator) at time t is independent of the potential outcomes, conditional on the covariate and treatment histories up to time t (Blackwell 2013, 510). In other words, conditional on the past, states with a female governor (senator) are similar to states without one. This assumption would be violated if we were unable to account for one or more covariates that affect treatment status and the outcome measure in our estimation procedures. We also assume positivity, which refers to the extent to which we can generalize our results. Causal inference requires “overlap” between treated and untreated units on key covariates, meaning that the two groups are comparable to each other with respect to those covariates. We describe the covariates we employ below. See the supporting information for more diagnostics and sensitivity analyses related to our assumptions.               "
"34","We employ several time‐varying covariates in the estimation of our causal effects. Specifically, in our weighting models, we include Berry et al. (1998) measures of state citizen ideology and state government ideology, an indicator for whether state legislative term limits were in effect, Squire's (2007) legislative professionalism index, and, for our governor (senator) estimates, an indicator for whether the state had a female U.S. senator (governor) in a given year. We also control for a cubic polynomial of time (Carter and Signorino 2010). Finally, we employ Windett's (2011) measure of state female sociopolitical subculture, lagged one election year. This measure is a composite of several indicators that reflect “friendliness” toward women in politics in a given state‐year. It includes measures of women's equality in society, their historical access to politics, and political culture.6 See the supporting information for a complete description of this measure.7"
"35","We conduct the IPTW method separately to estimate the effect of female governors and senators on our outcome variables.8 In each specification, we include the covariates mentioned above and a control for whether the other prominent office (senator or governor) is filled by a woman in the first‐stage model of treatment. We bootstrap the entire process by resampling states to compute measures of uncertainty, as recommended by Blackwell (2013). As we show in the supporting information, these models fit the data very well, and their corresponding weights greatly improve balance, providing favorable evidence for causal identification.               "
"36","Figure 1 graphs our estimated IPTW effects of female governors and U.S. senators. Recall that we consider two causal estimands. The CET reports the contemporaneous effect, averaging over states' histories of prior treatment. The ATHE captures a legacy effect. For two states with the same number of prior election cycles with a female governor (senator), it reports the expected difference in the proportion of female candidates when a female governor (senator) in office is added to one of the states for an election cycle. Additionally, note that the denominator in our proportion measures changes with each outcome. We divide all female candidates by total candidates, upper and lower chamber female candidates by total candidates in each chamber, respectively, and female winners by the total size of the legislature.         "
"37","The Effects of Female Governors and U.S. Senators on Female Proportion of Candidates for State Legislature"
"38","Note: The graphs present the estimated causal effects of a female governor (black) and female U.S. senator (gray). Line segments indicate 95% confidence intervals.                     "
"39","The CETs (contemporaneous effects) are all positive and notable in magnitude. First and foremost, consistent with Hypothesis 1, we find that high‐profile female politicians cause a contemporaneous increase in the proportion of female candidates: about 2.6 percentage points for a female governor and 2.7 for a female senator. These effects are statistically distinguishable from zero at the .05 level. Because the outcome is a proportion, their substantive impact depends on the number of candidates in a given election. This total varies widely across state‐years—its mean is 254 and its standard deviation is 146. One means of assessing the substantive impact is to translate the effects to an average election. In that case, these estimates correspond to increases of about seven female candidates."
"40","In contrast to Hypothesis 2, the CETs are not consistently stronger for lower chambers versus upper chambers; the only set of estimates that follows that pattern is the governor CETs, and in that case, the difference between effects in each chamber is not statistically significant. The CETs for female winners are positive and significant (p < .05): increases in the proportion of female legislators of 2.7 and 3.7 percentage points due to female governors and senators, respectively."
"41","The ATHE (legacy effect) estimates are also positive and are all statistically significant at the .05 level. Again, we find support for Hypothesis 1: For two states with the same treatment history, the effect of a single additional election cycle with a female governor (senator) on all women is an increase of 1.8 (1) percentage points in female candidate proportion. These are smaller than the CETs. However, it is important to emphasize that they represent the effect for a one‐unit change in the number of 2‐year election cycles with a female governor (senator). Those variables range from 0 to 10 in the observed data, and thus the cumulative effect could be quite large. Furthermore, we find that this cumulative effect is nonlinear. Additional analysis in the supporting information shows that the increase in female candidate proportion is strongest with the first female governor (senator) and then declines as time goes by and a high‐profile woman becomes more common. Over the course of a 4‐year (6‐year) term, a female governor (senator) increases the proportion of female candidates by 5.9 (5.7) percentage points. These estimates correspond to an additional 15 (14) female candidates for an average state (spanning multiple election years)."
"42","Finally, the ATHEs on upper chamber versus lower chamber candidates (Hypothesis 2) are again not consistent with our expectation. However, the legacy effects on the proportion of the legislature that is female are statistically significant estimates of 2.2 (governors) and 1.3 (senators) percentage points."
"43","In our theoretical expectations, we posited two potential causal mechanisms: a direct, symbolic effect or an indirect, practical effect based in attention to recruitment efforts. We next consider which of these two causal pathways holds more empirical support. We present three analyses to this end: (1) defining treatment status based on high‐profile women in neighboring states, (2) comparing partisan effects, and (3) estimating the effect of women who ran for governor or U.S. senator but lost the election. We focus most of our attention here on the first of these analyses; see the supporting information for details on the other two."
"44","In our first test of mechanisms, we repeat the IPTW analysis after defining treatment status in a given state by the presence or absence of a female governor (senator) in at least one of a state's contiguous neighbors. We contend that potential female candidates could be motivated to run not just by prominent women in their own state, but by prominent women in nearby states as well. Importantly, this approach empirically separates the two mechanisms because high‐profile women can inspire and motivate women in other states to run, but they likely do not actively recruit female candidates in other states. In other words, only the symbolic mechanism is a plausible causal pathway.            "
"45","In our weighting model specification, we include indicators for whether a woman holds the other high‐profile office in a neighboring state (i.e., female governor in the senators analysis and vice versa) and whether the original state has a female governor and a female senator. We also incorporate covariate information based on neighboring states; we compute the average values of each of the covariates described above among a state's neighbors and include those averages as predictors in the weighting models."
"46","Figure 2 presents the CET and ATHE results for this neighbors analysis. The estimated effects are all positive, and several reach statistical significance at the .05 level. However, the magnitudes of the estimates are somewhat different compared to our main results. The CETs for governors drop in magnitude compared to those in Figure 1, whereas the CETs for senators increase. For instance, the effect on all female candidates is 0.8 percentage points for governors (not statistically significant) and 3.7 for senators (p < .05). The ATHE estimates are statistically significant (p < .05), but slightly weaker in magnitude compared to those reported in Figure 1.            "
"47","The Effects of Female Governors and U.S. Senators in Neighboring States on Female Proportion of Candidates for State Legislature"
"48","Note: The graphs present the estimated causal effects of a female governor (black) and female U.S. senator (gray) in a neighboring state. Line segments indicate 95% confidence intervals.                        "
"49","We draw two conclusions from these results. First, there is support for the symbolic mechanism. We observe positive effects in a scenario in which the symbolic power of seeing a high‐profile woman hold office is the most likely pathway for that effect. However, given that several of the neighbor effects are slightly weaker than those reported in Figure 1, this analysis still does not directly rule out the possibility of a recruitment effect. Thus, our next step is to consider a scenario that would produce positive evidence in favor of the practical mechanism.            "
"50","Specifically, in the supporting information, we consider partisan differences in our original estimates. If the recruitment mechanism characterizes the process, we would expect to see clear differences in the effect of high‐profile Democratic (Republican) women on Democratic (Republican) candidates. High‐profile women are unlikely to prioritize candidate recruitment efforts (of men or women) for the opposing party. However, as we show in the supporting information, there are not major differences by party.9 Instead, we find that high‐profile women yield positive effects (albeit with some uncertainty) on women in both parties. A possible explanation of this finding is that a high‐profile woman in one party may mobilize women in her party, but also countermobilize women in the opposing party.            "
"51","Finally, in our third analysis, we again estimate same‐state effects, but consider a scenario in which the symbolic pathway is likely to be stronger than the practical mechanism (though not completely removed). In the supporting information, we repeat the IPTW procedure after redefining treatment status based on major party female gubernatorial or Senate candidates who lost the election.10 We posit that by removing the high‐profile women who won their elections, we reduce (though do not eliminate) the practical, recruitment‐based mechanism because the prominent woman never took office in those cases.11 This leaves the symbolic pathway as the more likely explanation. The estimated effects of high‐profile losing candidates are similar to what we report in Figure 1, though there is a bit more uncertainty.            "
"52","Overall, we find the most support for the symbolic causal mechanism. When we attempt to isolate the symbolic pathway through the neighboring state and losing candidates analyses, we see results comparable to what we report in Figure 1. Moreover, when we look for a pattern that should emerge if the recruitment‐based mechanism drives this process, we find no such evidence. The aggregate nature of our data means that these findings are not definitive, but they suggest that prominent female politicians predominantly play a symbolic role in mobilizing female candidates.            "
"53","The preceding analyses present tests of our role model theoretical framework, yielding several important patterns. First, the results indicate support for our central hypothesis (Hypothesis 1): High‐profile female officeholders exert positive effects on female candidates for state legislature. Moreover, these positive effects are substantively important. The fact that we can expect, on average, seven additional women on state legislative ballots due to the presence of a prominent female officeholder is noteworthy. It means that thousands of voters could have the option to elect a woman to the state legislature."
"54","We do not find support for the hypothesis that this effect is stronger in the lower chamber as compared to the upper chamber (Hypothesis 2). Perhaps in addition to motivating new women to run for office, prominent women also have a positive effect on women's progressive ambition. Women serving in the lower chambers may be inspired to run for higher offices, which would decrease female candidates in the lower chamber and increase those in the upper chamber. Future research could consider the differences in the effect of a high‐profile female officeholder on women's decision to initially run for office versus the potential impact on progressive ambition."
"55","We also assess empirical support for two possible causal mechanisms: a symbolic pathway in which the presence of a high‐profile woman inspires female candidates and a practical mechanism based in prominent female politicians' wider recruitment networks. Across three analyses, we find the most support for the symbolic mechanism. We demonstrate that even high‐profile women whose capacity to recruit is nonexistent (female governors or senators in neighboring states) or reduced (losing female candidates for governor or senator) still exert positive effects on female candidates for state legislature. Moreover, in our examination of party‐based effects, we find no evidence of strategic recruitment."
"56","Finally, we show some evidence that the effect of a female governor or U.S. senator does not end with the election season; at least some of the women who are motivated to enter (or remain in) politics due to a prominent woman are able to win elections and directly influence political outcomes. Both our contemporaneous and legacy estimates indicate that electing a prominent woman can improve women's presence in politics beyond just the high‐profile office. The increase in female legislators we find is likely not large enough to give women equal descriptive representation, but it could make an important difference in many areas of the legislative process as well as in the substantive representation of female constituents."
"57","This research yields findings that are important both for scholarly understandings of the political representation of women as well as normative assessments of the quality of democracy in American politics. First, it demonstrates that the role model effect is not limited to the political behavior of the mass public (e.g., voting or involvement in a campaign). We contend that female role models can affect the choice to directly enter politics made by some women. Given that women who run for or hold political office likely have a greater influence on women's substantive representation than those in the mass public who become more involved as citizens, we contend that our results uncover the most politically important influence of female role models."
"58","Our results are important in light of similar work that tests the influence of peer female legislators and finds no discernible effect (e.g., Broockman 2014). While peers do not exert an effect in state legislatures, we find that role models do cause female candidates to emerge. This contrast leads to the question of whether peer effects exist at higher levels in the American context (e.g., the U.S. Congress). Our data do not provide the necessary analytic leverage, but we speculate that they do not exist. If the positive effect of prominent female politicians is driven by symbolism, then it is likely to be most influential among inexperienced female politicians (e.g., women in state legislatures). Women who run for offices at higher levels—where the financial and career stakes can be relatively more consequential—may decide to do so based primarily on strategic considerations rather than inspiration from other women in politics.         "
"59","Our work also provides key insights for research on descriptive representation. One line of inquiry in that literature considers whether a representative who does not share the relevant descriptive trait can still represent members of the group; for example, can a white, liberal Democrat represent African American constituents' interests (e.g., Grose 2011)? The current research provides one example in which a descriptive representative is uniquely important. If women in a state become represented by a female governor or U.S. senator, they receive descriptive and substantive benefits as a direct consequence. However, our results also indicate that women in the state may also gain more descriptive and substantive representation from the additional women who subsequently run for legislative office. Such an increase would be realized most prominently due to women who win their elections, but even losing candidates can exert substantive impact (Sulkin 2005). In short, we find that descriptive representation can build on itself.         "
"60","From a normative perspective, we find that electing a woman to a state's most prominent offices has major significance for the advancement of women in politics. Our evidence does not support the possibility of electing a prominent woman to office causing a backlash against other women (e.g., Sanbonmatsu 2008). Indeed, electing a female governor or senator would likely improve the friendliness of the state's political culture toward women, further increasing women in politics in a virtuous cycle. However, this potential for improvement should be considered along with the more sobering fact that the historical underrepresentation of women is itself the source of the positive effect we uncover here. Prominent women are likely inspirational to other women precisely because a woman's holding a high‐profile office is a somewhat rare event. Nonetheless, we contend that women in prominent offices are crucial to the goal of improving women's political representation. Beyond their direct influence on policy, high‐profile female politicians also have an indirect, but lasting legacy: They motivate more women to enter politics, thereby amplifying the political voice of women.
