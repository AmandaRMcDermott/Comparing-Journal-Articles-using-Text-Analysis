"1","The composition of the courts affects bureaucratic decision making only under the following five critical conditions. First, bureaucrats must have discretion; otherwise, there would be no opportunity for external forces, including the courts, to influence their actions. Second, judges must have discretion; if they did not, rulings would be independent of the ideological composition of the courts. Third, judges' ideology must affect their rulings, and according to the literature it does (e.g., Segal and Spaeth 1993).         "
"2","Fourth, administrative officials must find it costly to have their decisions overturned in court; and, here again, prior research indicates this condition holds (e.g., Tiller and Spiller 1999). When an agency loses a case, a judge typically remands the matter for further bureaucratic and judicial review, which drains resources. Moreover, as McCubbins and Schwartz (1984) argue, rulings against an agency can set off a “fire alarm” to Congress that officials are not correctly performing their duties. Because lawsuits themselves drain resources and can set off fire alarms, agencies have an incentive to avoid litigation by implementing decisions that regulated parties believe the courts will uphold (e.g., Kagan 1995, 103).         "
"3","Finally, officials must possess and take advantage of unbiased information about judicial ideology, and thus, about the likelihood that a particular case will be overturned in court. As Lucas notes, in order to assume that individuals are incorporating information about a prospective event, one must assume “they have fairly stable arrangements for collecting and processing information, and that they utilize this information forecasting the future” (1977, 15). Most importantly, officials must possess information on judicial ideology. Previous research suggests that they do. For example, Estreicher and Revesz (1989) argue opportunities for “forum shopping,” the practice of seeking a court likely to favor one's positions, have encouraged agencies not to comply with existing legal precedent but instead to obtain an agreeable verdict in an ideologically sympathetic venue (see also Clermont and Eisenberg 1995).         "
"4","In sum, the composition of the courts will influence bureaucratic decisions only if officials and judges have discretion, judges' ideology influences their rulings, officials possess information about judges' ideology, and officials attempt to avoid being overturned in court."
"5","The Code of Federal Regulations defines wetlands as “those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal conditions do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.”1 Federal jurisdiction over wetlands derives from Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1977, which requires anyone interested in filling or otherwise developing the property of a wetland to obtain a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. In addition, the act gives the EPA the authority to set guidelines for the issuing of permits and veto power over any permit approved by the Corps.         "
"6","The guidelines established by the EPA stipulate three requirements, each of which allows for substantial bureaucratic discretion:1 there can be no practicable alternative to the project, the permit can not result in the significant destruction of waterways, and proper mitigation must be conducted.1 The last requirement enables officials to demand that developers create or restore other wetlands.         "
"7","The imprecise nature of the guidelines arguably engenders uncertainty about the manner in which applications are evaluated, but administrative procedures reduce this uncertainty.1 Applicants submit their proposals to the Corps district office with jurisdiction over the property of the wetland. The Corps has 38 U.S. district offices, each of which is supervised by one of the eight regional Corps divisions. An applicant is entitled to a preapplication consultation from Corps engineers, and once an application is complete, the Corps issues a public invitation for comments on the proposed project. The agency posts the notice in public locations and sends it to potentially interested parties, such as owners of adjoining property and conservation organizations, the latter of which often offer detailed alternative plans.1 If the issues raised by the comments cannot be handled informally, the Corps holds a public hearing to which the interested parties are invited. Only subsequent to all of these stages does the agency issue a decision. This process, from completion of the application through the decision, generally takes between two and three months.         "
"8","If the Corps issues a permit, the EPA can veto it. In practice, EPA vetoes of Corps permit decisions are exceedingly rare; since the regulations went into effect in 1979, the EPA has vetoed only 11 of the approximately 150,000 permit applications.1 This small number could, of course, imply that the Corps anticipates and seeks to minimize EPA vetoes just as I hypothesize it does for judicial reversals. In my empirical analysis, I will therefore account for this potential influence of the EPA on the Corps' decision making.         "
"9","The federal courts have jurisdiction over lawsuits filed against Corps officials. In general, the venue is limited to the district court of the wetland or the Corps district office responsible for the decision.1 The relevant appellate court thus hears appeals, and as Humphries and Songer note, the appellate court is almost always “the final arbiter” for lawsuits over administrative decisions (1999, 208). My data is consistent with this claim; for these administrative decisions, the Supreme Court did not hear any cases and the appellate courts heard 24 cases.         "
"10","Lawsuits against the Corps can be divided into two categories: those contesting the denial of a permit and those filed by environmental groups or others challenging the approval of one. Plaintiffs often argue that the Corps violated the Administrative Procedure Act by behaving in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner, that the administrative process is itself unconstitutional, or, in the case of parties challenging an approval, that officials failed to implement a nondiscretionary portion of the Clean Water Act. The most common charge is arbitrary and capricious behavior."
"11","I conducted seven interviews with Corps officials about their involvement with litigation, and all of them indicated that the Corps attempts to avoid going to court. For instance, an engineer in the Seattle district noted, “I've never had a project that's gone to court, and I pride myself on that” (phone interview, 7 August 2001). An engineer in the Vicksburg district acknowledged receiving threats of litigation “quite a bit,” but emphasized that she could usually convince prospective litigants they would lose in court or else reach a compromise agreeable to them (phone interview, 9 August 2001). The other five officials expressed similar sentiments.1"
"12","These officials with whom I spoke revealed knowledge of the ideological composition of their courts and expressed the belief that the composition would influence rulings. For instance, an official whose decisions would be litigated in the Southern District Court of Mississippi and Court for the Fifth Circuit, which are dominated by Republican appointees,1 stated that the courts were “pro‐property rights” in her area and thus likely to rule in favor of developers (phone interview, 9 August 2001). Likewise, an official whose decisions would be tried in the California Northern District Court, almost evenly split between Democratic and Republican appointees,1 commented that litigants would be taking a large risk if they filed suit with the hope of securing a sympathetic judge (phone interview, 7 August 2001).         "
"13","I also interviewed two associates of interest groups, who argued that Corps officials use their knowledge of judicial ideology in making decisions about wetlands permits. In particular, an employee for the National Wildlife Federation said that when Corps officials know litigation would occur in a highly conservative court, they essentially ignore threats of lawsuits from environmental groups (phone interview, 13 August 2001). An employee who monitors the Corps for the Center for Biological Diversity similarly observed that judicial ideology influences Corps officials' decisions (phone interview, 6 August 2001)."
"14","This description of wetlands policy suggests that it satisfies the five necessary conditions laid out for the composition of the courts to affect bureaucratic decisions. Agency officials have substantial discretion, attempt to avoid litigation, and are knowledgeable about the composition of their courts. Judges have discretion and, according to those involved in the policy implementation, are influenced by ideology when deciding cases. Moreover, consistent with the contention that the conditions are satisfied, anecdotal evidence indicates that judges' ideology affects the officials' decisions. What remains in question is whether any sort of systematic influence occurs."
"15","The data I employ involve 18,331 decisions by the Army Corps between 1988 and 1996 over whether to issue a permit for the development of wetlands. The data come from the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental research organization that acquired the information through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the individual Army Corps districts, each of which maintains the records on wetlands permits for the region it oversees. The dataset does not include certain Corps decisions. First, several districts were either unable or unwilling to provide the data in a manageable format.1 Second, the Corps has granted a few state governments primary authority for reviewing the applications; analyzing these administrative decisions would require separate examination.1 Third, I have included only those applications for which an applicant's ability to “forum shop” for a favorable district court is limited. Venue can be granted in either the court for the Corps office responsible for the application or the court for the property of the wetland, and I have included only applications for which one district court has jurisdiction over the Corps office and the property. The issue of forum shopping is an interesting one, but beyond the scope of the current analysis.         "
"16","Even with these exclusions, the data have large regional variation. The applications originate from the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, and West. In addition, they encompass nine of the 12 regional appellate courts and 23 of the 90 district courts for the 50 states."
"17","To analyze whether the composition of these courts influences Corps' officials decisions, I adopt a one‐equation logit specification in which the dependent variable, Permit Issued, equals one if the Corps issues a permit and zero otherwise, and in which the critical independent variables reflect the liberalism of the district and appellate courts. Formally, the econometric model can be stated as:            "
"18","Two potential concerns about the specification demand attention. The first is the possibility that applicants, anticipating judicial review of Corps decisions, structure their applications to account for the ideology of the courts. This behavior is unlikely to happen often because applicants usually do not have the option of redesigning their projects.1 To the extent such behavior does occur, however, it biases against confirmation of my hypothesis. Thus, β1 and β2 will, if anything, understate the impact of the composition of the lower courts.         "
"19","The second issue involves the selection of the observations; if the data exclusions biased the results, a selection model would need to be adopted. To assess whether such bias occurs, I analyzed a Heckman selection model for each possible combination of district court and Army Corps district in every year. The first‐stage equation estimated the probability that data were observed for a district court‐Corps office combination in a year, while the second stage modeled the relationship between the ideology of the courts and the percentage of permits granted. The estimates indicated that the selection does not significantly alter the findings.1"
"20","Accordingly, I present the results from equation (1). The following discusses the measurement of the variables in this specification, and in doing so, delineates the individual control variables.         "
"21"," Liberalism of Appellate Court and District Court. I base the variables capturing the ideology of the district and appellate courts on the party of the appointing president. Students of the lower courts emphasize the importance of the president in determining their ideological composition (e.g., Goldman 1997, 361), and research suggests that judges appointed by Democratic presidents are more likely to favor environmental protection than are Republican appointees (Kovacic 1991; Ringquist and Emmert 1999). For the district courts, in which a single judge hears a case, my measure of judicial ideology equals the percentage of full‐time judges who were appointed by a Democratic president. The percentage captures that potential litigants can know about the composition of the court but not which judge would hear their case. Analogously for the appellate courts, in which a panel of three judges hears a case,1 my measure equals the likelihood of receiving a panel in which a majority of the judges were appointed by a Democratic president.1"
"22"," Liberalism of District Court ranges from 0.000 to 1.000, with a standard deviation of 0.201; Liberalism of Appellate Court, from 0.000 to 0.500, with a standard deviation of 0.136. Two‐thirds of each variance derives from regional variation; the other one‐third, intertemporal change. The means, which equal 0.301 for the district courts and 0.272 for the appellate courts, indicate the dominance of Presidents Reagan and Bush, Sr. appointees (Epstein et al. 1994, 646‐7 and 657).         "
"23","Of course, judges who are appointed by presidents of the same party may have different preferences, and scholars have offered measures that incorporate other influences on appellate judges' decision making. For example, Humphries and Songer (1999) classify the judges by the region of appointment, and Tate and Handberg (1991) examine whether the appointing president was liberal, conservative, or moderate. I have estimated the model with these alternative measures and in each case obtained substantively similar results.         "
"24"," Congressional Liberalism. I measure the ideology of Congress with the ratings of the League of Conservation Voters (LCV). Groseclose, Levitt, and Snyder (1999) argue that the raw ratings cannot be used intertemporally, and offer a method for intertemporal use. Shipan and Lowry (2001) have applied this method to the LCV scores, and I use these adjusted scores, measuring congressional liberalism with the median rating among the members of the House Committee on Resources, one of the committees with jurisdiction over wetlands. I focus on a committee rather than the floor and on the House rather than both chambers, because these variables are highly collinear (ρ > 0.9). Furthermore, scholars of congressional oversight emphasize House committees' pivotal roles (e.g., Calvert, Moran, and Weingast 1987).1"
"25"," Reagan Administration, Bush Administration, and Clinton Administration. I include a set of three indicators for presidential administration. During the years covered by my data, each commander of the Army Corps and administrator of the EPA served throughout the entire term of the president that had appointed him or her. I therefore control simultaneously for the effects of the individual president, the leadership of the Army Corps, and the leadership of the EPA.1"
"26"," Budgetary Signal.            Krause (1999) argues that the budgetary signals of the president and Congress influence bureaucratic behavior. The president's and Congress's average proposals for the Corps and EPA are correlated at ρ > 0.7, and when I include each actor's proposal in my analysis only the president's is significant. Thus, I use presidential proposals to indicate the budgetary signal.1Wood and Waterman (1993) and Ringquist (1995) indicate that higher budgets are associated with increased protection of the environment, suggesting that Budgetary Signal should be negatively correlated with the likelihood of a permit.         "
"27"," Liberalism of the Supreme Court. Although the probability of the Supreme Court granting certiorari to a case on a wetlands permit is low, it is not zero. I therefore control for the potential effect of the justices' ideology. I use Martin and Quinn's (2002) dynamic ideal points, which rank the justices on a liberal‐conservative continuum. Specifically, my variable equals the median of the justices' ideal points in each year. The Martin‐Quinn ideal points are highly correlated with justices' votes on economic and regulatory issues and are therefore appropriate for my analysis.         "
"28"," Applicants' Legal Success, Interest Groups' Legal Success. Two variables reflect published lawsuits on wetlands permits. The first, which measures the legal success of applicants, is coded as the number of suits applicants won minus the number lost during the previous year in the relevant district and appellate courts. The second accounts for the success of legal challenges to the issuing of a permit. It largely reflects the success of organized interest groups: in all but three of these challenges an interest group was one of the plaintiffs.1Interest Groups' Legal Success is coded as the number of lawsuits won minus the number lost by parties contesting permits during the previous year in the relevant lower courts in which the issuing of a permit would be contested. I control separately for the influence of applicants and interest groups because their lawsuits may differ substantially in purpose. In particular, interest groups may use litigation to delay the development of a wetland even if the prospects for legal success are slim (Meier 1985, 30).         "
"29"," State Ideology. Scholars of the bureaucracy argue that local preferences can influence officials' decisions because successful policy implementation can depend upon the cooperation of the community (e.g., Scholz, Twombly, and Headrick 1991). To account for this influence, I employ Berry et al.'s (1998) measure of state government ideology,1 which is based on the Americans for Democratic Action's and Committee on Political Education's ratings for the congressional delegation from each state in every year.         "
"30"," County per Capita Income. Research suggests that bureaucratic officials will be more likely to regulate economic activity when the economy is strong (e.g., Krause 1996, 1099). Such an effect, combined with the potential influence of local preferences, could cause Corps officials to be less likely to grant permits the stronger the local economy. I therefore control for the annual per capita income of the county in which the wetland is located.         "
"31"," Percent of State with Wetlands. Regulators' decisions could be influenced by the quantity of wetlands in the region. In areas with a large concentration of wetlands, for example, officials may be less likely to issue permits because any given wetland may have a large influence on the ecosystem. Percent of State with Wetlands is based on the National Resources Conservation Service's National Resource Inventory (NRI), which uses sampling techniques to estimate for each state the percentage of surface area covered by wetlands. The agency conducts the inventory every five years; for the applications of 1988–92, I use the 1987 NRI and for those of 1993–96, the 1992 NRI.         "
"32"," Indicators for Army Corps Divisions and Years. These variables consist of sets of year and division dummies that account for otherwise unexplained variation in officials' decisions across regional division and time. The Corps has eight supervisory divisions: the Great Lakes and Ohio River, Mississippi Valley, North Atlantic, Northwestern, South Atlantic, South Pacific, Southwestern, and Pacific Ocean divisions. Given the exclusions of the data, the applications come from all but the last division. Implementation may vary across these supervisory units because of differences in bureaucratic culture (e.g., Wilson 1989, 91). I control for this type of variation in order to avoid overestimating the impact of regional differences in the composition of the courts. Similarly, I include year dummies to avoid overestimating the impact of intertemporal changes in this composition. For instance, some observers of the Corps argue that the agency has become more “green” over time, and the year dummies account for any such effect.1 Because several of the other control variables vary solely across time, only three year effects can be identified in the estimation.1"
"33","The results appear in Table 1. Because I use a logit specification, coefficients are not immediately interpretable. Therefore, the table presents not only coefficients and standard errors but also the marginal effect of each variable's increasing a standard deviation from its mean, holding all other variables at their means, on the relative probability the Corps issues a permit.1 The findings strongly support the hypothesis that the more liberal are the lower courts in which agency decisions may be challenged, the less likely is the Corps to issue a permit. For each lower court, the coefficient is significant at conventional levels (p < 0.05, two‐tailed). If the liberalism of the appellate court increases by a standard deviation, the relative likelihood of the Corps granting a permit decreases by approximately 8%; a standard deviation increase in the liberalism of the district court decreases the relative likelihood by about 6%. The combined effect of increasing the liberalism of both courts by one standard deviation is approximately 14%.1"
"34","This marginal effect is comparable to other, more established determinants of bureaucratic behavior. For example, the effect of congressional ideology is significant although smaller than the impact of the composition of the lower courts. That judicial ideology has a larger effect than congressional ideology is particularly noteworthy given the literature on “congressional dominance” of the bureaucracy.1"
"35","Among the other national political controls, almost all of coefficients have the expected effects. The probability of the Corps granting a permit is significantly higher under Reagan than Clinton, as the president's budgetary proposal for the Army Corps and EPA increases, and as the Supreme Court becomes more conservative. The impact of the liberalism of the Supreme Court suggests that even though the probability of the Court granting certiorari to a case over a wetlands permit is low, this threat may influence bureaucrats' decisions. However, this result is not robust to some of the alternative specifications discussed earlier. For example, when the Humphries‐Songer scores are used to estimate appellate judges' preferences or when members' partisan affiliation is used to measure congressional liberalism, the impact of the Supreme Court is not significant at conventional levels. Together, these findings suggest that a separate analysis of the relationship between the composition of the Supreme Court and bureaucratic decisions, particularly one with a lengthier time series, should be undertaken."
"36","The one surprising result concerning the national political controls is the insignificant effect of the Bush administration dummy. The parameter estimates suggest that the probability of the Corps granting a permit did not significantly differ between the Bush and Clinton administrations. One possible reason is that the difference between administrations is largely captured by the variation in their budgetary proposals; Clinton's average budgetary proposal was significantly higher than that of Bush.1"
"37","The effects of the local controls are smaller than the joint impact of the lower courts' ideology but are typically significant. State liberalism, the per capita income of the county, and the percentage of wetlands in the state all significantly decrease the likelihood of the Corps granting a permit. The effect of litigation is asymmetric between applicants and interest groups; the impact of applicants' legal success is significant while the impact of interest groups' litigation is not. As mentioned previously, a possible reason for such asymmetry is that groups may use the legal process to delay a wetlands project even when they believe the courts will rule in favor of the Corps. Consistent with this explanation, when one substitutes groups' gross (rather than net) wins, the effect is in the expected direction and statistically significant.1"
"38","The final control variables, the indicators for the Army Corps divisions and years, have significant effects, supporting inclusion of the factors. The significance of the division indicators is consistent with evidence indicating administrative behavior varies across regional units of an agency due to differences in bureaucratic culture. In fact, the results provide even greater evidence of this effect because the analysis eliminates the possibility that the variation derives solely from differences in the composition of the lower courts."
"39","A number of scholars argue that the courts have played an increasingly important role in policy implementation over the past fifty years (e.g., Tiller 1998; Wilson 1989). Yet, the systematic effects of the courts on bureaucratic behavior have remained largely unexplored. As Wilson surmises, “There have been countless essays on whether the courts should intervene as they do but scarcely any that describe what systematic (as opposed to particular) changes in bureaucratic life this intervention has produced” (1989, 282).         "
"40","This article has provided such a systematic analysis. I began by identifying critical necessary conditions for the composition of the courts to affect administrative decisions. After establishing that wetlands policy possesses these conditions, I analyzed decisions by the Army Corps of Engineers over whether to grant a permit for the development of wetlands. The analysis showed that officials were significantly less likely to issue a permit the more liberal the lower courts in which the decision could be litigated. Moreover, this effect was comparable in magnitude to other recognized determinants of bureaucratic behavior. These findings suggest that the courts play an important role in policy implementation, independently of rulings."
"41","The analysis has a number of other implications. For instance, the results indicate that policy implementation will not be consistent across federal court districts that differ in the ideological composition of their courts. However, such inconsistency might be reduced through forum shopping. The legal literature contains numerous articles that criticize forum shopping,1 and this study does not purport to be a normative analysis of the practice. However, if differences in regulatory treatment across districts are regarded as unfair or inefficient, the findings motivate the question of whether forum shopping might serve to alleviate such unfairness and inefficiency.         "
"42","A second implication involves the delegation of policy making by elected officials to bureaucracies. Scholars have analyzed the trade‐off that congressional members face between designing a policy that insulates their preferences versus one that accords an agency enough discretion to exploit its technical expertise (e.g., Bawn 1995; de Figueiredo 2002; Epstein and O'Halloran 1999). In this research, members are concerned about the ability of future Congresses, presidents, and administrative officials to alter the implementation of the policy. My results suggest that an additional concern of this research should be the potential influence of the courts. In particular, when the president and Congress increase bureaucratic discretion, they may ultimately be granting influence to the judges with jurisdiction over the administrative decisions.         "
