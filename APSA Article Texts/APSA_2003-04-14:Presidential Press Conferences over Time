"1","Political scientists have used two broad perspectives to explain the president's public activities.2 The presidency‐centered approach claims that contextual variables, such as technological, economic, and political factors, shape presidents' public activities, such as speechmaking. The president‐centered perspective maintains that individual presidents and their unique preferences determine the number of presidential speeches.         "
"2","The president‐ and presidency‐centered perspectives also frame the explanation of presidential press conferences.2 The president‐centered model of press conferences holds that individual president's preferences determine the frequency of press conferences. Grossman and Kumar (1981, 243–9) note that the press conference is different for each president. Some presidents, like John Kennedy, enjoyed giving press conferences and used them as a means to express their policy priorities. Other presidents avoided press conferences, because of their dislike of the media (Nixon) or because they preferred other means of communicating with the media (Ford).         "
"3","Although presidents begin each press conference like a speech, with a statement about their policy priorities and other topics that they wish to discuss, the press conference is more for the press than for the president. Press conferences give the media direct access to the president and allow members of the media to ask specific questions and receive immediate responses from the president. Nevertheless, Grossman and Kumar find it odd that some presidents have avoided press conferences because presidents have several ways to control them (but see Lammers 1981). The president calls on members of the media during the question and answer portion of the conference and might strategically avoid certain reporters who he knows will ask a difficult or controversial question. Reporters often hint at what questions they will ask in daily “gaggles” (see Kumar 2001), so members of the president's staff can advise the president on which reporters to avoid. Presidents can also announce press conferences just hours before they take place, leaving reporters less prepared to ask tough questions. Individual presidents set the tone and direction of press conferences, and variation by president is crucial to explaining press conferences (Grossman and Kumar 1981; Walcott and Hult 1995).         "
"4","The presidency‐centered perspective maintains that political, economic, and technological factors are more central to the explanation of presidential press conferences than individual presidents are. Hager and Sullivan (1994) find that divided government, a president's reputation, and technological advances all lead to a decline in press conferences over time. They also observe that press conferences have declined since the Truman administration because presidents have more and less confrontational means with which to convey a message publicly. Hager and Sullivan conclude that presidential press conference behavior “reflects more the standard trend generated by contextual forces,” (1994, 1094) and that press conferences offer an uncontrolled setting that presidents will avoid to avert embarrassment and misstatement (see also Lammers 1981). Furthermore, Hager and Sullivan argue that the presidency‐centered approach “explained variation [just] as well as the individual presidents model” and it “provides the best opportunity for systematic study of the presidency” (1994, 1098).         "
"5","The importance of Hager and Sullivan's (1994) work lies in their alternative explanation to the conventional wisdom, that presidential press conferences are not primarily a function of individual presidents and their decisions. Despite this contribution, Hager and Sullivan's article should be revisited for several reasons. First, Hager and Sullivan's (1994, 1095) press conference model raises methodological concerns. Their corrections for autocorrelation and treatment of missing data likely compromise the accuracy of their findings.2 Second, their findings disagree with the qualitative evidence, which characterizes the press conference as a unique public event over which presidents have substantial discretion and control. Moreover, their findings may be time bound. Presidents Bush and Clinton, who governed after the Hager and Sullivan study, used press conferences in a manner much different from their predecessors. They gave many more press conferences than their predecessors did and used press conferences as a tool in their public strategy. Indeed, President Bush used press conferences to control information the media disseminated about him (Nelson 1998, 13).2 Accounting for 12 more years of data could alter Hager and Sullivan's (1994) basic conclusions. Finally, the causal logic of Hager and Sullivan's argument and conclusions is that technological factors and political context have reduced the frequency of press conferences. If this argument is correct, then contextual factors should account for the frequency of press conferences under Bush and Clinton as well. If the press conference activity of these presidents is distinct, however, we will have critical evidence that the presidency‐centered thesis is not determinative of presidential press conference activity.         "
"6","My first task is to replicate Hager and Sullivan's press conferences model (1994, 1095) using their dataset and methods.2Table 1 presents four models. Model A is Hager and Sullivan's model published in their 1994 article. It shows that several contextual and two presidential dummies are statistical significant. From this model, Hager and Sullivan (1994, 1094) concluded that presidency‐centered variables provide for a more accurate explanation of press conferences than president‐centered variables do.         "
"7","Model B, C, and D are my attempts at replication, using Hager and Sullivan's (1994) dataset, their methodological techniques, and estimation procedures. Because Hager and Sullivan are unclear whether they model a single AR coefficient at the sixth lag or one for each of the first six lags, I model press conferences using both techniques. Model B includes an AR6 coefficient for each of the first six lags. It is similar to Hager and Sullivan's published findings (Model A), but the significant Ljung‐Box Q indicates substantial autocorrelation in the model. The statistically significant coefficients are therefore invalid. Model C includes an AR6 coefficient at only the sixth lag. It produces no statistically significant variables. Finally, I include 1966 in Model D, which also has unreliable estimates due to autocorrelation.2 In short, I cannot replicate Hager and Sullivan's (1994) findings, and some alternative model specifications produce unreliable estimates due to autocorrelation.         "
"8","I now present an alternative model using Hager and Sullivan's data updated through 1996. Hager and Sullivan's findings may be further undermined or possibly supported with three more presidential terms and 12 more years and of data. Table 2 presents these findings with a few changes. First, because there is a fairly clear decline in press conferences from 1949 to 1988, I include a time trend variable to account for this decrease.2 Second, I model Bush and Clinton dummies.2 The qualitative evidence supports press conference control by individual presidents. If dummy variables for Presidents Bush and Clinton are statistically significant, then we have evidence that the press conference is an event over which presidents have substantial individual control.         "
"9"," Table 2 shows the importance of individual presidents to the explanation of press conferences. In Model E, both the Bush and Clinton dummies are statistically significant and positive, controlling for all contextual variables hypothesized by Hager and Sullivan (1994) to be important. The Bush and Clinton administrations increase the number of press conferences by about 31 and 28, respectively. Consistent with the qualitative evidence that President Bush preferred press conferences as part of his public strategy, this quantitative evidence also shows that press conference activity varies by administration, especially the most recent two. I demonstrate the robustness of my findings in Model F, where I use alternative measures of similar concepts modeled by Hager and Sullivan (1994).2 Moreover, the joint F‐tests indicate that Bush and Clinton administration dummies explain variation in press conferences better than presidency‐centered variables do.2 Even though divided government contributes to fewer press conferences, these president‐centered variables add more to the explanation of press conferences than presidency‐centered variables do.         "
"10"," Hager and Sullivan (1994, 1094) concluded that context explains press conferences, and individual presidents have little influence over them. I have shown, however, that their results are questionable. I am unable to replicate their findings or produce reliable test results with their data. The updated models of presidential press conferences in Table 2 instead indicate that the president's “reputation” does not matter in the explanation of presidential press conferences. Divided government does predict fewer press conferences, but president‐centered variables best explain the number of press conferences from Truman through Clinton's first term. Indeed, the significant Bush and Clinton dummy variables are evidence that the underlying logic of the presidency‐centered thesis is flawed.         "
"11","Presidential press conferences are more a function of individual preferences than the political environment. The influence of divided government on press conferences through 1996 indicates (see Figure 1), nevertheless, that the broader context can shape presidential decisions. Hence, the debate between president‐ and presidency‐centered theses may no longer be useful for framing explanations of presidential activity. Instead, efforts may be better spent identifying the extent to which presidents' personal preferences are constrained by contextual circumstances. Presidents make decisions, which is the essence of presidential governance. But even when they differ from others in their approaches to governing, presidents are still bound by an environment that constrains their options. It remains to be seen if future presidents will continue to give press conferences consistent with their own personal preferences or alter their behavior in response to the political environment. In the case of press conferences through 1996, it appears that individual presidents have more control over their decisions and are therefore less constrained by the political environment than they may be in other areas of presidential politics.
