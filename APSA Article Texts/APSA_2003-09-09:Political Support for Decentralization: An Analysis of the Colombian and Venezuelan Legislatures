"1","In a region traditionally seen as the playground of caudillos, dictators, and strongmen, the reversal of “the centralist tradition” (Veliz 1980) is surprising. Within Latin America though, decentralization in Colombia and Venezuela is especially interesting. These are two of the region's oldest democracies, and while they are considered among the most consolidated, they are currently among those under the greatest stress, making it important to understand attempts to reform the state. Moreover, Colombia and Venezuela represent a useful constellation of values on several variables. Both have had a long experience with democracy, but both decentralized relatively late. This ensures that the process of decentralization is not conflated with democratization, two concepts that are harder to separate in other cases. A long experience with democracy is also helpful as it ensures a congressional record where debates over decentralization can be examined.         "
"2","In addition, the party systems are similar. Two major parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, emerged early in Colombia (1815 and 1849, respectively), established deep social roots, and built bases of support that cut across class lines. The hegemony of the two parties began to erode after the National Front agreement ended in 1974 and new parties have gained more seats in recent elections. In Venezuela, electoral support for the dominant Acción Democrática (AD, founded in 1936) and COPEI (Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, founded in 1946) has eroded in recent elections.1 This pattern can be seen in Table 1, which compares the percentage of seats held by political parties in both chambers of congress in Colombia and Venezuela.         "
"3","While the number of parties in these two countries is similar, electoral laws vary in important ways. Colombia uses simple quotas and least remainders to elect members of both chambers from multimember districts.1 However, because parties in Colombia exercise relatively little control over their label, the proliferation of multiple lists from each party is common. The result is that most lists fail to elect more than one individual (Archer and Shugart 1997). Consequently, members of congress in Colombia have strong incentives to build a personal reputation and weak incentives to follow the leadership of their party. In Venezuela, members of both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are elected using closed‐list proportional representation.1 In Venezuela, because of closed‐list PR elections, rank‐and‐file members have stronger incentives to follow the party (Carey and Shugart 1995) as Venezuelan party leaders determine not only who is placed on the ballot, but also where on the list they fall (Crisp 1997). This means that parties are more unified and disciplined in Venezuela than in Colombia.         "
"4","Within both countries there is significant variation in wealth and trust in government (see appendix). Colombia and Venezuela also provide variation with respect to federalism, with weak federalism in Venezuela (Grindle 2000) and Colombia being a “decentralized unitary republic” (Constitution of Colombia, 1991).1 Consequently, a comparison of Colombia and Venezuela makes it possible to determine if the structure of the state—federal or unitary—affects the role party identification, trust, and capacity play in a deputy's decision to promote decentralization.         "
"5","These are also good cases to study because their decisions to decentralize took place at about the same time. Among the first steps toward decentralization in Colombia was a 1968 constitutional amendment authorizing automatic transfers from the central government to department (state) governments. This remained the primary source of department finance, but municipalities were authorized to collect and administer the property tax after 1983 and received a percentage of the VAT after 1986. Direct mayoral and gubernatorial elections were established through a 1986 constitutional amendment and the 1991 constitution, respectively. The decentralization of services took place at approximately the same time. This occurred through a revision in the departmental and municipal codes transferring the responsibility for the direct provision and administration of education (in 1988) and health care (in 1990) to the municipal governments.1"
"6","A centralized federation, Venezuela's 1961 constitution guaranteed the states a share of the federal budget. Decentralization began in 1988, when directly elected mayors and governors replaced presidential appointees. In December of 1989, the “Decentralization Law” allowed the states to request administrative control in the areas of education, culture, sports, human development, environmental protection, health, consumer protection, and civil defense. Funding to encourage states to request these competencies came through FIDES in 19931 and participation in oil revenues in 1996.1 While the municipal government's fiscal authority includes lucrative taxes (commercial licenses and property taxes), the states depend primarily on income from federal transfers (Barrios 1998; González de Pacheco 1998).1"
"7","Thus, Colombia and Venezuela are both more decentralized now than twenty years ago, but decentralization has taken a different form in each country. Decentralization in Colombia transferred responsibilities to all subnational governments at once, while Venezuela let the states request responsibilities. This means that in Venezuela, the decentralization of service provision varies from state to state.1 Another important difference is that decentralization in Venezuela has focused on the state level, but in Colombia, it has targeted the municipal level.         "
"8","Most prior studies have focused on assessing the effects of decentralization, resulting in an extensive literature on the value of decentralization as a policy option with specific political and economic benefits. By bringing government closer to the citizens, decentralization becomes a way to improve the quality of democracy by enhancing participation and increasing representation (Blair 2000; Burki, Perry, and Dillinger 1999; Manor 1999; Peterson 1997; Pieterse 2001; and World Bank 2000). Decentralization can be a mechanism for building participatory democracy because it promotes inclusion and participation. Local governments are closer to citizens and better able to know their preferences (Hayek 1945) leading to better policy. This is expected to increase the quality of services while decreasing the cost of providing them. Moreover, as Tiebout (1956) argued, citizens will “walk” to the level of services at the price (taxes) they prefer, giving the government incentives to respond to demands. One way for subnational governments to dissuade citizens (and firms) from relocating is to provide public services as efficiently as possible (Weingast 1997; Williamson 1985).         "
"9","The combination of economic and political gains attributable to decentralization explains why an international institution (like the World Bank) might recommend decentralization to a country. A country's level of development might also explain why they decide to decentralize as more developed countries are more likely to have the structure in place to do so successfully (Bahl and Linn 1994). Likewise, federal states may find decentralization easier because the constitutional structure is set‐up to enforce these divisions (Breton 2000). But, this literature better explains intercountry variation in support for decentralization than intracountry variation. It provides no reasons why a given politician would be motivated to support decentralization, although at a general level one could claim they support it because of the aforementioned benefits or oppose it because of its risks as a policy option (see Prud'homme 1995).         "
"10","Current work has advanced our understanding of the impact of the party system on decentralization and provides some insight into variation in intracountry support for decentralization. Studies by Penfold‐Becerra (1999) and O'Neill (1999) suggest that some parties are more likely to support decentralization than others because of future electoral expectations. In the post‐National Front period in Colombia, the Liberal Party has been dominant, frequently winning the presidency and a majority of the seats in congress. O'Neill argues that when the Conservatives won the presidency in 1982 because two Liberal Party candidates split the vote, they realized this was a rare opportunity.1 Conservative Party members were also aware that certain areas of the country were consistent Conservative strongholds. Thus, while they temporarily controlled the national government they used the opportunity to decentralize to ensure that even when they did not control national political institutions, they would retain political power because they would consistently win at the subnational level in particular areas of the country. O'Neill argues that, “parties that find themselves in the executive of a strong centralized government may rationally choose to decentralize power if they do not expect to retain the executive indefinitely and if they expect to gain a significant percentage of power at the level(s) of government to which power is distributed” (O'Neill 1999, 27). Consequently, parties that are not nationally dominant, have significant regional power bases, and are established enough that they can make long‐term decisions should be the most likely to back decentralization.         "
"11","While not the kind of party O'Neill envisions as advancing decentralization, third parties may also have incentives to support it. Some small, ideologically based parties, such as the communists, compete and draw votes nationwide, but other parties draw their support disproportionately from one part of the country. This means that many of them also possess the same characteristics—regional strength but unlikely national victory—as large but nondominant parties. Decentralization would increase the number of offices for which these parties could compete, and endowing those offices with additional power would make them more valuable. Beyond electoral considerations, members of small parties have an additional incentive to support decentralization. The comparative party literature suggests that nontraditional parties are a response to crisis and perceived failings of the dominant parties (Mair 1997, for instance). In Colombia and Venezuela, the two largest parties have been criticized as corrupt and out of touch with citizens (Shugart 1992). Since people saw decentralization as a way to make government more responsive, and small parties frequently claimed to better represent citizen's interests, advocating a policy that would increase the accountability of government would be a logical and consistent position. Thus, deputies from small parties should also be more likely to propose decentralizing legislation.         "
"12","Finally, the internal organization of a party may affect their support for decentralization. Based on a comparison of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, Willis, Garman, and Haggard (1999) found that strong, state‐level party organizations created incentives for politicians to respond to their state's interests and promote decentralization, because subnational elites controlled nominations. While their model was developed primarily to explain intercountry variation, it could be extended to explain intracountry differences. Where nomination procedures vary across parties, political parties with decentralized nominations should have greater incentives to support decentralization than parties with centralized nomination procedures. The above discussion and expectations can be formally stated as Hypothesis 1a: Deputies from parties that are not nationally dominant (both large, nondominant parties and small parties) should be more likely than large, dominant parties to initiate decentralizing legislation. Hypothesis 1b: Deputies from parties with decentralized nomination procedures should be more likely to initiate decentralizing legislation than deputies from parties with centralized nomination procedures."
"13","While partisan identification may explain some variation in support for decentralization, it does not explain which deputies within a party push decentralization. Some authors have argued that in Colombia and Venezuela public strikes and popular protests convinced the government to decentralize (Nickson 1995). People saw government as generally nonresponsive and believed decentralization was a way to correct that. Grindle (2000) argues that dramatic institutional reform took place in Argentina, Bolivia, and Venezuela because politicians perceived a growing crisis of legitimacy. The political elite made the unusual decision to engage in dramatic giveaways of power because the risk of not doing so was much greater. Similarly, Rodriguez (1997) argues that in Mexico the PRI gave up some power at the subnational level in an attempt to retain power at the national level. These works can be adapted to explain why some politicians, but not others, support decentralization. Specifically, I argue that not all politicians are equally aware of, or place equal importance on, citizen's faith in the system. Those politicians who come from areas where the crisis is most acute should feel a much greater urgency for reform than those from areas where politics as usual seems to work. Formally then, Hypothesis 2: Deputies from areas of the country with the lowest levels of trust in the system will be more likely to initiate decentralizing legislation."
"14","In developing countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela, the capacity of subnational governments is likely to affect the success of decentralization (Rondinelli, Nellis, and Cheema 1984). If the capacity of the state is not fully developed, it is far more difficult for government to make decentralization work (Bahl and Linn 1994). The Tiebout (1956) model, where citizens relocate for the mix of services and taxes they find most appealing, is the basis for many of the hypothesized gains in efficiency from decentralization, but the model implicitly requires that subnational governments have the power to set taxes (including a reasonable tax base) and the ability to provide the services. This suggests that economic and bureaucratic capacity matter.         "
"15","Richer areas of a country may be better positioned to benefit from decentralization. Instead of the net outflow from richer to poorer states that frequently characterizes centralized systems, in a decentralized system, locally generated revenue remains in the state. Decentralization, in well‐off areas, can be a way to ensure that local taxpayers have greater control over resources. Government must have money and sufficient ability (bureaucratic capacity) to provide services in a decentralized system. Urban areas provide the dense populations that make subnational service provision efficient, while rural areas are usually not able to achieve the necessary economies of scale (Wallis and Oates 1988). Thus, I expect that more urban areas will be more likely to seek decentralization than rural areas. Wealth and urbanization are both part of a district's capacity, but district wealth captures aspects of the perceived economic benefits of decentralization, while urbanization is associated with chances of success. Wealthy areas seek decentralization because they expect to keep more money in the region; urban areas prefer decentralization because they expect to be able to administer services more effectively. This leads to Hypothesis 3: Deputies from areas expected to benefit from decentralization will be more likely to initiate decentralizing legislation."
"16","To test the above hypotheses, I collected data on party identification, trust in the system, capacity, and support for decentralization as described below. The Venezuela data covers the four congressional terms between 1979 and 1998. This period begins before the initiation of decentralizing reforms and ends with the arrival of Hugo Chavez Frías to power, because under Chavez, intergovernmental relations have been unpredictable. The only available bill initiation data for Colombia is from the 1986–1990 and 1994–1998 congresses. While this does not include the 1982–86 Betancur administration, which O'Neill highlights as important, the data includes observations before and after the 1991 constitution was adopted. Thus, while the Colombia data is not ideal, the data for both countries covers a period well after the initial move to democracy during which substantial decentralization occurred."
"17","Hypothesis 1a suggested that a party's future electoral prospects (based upon their size and national dominance) determine their willingness to support decentralization, with deputies from nondominant parties and from parties with decentralized nominations being the most likely to initiate decentralizing legislation. A deputy's partisan identification, the seats the party holds in the congress, and their electoral history determined whether a deputy is a member of the dominant party. Among the parties that were not dominant at the national level, I expected that small parties might behave differently from parties with a national (although not dominant) presence. Using the data from Table 1 on the percentage of seats the party held and the frequency with which they controlled the presidency, parties were classified as nationally dominant, nondominant, or small. In Colombia, the Liberal Party is the dominant party, the Conservative Party is nondominant, and all other parties are small. In Venezuela, I consider Acción Democrática (AD) to be the dominant party, COPEI to nondominant, and all other parties to be small.1"
"18","Hypothesis 1b suggested that support for decentralization is due to decentralized nomination procedures. In Colombia, because parties are not able to control the use of their label all parties effectively have decentralized nominations. A deputy can ensure that he or she is at the top of the list by running their own list, meaning they do not need the support of party leaders to ensure election. In Venezuela, however, there is variation across parties. Nomination procedures in AD are extremely centralized and national party leaders determine the list order. COPEI has used a mixed nomination strategy combining decisions by national party leaders with input from subnational party elites. Among small parties, information is only available for MAS (Movimiento al Socialismo), which has used primary elections to order the list (Crisp 2000). Consequently, using the dominant, nondominant, and small categories also permits an analysis of the impact of nomination procedures.         "
"19","The second hypothesis suggested that deputies from areas showing the greatest distrust in the system would be the most likely to support decentralization. Because distrust needed to be operationalized in a way that varied both within a country and across time it is not possible to use attitudinal surveys or data on strikes, riots, or demonstrations because this data only exists at the national level and is unavailable for much of the time period studied. Voter turnout is the best available measure of distrust. Failure to participate in an election through the simple act of voting indicates, among other things, a dissatisfaction with the system, politics, the candidates, and parties running, or all of the above.1 Colombian voter turnout in 1991 was only 33%, down from 58% in 1962. Even in Venezuela when voting was compulsory, turnout fell from 96% in 1973 to 53% in 1998 (International IDEA). As Grindle notes, “Even before the caracazo, Pérez and party leaders worried about increasing abstention rates in elections and diminishing levels of militancy within the parties” (2000, 203).         "
"20","Not voting is subtler, less risky, and less time consuming than joining a march or a demonstration. Those who do vote may not be happy with things in the country, but they must be convinced that elections are a way to change things; voters have enough trust in the system to expend the energy to vote. Therefore, while low voter turnout does not show the system is on the verge of collapse, it does reflect lower trust in the system. Of the few studies of nonvoters that have been conducted, the Doppelt and Shearer (1999) study of nonvoters in the United States provides some support for dissatisfaction with the system as a reason for not voting. While only one of the five clusters of nonvoters they identify (the “alienateds”) does not vote because of dissatisfaction with the system as a whole, a majority in each of the other four clusters believed the country had gotten seriously off‐track. Thus, while not the ideal measure, voter turnout provides a good measure of trust. It is also an advantageous measure as it varies within a country. In an effort to best utilize the intracountry and time serial variation the data affords, I subtracted the average voter turnout from turnout in the state that elected the deputy. States or departments with positive values are those with above average participation in elections indicating greater trust, those with below average turnout less trust.1"
"21","The third hypothesis suggested that deputies from areas that expect to benefit from decentralization would be more likely to support it and identified wealthier and urban areas as those most likely to benefit from decentralization. Wealthier areas expect to benefit because decentralization would given them greater control over their resources. The relative wealth of a deputy's district is measured as the percentage of total GDP generated in that state.1 The literature suggests that urban areas are better able to administer services efficiently (Wallis and Oates 1988) because they possess economies of scale that rural areas do not. Thus, the percentage of the population living in urban areas in a state is included as a measure of bureaucratic capacity, because once the central government transfers a service, a state or municipality must be prepared to administer it.1"
"22","In general, the use of state level data is acceptable because the state is the electoral district with two exceptions. First, after 1991 senators in Colombia were elected in a single nationwide district. For post‐1991 Colombian senators, voter turnout values are those for the 1994 Senate election while urbanization and GDP were coded as missing.1 Second, after 1993 half of the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies was elected in substate single‐member districts. Data on turnout, urbanization, and GDP was not available at the substate level, consequently the values used reflect the entire state.         "
"23","The dependent variable in the analysis is whether a deputy authored or coauthored a bill that would increase decentralization.1 The dataset focuses on sponsorship of decentralizing bills, not decentralizing laws, because I wish to identify the factors that make a deputy take action to advance decentralization, not the factors that determine success in passing legislation.1 Moreover, bill sponsorship is a way to advertise oneself as a supporter of decentralization, so a deputy may introduce a bill they expect to fail simply to provoke debate or to establish their position on the issue. Bill initiation attempts are a better indicator than intervening in debates or voting in support of someone else's bill because they identify the strongest supporters of decentralization—those willing to invest the time required to draft a bill and to take the political risk of leaving a paper trail.         "
"24","Decentralization is the transfer of functions from one level of government to lower levels of government within a given country (Rondinelli, Nellis, and Cheema 1984). Thus, decentralizing bills are those that would increase the political, fiscal, or administrative power of subnational governments (local, regional, or both). A bill must universally affect municipalities and/or states to be decentralizing. Consequently, bills that focus on a one‐time public works project in a particular municipality or region are not decentralizing.         "
"25","Bills can promote political decentralization by creating directly elected mayors or governors, regulating these offices, or establishing opportunities for citizens to participate in referendums. This category also includes bills that would change the structure of the country by creating a new state.1 Bills that would give new tax powers to subnational governments, increase intergovernmental transfers to subnational governments, or otherwise increase authority over revenue and expenditures increase fiscal decentralization.1 Bills that transfer specific competencies or services, such as education, to subnational governments enhance administrative decentralization. Of the bills classified as decentralizing in Venezuela, 31.6% were principally political, 21.1% fiscal, and 10.5% administrative. In Colombia, bills affecting political decentralization were 13.1% of the total, bills affecting fiscal decentralization were 19.4%, and those increasing administrative decentralization 37.4%.1"
"26","In Venezuela, some bills are initiated by the entire party. I did not use the three decentralizing bills initiated by “party faction us” in determining whether an individual deputy cosponsored a decentralizing bill because they violate the focus of this analysis on determinants of individual action to advance decentralization. This decision affected all three types of parties equally as one bill came from each.1 This was not an issue in Colombia.         "
"27","In addition to the independent variables discussed above, factors expected to affect the overall quantity of legislation a deputy initiates were also included in the analysis. We know that seniority is likely to affect the quantity of bills initiated (Shiller 1995). This finding applies not only to the United States, but also to Latin America where seniority is a positive and significant predictor of the number of bills initiated by members of congress in Colombia, although it is negative and significant in Venezuela (Taylor‐Robinson et al. 2001). Consequently, the number of terms a deputy has served in congress is included in the analysis. Finally, to control for the possibility that deputies elected from a national, rather than a subnational, district may be less interested in increasing the power of subnational governments, a dummy variable for the 1994–1998 Colombian Senate was included.         "
"28","The central question explored in this research is which members of congress support decentralization strongly enough to introduce a bill that would increase it. Thus, the logical unit of observation is members of congress.1 Data was collected on the above variables for all members of congress for the two Colombian congresses (1986–1990 and 1994–1998) and the four Venezuelan congresses (1979–1998) for which bill initiation data was available. Because of the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable, I used a logistic regression model (LOGIT) to test the effect that party, trust in the system, and bureaucratic and economic capacity have upon a deputy's support for decentralization. While observations across members are likely to be independent, observations of a deputy who serves multiple terms are probably not, since a strong proponent of decentralization is likely to introduce measures to advance it at every opportunity. To correct for possible correlations in the standard errors across observations of the same deputy, the standard errors were clustered by deputy.1 Because of my interest in comparing the process in two countries with different party systems and patterns of initiation, separate models were estimated for each country. The results are presented in Table 2.         "
"29","Both parts of the first hypothesis dealt with the impact of the party system (in terms of future electoral prospects at the national level and nomination procedures) upon the willingness of members of congress to support decentralization. The equations for both countries included variables for the largest nondominant national party (the Conservatives in Colombia and COPEI in Venezuela) as well as small parties, with the dominant party (the Liberals in Colombia and AD in Venezuela) as the excluded category."
"30","In Venezuela, at conventional levels of statistical significance, members of COPEI were 40% more likely than members of AD to introduce decentralizing legislation. These results provide support for Hypothesis 1a and Hypothesis 1b. COPEI has more decentralized nomination procedures than AD and is large, but not dominant, at the national level. Consequently, both parts of the hypothesis predict they would be more likely to support decentralization, which they are. The small party variable does not achieve statistical significance. This finding is problematic for the first part of the hypothesis as these parties should be more likely to benefit from subnational chances at power because they are unlikely to win the presidency and/or national congressional majorities."
"31","Two sets of results are presented for Colombia. The first model includes the capacity variables while the second model does not. Dropping the capacity variables, which are insignificant in the first model, makes it possible to include observations from the 1994–98 Senate. The results for the first hypothesis are mixed. In the first Colombia model, neither of the party variables achieves statistical significance at the .10 level. This result would seem to support the second part of the hypothesis, since the absence of differences in nomination procedures explains why there are no differences among the parties. However, in the second model, which includes the 1994–98 Senate, members of the Conservative Party were about 50% more likely to initiate decentralizing bills than were members of the president's Liberal Party. This finding supports O'Neill's Colombia results that large, but not nationally dominant parties advance decentralization because they believe it enhances their future electoral prospects. In sum then, the findings with regard to the party system are mixed, but there is some evidence that parties with long‐time horizons that believe their electoral prospects are better at the subnational level will promote decentralization. At the same time, there is also evidence that decentralized nomination procedures can explain variations in support for decentralization."
"32","The second and third hypotheses focused on characteristics of a deputy's district to explain variation in support for decentralization. To aid in the interpretation of the results in Table 2, I simulated probabilities for different values of the independent variables using Tomz, Wittenberg, and King's Clarify software.1 Simulated probabilities for Colombia (Table 3) and Venezuela (Table 4) illustrate the effect of party for deputies from identical districts, and the effect of district characteristics for deputies from the same party.         "
"33","The second hypothesis suggested that deputies from areas of the country that manifested greater distrust in the system—those areas with lower than average voter turnout—should be the most likely to initiate a decentralizing bill. There is strong evidence supporting this hypothesis in both Colombia and Venezuela, as the trust coefficient is negative and statistically significant. As expected, as voter turnout decreased, deputies were more likely to initiate a decentralizing bill. Differences in the probability of initiating a decentralizing bill change substantially for deputies from districts with below‐average turnout and deputies from districts with above‐average turnout. If one compares the first row in Table 3 with the last row, the differences are significant enough that there is no overlap between the 90% confidence intervals for members of the Liberal and Conservative Parties. Consistent with the expectations raised by both the first and second hypotheses, deputies from the Conservative Party who were elected from states with well‐below‐average turnout were by far the most likely to initiate a decentralizing bill, having a 37% probability of doing so. As expected, Liberals from districts with the highest turnout were the least likely to initiate a decentralizing bill.         "
"34","The top half of Table 4 illustrates the effect of changes in voter turnout among Venezuelan deputies from the same party. Deputies from COPEI were consistently the most likely to initiate a decentralizing bill. Nevertheless, while COPEI deputies from the parts of the country with the lowest turnout had a 10% chance of initiating a decentralizing bill, those from states with above‐average participation had only a 7% chance. Again in Venezuela, a deputy's perception of trust in their district seems to be a more important determinant of whether a deputy initiated a decentralizing bill than does party identification. Members of the dominant party (AD) from districts with the lowest voter turnout were more likely (7.6%) to initiate a decentralizing bill than were members of COPEI from high turnout districts (6.7%).         "
"35","The models presented in Table 2 provide mixed support for the third hypothesis—that deputies from districts with greater potential to benefit from decentralization—measured as urbanization and state contribution to total GDP—were more likely to sponsor decentralizing bills. Neither of these variables achieves statistical significance in the Colombia model. In the Venezuela model, only relative wealth achieves statistical significance although both coefficients are in the expected direction. This suggests that in Venezuela the relatively richer parts of the country wish to keep more of the wealth they produce for themselves.         "
"36","The bottom half of Table 4 illustrates the effect of wealth. While members of COPEI had the highest probability of initiating a decentralizing bill, a COPEI deputy elected from the wealthiest state had a 16% probability of initiating a decentralizing bill, but a COPEI deputy from the poorest state had only a 6% chance. The effect is similar for deputies from both AD and small parties as deputies from the poorest state had around a 5% chance of initiating a decentralizing bill, while those from the wealthiest state had a 12–14% chance. Again, there is almost no overlap in the confidence intervals for deputies from the richest and poorest states.         "
"37","Allowing popular referendums is not as demanding, technically or administratively, as is assessing and collecting the property tax or managing primary education. This suggests that the effect of capacity may be limited to certain types of bills, specifically those with a fiscal or administrative component. To explore this possibility, I disaggregated the decentralizing bills into two categories, those that had fiscal and administrative components, and those that did not.1"
"38","The model results remain consistent with those presented in Table 2, when the dependent variable is limited to bills that would increase fiscal and administrative decentralization. Neither urbanization nor state percentage of GDP achieved statistical significance at the .10 level in the Colombia models. Thus, even in what the most favorable test for this hypothesis, capacity does not seem to matter in Colombia. Capacity remains significant in Venezuela. Urbanization exerts a statistically significant and negative effect and GDP exerts a statistically significant and positive effect while COPEI, turnout, and seniority remain statistically significant and in the same direction as before.         "
"39","Why does capacity matter in Venezuela, but not in Colombia? Recall that Colombia and Venezuela shared a common democratic history and possessed similar variation on all important, national‐level variables—except federalism. Decentralization in Colombia has been homogenous, as responsibilities were devolved to all municipalities at the same time. In Venezuela, however, the states have assumed responsibilities through a piecemeal process, resulting in a more heterogeneous level of decentralization. These patterns are consistent with the existence of a federal system in Venezuela and a unitary system in Colombia. The design of decentralization in Venezuela and the importance of state's rights in a federal system likely make capacity important because states must decide they have the capacity to provide a service before requesting it. The blanket transfer of responsibility in Colombia may mean that those planning decentralization were not as concerned with the ability of subnational governments to provide the services."
"40","In summary, the findings for both Colombia and Venezuela provide mixed support for the hypotheses. By far the strongest effect is that of system trust as deputies from all parties elected in districts showing lower trust in government were more likely to propose decentralizing bills. There was some evidence that partisan identification affected a deputy's willingness to introduce a decentralizing bill, as members of COPEI (nondominant with somewhat decentralized nominations) and the Conservative Party (nondominant) were more likely to do so. Finally, only in Venezuela were deputies from wealthy districts more likely to introduce decentralizing legislation. The finding that partisan identification interacts with district characteristics contributes to our understanding of the political nature of the process of decentralization. It also reinforces the importance of all domestic factors, not just the party system, as sources of decentralization."
"41","Decentralization is relatively advanced in both Colombia and Venezuela. Despite differences in state structure and the party system, similar factors predict the strongest congressional supporters of decentralization. In both countries, the push to decentralize was led in part by the second largest party (big enough to be a serious block in congress and stable enough to focus on the long‐term, but not large enough to hope to rule unilaterally). The Conservatives in Colombia pushed decentralization because they assumed that while they were unlikely to win the presidency or a majority in the congress in the near future, they could count on winning a significant number of subnational offices. In Venezuela, COPEI deputies used the opportunities afforded them by their large size (although not majority status) to seek decentralization, hoping to capitalize on both future electoral prospects and to claim credit for advancing a popular policy. Anecdotal evidence from both cases suggested that small parties should have been more likely than all other parties to initiate decentralizing legislation. However, two factors may explain why small parties were not statistically different from the dominant party. First, the small‐party category is incredibly heterogeneous. The anecdotal evidence draws only on the behavior of a few small parties and may not be generalizable beyond those specific parties. This suggests the need to look at nontraditional parties and individuals in more detail, which is beyond the scope of this study. Second, the small number of seats held by these parties may lead them to pursue policy by amending bills rather than initiating their own."
"42","The most important finding is that the party system interacts with district context. Political parties seeking future electoral success are not the sole engines of decentralization. In both countries, deputies from districts showing the greatest signs of decreased trust were more likely to initiate decentralizing bills. This is consistent with evidence that lawmakers began the process of decentralization to address perceptions that government was out of touch with citizens. In Colombia, citizens became unhappy enough that they participated in a series of strikes and protests over poor public service provision. In Venezuela, popular demonstrations (and riots) targeted the austerity imposed by structural adjustment programs. Policy makers in both countries read these protests as a sign government needed to restore citizen's faith by being more responsive. The role of district‐level distrust in predicting who writes decentralizing legislation allows optimism that those seeking government accountability will determine the structure of the system. The Venezuela finding that deputies from wealthier districts were more likely to initiate decentralizing legislation than deputies from poorer districts allows added optimism that this is not just a political game designed to give the appearance of democratization, while setting the system up to fail."
"43","Colombia and Venezuela are among the oldest democracies in Latin America, but they are also among the democracies in greatest stress. Newspaper accounts clearly convey a rending of the social fabric filled with coup attempts, a rise in antisystem parties, and guerilla movements bombing cities and kidnapping presidential candidates. In the midst of this crisis, governments in both countries sought to find a way to relegitimatize the system and convince citizens that government was worthy of their trust. Governments have embraced decentralization in the hopes of resolving public service problems and restoring faith in government. The importance of internal crisis clearly demonstrates the domestic sources of this policy. Future work must determine if governments have succeeded in relegitimizing the system and increasing representation."
