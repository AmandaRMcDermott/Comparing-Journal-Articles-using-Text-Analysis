"1","Recognition of Mill's development may also add to an understanding of how his utilitarianism worked in practice. It demonstrates, on the one hand, the role that relatively autonomous secondary principles like the labor justification could play in Mill's thought, and on the other, the circumstances under which Mill would bypass such principles in favor of more explicitly utilitarian considerations. It shows that discarding a secondary principle could have a decisive effect on the character of Mill's political and social thought. To wit, near the end of his life, Mill abandoned the labor justification as a secondary principle and began to advocate a more direct and radical utilitarian analysis. But this notable change did not result from a sort of late conversion to utilitarianism."
"2","Scholars have long debated whether Mill was a proponent of act or rule utilitarianism (Brown 1997; Crisp 1997; Dryer 1963; Lyons 1997; Ten 1980, 4–5, 42–51; Urmson 1997). The question is whether Mill thought it was individual acts or general rules that had to be judged by the standard of utility. I find the evidence compelling that Mill was a rule utilitarian of some kind. He provided a number of distinct arguments for the approach (1969a, 110–11). Most significantly, Mill thought it sometimes correct to recognize a secondary principle as virtually inviolable—even though greater utility might be had in a particular instance by violating it—because the principle's general observance constituted “a rule of transcendent expediency” for “social well‐being” and “civilization” (1969c, 223). A right could be such a secondary principle, to be distinguished from “the mere idea of promoting human pleasure or convenience” (1969c, 259).         "
"3","Mill, then, was a rule utilitarian in the traditional sense that he advised against “pass[ing] over the intermediate generalizations entirely, and endeavor[ing] to test each individual action directly by the first principle,” utility (1969c, 224). He was also a rule utilitarian, I believe, in a further sense. For Mill contended that like many “first principles,” utility was not even needed to serve as the fixed point from which “detailed doctrines” were to be deduced (1969a, 110–11; Mill 1969c, 205). Rather than the foundation of a moral “edifice,” utilitarian analysis was like the “roots of a tree,” which served their purpose even if they had never been “dug down and exposed to light” (1969c, 205–06).1 Certain secondary principles could enjoy a considerable life of their own and even continue in force without explicit utilitarian scrutiny.         "
"4","Only under particular circumstances—one being the appearance or recognition of a contradiction between the “sides” of a secondary principle (1969c, 254)—did Mill feel the need to bypass such a principle and insist upon more direct and explicit utilitarian analysis. Below I show that the labor justification was such a secondary principle for Mill and narrate how he came to dispense with its use, giving far more weight to already‐developed principled arguments for the reform of property in the interest of the public good."
"5","A comparison with Mill's most widely‐recognized secondary principle—the liberty‐protecting harm principle—may help highlight in advance some important characteristics of Mill's labor justification and the potential for change in those of Mill's arguments that relied on it.2 First, the harm principle certainly was a secondary principle for Mill, one intended to enjoy considerable practical autonomy. It was “entitled,” he said, “to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control” (1977b, 223). But Mill also declined simply to assert the harm principle as an “abstract right,” instead showing that it was essential to utility (1977b, 223, 224). Indeed, because the harm principle was not at all widely accepted, he set out immediately on enunciating it to demonstrate that it promoted utility “in the largest sense,” meaning “the permanent interests of man as a progressive being” (1977b, 224). On Liberty (1859) makes it clear that liberty was not just an example of what promoted human well‐being; it was crucial to how Mill conceptualized well‐being itself. Given this, and given the close attention Mill paid to the utilitarian roots of the harm principle, it is reasonable to conclude that its position in his thought was rather secure, once he wrote On Liberty. By contrast, a rights principle of some sort linking legitimate property to personal exertion was already widely accepted in Mill's time and needed no special support from him. Thus Mill, as a matter of biographical fact, did not explicitly explore its utilitarian credentials for a considerable period of time, during which it nevertheless functioned autonomously in his thought. This only ceased at the point when he concluded that arguments using the labor justification foundered on a contradiction between its possible “sides.” Not secured by careful consideration in the way that the harm principle was, the labor justification remained for many years a potential source of change in Mill's thought.         "
"6","“Socialism,” according to Mill, referred broadly to a “system” in which “land and the instruments of production” were the “property … of communities or associations, or of the government,” an arrangement that made the “division of produce” into a “public act” (1965, 203, 202; Mill 1967a, 738). This definition points to two important preliminary features of Mill's writings on socialism. First, as a matter of classification, Mill generally dealt with socialism under the heading of “property,” making the subjects inseparable. (Though he wrote of “capitalists,” Mill did not use the term “capitalism,” referring instead to “private property.”) Second, among the arrangements alluded to in the definition, Mill tended to stress “communities and associations,” so that “socialism” for him signified the utopian schemes of his time, not the bureaucratic state systems of the twentieth century (Kurer 1992; Riley 1996, 44; Schwartz 1972, 188). More precisely, those who think Mill was a socialist generally consider him a proponent of cooperative socialism—a form of socialism based on worker management of firms (Ashcraft 1998, 183; Claeys 1987a, 127–29, 134–35; Kurer 1992, 224; Stafford 1998, 332–35).         "
"7","But beyond definitions, Mill's arguments about socialism were quite complex, a fact that has allowed different interpreters to focus on different issues. The skeptical scholars, who doubt Mill's claim that he became a socialist, characteristically have emphasized a variety of important Millian concerns and doubts, especially noting shifts in his expression of these between successive editions of The Principles of Political Economy (1848–1871), and the posthumously published Chapters on Socialism (1879).3 Ultimately, however, John M. Robson characterizes these concerns as strongly as they can be—as important modifications, but not negations, of a case for socialism (Robson 1968, 271).         "
"8","The most important concern connected to Mill's doubts about particular socialist schemes was liberty. Anschutz, like other skeptics, has argued that Mill's libertarian apprehensions militated against his “slightly socialistic” tendencies (Anschutz 1953, 32). But it is important to be precise about Mill, socialism, liberty, and freedom. Mill did not hold the view of many more recent defenders of capitalism that some combination of free trade and private property were synonymous with freedom (Baum 1999, 494; Mill 1977b, 293). He did express strong libertarian objections specifically to communist schemes like Owen's and centralist ones like those of St. Simon (1965, 209; 1967a, 745–46)—but not simply to all proposals for socialism. Moreover, Mill's discussion of freedom with respect to private property and socialism is by no means limited to an application of the harm principle. Liberty and the harm principle constitute “but one part of his larger account of the conditions of freedom,” as Baum writes (2000, 5). For Mill was concerned not just negatively to protect a sphere of individual life from compulsion, but also, positively, to create social conditions conducive to the actual enjoyment of freedom by all (Baum 2000, 3–5, 10–11, 23–36, 60–65). As I will emphasize below, he had deep concerns about the way in which existing economic relations undermined working‐class freedom (1965, 209). In all these ways, Mill's interest in liberty and freedom crucially shaped, but did not simply contradict, his critique of the existing economy and his case for socialism (Ashcraft 1998; Baum 1999; Claeys 1987a, 123–24; Stafford 1998, 342).         "
"9","Skeptics have also focused on alterations in Mill's discussion of socialism, work incentives, and the apportionment of labor (Hollander 1985, Ch. 10, III–IV; Robbins 1953, 148–54; Schwartz 1972, 157–81). Slight changes in expression aside, Mill argued consistently that any economic system, at least for the foreseeable future, had to rely on the incentive of individual gain from effort. He was thus sharply critical of “communist” schemes—which to him, signified those based on perfect equality, regardless of effort (1965, 203–14, 975–87). It should be noted, however, that this led Mill to comment favorably on Fourierist socialist schemes, which allowed such incentives to operate (1965, 212). Mill also had grave doubts about any plan that involved either doing away with the division of labor, or attempting to apportion labor centrally, as some communists planned (1965, 977, 982, 206–07). This position, however, underlay his praise for the Fourierists' vision of a voluntary, reward‐based scheme of apportionment (1965, 213).         "
"10","The skeptics are justified in pointing as well to Mill's sharp criticism of socialists' “exaggeration” concerning the flaws of the “present order of society”—especially their denigration of market competition (1967a, 727, 729–32). Schwartz takes Mill's discussion of these overstatements, in Socialism, to indicate a “decided cooling off of Mill's socialist sympathies” (Schwartz 1972, 181). But there is scant evidence that from the Political Economy (1965, 794–96) to Socialism Mill had changed his view of competition (Claeys 1987a, 143). And given the burgeoning contemporary literature on market socialism, it is not difficult to recognize today that Mill could favor cooperative socialism and markets (Kurer 1992, 225; Riley 1996, 68–71; Stafford 1998, 332–35).         "
"11","Mill sharply condemned revolutionary socialists (1967a, 749), a point emphasized by those denying Mill's socialism (Ottow 1993; Schwartz 1972, 187–88). But this does not constitute a rebuttal to the nonrevolutionary Utopian socialists with whom Mill was sympathetic (Kurer 1992, 228–29). Mill, it is pointed out, used a fallibilist, experimentalist language—stressing a view that “fair trial … alone can test the workableness of any new scheme of social life” (1967a, 748). Robbins's claim that Mill' socialism was just a “plea for an open mind” (1953, 167)—as well as cautions offered by other scholars (Baum 1999, 526) rest in part upon this recurrent language. But as even the skeptical Ottow notes, this disposition characterizes much of Mill's writing, not just that on socialism (Ottow 1993, 481). And Mill's expressed caution in this regard can be overemphasized, since it may have been partly a strategic concession to doubters (Stafford 1998, 327–28). Finally, skeptics point to Mill's frequently repeated view that continued educational and cultural improvement were necessary before society as a whole would be ready for socialism (Mill 1967a, 750). As he put it, a “change of character” was needed “both in the uncultivated herd who now compose the labouring masses, and in the immense majority of their employers” (1981, 239). This view, with others, certainly did dispose Mill toward a gradualist approach (Schumpeter 1994, 532). But given that Mill's entire social philosophy can be said to be aimed at “improvement” (Robson 1968), it would seem that, rather than indicating hostility to socialism, this belief actually closely links socialism to Mill's most central concerns.         "
"12","Strangely missing in the skeptical literature is a compelling account of why Mill was sympathetic to socialism in the first place. The skeptics note Mill's self‐designation as a socialist in his posthumous 1873 Autobiography (1981, 239). But Anschutz dubs this a “plainly an incredible statement” (1953, 31). And when it comes to explaining why Mill made it, the skeptics offer little. Robbins links Mill's socialist sympathies with the claim that he was “a man of intense and sometimes overpowering feelings” (Robbins 1953, 143, 153, 168; Schumpeter 1994, 532). Schwartz, like many others, faults Mill for an “inexcusable subservience to his wife's [Harriet Taylor's] opinions” (Schwartz 1972, 191, 165–74). But emotion and subservience do not in themselves dispose one to socialism.         "
"13","The great strength of the more recent literature buttressing Mill's socialist self‐designation is that it explores the reasons for the affiliation and finds them to be central to Mill's social and political theory. In this sense, it decisively broadens the evidentiary focus beyond Mill's alleged psychology and the shadings of doubt in successive writings. Instead of a mix of reservations, we deal with related principles in Mill's thought, chiefly justice (or equity), individuality, liberty, freedom, and democracy. For example, Stafford and Claeys point out that Mill believed unearned inequality and advantage were unjust and deployed this argument against the economy of his time (Claeys 1987a, 127; Stafford 1998, 328). Mill's discussion of “property” and socialism in general—especially his use of an “equitable principle”—is pervaded by this complex concern. I argue below that democracy is an appropriate summary category for some of the most significant arguments Mill made in favor of socialism. First, a number of scholars agree that the cooperative socialism Mill favored amounted to a kind of industrial democracy (Ashcraft 1998, 176; Baum 1999, 516; Claeys 1987a, 134). Relatedly, Baum contends that Mill made a case for “worker self‐management” and against the undemocratic existing economy based on a conception of “economic freedom” and its importance (Baum 1999, 496, 516, 523). He also notes that for Mill, individuality was a crucial condition for freedom—and that both were essential to human well being (Baum 1999, 498, 507). This insight, then, directs attention to scholarship stressing Mill's belief that the existing economy, especially the order of the workplace, undermined individuality, while properly ordered socialism could foster it (Ashcraft 1998, 180, 186; Claeys 1987a, 123, 145; Stafford 1998, 335–37).         "
"14","In light of this framework of evidence, it is clear, on the one hand, that any ultimate judgment as to whether Mill became a socialist involves a weighing of different aspects of his thought. But new syntheses of these same issues are unlikely to change minds. This article, while accepting the foregoing framework, adds something to it: recognition of a principled Millian argument defending the existing economic order—an argument, however, that Mill ultimately abandoned, late in life. Recognizing this labor justification of private property in means of production adds to our understanding of what Mill perceived to be the considerations arrayed against his own principled arguments for socialism. Recognizing that Mill ultimately abandoned this labor justification adds considerable weight to the idea that he became more of a socialist during his life.         "
"15","Mill made his earliest significant arguments on property in 1825, when he and his friends debated the Malthusian population principle and Robert Owen's scheme of cooperative communities with a group of Owenites. The “principle champion” for the Owenites, Mill later wrote, was William Thompson (1981, 129). Mill took the main thrust of his opponents' arguments to be that privately owned capital resulted from and perpetuated the unjust appropriation from workers of what they produced by their labor (Claeys 1987a, 125; Mill 1988a, 309). On at least one point, Mill did not differ with his opponents. Capital, he agreed, was “the produce of labour” (1988a, 310). The question, however, was what inferences to draw from this. Mill proceeded from this point to what I term a labor justification of private property in means of production. Private property in means of production, he argued, was the natural result of allowing “the man who produced most … to have most” (1988a, 313). First, it was evident that labor was not the only contributor to production; capital, too, was needed (1988a, 309). Next, it was evident that what was capital at any given time was simply a portion of previous production. And that previous production, too, had depended on capital. This former capital, Mill argued, “was produced by former labourers, aided by a capital of still older date, and so on” (1988a, 310). Capital, then, could ultimately be traced back to some stage of primitive production in which no capital had been used—“except the spontaneous produce of the earth” (1988a, 310). The conclusion of this argument, Mill claimed, was that “all capitalists were originally labourers, or descendants of labourers, and all capital is the saving from the produce of their industry” (1988a, 310–11). From this, Mill concluded that the capitalist was “entitled” to at least “some remuneration” (1988a, 309), which in itself controverted the Owenites' claim that payments to capitalists were an unjust expropriation. But Mill also alluded to the capitalist's “exclusive right” to his capital, and although he did not delineate the extent of this right, it appears that for Mill it implied the legitimacy of capitalists controlling production, hiring workers, and offering wage rates as low as subsistence‐level—and in general, the legitimacy of existing class relations (1988a, 313, 311).         "
"16","Another prong of Mill's defense of private property in means of production cut off criticism of the distributive consequences of the institution and redirected attention toward the Malthusian population principle. The crux of the argument was that wages were established simply by “the competition on the one hand, of capitalists to get labourers, and on the other hand, of labourers to get employment” (1988a, 312). Mill asserted that population grew faster than capital (demand for labor) and consequently that “every plan for ameliorating the condition of the people, which is not founded upon a regulation of their numbers, is futile and visionary,” (1988a, 312)."
"17","These speeches demonstrate that Mill was, in certain ways, deeply schooled in the conventions of political‐economic argument practiced by his father, Jeremy Bentham, David Ricardo, and Thomas Malthus, a fact Mill stressed in his Autobiography (1981, 105, 107). But despite the clear influence of Mill's mentors on these early speeches, it is notable that in justifying private property, he did not appeal directly to “happiness” or “utility.” Instead, he founded his arguments on what seems to have served as a relatively autonomous secondary principle: that private property in means of production involved nothing more than securing people the right to the produce of their labor.         "
"18","By contrast, Mill's father, when he discussed a similar principle—securing the fruits of labor to those who labored—explicitly and immediately grounded it in “the greatest possible happiness of society” (1992, 5). The younger Mill's treatment of property in these speeches was even more dissimilar to the utilitarian argument about property found in Bentham's Theory of Legislation—the reading of which, just a few years earlier, had marked for Mill “an epoch in my life; one of the turning points in my mental history” (1981, 67). Bentham's argument there centered on security as the “principal object of law,” one that was not entirely amenable to the claims of labor (1864, 109). Labor played only a subsidiary role in the various “titles” according to which existing property could be claimed. The first of these was actual possession, or right of first occupancy. And while Bentham mentioned labor later in the discussion as a title to property, he meant labor used for the improvement of a person's already‐existing property (1864, 162). Indeed, in Bentham's treatment, the urgent claims of those who labored could readily conflict with the pre‐eminent goal of security of existing property, however acquired. One cannot easily pass over the fact that the young Mill adopted the labor justification, but took no pains to show the principle's utilitarian credentials. This does not mean Mill was not utilitarian at this point in his life. But it shows he was satisfied with a labor justification of property and content to treat it as a secondary principle with independent standing.         "
"19","About a year after the Owenite debates, in the fall of 1826, Mill plunged into a state of intellectual confusion that he later termed his mental “crisis.” Over the next years, he reconstituted his view of morality and politics. One result was “a change in Mill's conception of political theory” stressing historical‐sociological analysis (Ashcraft 1989, 107; 1998, 171, 170–75, 176–77; Robson 1968, 21–114). “Any general theory or philosophy of politics supposes a previous theory of human progress,” he now believed; and “this is the same thing with a philosophy of history” (1981, 169). After the crisis, he was predisposed, at least, to reconsider his earlier arguments concerning property. For this new view of political theory led to at least three new habits of thought. First, Mill became convinced of the historical variability of political, social, and economic institutions. A major flaw in the “old political economy,” he now realized, was precisely its assumption that private property in means of production was an “indefeasible” fact of life (1981, 175). Second, Mill's new interest in sociology led him to see the debate over property as one in which conflicting class arguments and interests met and thus as an opportunity for him to apply the method of synthesis, which he adopted in his critiques of Bentham and Coleridge (1969a; 1969b; 1981, 225, 227). Finally, Mill would never again examine an issue such as property without reference to the existing historical tendencies at work—in this case, growing democratization, cooperation, and working‐class power. These trends both helped Mill choose topics of interest and set certain bounds on his practical objectives.         "
"20","Beginning in the 1830s, two lines of reasoning led Mill from democracy to a critique of private property. Mill thought the growing power of the working classes, which he took to be a facet of democratization, made the reexamination of institutions like property practically unavoidable and morally urgent. Working‐class men would sooner or later be enfranchised (1982, 481–89). And this had important consequences for property. In 1839, Mill argued that the working classes wanted to reform economic institutions, probably along socialist lines (1982, 485, 486). And he continued to link a broader suffrage to such reforms up until his last writings on socialism (1967a, 705–08)."
"21","Perhaps more importantly, cooperative socialism represented to Mill a means by which the working classes could share in individuality and enjoy freedom—and, relatedly, it represented an application of the best principles of democracy to industry (Ashcraft 1998; Baum 1999; Claeys 1987a, 134–35). There are two justifications for including the first two considerations—freedom and individuality—under the latter heading, democracy. First, Mill valued democracy precisely because institutions that gave an “actual part” in government to all citizens fostered individuality and the development of human capacities and thus contributed to the actual enjoyment of freedom (1977a, 390, 403–04), which he understood to be a positive condition not reducible to being left alone (Baum 2000, 23–25). Second, considerations of this very kind led Mill to favor a form of active, participatory economic organization, cooperative socialism (1965, 775–94), which both he and later scholars recognize as “democratic” (1965, 793).            "
"22","Underlying these arguments, first, was a democratic critique of the existing economy. Mill pointed out in the Political Economy that the rules of private property dictated that workers were paid “only their stipulated hire,” while the capitalist, who “supplied the funds,” received the rest of the produce of labor (1965, 215). Since wages were paid from capital previously accumulated according to these rules (1965, 55, 337), the capitalist would always determine the conditions of employment and retain power over workers. This “relation of hiring and service,” then, divided people into “two parties”—“the many who do the work being mere servants under the command of the one who supplies the funds” (1965, 766, 769). And under these conditions, “the generality of labourers in this and most other countries, have as little choice of occupation or freedom of locomotion, are practically as dependent on fixed rules and the will of others, as they could be on any system short of actual slavery” (1965, 209). This quotation suggests at least three interrelated conditions hostile to freedom: first, straightforwardly, subordination; second, a lack of mechanisms for self‐government; third, a lack of opportunities and choice. Mill's chapter “On the Probable Futurity of the Labouring Classes” began with a broad assault on the idea that the working classes should remain in such subordination to others' wills (1965, 759–62). Workers would not be “permanently contented with the condition of labouring for wages,” precisely because this made them “servants” (1965, 766). The spread of “ideas of equality” would end the division of the world into “employers and employed” (1965, 767).            "
"23","Mill fully embraced the direction of this social tendency as an “aim of improvement,” enabling people to enhance their abilities “to work with or for one another in relations not involving dependence” (1965, 768). This and related passages are important not for the certainty or imminence of Mill's predictions, but for the democratic, developmental, and freedom‐enhancing principles recognized in them. As Mill put it:"
"24","                              "
"25","The form of association … which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and workpeople without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removeable by themselves. (1965, 775)"
"26","Here Mill was referring, of course, to cooperation, or cooperative socialism, several experiments in which he discussed admiringly in the same chapter (1965, 775–94). A system based on such worker‐managed, cooperative industry, Mill said, could effect a"
"27","                              "
"28","change in society, which would combine the freedom and independence of the individual, with the moral, intellectual, and economical advantages of aggregate production; and which … would realize, at least in the industrial department, the best aspirations of the democratic spirit, by putting an end to the division of society into the industrious and the idle, and effacing all social distinctions but those fairly earned by personal services and exertions. (1965, 793)"
"29","Citing Mill's libertarian concerns, and others about the educational and cultural level of the working classes, some scholars might object that his writings on democracy betray ambivalence. This is true, in a sense, but as in all areas of Mill's thought, care is needed. First, the thread of elitism running through his writings on democracy, while real, does not undermine a main point here: that many of the most important of Mill's principled reasons for supporting democracy—especially the promotion of individuality and the enjoyment of freedom—were the same as his most important principled reasons for supporting socialism."
"30","Of course, Mill's educational concerns about the working classes surely did contribute to his view, mentioned above, that the transition to socialism could only proceed apace with cultural improvement. And, separately, Mill did believe that in mass societies in which liberty in the form of popular government had been achieved, the problem of protecting individual liberty from “prevailing opinion and feeling” became increasingly pressing (1977b, 220). But Mill clearly valued both liberty in the individual sphere and the more public freedom embodied in democratic practices and showed no inclination to sacrifice the latter to the former (Baum 2000, 61–62, 136). Moreover, Mill's concerns about working‐class culture and power can be exaggerated, especially if they are conflated with what was really a broader problem for him: class conflict in English society, its harmful effects, and proposals for dealing with it within a democratic framework (Ashcraft 1989; 1998, 176–80; Sarvasy 1984). Mill's sympathy for plural voting in Considerations on Representative Government (1861) is often taken as the definitive example of elitist fears limiting his enthusiasm for democracy. But the section of Representative Government on “infirmities and dangers” makes relatively quick business of “general ignorance and incapacity,” before dwelling much longer on “class legislation” and “sinister interest[s]” (Ashcraft 1989; Mill 1977a, 436, 446). And Mill actually proposed two possible solutions to these problems, plural voting (intended to give the balance of legislative power to better‐educated representatives) and proportional representation (intended to ensure that minority voices could not be drowned out). Packe and Sarvasy argue that Mill soon came to favor the latter solution, one less colored by elitism and more narrowly tailored to deal with the pathologies of class conflict (Packe 1954, 416–17; Sarvasy 1984, 583). In his Autobiography, Mill acknowledged “strong, possibly conclusive, objections” to plural voting (1981, 262). And in an 1867 parliamentary speech, he neglected plural voting while proposing a form of proportional representation, calling it, significantly, “the only true realization” of democratic principles (1977a, 449; 1988c, 183). Relatedly, Carlisle shows that during his term in Parliament (1865–68), Mill put aside the dominant discourse that focused on the presumed ignorance of the working classes and argued instead that they had much to teach the rest of conflict‐ridden English society (Carlisle 1999). This view, I will show, ultimately added to the radical flavor of Mill's last writings on socialism.            "
"31","Mill's broadly democratic critiques of private property did not settle the question for him. By the time he began his Political Economy in the 1840s, Mill perceived the debate concerning labor and property relations as one between social as well as philosophic positions. The working‐class critique of private property in means of production emphasized the fact that “the operatives in a manufactory create, by their labour and skill, the whole produce” and moved from this to the claim that any private ownership of capital was wrong (1965, 215). The middle‐class answer, Mill observed, emphasized that capital represented the “fruits of previous labour” (1965, 215) and moved from this to an argument against any interference with the rights of capital. Mill recognized that both sides premised their property arguments on the belief that “each person” should have “a right to the exclusive disposal of what he or she have produced by their own exertions” (1965, 215). Mill could agree with a version of this: an “equitable principle, of proportion between remuneration and exertion” (1965, 208). This “equitable principle,” however, could be deployed against both working‐class and capitalist arguments.         "
"32","The “equitable principle” did not, for Mill, directly imply the illegitimacy of capitalists sharing in the produce of labor. But it did direct his attention to the actual “proportion between remuneration and exertion” (1965, 208). Until late in life, Mill insisted that wages were fully determined by impersonal market forces (1965, 337). Yet one could still ask whether or not remuneration actually increased with the amount and difficulty of labor. In “the present state of society,” Mill wrote, the produce of labor is apportioned,"
"33","                        "
"34","almost in an inverse ratio to the labour—the largest portions to those who have never worked at all, the next largest to those whose work is almost nominal, and so on in a descending scale, the remuneration dwindling as the work grows harder and more disagreeable, until the most fatiguing and exhausting bodily labour cannot count with certainty on being able to earn even the necessities of life. (1965, 207)"
"35","This injustice was surely one of the “mass of physical and moral ills” that “directly grow out of the facts of competition and individual property” (1967d, 442). And the inequity was so offensive, Mill said, that if it was “necessarily” a feature of private property, “all the difficulties, great or small, of Communism, would be as dust in the balance” (1965, 207). Mill's “equitable principle” could also be used to critique certain aspects of the existing distribution of wealth, such as those due to inheritance practices. For the equitable principle of “proportion between remuneration and exertion” could never be used to justify securing one person “the fruits of the labour and abstinence of others, transmitted to them without any merit or exertion of their own” (1965, 208).4"
"36","Nevertheless, Mill clearly still believed, during much of the writing and revising of his Political Economy, that the equitable principle provided a defense of the existing structure of property and productive relations. The “justification of private property,” he wrote, rested on certain principles, especially “the guarantee to individuals of the fruits of their own labour and abstinence” or “the right of producers to what they themselves have produced” (1965, 207, 208, 215). The reason “on which the institution of property rests,” its “essential principle,” was “to assure to all persons what they have produced by their labour and accumulated by their abstinence” (1965, 226–27). Thus, until late in life, Mill repeated an argument he had first made in his youth: capitalists could claim justly that the “rights of capital” were “a portion of the rights of labour” (1967e, 653).         "
"37","Doubtless Mill continued to think utility was necessary for “moral metaphysics” or “the systematic unity and coherency of ethical philosophy,” as he put it elsewhere (1969a, 110, 111). And he alluded in the Political Economy to the idea that although private property had not arisen from “considerations of utility,” utility did “plead for the maintenance of it when established” (1965, 201). But such a passing reference cannot support a claim that the Political Economy presents an explicit utilitarian theory of property. Mill apparently thought there was little reason for the express assertion of utility in the present argument, which could more readily be conducted in terms of plausible and familiar secondary principles like the labor justification. Thus he began the subsequent chapter, dealing with “what is included in the idea of private property” with this: the “institution of property,” in its “essential elements” consisted “in the recognition, in each person, of a right to the exclusive disposal of what he or she have produced by their own exertions” or received “by gift or by fair agreement” (1965, 215). In the passage that followed, Mill related this principle to questions of labor or industry, right, desert, and justice, but did not explicitly mention utility (1965, 215–17). Such language, as a number of scholars have acknowledged, sounds far more Lockean than Benthamite (Gray 1979; Lindsay 2000, 674, n. 68; Wolfe 1975, 62). Mill added to the labor justification the idea that one had a title not only to what one produced, but also to what one “received either by gift or by fair agreement, without force or fraud, from those who produced it”—i.e., “the freedom of acquiring by contract” (1965, 215, 217). In addition, the capitalist's title could always be defended by “prescription”—the practice of acknowledging a sort of statute of limitations, after which property would be secure, however it was obtained. Prescription, Mill insisted, was simply one of the “essentials” of property.5"
"38","Mill's continuing acceptance of the labor justification was quite significant for his posture toward socialism. First, despite his democratic critiques of private property in means of production, his acceptance of the labor justification surely reduced for Mill the moral urgency of establishing socialism. Had Mill believed, with some socialists, that a capitalist's profit per se represented an unjust expropriation, he would likely have felt the need to press for speedy reform. But, on the contrary, Mill's labor justification cast private property in means of production as an institution that embodied a principle of justice. If Mill later were to doubt the labor justification, this intrinsic justness would no longer be as certain. Second, acceptance of the labor justification may have seemed to Mill to place limits on the nature and pace of reforms that could create the conditions for cooperative socialism. As we have seen, Mill noted that defenders of private property in means of production staked their claim on the idea that a person should have “exclusive disposal” of what he or she produced by labor. Mill too endorsed the principle that “in all things the product of labour … the owner's power both of use and of exclusion should be absolute, except where positive evil to others would result from it” (1965, 231–32).6 Such absolute control of capital could plausibly entail full control of the allocation of profits, the rules of the workplace, and the terms and conditions of employment. Such exclusivity was surely an inhospitable standpoint from which to contemplate potential reforms. In “Thornton on Labour and its Claims,” Mill would articulate the apparent nature of the limit on reform imposed by the labor justification in the starkest possible terms—even while providing the intellectual means to transcend it.         "
"39","The nature of the limit implied by Mill's acceptance of the labor justification may also become clearer if we turn to the arguments that Mill made at this time concerning private property in land, a case where he thought the labor justification did not apply. These land‐reform writings exemplify a telling feature of the structure of Mill's thought. When Mill was not constrained by the claim that the current owners of private property in means of production had a right to it secured through labor or abstinence, the ground of his argument shifted, and he argued vigorously that property arrangements had to redound to the public benefit or utility. And in such cases, he entertained far more radical proposals for reform.         "
"40","Mill, as usual, had his eye on existing tendencies in English society as he mounted arguments concerning landed property. At the moderate end of the spectrum of nineteenth‐century land reformers were those like Feargus O'Connor, whose hopes for challenging the unequal distribution of land ownership entailed no challenge to the principle of property in land itself (MacAskill 1960, 304–41). But drawing on a natural law tradition that survived well through the eighteenth century (Claeys 1987b, 9–33), agrarian radicals such as Thomas Spence had argued that land should be regarded as a social resource, belonging to the people in common (Chase 1988, 3, 19, 23–24). Spence's more‐radical tradition was kept alive in the nineteenth century by the Chartist propagandist James Bronterre O'Brien. O'Brien favored the nationalization of land through purchases by eminent domain, the land then to be colonized by the unemployed (Plummer 1971, 179–84).         "
"41","In the Political Economy, Mill argued that property in land was usually distinguishable in two ways from other kinds of private property. First, echoing aspects of the natural law tradition just mentioned, he contended that the land itself, unlike many forms of property, was never a product of labor. “When the 'sacredness of property' is talked of, it should always be remembered, that any such sacredness does not belong in the same degree to landed property,” Mill argued, continuing: “No man made the land” (1965, 230). Thus the “essential principle of property”—“to assure to all persons what they have produced by their labour and accumulated by their abstinence”—simply “cannot apply” to land itself (1965, 227). Second, the portion of the value of land due to labor was seldom due to the labor of the land's owner (1965, 228, 229). Since property in the value of land improvements could be justified only “in so far as the proprietor of the land is its improver,” labor justifications were often unavailable to many English and Irish landowners (1965, 228).         "
"42","The radicalness of Mill's writings on land have been recognized by scholars (Claeys 1987a, 140–42; Hollander 1985, 834–37; Kurer 1991, 119–34; Robson 1968, 252–55; Stafford 1998, 336, 340). But absent a recognition of how strongly Mill emphasized the labor justification elsewhere, his approach to land, and his emphasis on the idea that “no man” made it, may seem puzzling. Kurer complains: “One would have preferred Mill to have reasoned straightforwardly on the basis of social welfare, without having recourse to this dubious ‘man made' argument” (Kurer 1991, 120). But Mill did stress the “man made” argument, a fact that attests to the weight he continued to put on the labor justification.         "
"43","In any case, Mill contended in the Political Economy that in the absence of a labor justification, the only argument that could be made in favor of recognizing current owners was based not on right, but on utility. As Mill put it: “When private property in land is not expedient, it is unjust” (1965, 230). As a matter of principle, then, Mill had no objection to the state nationalizing all land, as O'Brien had suggested. Landowners could be compensated, either to pay for any value they themselves had added to the land through labor, or simply to acknowledge their expectation of obtaining some value for their land (1965, 230–31; 1988b, 419). Nationalization could “rightfully be done, if it were expedient to do it,” Mill contended; but “at present I decidedly do not think it expedient” (1988b, 419). Thus Mill's practical proposals were more moderate than outright nationalization. Claeys argues, in fact, that Mill wanted to “draw support away from those socialists who sought the immediate nationalization of the land” (Claeys 1987a, 141). For Ireland, Mill proposed a plan to convert cottiers into peasant proprietors by allowing them to demand a permanent tenure on their land at a fixed‐rent charge (1988d, 254–55, 257). This would guarantee tenants the benefit of any value they added to the land by their labor. Those landowners who did not want to let the land on such terms, would, in effect, be forced to accept a buyout by the state in the form of an annuity (1988d, 257–58). His proposals for England were different. As its chairman, Mill promoted the program of the Land Tenure Reform Association (LTRA) (1967b). This included a heavy tax that would transfer any unearned increase in the market value of land to the state. Any landlord who objected to the tax would again have the option of selling the land at market price. Mill and the LTRA also proposed periodic state purchases of common and waste lands, some to be used to foster agricultural cooperatives. Clearly, when Mill did not think that a labor justification applied to a particular class of property, he insisted that property be restructured for the common good.         "
"44","Mill's 1869 essay, “Thornton on Labour and its Claims,” is recognized as an important turning point because in it he abandoned the “wages fund” doctrine, which held that wage‐rates were strictly limited by the existence of a fixed pool of money available to purchase labor. After this, Mill acknowledged the usefulness of trade unions. But “Thornton,” I argue, also marked Mill's effective discarding of the labor justification, a change that would reverberate through his writings on capitalism and socialism for the few remaining years of his life."
"45","Mill's insight in the essay was that social power made the labor market different from others. Stimulated by his friend and India House colleague, William Thornton, Mill argued that in labor markets, there was no unique market‐clearing price. Furthermore, on the one hand, laborers had such a poor bargaining position that they were obliged by need to sell all their labor at whatever wage they could obtain (1967e, 640, 642–43). On the other hand, employers' labor needs were fixed in terms of hours of work needed, but not in terms of the total wage bill. Since employers could employ the same number of laborers at a range of different wage rates, they had an incentive to hold out for low wages. Within limits, then, the question of what wage rate prevailed was determined by the relative power of labor and capital. Under the current circumstances, however, capital was always able to bargain labor down. “The labourer in an isolated condition,” Mill wrote, is “unable to hold out even against a single employer, much more against the tacit combination of employers” (1967e, 657). This conclusion, of course, added force to Mill's longstanding critique of the remuneration of labor based on his “equitable principle.” It was now clear to Mill that wages were set by the outcome of a “conflict of wills”; thus the setting of wages, like other things subject to “human voluntary action,” had to fall “under the jurisdiction of the moral law” (1967e, 647). And Mill had long argued that pay for labor in the system of private property was unjust—if anything, inversely related to work.         "
"46","But “Thornton” is even more remarkable for three significant new arguments Mill marshaled against the labor justification itself—one empirical and two conceptual. Mill's language indicates that he still recognized, in principle, the potentially legitimating significance of labor. “In his chapter on the Rights of Capital,” Thornton, according to Mill, very truly and forcibly argues, that these [private property rights] are a portion of the rights of labour. They are the rights of past labour, since labour is the source of all capital; and are sacred, in the same sense, and in an equal degree, with those of present labour (1967e, 653).         "
"47","But Mill now sharply challenged the empirical application of this principle. In theory, the rights of capital were the rights of labor, assuming that capital had been “honestly come by” and legally bestowed. “But how stands the fact?” Mill asked (1967e, 653). His answer: the theory was liable to “great abatements” (1967e, 653). Putting aside outright fraud, Mill pointed out that many large sums of capital were built up not by personal labor but by “practices which in a better state of society would have been impossible” including exploitation of “the manifold advantages which imperfect social institutions gave to those who are already rich, over their poorer fellow citizens, in the struggle of life” (1967e, 653). Given the focus of the essay, the most obvious of these “manifold advantages” was surely the vulnerable bargaining position of labor (1967e, 643, 657)."
"48","This led Mill to a related conceptual point in his arguments on property. In the Political Economy, Mill had argued that even when the labor justification did not apply, property could be defended by prescription. But with doubts about the empirical origin of capital striking Mill more forcibly, he now stated the case against prescription more strongly and limited it more narrowly. He now conceded that the idea “that a bad title may become a good one by lapse of time,” did “considerable violence” to “the instinctive sentiment of justice”: “[I]t is not at all conformable to intuitive morality that a wrong should cease to be a wrong because of what is really an aggravation, its durable character” (1967e, 654). Previously, Mill had argued that title by prescription ought to be granted “within a moderate number of years” (1965, 217). Now he found prescription defensible only in the case of “wrongs of so remote a date that the evidence necessary for the ascertainment of title is no longer accessible, or that the reversal of the wrong would cause greater insecurity and greater social disturbance than its condonation” (1967e, 654). Mill was also more explicit in “Thornton” that the only grounds favoring prescription were those of “general utility” (1967e, 654).         "
"49","If that was all that Mill had done in this essay, it would be noteworthy. But in “Thornton,” Mill also advanced an argument fatally undermining the relevance of the “doctrine that the rights of capital are those of past labour.” Mill's first step was to describe in starker terms than ever before the supposed limit that this doctrine placed on possible reforms. Mill had long noted that the labor justification entailed a claim to the exclusive control of capital. Thornton claimed, on this basis, that one had to accept, as a feature of private property rights, “the equal legitimacy of any contract for employment, which past labour [capital] may impose on the necessities of present labour,” up to and including wages inadequate to live on (1967e, 653)."
"50","The philosophical problem with such an argument, Mill now asserted, was that it was presented a priori, as if it could be accepted intuitively, without reference to consequences (1967e, 650). But one could always present another intuitively sound a priori claim, whose consequences conflicted with the first, and thus create a stalemate. In sociological terms, Mill argued, the corollary problem with Thornton's claim was that the working classes had an equally valid labor‐based counterclaim. Workers (present labor) could equally well seek to impose any conditions they wished upon capitalists (past labor), up to and including wages so high that virtually no share would be left for profits; this, of course, would essentially amount to a de facto restructuring of property rights (1967e, 647, 657). As for a de jure restructuring, Mill wrote that labor “would in no way infringe the definition of justice by taking the matter into their own hands, and establishing by law any modification of the rights of property which in their opinion would increase the remuneration of labour” (1967e, 654). Indeed, in the wake of the Second Reform, workers constituted the “numerical majority” and actually could“effect the most fundamental changes in society by simply withholding their concurrence” from the current rules of property (1967e, 655). What could society do, in cases such as this one, in which otherwise plausible a priori justice claims contradicted each other?         "
"51","First, one had to admit that “no practical conclusions of any kind can be drawn from such premises”—premises Mill himself had emphasized for decades (1967e, 655). Mill thus turned explicitly to the standard of utility in broadest sense. A few years earlier, Mill had written in Utilitarianism (1861) that justice claims, legitimate claims of rights, had to be regarded as uniquely important rules or secondary principles to be enforced by society—ones ultimately premised on utility, but not on an act‐by‐act basis. And he had directly addressed situations such as this, in which a priori justice claims conflicted: “Justice has in this case two sides to it, which it is impossible to bring into harmony, and the two disputants have chosen opposite sides … Social utility alone can decide the preference” (1969c, 254; see Dryer 1963, cviii‐cx).         "
"52","This is the same line of argument Mill now adopted here in “Thornton.” One could only resolve this stalemate between a priori justice claims, each linking labor to a different institution of property, by examining a particular rule, reform, or proposal explicitly and directly in terms of utility. The only potential argument one could make against the use of working‐class power for any property reform, Mill argued, was that the proposed reform “would be injurious, instead of beneficial, to the public weal” (1967e, 655). Indeed, Mill's arguments concerning capital now paralleled those about land. Once Mill had given up a sweeping labor justification for private property in means of production, the only premises left upon which prescription could be defended, or any particular reform fended off, were “utilitarian ones,” considerations of the common good or of “common interest” (1967e, 655, 656). As in the case of private property in land, Mill argued that there were utilitarian reasons not to simply abolish private property in means of production (1967e, 654).         "
"53","Nevertheless, Mill had now abandoned an argument that had been, up to this point, a very prominent feature of his discussions of property: the labor justification. One important effect of this was to eliminate a crucial counterweight to his already‐existing critiques of private property. In addition, the proper standard for proposals to reform property was now “the interest, immediate and ultimate, of the human race” (1967e, 655)—what he called utility in the “largest sense,” rooted in the permanent interests of humans as “progressive” beings. According to such a standard, Mill's existing criticisms of private property based on principles of democracy, freedom, and the development of individuality surely became more important than ever. For none of Mill's principled commitments could be said to be more proximate than these to his understanding of the “permanent interests” of human beings."
"54","Mill did not as a consequence of this reconsideration, embrace immediate, drastic reforms. First of all, the scope of “Thornton” was limited to the relatively short term. The essay is remembered most for Mill's endorsement of unions. In “Thornton,” Mill argued on utilitarian grounds for protecting the “free disposal of property” (1967e, 654) and against laws that would “deny legal protection to properties exceeding a certain amount,” or shift the tax burden entirely to the rich, or force the rich to employ the poor at liberal wages in numbers proportional to their wealth, or summarily abolish of inheritance and bequest (1967e, 655). But he was careful to mark all these propositions as applying to a less‐than‐ideal present. Unions, he argued, would be clearly inferior to their longer‐run alternatives: “co‐operative industry” or even “Industrial Partnerships” (1967e, 666). And while it was true that, at present, “capital is as indispensable to labour as labour to capital,” Mill added: “Labourers need only capital, not capitalists; it would be better for them if they had capital of their own” (1967e, 656)."
"55","Intriguingly, a year after “Thornton,” the labor justification of private property in means of production was conspicuously missing from Mill's discussion of the distinction between landed and moveable property. In “Leslie on the Land Question,” published in 1870, Mill wrote that the distinction was “fundamental,” but rested upon the facts that “land is a monopoly” and that it was “the source from which mankind derive, and must continue to derive, their subsistence”—not on the labor presumptively embodied in moveables (1967c, 672)."
"56","In the same year that Mill published “Thornton,” he began what was intended to be a book‐length work, the Chapters on Socialism, left unfinished when he died in 1873. All the important elements of Mill's critique of private property up to this point—including the abandonment of the labor justification and the utilitarian turn noted in “Thornton”—reappeared or were actually reinforced in Mill's last statement on the matter.         "
"57","Mill's claim that the reconsideration of property relations was being forced upon English society by the empirical tendency toward democracy and working‐class power appeared more forceful than ever in Socialism. English society had so far avoided a full examination of private property, Mill contended. But with the trend toward working‐class suffrage, “it will not be possible to go on longer in this manner,” he believed; “when the discussion includes classes who have next to no property of their own … they will not allow anything to be taken for granted—certainly not the principle of private property” (1967a, 708). Likewise, Mill's argument that private property in means of production was a barrier to the extension of equality, the development of individuality, and the growth of freedom again loomed large in Socialism. Political democracy would not now be enough for the working classes, Mill argued:         "
"58","                        "
"59","No longer enslaved or made dependent by force of law, the great majority are so [enslaved] by force of poverty; they are still chained to a place, to an occupation, and to conformity with the will of an employer … That this is an evil equal to almost any of those against which mankind have hitherto struggled, the poor are not wrong in believing. (1967a, 710)"
"60","Third, Mill repeated his longstanding critique of private property in means of production on the grounds that it resulted in a distribution of wealth and income that was out of proportion with labor. “The reward” of labor, Mill argued,"
"61","                        "
"62","instead of being proportioned to the labour and abstinence of the individual, is almost in an inverse ratio to it; those who receive the least, labor and abstain the most … The very idea of distributive justice, or of any proportionality between success and merit, or between success and exertion, is in the present state of society so manifestly chimerical as to be relegated to the regions of romance. (1967a, 714)"
"63","But perhaps most interestingly, Mill's argument, in “Thornton,” that the labor justification of private property in means of production had no “practical” implications appears to have remained conclusive. Unlike earlier treatments of property, the one in Socialism did not prominently feature a discussion of the labor justification. Rather, in Socialism, Mill held out the common good, or general utility, as the only standards for judging property institutions, just as he had in “Thornton.” Repeatedly, Mill argued that the reforms of property must ultimately be judged according to utility or the common good. Several aspects of this new almost‐exclusive emphasis on utilitarian standards are worthy of note. First, it was quite unlike Bentham's deployment of a utilitarian standard with respect to property—indeed it had almost antithetical implications. Bentham had tied utility to security of existing property and settled expectations, arguing that existing property had to be protected, regardless of fastidious concerns about its origin. By contrast, in Socialism, Mill clearly favored giving a hearing to even the most radical challenges to property and recognized explicitly that it was precisely those who benefited from existing property arrangements who had the most to lose by the application of the utility standard. “Until the present age,” Mill observed, the institution property had not been questioned because those who had a say also “had a stake in the existing constitution of property” (1967a, 708). To such people, arguments in favor of the status quo had “the double prestige of immemorial custom and of personal interest” (1967a, 710). But “it will not be possible to go on longer in this manner,” Mill believed (1967a, 708). “[T]he discussion that is now required is one that must go down to the very first principles of existing society,” he contended (1967a, 708). The question was “the institution [of property] so far as it is a public benefit,” or the “utility” of property (1967a, 708). What mattered was whether proposed changes would be “beneficial to the public” or “conducive to the general improvement,” not merely whether they conflicted with the existing “idea of property” (1967a, 753). “[S]ociety,” he wrote sternly, “is fully entitled to abrogate or alter any particular right of property which on sufficient consideration it judges to stand in the way of the public good” (1967a, 753).         "
"64","Adding to the force of this pronouncement was a new attitude toward the working classes, resulting in part from Mill's term in Parliament, as Carlisle has observed (Carlisle 1999, 164–66). Bracketing doubts about their culture and education, Mill now suggested simply that working‐class attitudes would provide a rough and ready test of utility. The working classes were right to think, he wrote, that         "
"65","                        "
"66","the whole field of social institutions should be re‐examined, and every question considered as if it now arose for the first time; with the idea constantly in view that the persons to be convinced are not those who owe their ease and importance to the present system, but persons who have no other interest in the matter than abstract justice and the general good of the community. (1967a, 711)"
"67","In contrast to this multifaceted emphasis on utility, Mill did not rest any significant part of Socialism on the labor justification of private property in means of production. Tellingly, he only referred to equitable principles or to the rights or obligations of existing owners of property in connection with his anticipation that property relations would be reformed. For example, on the one hand, Mill argued that it was “an obligation of justice” to “give impartial consideration to all proposals for rendering those laws [of property] in any way less onerous to the majority” (1967a, 750). On the other, he contended, property owners had an “equitable claim … to be compensated by the state for such legal rights of a proprietary nature as they may be dispossessed of for the public advantage” (1967a, 753).         "
"68","In the development of Mill's critique of private property, culminating with his withdrawal of the labor justification, one thing that stands out is the flexibility of his thought with respect to the fundamental principles that might have confined him. This flexibility is instructive, both about Mill and the liberal traditions usually associated with him. First, consider the labor justification itself. This venerable principle, which might have made for an absolutist defense of private property, clearly did not dissuade Mill from developing a countervailing democratic critique of the institution. And when the justification itself seemed to lead only into contradiction, Mill found resources in his thought to transcend it rather elegantly. Second, there is utility. Given the amount of attention that has been paid to this feature of Mill's philosophy, it is valuable to be reminded how adaptable it could be when Mill himself employed it. The adaptability is due not only to the role of secondary principles (a prominent focus of this article) but also to the rich substantive content of utility as Mill understood it—that is, the promotion of the “permanent interests of man as a progressive being.” Political theorists are perhaps professionally inclined to insist that each other's weaknesses are deeply rooted in contaminated first principles. But Mill demonstrates again the importance of the practical manner in which one actually unfolds one's thought. And this reminder applies as well to the brooding figure lurking in any treatment of Mill—liberalism. Again in Mill there is evidence for the rich variety of ways in which aspects of this family of loosely related philosophies—this uncertainly‐constructed set of values, assumptions, practical commitments, and methods—may be deployed."
