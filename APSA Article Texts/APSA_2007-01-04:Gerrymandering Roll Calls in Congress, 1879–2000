"1","In a typical U.S. congressional election, a set of voters is presented with a choice between two candidates, one Republican and one Democrat. In a typical congressional roll call vote, a set of legislators is presented with a choice between two alternatives, the state that would obtain were the motion accepted and the state that would obtain were the motion rejected. In both the electoral and legislative example, each chooser has just one vote to cast and the alternative receiving more votes wins (we exclude from analysis votes on veto overrides and other motions in the U.S. House that require a two‐thirds approval to pass).1"
"2","The consequence of winning in an election is that one party gets a seat in the House and the other fails to get this seat. The consequence of winning in a legislative vote is more complex. If the two parties take the same position (either for or against) on a motion, then both win.2 If the two parties take opposite positions, then, as in the election, one wins and one loses. In what follows, we focus on the cases of party disagreement.         "
"3","Students of elections have a long‐standing interest in how votes map into seats. Within a single district, the answer is transparent (in the case of plurality elections dominated by two parties): a party's seat share is zero, if it secures less than 50% of the two‐party vote; and one, if it secures more than 50% (we ignore ties). Aggregating across all the districts in a legislature, the votes‐to‐seats mapping becomes more complex and is usually described in terms of two key parameters: responsiveness and bias."
"4","Responsiveness refers to how much a party's aggregate seat share responds to changes in its aggregate vote share. To be concrete, let s denote the share of all seats that a party wins in a given state legislature (elected in single‐member districts by plurality rule); let v denote the average vote share garnered by the party's candidates in the various districts within the state. If all the districts in a state are “safe” for one party or the other, then the statewide vote share may change (moderately) yet produce no change in the statewide seat share. This would be an example of low responsiveness. In contrast, if all the districts in a state are closely contested by the two parties, then a small statewide vote swing may produce a very large change in the parties' seat shares—an example of large responsiveness.            "
"5","Bias refers to an advantage for one party in the efficiency with which its votes translate into seats. For example, if a state legislature has been gerrymandered by the Republicans, there may be a few extremely safe Democratic districts and a large number of just‐winnable Republican districts. In this state, the Democrats “pay” a lot in votes for each seat they win, while the Republicans “pay” substantially less per seat won. Put another way, the Republicans have arranged the districts so that they win by a little and lose by a lot, thereby increasing the number of seats they can eke out of a given expected statewide vote."
"6","The standard equation used to represent (and to estimate) the levels of responsiveness and bias, given average vote (v) and seat (s) shares, is the seats‐votes curve:               "
"7","Examples of seats‐votes curves can be found in Figure 1. To see the effect of responsiveness, ρ, it is simplest to assume no bias (λ= 0). In this case, ρ= 1 corresponds to “proportional representation”: a party can expect to get a statewide seat share equal to its statewide average vote share. Values of ρ larger than one imply larger seat bonuses for the party winning more votes on average; that is, the vote‐richer party's seat share exceeds its average vote share.4 Positive values of ρ smaller than one imply larger and larger seat bonuses for the party winning fewer votes statewide; that is, the vote‐poorer party's seat share exceeds its vote share. Finally, if ρ= 0, then seat shares are completely unrelated to vote shares.            "
"8","                 Examples of Seats‐Votes Curves with Varying Values of ρ and λ= 0                         "
"9","Now consider bias, reflected in the parameter λ. Note that there is bias in favor of a given party (λ > 0) if and only if its expected seat share, conditional on garnering exactly half the vote on average, exceeds one‐half. That is, bias can be identified with the difference E[s|v = .5]– .5. Negative values indicate that the party is getting less than half the seats for half the votes, while positive values indicate that the party is getting more than half the seats for half the votes. Departures in either direction indicate bias, in favor of one party or the other."
"10","Yet another equivalent way to characterize bias is as follows. There is bias in favor of a given party (λ > 0) if and only if, conditional on v = .5, that party's average margin of victory is less than its average margin of defeat. In other words, there is bias if the favored party tends to win by a little and lose by a lot, conditional on its average vote share equaling one‐half.5"
"11","Both responsiveness and bias can be defined in the legislative setting as well. To see how, first consider how to define the variables, seats (s) and votes (v), in the seats‐votes equation above.            "
"12","In the electoral context, the variable v is the average, across all the districts of a given state, of the vote share garnered by the Democratic candidate. In the legislative context, v is the average, across all “party” votes occurring in a given Congress, of the vote share garnered by the “Democratic position.” A “party” vote is one that pits majorities of the two parties against one another (one favoring the motion, one opposing) and the “Democratic position” is whichever side of the question a majority of Democrats favor.            "
"13","In the electoral context, the variable s is the share of times that Democratic candidates in a given state win. In the legislative context, s is the share of times that Democratic positions in a given Congress win (where the denominator is restricted to “party” votes).6"
"14","Having defined the variables in the legislative arena, one is in a position to estimate the votes‐to‐seats equation by one of the several techniques on offer in the electoral studies literature. We consider the best estimation option later, simply noting now that it is possible to estimate both responsiveness (ρ) and bias (λ) for legislative binary vote data."
"15","To provide some intuition about responsiveness in the legislative setting, consider some examples. First suppose that both parties are perfectly disciplined voting blocs. In this case, it makes no difference whether the majority party holds 218 seats against the minority's 217, or 318 seats against the minority's 117: the majority always wins, because all its members always vote on the same side of any issue. The (v,s) data that perfectly disciplined parties produce (over a period in which a single party always has a majority) might thus look like (.51,1), (.55,1), … , (.95,1). One interpretation of such data is that legislative responsiveness is nil and pro‐majority bias is infinite (ρ= 0, λ=∞): changes in the majority's average vote share (v) do not affect its victory rate (s), but the majority always wins (s = 1). Now suppose that the defection rate of majority party members is positive, rather than zero. With a positive defection rate, the party's victory rate would be sensitive to variations in its average vote share. That is, responsiveness increases at lower levels of party discipline. Note that something very similar is true in the redistricting case: responsiveness increases as voters' partisan attachments become weaker (cf. McDonald 1999).            "
"16","To provide some intuition about bias in the legislative setting, consider the following example. The majority party in a particular Congress has 218 members. On 51 roll calls, the majority suffers no net loss of support (the number of majority defectors equals the number of minority defectors) and gets 218 votes to the minority's 217. On 48 roll calls, the majority suffers a net loss of one, and loses to the minority 217 to 218. Finally, on one roll call, the majority suffers a net loss of two and loses 216 to 219. As the reader can verify, the majority's average vote share across these 100 roll calls is .5. Yet, the majority wins 51 of the 100 votes."
"17","This example illustrates two points. First, even a little departure from symmetry can produce bias as conventionally defined. Second, merely because a majority party has a majority of seats does not guarantee that it will, on average, win a majority of votes in roll calls. If the majority is less cohesive than the minority, or it gets unlucky in the particular questions that are put to a vote, it can in principle end up with an average vote share less than .5 or, as in the example, equal to .5. Indeed, the majority party's average vote share falls below .5 in three out of the 61 Congresses in our dataset (or 5%)."
"18","Having laid out the analogy between votes‐to‐seats translations in the electoral arena and votes‐to‐victories translations in the legislative arena, we note that the mechanics of biasing these translations differ in the two arenas. Bias is engineered in the electoral arena by drawing district lines that will last for a number of elections (although some states during some periods in the nineteenth century drew new district lines for every election). In contrast, bias is engineered in the legislative arena by making decisions about which bills will be considered on the floor, which amendments will be allowed, how votes are influenced on the margin, and so forth.7 We turn to a more detailed consideration of these matters next.            "
"19","Many scholars argue that the party in control of redistricting in a state will engineer bias in its own favor. Cox and Katz (2002), for example, view responsiveness and bias as properties of state districting laws. Each such law affects the number of marginal and safe districts and their distribution between the two parties. Districting plans that create more safe districts across the board will exhibit lower responsiveness. Districting plans that give one party a markedly higher safe‐seat‐to‐marginal‐seat ratio than the other will exhibit bias.         "
"20","The usual method by which partisan effects in redistricting are detected is to allow bias (λ) to be a function of which party controls the redistricting. States in which the Republicans control both houses of the state assembly and the governorship, and hence control the redistricting process, are expected to exhibit pro‐Republican bias, with just the opposite expectation for states in which the Democrats are in control. Empirically, Cox and Katz (2002) and Engstrom (2003) find considerable support for this line of reasoning over most of U.S. electoral history.8"
"21","We highlight two arguments in the literature that, although not framed explicitly in terms of bias, nonetheless lead one to predict bias in favor of the party that sets the agenda in the U.S. House—i.e., the majority party. Each is similar to the argument that the party controlling the redistricting process will benefit from electoral bias in its favor, in that it specifies a mechanism by which the majority party may tend to win by a little but lose by a lot."
"22"," King and Zeckhauser (2003) argue that legislative leaders will typically not buy votes but instead will buy vote options.9 For example, the Speaker will line up members who are willing to sell their votes to the majority party, if necessary to produce victory. When the Speaker can eke out a victory by exercising his options, he schedules the vote, calls in the vote options, and produces a close victory for his party. When the Speaker is too far short of votes, then there is no point in exercising any of his options and the majority party thus loses by a lot. Thus, as King and Zeckhauser note, “if leaders use vote options on closely contested votes, then…they will have many small wins and few small losses…” (2003, 397).         "
"23","If both the majority and minority parties' leaders were equally able to line up vote options, then there would be no reason to expect bias. However, it is the majority party leadership, not the minority leadership, that is typically credited in the literature with the ability to win close votes. Bauer, Pool, and Dexter, for example, put it this way: “The [majority] leadership usually has enough of a reservoir of political credit to have a few votes switched if it would otherwise lose by a narrow margin” (1963, 432). King and Zeckhauser (2003, 402–403) provide evidence that the majority party regularly eked out close victories on CQ Key Votes over the period 1975–2001. To the extent that such patterns generalize, the majority party will significantly more often be able to secure narrow victories and avoid narrow defeats. Hence, because winning by a little and losing by a lot leads mathematically to bias, one should expect a pro‐majority bias in congressional votes.         "
"24","Another argument concerning why the majority party might tend to win by a little but lose by a lot on “party” votes, hence enjoy a statistical bias in its favor, has to do with its control of the agenda. Nonpartisan theories of the U.S. Congress (e.g., Krehbiel 1998; Mayhew 1974) view the majority party as having no significant advantage over the minority in its ability to set the agenda. In contrast, Cox and McCubbins (2002) argue that the majority party has the power to block the consideration of bills on the House floor, while the minority sometimes does not (depending mostly on the membership of the Rules Committee in a particular Congress).10 This differential power to block, when it arises, may produce pro‐majority party bias.         "
"25","To see how, consider a simple spatial model. We will assume that the legislators possess single peaked preferences on n left‐right issue dimensions. On each of these issue dimensions is a predefined status quo point, which we will denote q1, … , qn. These are the policies that will remain in force if no new bill is passed on the given dimension. Assuming that members have additively separable preferences across the dimensions, we can consider each in isolation. Denote the median majority‐party member on the jth issue by Mj, the median House member by Hj, and the median minority‐party member by mj. Given a Democratic Congress, one can assume that Mj < Hj < mj. Now suppose that qj lies between Mj and Hj. The majority‐party leaders can foresee that bringing a bill to the floor to change qj can only lead to a rightward policy change (to Hj) that will displease a majority of Democrats. Thus, if they can prevent the consideration of this particular issue dimension, they will. A similar point holds for the minority and issue dimensions on which qj lies between Hj and mj: the minority will, if it can, block consideration of such issues.11"
"26","Now consider a Congress in which only the majority has a reliable power to block. The majority party will allow bills targeting status quo points that are slightly to the right of the legislative median and the final passage votes on such bills will produce narrow wins for the majority. At the same time, the majority will block bills targeting status quo points that are slightly to the left of the legislative median and the final passage votes on such bills would have produced narrow losses for the majority. In other words, majority‐party agenda power prevents narrow losses on final passage votes for the majority party but not for the minority party—thus depriving the minority (but not the majority) of “efficient” wins and contributing to pro‐majority bias.         "
"27","It is not just by censoring what would have turned out to be close minority wins that majority agenda power produces bias, however. There is also a systematic pattern across amendments and final passage votes. To provide a detailed example, consider two status quo points near Hj but on opposite sides: qL= Hj– e and qR= Hj+ e, for some small e > 0. The majority party will allow a bill targeting the right‐of‐center status quo, qR, to be considered on the floor. Suppose that some of the majority's left‐wing members propose a bill bj < Mj near their ideal points. The majority leaders allow the bill onto the floor (thereby allowing their left‐wing members to stake out a clear position and claim credit) but give it an open rule (so that the ultimate bill will be more moderate). When the bill is brought up on the floor, the median legislator moves to amend it. Thus, the first vote pits the original bill, bj, against an amended version of the bill, b′j= Hj. Let the cutpoint, (bj+ Hj)/2, be slightly greater than Mj.12 In this case, a majority of the majority party will vote against the amendment, yet the amendment will carry by a large margin. The amended bill, b′j, will then be pitted against the status quo, qR. In this vote, the majority position will carry by a small margin (small because e is small). Thus, in this example, a single issue produces two votes, one of which the majority loses by a lot, one of which it wins by a little. Note that this pattern will not be balanced by the House's consideration of the left‐of‐center status quo, qL, because the majority will block any bill targeting that status quo.         "
"28","This example is certainly stylized, but similar examples can be generated with less stringent assumptions. Moreover, the example illustrates the gist of a not‐uncommon empirical pattern. As Cox and McCubbins (2005) report, during the long period of Democratic dominance in the House, the so‐called conservative coalition was active almost entirely at the amendment stage. As they note, the typical pattern produced was one or more amendments carried by the conservative coalition (often by large margins), followed by a narrow passage of the amended bill with mostly majority support and mostly minority opposition.         "
"29","Now consider a Congress—perhaps in the period 1937–60, during which the Rules Committee has been characterized as controlled by a conservative coalition—in which both the majority and minority party have some power to block.13 In this Congress, status quo points in both the region [Mj, Hj] and the region [Hj, mj] will be blocked (and possibly others as well, depending on the ability of various actors to commit to closed rules). This will prevent narrow defeats for both the majority and the minority party, so that no systematic effect on bias is predicted. Moreover, the minority may also be able to prevent the majority from putting far‐left bills on the agenda to begin with, thus preventing the large majority losses that occur when such bills are amended.         "
"30","Bias in favor of a given party arises when that party wins by a little and loses by a lot, relative to the other party. Thus, bias is a joint product of the ability to block—avoiding narrow defeats of one's party; and the ability to push—forcing through legislation in the teeth of the minority's strenuous opposition (and hence producing narrow victories).14 We thus expect pro‐majority bias to arise in those Congresses in which the majority possessed both the ability to block what would have become narrow defeats and the ability to push through to sometimes narrow victories. In other words, pro‐majority bias should arise when there is both an agenda cartel (per Cox and McCubbins 2005) and conditional party government is more visible (Aldrich and Rohde 2000). The Congresses that best fit this description are the czar‐rule Congresses at the turn of the twentieth century and the post‐packing Congresses (1961–present). In the empirical work below, we will test whether these periods stand out in terms of detectable bias.         "
"31","We have noted above two equivalent ways to characterize bias in favor of a given party: (1) the party wins more than half the time when its average vote share is one‐half; and (2) λ > 0 in the party's estimated votes‐to‐victories curve. In this section, we examine whether the first of these patterns arises in the U.S. House."
"32","Our method is suggested by the heading of this section: we take four successively more stringent definitions of what a “close” roll call is and compute the proportion of such votes that the majority party wins. Close roll calls have v ≈ .5 and hence the proportion of times that the majority wins on such votes provides one way to approximate E[s|v = .5]. Comparing this proportion to .5 then reveals the bias in favor of (or against) the majority."
"33","Our results are displayed in Table 1. Regardless of whether one focuses on roll calls with margins less than 1.0%, less than 0.5%, less than 0.25% or less than 0.125%, the majority party wins about the same percentage of the time—viz., 66%. As shown in the last column of Table 1, the difference between the majority's share of victories (.66) and what would be expected given no bias (.5) is statistically significant in all cases.            "
"34","One might complain that even the last row of Table 1 does not impose the relevant theoretical condition—that v = .5. Thus, some readers may wonder whether it remains possible that congressional votes simply exhibit high responsiveness, rather than pro‐majority bias.            "
"35","One way to address such concerns is to impose the constraint λ= 0 and ask what ρ must be in order to give the majority a victory rate of .662 when it has an average vote share of .50125. The answer (computed from equation (1)) is ρ≈ 1334.15 Is it possible that λ= 0 and ρ≈ 1334? Were these the true parameter values, then one could use them to compute the majority's expected victory rate, given an average vote share of .51: it should be .995. As can be seen, however, the first row of Table 1 does not come close to .995 or even show any growth from the value given for the fourth row. Thus, the data displayed in Table 1 cannot be explained purely in terms of a high responsiveness; pro‐majority bias is also at work, as we shall show in greater detail in the next section.16"
"36","Our data consist of all recorded votes from the U.S. House of Representatives in the 46th–106th Congresses (1879–2000). The starting point for our dataset (1879) was chosen because including Congresses before the 46th enters a much different congressional world, in which the southern representatives are largely or wholly absent. The end point for our dataset (2000) reflects the available data when our investigation began. Given that we include over 120 years of congressional data, we are confident that extending the end point would not change our basic findings.17"
"37","We exclude votes that require a two‐thirds majority for passage (such as suspension of the rules). We also exclude the vote on election of the Speaker and all votes on which the two parties were in agreement (i.e., majorities of both parties voted in the same manner). For the remaining votes—votes on motions requiring a simple majority for passage and on which the two parties were opposed—we calculate the percentage of the total vote cast for the “Democratic” position and whether the Democratic position prevailed. Averaging across each Congress, we then compute the average vote share garnered by the “Democratic” position, DV; the number of all motions that the Democrats won; and the total number of motions voted on (meeting our criteria).18"
"38","We use these data to estimate the parameters, ρ and λ, defined in Equation 1. This is done by solving for s in terms of v, yielding               "
"39","This is the standard grouped logit model with a single independent variable, ln (v/ (1‐v)), the natural logarithm of the ratio of the average vote share. We actually will allow the bias to differ between Democrat‐ and Republican‐controlled Congresses. In order to account for possible unmodeled heterogeneity, we use the extended beta‐binomial model that generalizes the grouped logit model (cf. Palmquist 1999). Complete details of the estimation can be found in the appendix. From our analysis, we can compute the bias in favor of the majority party (which we shall take as positively signed, with negative values indicating pro‐minority bias).19"
"40","We have analyzed bias in the entire time period from 1879 to 2000 and in four subperiods: (1) the pre‐Reed Congresses (1879–90); (2) the czar‐rule Congresses (1889–1910); (3) the post‐Cannon Congresses (1911–61); and (4) the post‐packing Congresses (1961–2000). The four subperiods were chosen to correspond to major organizational watersheds identified in the previous literature. In particular, we use the following landmarks to define our periods: the adoption of Reed's Rules in 1890; the revolt against Speaker Cannon in 1910; and the packing of the Rules Committee in 1961."
"41","The landmarks we have chosen as demarcating our periods stand out in the previous literature as the logical choices. This is obvious enough for the first two, Reed's Rules and the revolt against Cannon (see, e.g., Galloway and Wise 1976), but let us say a few words about the last. Before the Rules Committee was packed with additional liberal members after the 1960 election, standard sources view it as independent of the majority party (and, indeed, dominated by a conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans). Afterwards, the majority's control was improved, but standard accounts stress that Rules continued to be largely independent of the majority party until further reforms in 1975 (see Oppenheimer 1977; Peabody 1963; Rohde 1991, 25). Nonetheless, Cox and Poole (2002) find that party pressures on procedural (and especially special rule adoption) votes increased after 1961, while Cox and McCubbins (2005) find that, relative to other procedural motions, the majority party became abruptly more likely to win on special rule adoption votes after 1961, and the minority party abruptly more likely to lose. We have thus chosen to pool the 1961–73 period with the post‐reform period, rather than with the previous period. If one chooses a different cutpoint for the data, the results are similar to those we report below.20"
"42","Our numerical results can be found in Table 2. A graph of the “victories‐votes” curve—i.e., the seats‐votes curve with the legislative data—estimated for the full time period, 1879–2000, is displayed in Figure 2. We have included the actual data points used to estimate the curves. As can be seen, the estimated responsiveness nearly follows the classic cube law since the curves are nearly perfectly S‐shaped, with a value of 3.45; while estimated bias in favor of the majority party is 6.5, statistically significant at the .01 level. A bias of this size means that, were the majority party to average 50% of the vote in a series of roll calls, it would expect to win 56.5% of them. Somehow, the majority is getting more bang for its buck: more legislative victories for its legislative votes.         "
"43","                 Victories‐Votes Curve for Congressional Roll Calls from 1879 to 2000                      "
"44"," Note: There are separate curves for Democratic and Republican Congresses. The data points used to estimate the curves are denoted by the points marked “D” and “R.”                     "
"45","Breaking the analysis into the four subperiods noted above, we find some stark differences. Responsiveness is relatively high in the first, third, and fourth periods—2.59, 3.76, and 3.97, respectively. However, in the second period, it falls to virtually nil (.01). Bias, meanwhile, is positive (pro‐majority party) in all periods but small and insignificant prior to Reed's Rules (.006);21 very large in the czar‐rule Congresses (.355);22 moderate in the post‐Cannon Congresses (.029); and very near the overall level of bias (noted in Table 1) in the post‐packing Congresses (.065). By and large, these results fit with conventional accounts of these Congresses. More importantly, they jibe with what one would expect from Cox and McCubbins' cartel model: bias is insignificant when the minority's procedural hand is good (pre‐Reed and post‐Cannon); but it is significant when the minority's procedural hand is poor (in the czar‐rule and post‐packing Congresses).         "
"46","To check the robustness of our findings, we conducted the following analysis. We first split each Congress into subperiods and calculated the average vote (vtj) and victory (stj) shares for the Democrats in each subperiod (j) of each Congress (t). We then used the subperiod data from Congress t ± 3 (that is, the data {(vτj, sτj): t − 3 ≤ τ ≤ t + 3}) to estimate a sort of running average of the bias and responsiveness across time. We display the estimated bias for the time period centered on t, denoted λt, below.         "
"47","Before looking at our results, it is worth stressing that our proposed method will not work if the Congresses t − 3, … , t + 3 are all very similar. For, in this case, the data {(vτj, sτj): t−3 ≤ τ ≤ t + 3} will simply be a tight cluster of points centered at one point in the seats‐votes space. Put another way, there will be no variance in the independent variable, v, hence no real chance to estimate the relevant slope and intercept terms. Our method can only work if there is substantial variation in the average vote shares, which typically requires a change in party control of the House. Recalling the history of the House, this means that our method will likely not work for the 87th to the 100th Congresses, as each of these Congresses were deep enough within a period of uninterrupted Democratic control that there is no change of party within the window of Congresses examined. (These were the only Congresses so affected, except for two czar‐rule and two New Deal Congresses.)         "
"48","With that caveat in mind, the reader can examine Figure 3, which displays the estimated “running average” bias, λt, for t = 46, … , 106. The results are largely consistent with those in Table 2. In the pre‐Reed era, the running average bias is statistically insignificant in four out of five Congresses, corresponding to Table 2's finding of insignificant bias. In the czar‐rule era, the running average bias is statistically significant in nine out of ten Congresses, corresponding to Table 2's finding of significant bias. In the post‐revolt era, the running average bias is statistically significant in only four out of 25 Congresses, corresponding to Table 2's finding of positive but insignificant bias. Finally, in the post‐packing era, there is initially a long run of Congresses (87th to 100th) for which the method is unlikely to, and does not, detect any bias. This is presumably because the Congresses in this period all have similar Democratic vote shares, so that it is not possible to separately estimate bias and responsiveness. As soon as we reach the first Congress for which a change of party control is within the window of Congresses examined—the 101st—bias is significant. Moreover, it remains significant for the duration of the post‐packing period, registering values comparable to those found in the czar‐rule era. Thus, all told, the results in Figure 3 corroborate those in Table 2.         "
"49","                 Running Averages of Estimated Bias in Congressional Roll Calls 1879 to 2000                      "
"50"," Note: These points represent the level of bias toward the majority party averaged over seven congresses centered on a given one. The lines represent the 95% confidence interval for the estimate. The “D” and “R” at the bottom of the graph denote the majority control, Democratic or Republican, in the Congress.                     "
"51","We also note that some of the finer‐grained findings in Figure 3 jibe with conventional accounts of partisanship in the House. In particular, note that the three Democratic Houses in the immediate aftermath of the revolt against Cannon all exhibit significant pro‐majority bias, as do the first three New Deal Democratic Houses (weakly). The nadir of pro‐majority bias arrives in the four Congresses immediately preceding the packing of the Rules Committee.         "
"52","As another check on the robustness of our results, we added an additional control variable, tapping changes in the location of the House median. The rationale for this variable (which simply subtracts the t − 1 House median from the t House median) is that the status quo policies should be near the lagged House median. Suppose that the House moves rightward between t − 1 and t. This will mean that the House at time t will face a fair number of left‐of‐median status quo policies. Dealing with them should produce rightist victories and may increase pro‐right bias. Thus, for example, when the Republicans took over the House in 1994, one might attribute the observed pro‐Republican bias to the fact that there were many leftist status quo policies to change, rather than to the majority party's ability to manipulate the agenda or buy votes on the margin to secure victory."
"53","Including a variable equal to the change in the House median from t − 1 to t does not change any of the results reported above. Thus, one can more confidently attribute pro‐majority bias to something the majority does, rather than to a consistent pattern of change in the House median that favors the majority party."
"54","Parties, whether electoral or legislative, seek to win enough votes to attain “victory.”Electoral victories produce control over legislative seats (and other offices). Legislative victories can be as small as fending off a dilatory motion or as large as passing a major piece of legislation. In both arenas, attracting more support in one vote expends resources that could otherwise be used to attract more support in another vote. Thus, in both arenas, parties wish to use their votes efficiently, winning victories at the cheapest possible price in manufactured votes. One can use standard statistical analyses, such as those employed in this article, to detect any partisan bias—which will arise if one party is systematically more efficient in its translation of votes into victories.         "
"55","In this article, we have estimated the bias in congressional votes over the period 1879–2000. What we find is consistent with the cartel theory of how majority parties in the U.S. House operate (Cox and McCubbins 1993, 2002, 2005). When the majority party is both able to block bills it does not like (virtually always) and to push bills it does like against the minority's opposition (in the czar‐rule and post‐packing Congresses), then it is able to both avoid narrow defeats and generate narrow victories. This means bias in its favor in the translation of votes into victories.         "
"56","The primary weakness of our method for detecting majority‐party agenda‐setting advantages is its reliance on highly aggregated data, as is also the case in electoral studies using this method. Other techniques for detecting majority‐party advantages rely on a more disaggregated analysis of roll call voting data than we provide here. For example, Sinclair (2002) focuses on how members' votes change between the adoption of a special rule for consideration of a particular bill, and the final passage of that bill. Lawrence, Maltzmann, and Smith (2003) and Cox and McCubbins (2002, 2005) similarly rely on features of roll‐call voting that can be analyzed within a given Congress. In contrast to these more disaggregated approaches, our method focuses more clearly on changes in the main independent variable: majority status. (The other studies necessarily hold this constant when applied to a single Congress, although pooling across Congresses does allow majority status to vary and hence the effects of such variation to be explored.)         "
"57","Our technique is general and could in principle be applied to any legislature. However, we note that it will yield indeterminate results in some cases of very strong party government. In the United Kingdom, for example, the majority party will typically win a very high percentage of all votes, regardless of its share of the seats; and it will hold most of its members on every vote. The consequence of this is a pattern of data that can be “fit” by a statistical model in either of two ways: zero responsiveness and high pro‐majority bias; or high responsiveness and zero bias."
