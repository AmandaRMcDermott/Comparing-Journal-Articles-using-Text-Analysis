"1","In deciding whether to vote in an election, and which party to support, informal political discussions with family, friends, and acquaintances play an important role. These discussions reinforce social norms, provide us with political information, allow us to understand the views and reasoning of others, and enable us to express—and maybe even persuade others of—our own views (Conover, Searing, and Crewe 2002; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1987, 1991; Mutz 2002b, 2006; Sinclair 2012; Zuckerman, Dasović, and Fitzgerald 2007). Ultimately, they are said to result in increased political engagement and electoral mobilization (Cutts and Fieldhouse 2009; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995; Klofstad 2007, 2011, 2015; Lake and Huckfeldt 1998; McClurg 2003; Rolfe 2012; Sinclair 2012; Zuckerman 2005; Zuckerman, Dasović, and Fitzgerald 2007).         "
"2","Consequently, political scientists have long discussed the potential of campaigns to mobilize voters indirectly by encouraging political discussion within personal networks, such as that of the family, in the run‐up to an election (McClurg 2003; Rolfe 2012). Glaser, for instance, argued that “the most influential canvassers are the rest of the people in the voter's family” and that “if party workers or civic organizations want the greatest return on the use of their scarce services, they should make contact with the most politicized member of a household […] and motivate that member to bring all the other members to the polls” (1959, 570).         "
"3","But, while studies show a strong relationship between political discussion within personal networks and political participation (Bond et al. 2012; Klofstad 2011, 2015; McClurg 2003; Rolfe 2012), there is an unresolved debate about the extent to which indirect mobilization is dependent on the degree of political agreement within the network (Bélanger and Eagles 2007; Fitzgerald and Curtis 2012; Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2002, 2004; Klofstad 2011; Klofstad, Sokhey, and McClurg 2013; McClurg 2003, 2006; Mutz 2002a, 2006; Nir 2011; Pattie and Johnston 2009). In an influential series of observational studies, Mutz (2002a, 2002b, 2006), while acknowledging the benefits of mixed political company for political tolerance, has expressed concerns about the correlation between network heterogeneity and electoral abstention. Her findings suggest that there might be a flip side to increasing tolerance, a demobilizing, “dark side of mixed political company” (Mutz 2006, 89). On the other hand, studies such as those conducted by Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague (2002, 2004), Nir (2005), and McClurg (2006) dispute the demobilizing impact of disagreement within a network.         "
"4","The literature on network heterogeneity and political participation has faced difficulty in making strong causal inferences (Fowler et al. 2011; Klofstad 2007, 2011; Mutz 2006). Findings from studies relying on randomized campaign experiments, which allow for stronger causal inferences, support the notion of indirect mobilization through small, personal networks by showing that conversations with campaign volunteers mobilize not only the contacted individual, but also his or her household members—a phenomenon that is called “spillover” (Nickerson 2008; Sinclair 2012; Sinclair, McConnell, and Green 2012). Yet spillover experiments have not addressed the potential consequences of political (dis)agreement for intrahousehold mobilization. In addition, these experiments have exclusively relied on nonpartisan mobilization messages, notwithstanding the partisan nature of most campaigns. All the while, the partisan intensity of mobilization messages likely impacts mobilization among members of a household differently depending on whether they are politically like‐minded or non‐like‐minded.         "
"5","In this article, we integrate the literature on political homogeneity and heterogeneity in social networks and the experimental literature on indirect campaign mobilization. We focus on what is arguably the most important context of interpersonal influence for voters: the household (Cutts and Fieldhouse 2009; Fieldhouse and Cutts 2012; Nickerson 2008; Sinclair, McConnell, and Green 2012; Stoker and Jennings 1995; Zuckerman, Dasović, and Fitzgerald 2007). While there is a high congruence between household members' party and policy preferences (Stoker and Jennings 2005), still no more than an estimated 40–60% of two‐voter households can be described as politically homogeneous in partisan terms (Bélanger and Eagles 2007; Johnston et al. 2005; Zuckerman, Fitzgerald, and Dasović 2005). We ask to what extent intrahousehold mobilization during an election campaign is conditioned by both the degree of heterogeneity of party preferences within the household and the partisan intensity of a campaign message. We focus on two‐voter households, the majority of which are likely to consist of family members, and in particular, couples. Following Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague (2004), we conceptualize disagreement as partisan disagreement (for a discussion, see Klofstad, Sokhey, and McClurg 2013). Instead of relying on only one network member's report of the extent of partisan disagreement in his or her network, though, we use the self‐reported party preference of each household member, thus reducing the systematic biases in respondents' perceptions (Klofstad, Sokhey, and McClurg 2013; Osborn and Mendez 2011).         "
"6","Our research design combines data from a previously conducted randomized campaign experiment in the United Kingdom (UK), which includes information on the party preferences of household members, with validated turnout data from the official voter register on both assigned subjects and those household members excluded from the original experiment. We conduct an implicit mediation analysis (Gerber and Green 2012) by utilizing campaign messages of different partisan intensity that manipulate the potential for partisan disagreement within heterogeneous and homogeneous households, and we then assess their impact on turnout. Our results show that intrahousehold mobilization effects are larger as a result of campaign contact in households that consist of individuals who hold competing party preferences, and larger still when the partisan intensity of the message is increased. Thus, we find no evidence in support of a demobilizing impact of disagreement. In contrast, partisan disagreement within the confined space of the household might be beneficial for encouraging political debate and ultimately participation.         "
"7","Early voting studies established the importance of political discussion within personal networks for voting behavior (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Campbell et al. 1960; Downs 1957; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1948). Ever since these early studies, there has been a debate about the importance of the nature of the network (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1948). Currently, an important aspect of this debate concerns the question of whether discussion is more likely in networks that consist of politically like‐minded or non‐like‐minded individuals, and how this so‐called network homogeneity and heterogeneity (Mutz 2006) ultimately impact on political participation.         "
"8","It is important to note that much of this current debate does not explicitly address households (for notable exceptions, see Bélanger and Eagles 2007; Bello and Rolfe 2014). Yet family or household members are regularly named as the most important or frequent discussion partners (Mutz 2006, 126; Sinclair 2012, 27). Couples have been shown to influence each other, to become more similar in their party preferences (Stoker and Jennings 2005; Verba, Schlozman, and Burns 2005; Zuckerman, Dasović, and Fitzgerald 2007), and to exhibit similar levels of turnout (Glaser 1959; Straits 1990; Verba, Schlozman, and Burns 2005).         "
"9","Mutz (2002a, 2006) shows that individuals in heterogeneous networks are less likely to participate in politics, and she argues that this is due to the experienced cross‐pressures resulting from the diverging political views within the network. Specifically, Mutz (2006) suggests that there might be two, interconnected psychological processes at work. First, membership in a politically heterogeneous network may lead to internal ambivalence regarding one's own political position. This ambivalence, in turn, might lead to negative participation decisions. Second, and most importantly, because individuals try to maintain social harmony within their personal networks by pleasing all members, they avoid discussion of divisive political issues, which in turn discourages participation. An additional potential mechanism, discussed by Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague (2004, 7), builds on Downs's (1957) argument that individuals seek out discussion partners within their personal networks who are well informed and have similar political viewpoints as a means to obtain low‐cost information. Consequently, this mechanism also suggests that political disagreement within personal discussion networks is avoided, albeit inadvertently.         "
"10","When it comes to households, it is certainly plausible that these processes work similarly. Maintaining social harmony might be particularly important with those with whom we live under one roof, and unlikely to be jeopardized over political issues that are of limited interest to the majority of individuals (Mutz 2006, 106). In addition, we might avoid political discussion with household members if we do not perceive them as politically agreeable, and therefore useful, sources of information. Among the few observational studies that have looked explicitly at households, there is some empirical support for the notion that individuals in homogeneous—all‐Democratic or all‐Republican—households are indeed more likely to vote than those in households in which members differ in their party registration (Bélanger and Eagles 2007).         "
"11","On the other hand, exactly because the household tends to constitute our most intimate personal network, it can arguably endure a substantial amount of disagreement when it comes to issues that do not directly affect personal relationships between family members (Morey, Eveland, and Hutchens 2012). In fact, political discussions might be difficult to avoid with people with whom one interacts so frequently, often occurring as by‐products of sharing the same household, and certainly not as easy to shun as unwelcome TV channels or online news sites. As with sports, we might enjoy discussing and watching a game with household members even if we support different teams.         "
"12","The expectation that individuals who live in politically heterogeneous households are able to disagree without being disagreeable is also based on the observation that individuals in heterogeneous networks are more tolerant of other political viewpoints than individuals in homogeneous discussion networks (Mutz 2002b, 2006). Indeed, Mutz's (2002b) finding that political discussion and political tolerance are higher in heterogeneous networks appears to stand in contrast to a theory that would expect household members to disengage from politics in order to avoid conflict and confrontation. Bello and Rolfe (2014) show that Mutz's (2002b) finding also generalizes to the UK, and specifically to the household. Moreover, Klofstad (2011) shows that social intimacy (trust) strengthens the relationship between discussion and civic participation.         "
"13","Not only might political discussion be as frequent in heterogeneous as in homogeneous households, but there are also reasons to suspect it might be more frequent. Bello and Rolfe (2014) show that not only are “spouses and family members […] more likely to be retained as political discussants than other friends, even close friends,” but “respondents are more likely to continue discussing politics with spouses who hold different political views when compared to spouses who hold the same view” (Bello and Rolfe 2014, 141). This might be because, given the already high level of homophily in terms of socioeconomic characteristics and the living environment, discussing with a household member who thinks differently about politics provides a more effective means of gaining additional information about an upcoming election than talking to a copartisan. Alternatively, within the context of an election campaign, political disagreement might create a situation of friendly competition between household members that leads to higher levels of political engagement, and ultimately electoral participation. Politically interested individuals—often partisans—are more likely to discuss politics, even though this increases the probability of political disagreement, because they simply enjoy political discussion (Huckfeldt and Mendez 2008). Competition between household members might therefore either increase electoral participation indirectly through fostering political discussion or directly increase turnout if household members decide to “counter‐mobilize,” voting for the opposing candidate in order to “cancel out” the vote of their household member (Straits 1990, 64–65; Wolff 2002, 33).         "
"14","One of the major challenges of research on the impact of network diversity on political participation is separating self‐selection into politically like‐minded personal discussion networks, and contextual influences, from social influence within networks (Fowler et al. 2011; Klofstad 2007, 2011; Manski 1993). Self‐selection can occur when characteristics of individuals impact both the level of heterogeneity in their discussion network and their level of political participation (Bélanger and Eagles 2007, 850; Mutz 2006, 115). For instance, individuals who are more politically interested or have stronger partisan preferences might be more likely to participate as well as to surround themselves with like‐minded discussion partners (Mutz 2006, 115). Contextual influences occur when the external environment has a similar, exogenous impact on all members of a network—for example, a political campaign could change network members' political views and participation rates in the same direction, without individuals influencing each other (Fowler et al. 2011, 450; Manski 1993).         "
"15","A few studies have exploited the benefits of panel data (Bello and Rolfe 2014) or statistical techniques such as propensity score matching (Klofstad, Sokhey, and McClurg 2013) for causal inference. While certainly an improvement on earlier correlational work, such studies do not fully resolve the issue of separating self‐selection and contextual influences from social influence, as they do not overcome the issue of unobserved individual‐level or contextual‐level confounders (Arceneaux, Gerber, and Green 2006; Wooldridge 2010). For example, when it comes to campaign‐induced discussion, homogeneous partisan households might have a higher probability of being contacted by election campaigns than heterogeneous partisan households because the former provide the opportunity to mobilize several potential party supporters with one contact.         "
"16","A handful of scholars have conducted studies in which households are randomly allocated to be contacted by nonpartisan campaigns, ensuring that households exposed to such an external shock are in expectation the same as households that are not (Nickerson 2008; Sinclair 2012; Sinclair, McConnell, and Green 2012). Differences in the outcome of interest should consequently be due to social influence within the household, and not to preexisting compositional and contextual differences between households. These randomized field experiments have shown that turnout levels among household members are significantly higher because their family members were contacted by election campaigns, confirming that contagion of campaign messages indeed occurs (Sinclair, McConnell, and Green 2012).1"
"17","While randomized spillover experiments have contributed much to our understanding of the household as the most important location for intrapersonal mobilization, the household itself has remained a “black box” for experimentalists (Fowler et al. 2011; Nickerson 2008; Sinclair, McConnell, and Green 2012). Field experiments have neither been able to distinguish between households according to the composition of their members' preexisting partisan preferences, nor have they been able to ascertain the impact of (discussions about) explicitly partisan campaigns on electoral mobilization, as all spillover experiments have been based on nonpartisan campaign interventions.         "
"18","The contribution of this study lies in addressing these omissions. By utilizing a spillover experimental design, we are able to separate selection effects and preexisting contextual differences from social influence in assessing to what extent intrahousehold mobilization occurs as a result of an election campaign. Subsequently, we test whether such mobilization is conditioned by the degree of heterogeneity of party preferences within the household. We perform an implicit mediation analysis (Gerber and Green 2012, 333–36) by randomly assigning one of two campaign messages of varying partisan intensity, hence further manipulating the potential for discussion between household members. Our argument is that overtly partisan messages exacerbate partisan sentiment compared to more neutral messages, making preexisting partisan disagreement within the household more salient. In part, this might be because overtly partisan messages function as a social identity cue, rallying support for the team and pitting party supporters against each other (Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002; Rogers, Fox, and Gerber 2014). An overview of our study variables and hypothesized relationships is shown in Figure 1.         "
"19","While our study thus allows for a unique contribution to both the literatures on social network composition and on voter mobilization, it is important to point out its limitations. First, although our study design allows us to identify the causal impact of campaign contact on intrahousehold mobilization within both heterogeneous and homogeneous partisan households, we prime, but do not randomly assign, partisanship within households. Consequently, we cannot exclude the possibility that compositional partisan differences might be confounded by a number of (un)observable background attributes. Individuals in heterogeneous partisan households might, for instance, be—ex ante—less likely to participate in politics than individuals who live in homogeneous partisan households. While we therefore cannot claim that the conditional effects that we uncover are causal in nature, we utilize information about turnout behavior in multiple previous elections to estimate the effects net of ex ante turnout differences between heterogeneous and homogeneous households.         "
"20","Second, we share the limitation present in the experimental and observational literature that we cannot conclusively show that contagion within households is a result of actual discussion (Fowler et al. 2011, 463; Nickerson 2008). As Bullock, Green, and Ha (2010) have demonstrated, it is almost impossible to identify a causal mediator, even if a direct measure of discussion were available in our data set. Hence, we must acknowledge the possibility of alternative explanations for any indirect mobilization effects identified in our experiment that may occur in the (near) absence of discussion. Household members might simply have listened in on the experimental subject's telephone conversation with the party volunteer and adjusted their behavior accordingly. Alternatively, they might have felt social pressure after observing the experimental subject going out to vote, or they might have considered the lower costs of voting by going to the polls together (Nickerson 2008, 55). Most of these alternative mechanisms, however, differ in their observable implications. In the latter two scenarios in particular, there would be little reason to expect different levels of indirect mobilization depending on whether the household is homogeneous or heterogeneous, or depending on the partisan intensity of the campaign message.         "
"21","A third limitation concerns the question of generalizability (Fowler et al. 2011, 466). The mobilization messages used in our study were communicated by a local Labour Party. Work by Jost and colleagues suggests that individuals who hold conservative ideologies are more likely to avoid situations that arouse cognitive dissonance and less likely to be open to new experiences and arguments than liberals (Carney et al. 2008; Garrett 2009; Jost et al. 2003; Nam, Jost, and Van Bavel 2013). Consistent with this idea, Mutz (2006, 33) shows that conservatives are less likely to be embedded in cross‐cutting political discussion networks than liberals. Consequently, we cannot exclude the possibility that conservatives might be less responsive to a Labour campaign message than Labour supporters to a Conservative campaign message. Moreover, within the household, conservatives might be less likely to share opinion‐challenging messages with Labour supporters than vice versa. Hence, we would expect indirect mobilization effects to be more pronounced if contact was made by a Conservative campaign and mediated by a subject who has liberal leanings than the other way around. Our focus on campaign contact also means that our findings might not generalize to other settings in which political discussion is likely to occur within the household, such as when watching news programs together.         "
"22","Finally, although households are important locations of social interaction, they are also unique because personal relationships between household members are usually stronger and may therefore withstand political disagreement more easily than ties that exist between colleagues or acquaintances. This study therefore seeks to qualify, but not directly contradict, the empirical findings of previous work such as Mutz's (2006), whose data on cross‐cutting exposure include weak ties such as those formed at the workplace or in places of worship.         "
"23","Notwithstanding these limitations, the household is arguably the most important personal discussion network and hugely influential in our turnout decisions. By examining the conditions under which campaign‐induced partisan disagreement between household members translates into turnout, we aim to shed some light on intrahousehold mobilization and to more closely integrate, and make valuable contributions to, the literatures on social network composition and campaign mobilization."
"24","We rely on a previously conducted randomized campaign experiment to identify mobilization effects between household members in two‐voter households and to gauge the extent to which they are conditioned by both the degree of heterogeneity of party preferences within the household and the partisan intensity of the campaign messages. We conducted this campaign experiment in several electoral wards in the British city of Birmingham in the context of the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) election, which was held on November 15, 2012.2 This campaign experiment combined two design innovations that make it especially well suited for our current study.         "
"25","First, the experiment was conducted in cooperation with a local Labour Party. Existing field experimental studies of interpersonal influence within households have so far exclusively relied on identifying spillover effects of nonpartisan get‐out‐the‐vote (GOTV) interventions. When trying to assess the impact of an election campaign on indirect mobilization within households, working from within a party's campaign mimics reality more closely given that most mobilization efforts tend to be partisan in nature. As we discuss below, phone bank volunteers were instructed to use two different messages: one of low and one of high partisan intensity. This difference allows us to identify how varying the potential for partisan disagreement affects intrahousehold mobilization."
"26","Second, we had access to detailed information on the pretreatment party preferences of both household members. This information was included in the Labour Party's extensive targeting database and is based on prior canvassing efforts conducted by party volunteers in the constituency.3 The party aims to contact every voter living in the parliamentary constituency to find out which party he or she supports. It is common practice for constituents to volunteer their voting intentions to party canvassers in the UK. The database covered around 38% of registered voters. Although the accuracy of the pretreatment party support measure obtained through local Labour Party canvassing is difficult to assess, a comparison to city council election results suggests that neither Labour supporters nor supporters of rival parties are overrepresented in the data (supporting information, Table A7).4 In addition to party preference, the database also provided information on gender, year of birth, whether individuals were registered as postal voters, the electoral ward in which they reside, and individuals' validated turnout histories (as available from public records). This extensive set of covariates allows us to check whether our findings are robust to covariate adjustment.         "
"27","To fulfill the noninterference assumption (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption, short SUTVA), we randomly selected one individual per household included in the electoral database to be part of the original experiment. The household members of these experimental subjects were not assigned to receive any treatment. For random assignment, a total of 13,065 households with landline numbers (of which 5,190 were two‐voter households) were first stratified into three blocks based on the latest recorded party preference of the experimental subject: “Labour” supporter, “rival party” supporter (i.e., Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Green, British National Party, Respect, UK Independence Party, or those who otherwise indicated explicitly opposing Labour), and those who were “unattached” to a party or whose latest recorded party preference was unknown (i.e., “won't say,” “don't know,” “non‐voter,” or “missing”). The choice of these three groups was motivated by the design of the original experiment, which aimed to distinguish Labour from rival party supporters. Homogeneous partisan households are accordingly defined as households that include either two Labour voters or two rival party supporters, heterogeneous partisan households as consisting of one Labour and one rival party supporter, and unattached households as consisting of at least one unattached voter.5 Next, for two‐voter households, experimental subjects (and their household members) were, within each partisan group, randomly assigned to either one of two treatment groups or to the control group. The control group did not receive any form of contact from the campaign. An overview of the random assignment within partisan blocks for two‐voter households is shown in Figure 2.            "
"28","We followed the standard randomization inference procedure (Gerber and Green 2012) to check whether any covariate imbalances in our sample of two‐voter households were larger than expected given random sampling variability. The resulting p‐value of .50 indicates that we cannot reject the sharp null hypothesis that the covariates taken together are not systematically related to treatment assignment of the household member. Detailed balance tables and figures can be found in the supporting information (Table A1 and Figure A1). Furthermore, as we would expect given that turnout data are collected from the public register, missing outcome data for any household member are neither systematically related to treatment assignment, nor are they a function of treatment assignment, pretreatment covariates, and the interaction between treatment assignment and covariates (see Figure A2 in the supporting information).            "
"29","In order to estimate the within‐household spillover effects resulting from the two treatments, we compare turnout among unassigned household members living with subjects who were assigned to one of the two treatment conditions to turnout among unassigned household members living with subjects assigned to the control condition. In doing so, our spillover model relies on the common assumption that effects spill over within households, but not between neighboring households. This assumption has been tested and confirmed in previous field experiments (Sinclair, McConnell, and Green 2012), and we have no reason to believe that it was violated in the context of our experiment.            "
"30","Experimental subjects allocated to the two treatment groups were called by telephone by Labour Party volunteers in the week leading up to the election (November 10–15) and were encouraged to vote in the PCC election on November 15, 2012. Phone bank volunteers were entirely blind to subjects' pretreatment party preferences, and they were instructed to ask to speak to the person in the experimental group before delivering the messages. In case the person was unavailable, volunteers were instructed to politely finish the conversation without revealing the intent of the call."
"31","In formulating the message scripts, we worked closely with the local Labour Party in order to ensure the messages paralleled normal campaign efforts. Both messages provided practical information to subjects on the election date and their local polling station, and encouraged them to vote for the same candidate, providing information about the candidate's background and his most important policy stance (opposition to cuts in police numbers). However, the content of the scripts varied drastically across the two treatment groups. The “high partisan intensity” treatment was formulated in a strongly partisan tone, explicitly mentioning the Labour Party and policies multiple times, while taking an antagonistic stance toward the main rival party, the Conservative Party, by pointing out the Labour candidate's opposition to the “Tory cuts” in police numbers. In contrast, the “low partisan intensity” treatment message avoided all statements about party competition and mentioned neither the candidate's party affiliation nor the rival party. Both message scripts are displayed in Figures A3 and A4 in the supporting information."
"32","Campaign volunteers were asked to fill in a form on whether contact with the targeted individual was made, any reasons for why contact had failed (i.e., answering machine, no answer, hang‐up), and the number of callbacks made. After the election, the local Labour Party provided us with an updated version of the (anonymized) database, which included validated turnout data for the PCC election from the marked electoral register for both the experimental subjects and their household members. Before the analysis, all two‐voter households with missing outcome data were removed from the sample."
"33","We took great care in the parallel administration of both treatments. The total contact rate, defined as the percentage of individuals in the respective treatment groups who answered the phone when called by volunteers, among two‐voter households, is 45% for both treatment groups (see Table 1). Thus, we failed to administer the treatment to 55% of those assigned to treatment. This rate of noncompliance is similar to the rate recorded in other GOTV studies in the UK (John and Brannan 2008).            "
"34","We start by examining to what extent low and high partisan intensity phone messages mobilized experimental subjects and their household members. Table 1 shows turnout rates for experimental subjects and their household members assigned to the control group and to the two treatment groups. These rates are shown by experimental block, meaning conditional on the pretreatment party preference of the assigned subject.         "
"35","The final column shows that turnout rates among subjects assigned to the control group and their unassigned household members are almost identical at around 19–20%. We would expect this, given the stratified random sampling procedure used to allocate one subject per household to the experimental sample. Among subjects assigned to receive either a low or high partisan intensity phone call, turnout reaches 22–23%. Turnout among the household members of these subjects is slightly higher at 24%. Using randomization inference (Aronow and Samii 2012; Gerber and Green 2012) to estimate p‐values and confidence intervals, we find that, for all partisan groups combined, both the direct and the indirect intent‐to‐treat (ITT) effects are statistically different from the respective control groups, with p < .05. The results suggest that both the low and high partisan intensity campaign messages resulted in intrahousehold mobilization. As we would expect, Table A2 in the supporting information shows that the estimates are robust to covariate adjustment.         "
"36","We next test whether the rates of intrahousehold mobilization differ significantly between homogeneous and heterogeneous partisan households. Figure 3a displays the changes in the predicted probabilities of turnout for unassigned subjects as a function of the treatment assignment of their household member, conditional on the partisan composition of the household. The predicted probabilities are based on a logistic regression of turnout on treatment assignment of the household member, the partisan composition of the household, the interaction between treatment assignment and household partisan composition, pretreatment covariates, and the interaction between pretreatment covariates and treatment assignment (see Equation 14 and Table A3, Model III, in the supporting information).         "
"37","ITTs on Turnout of Unassigned Household Members, Conditional on Household Party Preferences"
"38","Note: Bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.                     "
"39","The key result is that intrahousehold mobilization effects are stronger, not weaker, in households where individuals support different parties. While indirect mobilization effects are around 3.5 percentage points in homogeneous partisan households and around 7 percentage points in households with at least one unattached voter, spillover effects in heterogeneous partisan households peak at around 15 percentage points. Although we are dealing with a treatment‐by‐covariate interaction, this relationship remains unchanged regardless of whether we adjust for pretreatment individual and compositional differences in age, gender, place of residence, registration type (postal voter or not), and turnout history (see Models I–III in Table A3 in the supporting information). Moreover, Figure 3b shows that our results are robust to further breaking down the homogeneous partisan household category into homogeneous Labour households and homogeneous rival party households, and the unattached category into households that include only one unattached subject and households in which both members are unattached.6"
"40","What do these results tell us? We find no evidence to support the hypothesis that individuals are more likely to mobilize a copartisan than a household member who supports another party as a result of being contacted by the Labour campaign. Although we find that campaign messages spill over in homogeneous households consisting of two Labour Party supporters or that include an unattached voter, mobilization effects in these households are no greater than in heterogeneous partisan households. In contrast, we find greater spillover effects when partisans support different parties."
"41","The finding that campaign spillover effects appear more pronounced in heterogeneous than in homogeneous partisan households is difficult to reconcile with a theoretical conception of household members as conflict avoiders. In what follows, we try to further disentangle the partisan mobilization dynamics within the household by examining whether spillover is more or less likely depending on the partisan preferences of both household members."
"42","Figure 4 displays the marginal changes in predicted probabilities resulting from a logistic regression of turnout on assignment to either of the two treatments, the partisanship of the experimental subject, the partisanship of his or her household member, and the two‐ and three‐way interactions between the treatment and the party preferences of both household members. The model also includes pretreatment covariates and interactions between covariates and the treatment (for estimates, see Table A5, Models I–III, in the supporting information).            "

"46","Figure 4a shows that rival party supporters mobilize Labour supporters if they are contacted by a Labour campaign. Figure 4b also shows that Labour Party supporters mobilize rival party supporters as a consequence of Labour campaign contact. While the effects for heterogeneous households are noisy due to small sample sizes, they are substantially large and seem even more pronounced than indirect mobilization effects between two Labour supporters (although the difference between the two effects is not statistically significant). These results thus suggest that party supporters discuss campaign messages with their household members even if a party they oppose initiates contact.            "
"47","The previous results demonstrate that within‐household mobilization plays an important role in partisan election campaigns and that, in contrast to what a conflict‐avoidance mechanism would suggest, heterogeneous partisan households are conducive to indirect campaign mobilization. We implicitly test the effects of raising the level of partisan discussion within the household by exploiting the design feature that the partisan intensity of the campaign message was randomly assigned. Messages with stronger partisan language should exacerbate partisan sentiment compared to more neutral messages, making preexisting partisan disagreement within the household more salient, and resulting in a higher probability of partisan discussions in the household."
"48","Table 2 and Figure 5 show the logistic regression estimates and the corresponding predicted conditional complier average causal effects (CACE) comparing outcomes directly for subjects whose household members answered the high‐intensity phone call to subjects whose household members answered the low partisan intensity phone call. Since subjects included in the original experiment did not know before answering the phone whether they were about to receive the high or the low partisan intensity call, and compliance is defined as living in a household where the assigned subject would answer the phone when called, the share of compliers in the high and the low partisan intensity call groups should, in expectation, be identical (Gerber et al. 2010, 302–5). Following Gerber et al. (2010), this “perfect blindness” assumption can be assessed empirically. If, as in our case, compliance at 45.4% and 44.8% does not vary as a function of treatment assignment, we can compare turnout rates for household members of compliers directly to each other (for the formal assumption and the corresponding CACE spillover estimator, see Equations 23 and 24 in the supporting information).

"50","Note: Bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.                        "
"51","Across partisan blocks, the results in columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 confirm that receiving a high‐intensity partisan message did not result in significantly lower levels of intrahousehold mobilization than receiving a message without partisan content. The relative effectiveness of the two messages again seems to differ according to the partisan makeup of the household. Columns 3, 4, and 5 display the results of models that include interactions between the partisan composition of the household and the partisan content of the message. While column 4 shows the estimates from a model unadjusted for compositional differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous households, column 5 shows the estimates for a model that includes interactions between pretreatment covariates and the treatment. The statistically significant interaction terms indicate that increasing the potential for partisan disagreement had a significantly more positive effect on turnout for household members living in heterogeneous partisan households than for household members living in homogeneous and unattached partisan households.            "
"52","Figure 5 displays the marginal changes in predicted probabilities of turnout for unassigned subjects based on Model V in Table 2. Figure 5b shows a robustness check that compares heterogeneous households separately to homogeneous Labour households and households in which both members support rival parties (based on Model V in Table A6 in the supporting information). If partisan discussion is a plausible mediator linking campaign contact to intrahousehold mobilization, raising the partisan intensity of the message should increase, not decrease, indirect mobilization effects in heterogeneous households.            "
"53","In line with this expectation, we find that indirect mobilization effects in heterogeneous households are 35 percentage points larger among individuals living with someone who received a call priming his or her partisan identity than among subjects whose household members received a call of low partisan intensity. This substantial but noisy CACE estimate might be a function of the low baseline turnout rate, and the relatively small subsample size when comparing household members of compliers directly to each other. It is hence likely that we are dealing with an upper bound on the true effect size. Although we therefore caution against overinterpreting the size of this effect, we clearly do not find any evidence that would support the notion that priming household members' party preferences would decrease indirect mobilization between subjects who are predisposed to disagree on which party to support.            "
"54","An increasing number of political scientists view turnout as a social activity, and few doubt that family, friends, and neighbors influence decisions about whether or not to participate politically and whom to support (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995; Klofstad 2011; Mutz 2006; Rolfe 2012; Sinclair 2012; Zuckerman 2005; Zuckerman, Dasović, and Fitzgerald 2007). The debate within the literature now centers on whether political disagreement between network members is harmful or beneficial for political participation. In this article, we contribute to this debate by focusing on a specific, but very common, instance of political disagreement that occurs among household members in the context of a partisan election campaign and that affects the decision to vote. Our study is unique because it combines the exogenous assignment of partisan telephone calls with an unusually rich data set, made available by a local branch of the UK Labour Party, which includes the party preferences and validated turnout of all household members. Our results demonstrate that within‐household mobilization effects are considerably larger as a result of campaign contact in households that consist of members who disagree in their party preference than in households in which members share a similar party preference.         "
"55","These results provide an important qualification regarding the role of disagreement in discouraging electoral participation in the context of the household. Rather than supporting a demobilizing impact of partisan disagreement, our results offer new experimental evidence for the participatory benefits of disagreement that advance on observational work carried out by Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague (2002, 2004), Nir (2005), and McClurg (2006). Importantly, our study is the first to causally identify the indirect effects of partisan messages on turnout in heterogeneous and homogeneous personal networks. We recognize that our findings may be limited to the household or other equally intimate settings, and may not apply to social networks in which ties are weaker and political discussion is more easily avoidable. We have suggested that because households tend to be high‐trust environments, the risk of potential fallout from political discussion is likely lower than in environments such as the workplace. If social costs are lower, individuals can more easily enjoy the entertainment value and political information that discussions about partisan politics provide. As such, our findings qualify, but do not directly contradict, Mutz's (2006) earlier work on turnout in heterogeneous networks that consist of both strong and weak ties.         "
"56","How confident are we that this intrahousehold mobilization is a result of discussion rather than some other form of social influence? Social influence can occur in a number of imaginable ways. For instance, observing a household member voting might function as a simple reminder to vote, or it may provide social pressure to comply with a perceived norm of voting. By showing evidence that campaign messages of a highly partisan nature increase indirect mobilization in heterogeneous partisan households to a greater extent than campaign messages of a lower partisan intensity, our findings are suggestive of household members talking about the message, rather than solely acting as a consequence of observing their household member's act of voting. Our assertion that members in two‐voter households do not refrain from partisan discussions in order to avoid conflict is also in line with research that shows how couples who live together become increasingly similar over time in their policy and party preferences (Stoker and Jennings 2005; Zuckerman, Fitzgerald, and Dasović 2005). In order to adopt each other's preferences, surely couples must be talking.         "
"57","In addition to the literature on disagreement in social networks, this article also makes an important contribution to the literature on partisan election campaigns. While the existence of an indirect mobilization effect within households has been demonstrated in nonpartisan GOTV experiments (Nickerson 2008; Sinclair, McConnell, and Green 2012), we show that this effect is also present in partisan campaigns. As Nickerson, Friedrichs, and King (2006) caution, partisan and nonpartisan campaigns differ in multiple ways, and intrahousehold partisan dynamics are widely expected to influence the effectiveness of indirect campaign mobilization (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004). It remains to be seen to what extent indirect mobilization effects between partisans are replicated, or even amplified, when conservative parties initiate contact with supporters of more liberal rival parties, as liberals are said to be more open to opinion‐challenging information than conservatives (Jost et al. 2003; Nam, Jost, and Van Bavel 2013).         "
"58","The relatively large spillover effects reported in this article (cf. Nickerson 2008; Sinclair, McConnell, and Green 2012) might partly be due to the low‐information, low‐saliency nature of the election. Alternatively, they might be a function of the research design. In a recent paper, Mann and Sinclair (2014) argue that spillover effects might differ depending on whether the low‐ or the high‐propensity voter in a household is targeted. As a function of our research design, the lower‐propensity voter had an equal probability of being assigned to contact as the higher‐propensity voter. In contrast, in Nickerson's (2008) experimental design, the higher‐propensity voter might have been more likely to self‐select into opening the door to the canvasser. Even if our results are on the high end of the scale, they nonetheless strongly suggest that partisan election campaigns can have substantial indirect mobilization effects that should be taken into account when assessing the cost‐effectiveness of different voter mobilization methods.         "
"59","Our results thus raise intriguing strategic questions for partisan campaigns. Partisans appear to be more responsive to campaign messages from rival parties if these messages are mediated by household members than if they are transmitted directly by party canvassers. Our results suggest that campaigns can indirectly affect the turnout behavior of a rival party's supporters via sympathetic household members. Future research should hence investigate whether a campaign strategy that targets heterogeneous partisan households is prone to being strategically ineffective by mobilizing votes for opposing parties, or if such a strategy might be beneficial to parties if contacted supporters persuade their household members to switch their vote."
"60","Are these results specific to the UK context? We sincerely doubt so. Compared to the United States, the partisan context in the UK is less polarized, and fewer individuals hold strong party preferences (Ford 2014; Pattie and Johnston 2010). As such, one might have expected no difference in intrahousehold mobilization between households in which members support the same party and those in which they do not. Our finding that spillover effects are larger in heterogeneous than in homogeneous partisan households as a result of campaign contact, and larger still when the partisan intensity of the message is increased, would lead us to expect an even more pronounced impact of partisan disagreement within households on electoral participation in the U.S. context.         "
"61","Political discussion within personal networks is widely believed to go hand in hand with increasing levels of political knowledge and tolerance of competing political viewpoints, ultimately benefiting the functioning of democracies (Conover, Searing, and Crewe 2002; Mutz 2002b, 2006). However, scholars have doubted that these civic characteristics of politically heterogeneous networks also facilitate political participation (McClurg 2003; Mutz 2002a, 2006). Our article shows that political disengagement is not necessarily the flip side of the political diversity and tolerance fostered by sharing the same household with individuals who hold different political views. A better understanding of how partisan political disagreement within the family can motivate voter participation provides valuable insights into the general conditions under which political discussion in personal networks occurs and under which it generates civic benefits.
