"1","The dominant models of judicial decision making argue that, above all else, judges seek to make legal policy. There are, of course, considerable reasons to believe judges seek policy. Chief among them is the wealth of data showing their actions are consistent with policy goals. At the threshold stages of decision making, judges set their agenda and determine whether parties have standing based on ideological values (Black and Owens 2011; Ho and Ross 2010; Rowland and Todd 1991). During oral argument, they raise policy matters (Johnson 2004). And at the merits stage, they craft opinions (Maltzman, Spriggs, and Wahlbeck 2000) and cast votes (Epstein and Knight 1998; Segal and Spaeth 2002) seemingly for policy considerations.         "
"2","Though contextual constraints leave circuit court judges somewhat constrained from sincerely seeking policy, a substantial empirical foundation holds up the belief that policy goals strongly influence their behavior (Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek 2003, 2004, 2006; Songer and Haire 1992). After all, the Supreme Court reviews few cases every term (Owens and Simon 2012), so circuit judges can, if they desire, vote their preferences with little fear of reversal. In fact, interviews with circuit judges and empirical analyses suggest that fear of reversal plays little role in circuit judges' behavior (Bowie and Songer 2009; Klein 2002; Klein and Hume 2003). What is more, voting patterns and dissents appear to turn on ideological considerations (Cross 2003; Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek 2004, 2006). For many reasons, then, scholars argue that policy goals motivate judges and that other considerations are instrumental to those ends.1"
"3","There are reasons to question whether policy goals alone motivate judges, however (Baum 1997, 2006; Brace and Hall 1997; Hall 1987, 1995). For starters, judges observe little personal gain from effectuating policy goals. Policy is simply a broad and often intangible concept that tends not to generate personal gains for judges. Even if a judge does receive a personal gain in terms of policy, such gains usually arise in the future, and, as Baum (2006) reminds us, people tend to discount future costs and benefits. Finally, the Court's policy outputs are public goods. Judges cannot be denied those goods once they are created. Thus, for each judge, sacrificing more immediate benefits may be irrational (Baum 2006).         "
"4","We take these concerns seriously. We concede that policy goals are indirect, distant, and collective, and therefore might give way to more immediate interests. Yet, we do not argue that policy goals are irrelevant. To the contrary, we suggest that other goals might motivate judges alongside their policy goals. That is, when a more immediate benefit is available, judges may sacrifice their policy goals in favor of these other goals, which are usually less operative because they are usually less relevant. Just what those other goals are is unclear, but certainly among them are approbation (Baum 2006), legal accuracy (Rubin and Feeley 1996), collegiality (Edwards 2003), and, most important for our purposes, career advancement. Our central claim is that judges with a large probability of promotion will “be willing to sacrifice some of their preferred policies, which provide no tangible benefits, for even a small improvement in the odds of elevation to a higher court” (Baum 2006, 82).         "
"5","We have ample reason to suspect that career goals motivate some circuit court judges (See, e.g., Epstein et al. 2013). After all, empirical evidence shows that career goals motivate some federal district court judges. Promotion‐minded district court judges show their political caretakers they are trustworthy and qualified by casting particular votes. For example, a number of studies examine district court judges' votes on the constitutionality of the federal sentencing commission (Cohen 1991; Morriss, Heise, and Sisk 2005; Sisk, Heise, and Morriss 1998). In particular, Cohen (1991) examines whether judges who were likely candidates for promotion to the circuit court supported the commission. He finds that judges who were strong contenders for promotion were more likely to support the commission, in part because the president (who might nominate them) supported it (see also Sisk, Heise, and Morriss 1998). Cohen (1992) likewise examines whether federal district court judges imposed different fines against companies for antitrust violations when they were contenders for elevation to the circuit court. His results suggested that Democrat judges who were objectively strong contenders for promotion imposed significantly higher fines than judges who were not contenders.2 Epstein et al. (2013) find similar results. Looking at the behavior of “auditioner judges” seeking elevation to the Supreme Court, they discover that in criminal cases auditioners are significantly more likely to vote against defendants than nonauditioners. They find no differences between auditioners and nonauditioners, however, in civil cases.         "
"6","We believe career goals influence circuit court of appeals judges to behave in ways, during Supreme Court vacancies, they otherwise would not. Looking at circuit judges in particular is logical because presidents overwhelmingly turn to them when filling High Court vacancies. This is the case because circuit court judges have had to decide cases and write opinions, thereby providing presidents with more information about their judicial preferences. As such, “federal appeals judges offer a better (if hardly dispositive) gauge of future Supreme Court behavior than anyone else” (Yalof 2005, 697). Presidents also nominate from the pool of circuit court judges because those judges enjoy nearly instant perceived legal qualifications. Having already served as judges, they appear qualified even before the public explores their backgrounds. As a consequence, circuit court judges nominated to the Supreme Court have an impressive batting average. Among nominees receiving a confirmation vote on the Senate floor since John Marshall Harlan in 1955, those who were sitting circuit court judges received 1,382 yea votes, whereas those who were not received only 868 yea votes (Epstein et al. 2007).         "
"7","What is more, circuit judges know presidents look their way and therefore have incentives to audition for promotion. In fact, one circuit judge jokingly referred to himself as a member of the OOPPSSCA: the “Organization of People Patiently Seeking Supreme Court Appointments” (Bazelon 2004). The names of circuit court judges have been on every president's Supreme Court short list for decades. They have reason to believe that under the right set of conditions, they might be nominated by the president to the Court.         "
"8","This suggests, then, that under some conditions, promotion‐seeking judges will alter their behavior. “If the judge attaches enormous value to being a Supreme Court Justice,” says Posner, “the expected utility of such an appointment… may influence behavior” (2005, 1274). Thus, we examine whether federal circuit court judges alter their behavior in an effort to solidify their standing with the president and get nominated to the Supreme Court."
"9","But what kind of behavior modification might we expect from promotion‐seeking judges? We focus here on three. We examine whether they become more likely to vote in line with the president's ideology and to side with the United States when doing so might aid their chances of elevation, and whether the possibility of promotion leads them to write more or fewer separate (dissenting and concurring) opinions."
"10","Circuit court judges seeking promotion to the Supreme Court may be more likely to vote in line with the president's ideology when there is a vacancy on the Court versus when there is no vacancy. Judges' votes are, of course, among their most important official actions, and if they want to signal to the president their worthiness for elevation, they are likely to vote ideologically as he would (Savchak et al. 2006). Thus, we expect judges with potential to be nominated to the Court by Republican (Democratic) presidents to be more likely to vote conservatively (liberally) during a vacancy period than during a nonvacancy period.            "
"11","We focus on a contender judge's relationship with the president for a host of reasons. Most obviously, the president must first nominate someone to the High Court before one can take a seat there. So, locking down presidential support would be a primary consideration for an ambitious circuit court judge. Indeed, Savchak et al. (2006) find that district court judges who cast more votes in accord with the sitting president's ideology were more likely to get nominated and confirmed to a vacancy on the circuit court. Additionally, because the president acts first in the nomination and confirmation process—and can sometimes manage it effectively—he is advantaged (Maltese 1995; Massaro 1990).            "
"12","More importantly, though, we focus on a contender judge's relationship with the president (rather than the Senate) because Johnson and Roberts (2004, 2005) show that presidents have considerable influence over Senate confirmation of Supreme Court nominees. They examined the success of presidents' nominees to the High Court, looking specifically at presidential success during unconstrained, semi‐constrained, and fully constrained regimes (Moraski and Shipan 1999). What they found was that presidents succeeded in getting their nominees confirmed across all three regimes—even the fully constrained regime, when Senate power should be at its zenith and the president should be most likely to fail. What Johnson and Roberts show is that by going public, presidents can overcome senates that are ideologically and politically opposed to them. In fact, presidents who go public can switch the votes of individual senators who otherwise might seek to oppose the nominee (Johnson and Roberts 2004). As they put it, “presidents have a greater deal of power over the nomination process—even when they face ideological constraints in the senate—and … they use this power to gain confirmation for their preferred choice” (Johnson and Roberts 2005, 44). In short, because a president wields considerable power in the nomination and confirmation process, and judges surely know it, our focus is on the contender's relationship to the president.3"
"13","Circuit judges seeking elevation to the Supreme Court also may treat the United States more favorably when there is a vacancy on the Court than when there is no vacancy. These judges may wish to show their “team credentials” during these time periods, assuring politicians that they will side with the United States in cases. Whether in criminal cases or other cases involving the government, elevation‐seeking judges may be more likely to vote in favor of the United States during vacancy periods."
"14","To bolster this claim, we look to the work of Pacelle and others. In his extensive interviews with current and former Solicitors General (SG) and their staff, Pacelle (2003) discovered that presidents of both parties sought to prosecute criminals at a high rate. One former assistant in the SG's office even told Pacelle that “in 80 to 90 percent of the cases handled [under both Republican and Democrat administrations], the dispositions did not change that much. Probably 40 to 60 percent were criminal cases. We were still trying to keep the bad guys in jail” (Pacelle 2003, 26). Judge William Bryson, who also previously worked in the Office of the Solicitor General, likewise told Pacelle that “98 percent of the cases are not affected by the Administration” (26). Pacelle, Curry, and Marshall (2011) go further, finding that regardless of which party occupied the White House, the United States took the conservative position in 96% of the criminal cases under study, argued 80% of its internal revenue cases in favor of the IRS; and found 84% of federalism cases in favor of the national government (72). In short, it would appear that in many cases there is a clear position on behalf of the United States that presidents, regardless of party, seem to pursue. Accordingly, we expect judges seeking elevation to be sensitive to those goals and side with the United States.            "
"15","We expect that the separate opinion‐writing behavior of promotion‐seeking judges will be systematically different when there are vacancies on the Court. Opinion writing is critical for judges, not only as they make legal policy, but also as they attempt to single out their particular worthiness for promotion. The opinions they write can be strong signals to presidents and presidential advisors. Morriss, Heise, and Sisk (2005), for example, argue that opinions “attract the attention necessary for nomination” to higher office (72). Certainly, judges seeking elevation might desire to write the majority opinion in all cases in which they sit. Yet, given the norms of opinion assignment, they cannot craft all such opinions. And, even if they could, they would face the prospect of having to accommodate their colleagues (Maltzman, Spriggs, and Wahlbeck 2000). Accordingly, separate opinions become important tools. As Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek (2003, 219) put it: “Unlike the majority opinion author in the typical case, the concurring or dissenting judge speaks alone. Hence, judges may perceive separate opinions as useful tools to achieve personal distinction.”            "
"16","But separate opinions are not all equal. The benefits, costs, and goals of writing dissents versus concurrences are different.4 And in many cases, dissent will be more appealing to a contender judge than a concurrence.            "
"17","Consider the contender's goal to state his or her views clearly for the record. Without the need to accommodate other judges, a dissenter can write precisely what he or she wants (Scalia 1998, 22–23). In fact, it is commonly believed that Warren Burger's dissents as a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit, along with his speech on criminal justice at Ripon College, led Richard Nixon to pay closer attention to and elevate him (Abraham 1999). Contrast this to writing a concurring opinion. Like a dissent, a concurring opinion offers a judge the ability to state his or her views apart from the majority opinion. This benefit, however, is less potent in concurrences. For, when a judge concurs in an opinion, she casts her lot with the majority outcome and, often, with the rationale the majority used to get there. By joining the majority opinion, a concurring judge runs the risk of muddling her position and may find herself unable to separate her views clearly from the majority. Dissent, on the other hand, sends a clear signal.            "
"18","Of course, while a judge in dissent runs the risk of looking rigid, this is probably the type of justice presidents want to nominate. What some call rigid, others call principled. A rigid judge is less likely to drift ideologically than a judge who compromises and shows flexibility (Owens and Wedeking 2012), something presidents are likely to desire. After all, for a judge seeking to get promoted to the Supreme Court, what could be more important than stating a legal view clearly in a formal opinion? Likely not much.5"
"19","By their very nature, the goals of dissents and concurrences are different, with the purpose of dissent more suited toward elucidating one's position and pointing out flaws with the majority's reasoning, and the purpose of a concurrence to improve the majority's reasoning. For example, Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek (2003) argue that concurring opinions seek to clarify the majority opinion or make alternative arguments that support its result (237). Lupu and Fowler (2013) find that concurring opinions have the likely intended effect of strengthening the majority opinion. Dissents do not. Dissents are blunter measures that are based on ideological disagreement, with the intent to separate the dissenter cleanly from the majority. As Judge Coffin once stated: “A concurrence is like a fencing foil; it elegantly makes its usually bloodless points. A dissent, on the other hand, is more like a broadsword. It takes more resolution and commitment to wield it and there is the expectation of drawing at least a little blood” (Coffin 1994, 227). A concurring judge is tied to the majority opinion, whereas the dissenter is not.6"
"20","Perhaps most important for our purposes, however, is the theoretical argument proposed by Maveety, Turner, and Way (2010). Following the general theory of Baum (1997), that judges have multiple goals, the authors argue that judges have two goals: winning and speaking. Winning reflects their dispositional policy goals. That is, it reflects whether the conservative or liberal position wins. Speaking, on the other hand, focuses on the judge's goal of making good legal doctrine. That is, it represents the judge's goal of setting effective and favorable legal guidelines. Maveety and her coauthors argue that Supreme Court justices today seek both goals—and that is what explains the increase in concurring opinions: They want to win (i.e., vote with the dispositional majority) but also speak (i.e., lay out their views of good law). Our theory applies their notion to contender judges by arguing that while winning and speaking may be operational goals for them generally, once a vacancy arises, contender judges become less interested in winning and more interested, simply, in speaking. Why? Because the judge knows that the president is listening. So, with the goal of winning taking second place to the goal of speaking, dissent becomes more useful. The judge speaks as clearly as possible, through dissent, to set himself or herself apart from the majority and other possible contenders.            "
"21","All this gives rise, then, to our belief that during vacancy periods, contender judges will be more likely to write dissenting opinions and less likely to write concurring opinions."
"22","To determine whether the possibility of promotion causes circuit court judges to modify their behavior, we compare how “contender” circuit court judges (whom we define below) behave in cases decided when a Supreme Court vacancy exists with their behavior when there is no such vacancy. We then repeat this comparison among noncontender judges, for whom we should expect to observe no behavioral differences."
"23","Our first order of business was to determine which judges were “contenders” for promotion. Conceptually, this was no easy task. On one hand, using an overly broad definition would risk including judges who were not likely contenders, which would make it more difficult to recover behavioral differences that might well exist. On the other hand, an unduly narrow definition that included only a few judges would both be too charitable to us and limit our ability to generalize. Thus, we took a moderate (and easily replicable) approach. To identify contender judges (those with the most promotion potential—and likely to know it), we looked at the names of people who made each president's “short list.” The president's short list is a list, or running tally, of the names of individuals the president has strongly considered nominating to the Court. We use short‐list data discovered and provided by Nemacheck (2007) and identify a total of 68 contender judges across each Supreme Court vacancy, starting with Chief Justice Stone's departure in 1946 and ending with Justice Stevens's vacancy in 2010 (see the online appendix for a full list).7 From these lists, we observe a total of 68 different circuit court judges across our sample period, with an average of 3.4 circuit court judges per vacancy.8"
"24","To be sure, identifying contender judges by looking to the short list is not a perfect measure. It may leave out some judges who actually had potential for elevation—or at least thought they did—but did not make the president's short list. Yet, the alternatives are either impossible or unappealing. For example, we cannot use the same approach as scholars who looked at district court promotion‐seeking behavior because they rely on dynamics that are unique to lower federal courts. When a circuit court vacancy comes open, the vacancy “belongs” to the state in which the retired judge lived. The president, with advice from the home‐state senators, will nominate someone from that state. Scholars in that context can identify contender judges by looking at the ages and residences of sitting circuit court judges. As a circuit judge from a particular state ages, a vacancy becomes more likely, and the district court judges from that state can begin to lobby for the position. These same dynamics simply do not apply to Supreme Court vacancies, where no state holds title to a seat. Other approaches also come up short. For example, asserting that judges of a certain age should vote more strategically is too broad, as it assumes that all those judges of a certain age are equally likely to be elevated."
"25","Our next step was to define the time period in which we expect to observe behavioral change (i.e., the “vacancy period,” or “treatment period”). We focus on the time between when a Supreme Court vacancy is made public and when the final nominee for that position is confirmed by the Senate, though our results are robust to other windows of time.9 To obtain these dates, we relied on Epstein, Segal, et al. (2007).            "
"26","We pause here to make one thing clear. We do not argue that when selecting nominees, presidents look only to their behavior during these vacancy periods. Rather, presidents look back to the behavior of judges over their careers for defining characteristics. Nevertheless, the vacancy period is the one time contender judges know presidents watch them. They therefore have incentives to maximize their elevation potential then. So, while this is not the time for contender judges to make first impressions, it is a time for them to solidify their standing with the president. Our introductory example of Chief Justice Roberts underscores the point. President Bush knew of Roberts before Hamdan, but it was his vote in that case that “sealed Roberts's nomination” (Toobin 2007, 277).            "
"27","Since our goal is to determine whether a vacancy on the Court causes contender circuit judges to modify their behavior, we need a research design that allows us to examine a “but for” question. But for the presence of a vacancy, would the judge have behaved differently? In a perfect world, we would examine the behavior of contender judges in the presence of a vacancy, and then rerun history and observe how those same judges voted in those same cases when there was no vacancy on the Court. Since we cannot do that, the next best alternative is to employ matching. We find cases that are as similar as possible to one another in every meaningful way, except for the fact that in some cases there were vacancies on the Court and in other cases there were not (Epstein et al. 2005). If, after matching the observations accordingly, we observe a change in a judge's behavior across the two sets of cases, we can attribute it to the presence of a vacancy on the Supreme Court.10"
"28","Our cases come from two sources. We started by identifying all the cases included in the U.S. Courts of Appeals Database (between 1946 and 2010) that were decided by a contender judge. While roughly 10% of the nearly 53,000 votes were cast by a contender judge, only a small fraction of these were cast during a vacancy period. Power analyses revealed that if we used these data alone, we would be unlikely to detect even large vacancy‐caused changes in a judge's behavior. Accordingly, we searched LexisNexis to identify cases that involved a contender judge and were decided during a Supreme Court vacancy. We then coded an 85% random sample of these cases. All told, our analysis consists of 4,901 contender judge observations during a Supreme Court vacancy and 6,886 contender judge observations during a nonvacancy period. Data for our group of noncontender judges come exclusively from the U.S. Courts of Appeals Database, which yields 4,903 vacancy observations and 32,378 nonvacancy observations."
"29","We used coarsened exact matching (CEM; Iacus, King, and Porro 2012) to pre‐process and balance our data. We matched cases on a host of characteristics that might influence a judge's behavior but are nonrandomly distributed among cases and judges. In particular, we examined the judge's Judicial Common Space (JCS) score, the JCS score of the median justice on the Supreme Court at the time of the decision, the JCS score of the median judge on the circuit at the time of the decision, the ideological composition of the panel with whom the judge sat, and the publication status of the court's opinion in a case.11"
"30","We matched on each judge's JCS score so that we could compare the behavior of judges who held similar policy views.12 We wanted to ensure that we compared the behavior of liberal (conservative) judges with the behavior of other liberal (conservative) judges.13 For if we compared the voting behavior of a conservative judge under a Republican president during a vacancy period with the voting behavior of a liberal judge under a Republican president during a nonvacancy period, we would get an inflated perception of the effect of a vacancy period. We would expect the conservative to be more likely than the liberal to vote with the president's policy position. The difference in ideological behavior would more likely be attributable to ideological preferences rather than to the presence of a Supreme Court vacancy.               "
"31","We also matched on the ideological distance between the judge and the president. Since we would expect presidents to be more likely to nominate judges with whom they are ideologically compatible, and that these judges would know they stand a better chance of elevation, we thought it wise to ensure that our observations focused on similar ideological distances both when a vacancy existed and when it did not. For example, assume we have a contender judge under President Obama. If we compared her behavior during a vacancy period when President Obama was in office versus her behavior during a non‐vacancy period when President George W. Bush was in office, we might bias the data in favor of finding a result during the treatment period when, in reality, her behavior changed as a result of general ideological agreement with the president. On the other hand, if we compare her behavior during an open‐vacancy period when President Obama was in office versus her behavior during a nonvacancy period when, say, President Clinton was in office, then we will have much more confidence in the effect of the vacancy. To measure the ideological agreement between a judge and the president, we obtain the absolute value of the difference between the judge's JCS score and the president's JCS score."
"32","To minimize the noise from the threat of review by the Supreme Court, we also matched observations on the ideological location of the median Supreme Court justice. There is some evidence to suggest that lower court judges render decisions strategically so as to avoid Supreme Court review. For example, Westerland et al. (2010) find that circuit court judges who interpret and apply precedent look to the preferences of current Supreme Court justices. Likewise, Benesh and Reddick (2002) find that lower courts comply more quickly with Supreme Court decisions when the High Court appears more vested in them. Wahlbeck (1998) reveals that the Court's decisions on public nuisance led to a change in behavior by the lower courts. And Hansford and Spriggs (2006) find that circuit courts follow the Supreme Court's lead when treating upper court precedent. Simply put, there is considerable evidence to suggest that circuit court judges follow the Supreme Court. So, we wanted to ensure that our comparison of cases was fair—that the Court was roughly the same ideologically for cases decided during a vacancy period as it was for cases decided when no vacancy existed.               "
"33","Circuit judges sometimes render decisions strategically to avoid en banc review by their circuit colleagues. As Hettinger and Lindquist (2012) note: “Cases can be heard or panel decisions reheard en banc if a majority of the judges in the circuit vote to do so” (142, fn. 2). That is, if a three‐judge panel renders a decision that is inconsistent with the law of the circuit—or if a majority of circuit judges disagrees ideologically with one of their panel's decisions—the circuit, upon majority vote, can review the panel decision en banc and thereby set circuit‐wide precedent. A number of studies suggest that panel judges may be influenced to moderate their votes so as to avoid en banc review (see, generally, Cross and Tiller 1998; George 1999; Giles et al. 2007). If judges are in fact influenced by the threat of en banc review, we must account for this dynamic. As such, we match observations so that open‐vacancy cases are compared to nonvacancy cases where judges are overseen by similar circuit court colleagues.               "
"34","In addition to the hierarchical considerations already described, another potential influence is the identity of the other judges on the panel itself. Sunstein, Schkade, and Ellman (2004) show, for example, that Democratic appointees are less likely to vote liberally when the panel is composed of two Republican appointees as opposed to two other Democratic ones. More recently, Boyd, Epstein, and Martin (2010) document the existence of sex‐based panel effects in sexual discrimination cases (see also Cross and Tiller 1998). To control for the potential ideological influence of a judge's colleagues, we match on the absolute value of the ideological distance between a short‐listed judge and her remaining colleagues. For the typical three‐judge panel, we compute the distance between a short‐listed judge and the midpoint of her two colleagues. For en banc cases, we use the median of the judges on the panel (excluding the short‐listed judge) as the referent point.               "
"35","Courts of appeals judges are allowed to dispose of cases through an opinion they declare to be unpublished and, thus, nonprecedential. This status is generally reserved for rudimentary cases that simply apply settled law. Indeed, more than 80% of circuit court opinions are unpublished (Law 2005, 817). Accordingly, controlling for this factor allows us, albeit in a rather coarse way, to distinguish between the underlying importance of a case.14"
"36","An additional way to determine the importance of a case is to examine whether the circuit court reversed the decision under review. Circuit courts review numerous appeals every year that are frivolous. The courts tend to affirm the lower courts in these cases. But cases that observe reversals tend to be more important cases that require judicial attention. To ensure that we distinguish between perfunctory cases and those of significance, we also match observations on whether the circuit court reversed the court below it."
"37","Matching on these variables resulted in a sizable improvement in the balance between our vacancy and nonvacancy observations. We summarize balance using , a measure that provides an index of the degree of imbalance across all multivariate combinations of pretreatment variables in a data set (Iacus, King, and Porro 2011). Zero is the minimum value of  and represents perfect balance between the treatment and control groups. One is the theoretical maximum of  and indicates that no overlap exists between the two groups (i.e., that the treatment and control groups are very dissimilar). Preprocessing with CEM yielded an 80% and 84% reduction in overall imbalance for our contender judge and noncontender judge data, respectively.15 In short, matching has left us with data that allow us to make more informed inferences about the effect of Supreme Court vacancies on circuit judge behavior.               "
"38","Matched data in hand, we estimated a series of logistic regression models. Our dependent variables in these models came from our list of areas where we expect judges' behavior to change when faced with a vacancy on the Court. They were (1) whether the judge voted with the president's ideological preferences, (2) whether the judge voted in favor of the United States as a party, (3) whether the judge wrote a dissenting opinion, and (4) whether the judge wrote a concurring opinion. Each of these variables is dichotomous, taking a value of 1 if the judge engaged in the act and 0 otherwise."
"39","Our main covariate of interest was whether the judge ruled on the case during a vacancy period, which we coded as 1 if a case was decided during a vacancy period and 0 if it was not. We also include each of the matching variables described above: each judge's JCS score, the JCS score of the median Supreme Court justice, the JCS score of the median judge on the circuit, the ideological distance between a judge and the remaining panelists, whether the case was published, and whether the circuit court reversed the lower court. In so doing, we follow the advice of Ho et al. (2007), who advocate including the matching variables in parametric models as a way to neutralize any remaining imbalance in the data and omitted variable bias.         "
"40","We then estimated these models for our two different types of judges: contenders and noncontenders. If our theory about judges following their career goals is correct, contender judges will alter their behavior during vacancy periods but noncontender judges will not. Figure 1 presents our results, which come from stochastic simulations performed after estimating our models.16 The labels on the y‐axis identify each of the four behavior outcomes we examined. The x‐axis corresponds to the predicted probability a judge engages in each behavior, conditional on (1) whether he or she was a contender judge (circles) or noncontender (squares) and (2) whether a vacancy existed at the time of the decision (black = yes; white = no).         "
"41","Our results provide strong support for the idea that contender judges systematically alter their behavior and that noncontenders do not. Consider, first, whether the contender judge's vote accords with the president's ideology. We hypothesized that contender circuit court judges would be more likely to vote in line with the president's preferences during vacancy periods. That is, we expected that during a vacancy period with a Republican (Democratic) president, a Republican (Democratic) contender judge would be more likely to cast conservative (liberal) votes. The data support our hypothesis. The probability of a judge voting consistently with the president's general preferences increases from 0.42 when no vacancy exists to 0.51 when one does—a 21% relative increase. This finding is noteworthy because to make it on the president's short list, a judge must have largely ruled consistently with the president. And if the short list contains judges who already were voting in line with the president, then the increase we observe seems to be especially significant. This result, again, occurs even when we match on other possible confounding variables—including, most importantly, her general ideological agreement with the president. Stated otherwise, holding all else equal, save for the fact that in one case there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court and in the other there is not, a judge contending for elevation to the Court is 21% more likely to vote for the ideological disposition generally favored by the president. This, we believe, is to curry favor with the president and solidify the judge's credentials. What is more, as the squares within the topmost section of the figure suggest, we do not observe a similar vacancy effect for noncontender judges.17 This shows, then, that among judges with strong potential for elevation, career goals can lead them to deviate from their normal policy‐seeking behavior. They amplify their policy decisions so as to signal viability to the president.         "
"42","We next hypothesized that circuit judges who are strong contenders for elevation would be more likely to vote in favor of the United States when it is a party to a case, and that noncontenders, by contrast, would not exhibit such behavior. The data support both of these hypotheses. For contender judges, the probability of a pro‐U.S. vote doubles, jumping from 0.27 when no vacancy exists to 0.54 when there is a vacancy. Among noncontenders, there is no such effect. Once again, the desire for elevation leads contender judges to deviate from their pure policy preferences and vote in favor of the United States more often than they otherwise do."
"43","The bottom half of the figure shows the results for our separate opinion writing variables. Recall that opinion writing provides judges with a unique opportunity to express their views in a format that is likely to capture the attention of the president—or at least his advisors. From our perspective, however, we expected to observe differences between dissent and concurrence writing behavior. In particular, a dissent offers the clearest way for a judge to differentiate herself from her colleagues. In a concurrence, by contrast, a judge is agreeing with the case outcome and parts of the rationale. We expected that contending judges would be more likely to write dissents during vacancy periods and less likely to write concurrences, and that noncontender judges would exhibit no systematic tendencies during vacancy periods for dissents or concurrences."
"44","The data support the first half of our hypotheses. Contender judges are more than twice as likely to author a dissenting opinion when a vacancy exists as opposed to when it does not, with the predicted probability jumping from 0.08 to 0.18. Again, we reiterate that these effects are what we observe after matching observations on a judge's level of ideological agreement with both her fellow panelists and the preferences of the two judicial bodies that could review the panel's decision—the circuit as a whole and the Supreme Court. Although contender judges' dissenting behavior is affected by the presence of a vacancy, we fail to find evidence that vacancy periods affect noncontenders. In terms of concurring behavior, we observe a slight negative effect but one that is ultimately not statistically significant."
"45","Taken together, these findings support our theory that when career goals are relevant and elevation is possible, judges will sacrifice short‐term policy goals for upward mobility.18 They vote more with the president's ideology than they otherwise would. They vote in favor of the United States more than they otherwise would. And they write more dissents than they otherwise would. All this they do to solidify their standing with the administration in an effort to get promoted. What this suggests, then, is that under the right conditions, policy goals will not predominate; rather, more personal goals can take hold. To be sure, we recognize that elevation for most judges is an unlikely prospect and, thus, the goal of policy acquisition remains unchallenged. Yet, because some judges in some instances show clearly that policy goals will give way to career considerations, we must consider the possibility that policy goals are simply one of many goals judges hold and that they may even be weaker goals. If career goals can trump policy, other goals may as well.         "
"46","Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Alex Kozinski once stated:            "
"47","Every magistrate judge is a district judge in waiting; every district judge is a circuit judge in waiting; every circuit judge is an associate justice in waiting; and every associate justice is a chief justice in waiting… . How does a judge reconcile his personal ambitions with the requirements of principled application of the law and sensitivity to individual justice? (2004, 1104)"
"48","If our data have anything to say about the matter, it is that career goals can take center stage. Our results show that circuit court judges who are strong contenders for elevation to the Supreme Court clearly alter their behavior during vacancy periods. When a vacancy opens up on the Supreme Court, these judges are significantly more likely (than they otherwise would be) to side with the current president's ideological position, rule in favor of the United States, and alter some of their separate opinion writing behavior. Noncontender judges evince none of these changes. Put simply, we find significant evidence to support the claim that circuit judges use their institutional powers to seek promotion."
"49","This finding speaks to the need to revisit judges' goals and the role of audiences on judicial behavior. If judges modify their behavior to get promoted, perhaps they also alter it when speaking to different legal audiences. For example, do they modify their behavior or their opinion language when they rule on cases the public will read? Might doing so allow them to shape public perception of the courts and judicial legitimacy? Do judges behave or speak differently when dealing with Congress, or with professionalized state legislatures? And how do these dynamics shape or fit within larger judicial goals? These are important questions that future research efforts should address."
"50","Circuit court judges behave differently when auditioning for promotion. This is not a private audition, however. Indeed, the behavior we observe could have broad consequences for legal policy and collegiality on the circuits. Consider, first, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Throughout our sample, many contending judges sat on the D.C. Circuit. It is entirely possible that the D.C. Circuit observed significant doctrinal change as a consequence of judges vying for elevation. Consider, further, the consequences for collegiality on the circuits. When Supreme Court vacancies arise, we observe more dissents from contending judges. Dissents might lead to a breakdown in collegiality as well as uncertainty and conflict in the law. Further, one wonders whether noncontending judges discount the opinions of contender judges in vacancy periods."
"51","On a broader, policymaking level, these findings call into question a number of judicial appointment reform proposals. One such reform proposes to institute term limits on Supreme Court justices (Calabresi and Lindgren 2006). Under this proposal, a vacancy would arise on the Supreme Court every two years. With more vacancies on the Supreme Court, though, there would be an increasing number of vacancy periods and, consequently, more possibility for circuit judges to modify their behavior for elevation. The end result of this dynamic could be the instability of circuit doctrine and more conflict precisely for the reasons outlined above. At the same time, our results suggest that policy makers should be highly skeptical of judicial behavior during vacancy periods. If these judges change their behavior to look more suitable—and are less than sincere when so doing—their selection might come with considerable costs. Certainly, presidents do not select judges simply because of their behavior during vacancy periods alone, and we do not argue that the vacancy period is the only period of behavior that matters to nominating presidents. But when the decision among potential nominees is close, and presidents look for behavior that tips their decision, they might consider studying the behavior of judges outside vacancy periods.         "
"52","In the end, then, the data show that judges seeking promotion to the High Court change their behavior to get nominated. By courting the president, they hope to increase their odds of elevation. These results underscore the need to examine more closely the goals judges hold and the role of audiences in judicial decision making. By understanding the various goals judges hold and the conditions under which those goals are more or less operative, we will understand judicial behavior and legal development more fully."
