"1","The growing literature on the effect of minority descriptive representation (e.g., Black officeholders representing Black constituents) demonstrates that while non‐minority representatives tend to positively respond to minority constituent policy preferences, minority legislators provide an additional level of substantive representation for minority constituents. These “substantive” differences (Mansbridge 1999; Pitkin 1967) are often cast in terms of behavior in office and are measured in a variety of ways (see Cameron, Epstein, and O’Halloran 1996 and Grose 2005 for concise reviews of the different ways scholars have operationalized substantive representation). The most often employed measure of behavioral difference is some indicator of legislative preference, either votes on specific bills that are considered important to minority voters (Baker and Cook 2005; Canon 1999; Epstein and O’Halloran 1999, 2006; Hero and Tolbert 1995; Hutchings, McClerking, and Charles 2004; Overby and Cosgrove 1996; Swain 1993; Welch and Hibbing 1984; Whitby and Krause 2001) or ideology scores estimated from a more general voting pattern (Casellas 2009; Griffin and Newman 2008; Grose 2005; Lublin and Voss 2003; Preuhs and Gonzalez Juenke 2011; Whitby and Krause 2001). The evidence for minority substantive representation using these dependent variables is fairly strong, even in studies where it is discounted as inefficient and ineffective in the aggregate (Cameron, Epstein, and O’Halloran 1996; Canon 1999; Epstein and O’Halloran 1999; Hero and Tolbert 1995; Kerr and Miller 1997; Lublin and Voss 2003; Swain 1993).         "
"2","The evidence of representative behavior that is not roll call related leads to the similar conclusion that minority representatives are behaviorally different than their counterparts. Minority legislators are more likely to sponsor legislation that is deemed important to African American and Latino voters (Baker and Cook 2005; Bratton 2006; Bratton and Haynie 1999; Canon 1999; Haynie 2001), they are associated with mobilization of minority voters (Barreto 2007; Barreto, Segura, and Woods 2004; Gay 2001; Hajnal and Troustine 2005) and with changes in constituent attitudes about government (Griffin and Newman 2008), and they even tend to better match minority preferences than non‐minority lawmakers (Griffin and Newman 2007, 2008). Black and Latino representatives are generally more consistent supporters of legislation that is deemed important for minority voters, and typically further to the left ideologically than non‐minority officeholders (Griffin and Newman 2008).         "
"3","While the evidence supporting substantive “descriptive” representation is ample, the inferences we can draw from it are less certain. One empirical constraint facing all previous studies is that minorities are almost exclusively elected in near‐majority or majority‐minority districts; thus, separating minority legislator from minority constituency effects in substantive models is confounded by multicollinearity issues (Grose 2005).2 Moreover, non‐minority legislators tend to represent districts with nominal minority populations. Thus, the effects of minority descriptive representation and minority district population may be driven in part by population estimates biased by sample limitations. Whitby and Krause put the multicollinearity problem in stark terms: “This dilemma hampers all other research on this topic” (2001, n. 27).         "
"4","These sample limitations lead to the persistence of the question: Are minority representatives different because they represent different districts, or does the unique effect persist even after controlling for constituency characteristics? If it is the former, then these representatives are ideologically replaceable. Indeed, this is how some prominent researchers treat minority legislators. Carol Swain (1993) is the most well‐known proponent of comparing non‐minority Democrats to their minority counterparts, concluding that ideological representation is primarily done by co‐partisans (Democrats of any color) and secondarily by responsiveness to Black constituents.3 According to this argument, minority legislators are mostly different because they represent different districts than non‐minority partisans, and thus they are ideologically replaceable with White partisans. Subsequent research apparently bolsters the constituency‐based arguments. Cameron, Epstein, and O’Halloran (1996) find that substantive representation is generally due to Black constituency changes, and that these effects dwarf minority legislator outcomes in most parts of the country. Hero and Tolbert (1995) and Kerr and Miller (1997) find similar evidence for Latinos. Indeed, it is difficult to find research devoted to this topic that does not find both minority constituency and partisan representative effects (Baker and Cook 2005; Epstein and O’Halloran 1999, 2006; Griffin and Newman 2008; Lublin and Voss 2003; Overby and Cosgrove 1996; Welch and Hibbing 1984; Whitby and Krause 2001).4"
"5","While it is not surprising that scholars find strong partisan effects dominating the substantive models,5 the broad inferences discounting separate minority effects are particularly odd in light of the large and consistent bivariate differences found between minority and White partisans in these same studies (Cameron, Epstein, and O’Halloran 1996, 802; Kerr and Miller 1997; Swain 1993, 18; Welch and Hibbing 1984, 332). This empirical complexity motivates the argument that minority legislators are either replaceable, not substantively important relative to White partisans, or costly in the aggregate even if they are slightly more minority‐representative.         "
"6","The competing views of the dominance of constituency versus legislator effects parallel the traditional trustee and delegate nature of American geographic representation. Minority representatives act like delegates in the sense that they respond predictably to the presence of variable district constituencies (Baker and Cook 2005; Griffin and Newman 2008). These same representatives might also act like trustees, however, when, regardless of the district makeup, there appears to be a minority‐preferred or left‐leaning pattern that is only captured by their co‐racial or co‐ethnic status. Comparable to this trustee/delegate split is the argument that minority representatives can provide dyadic and/or collective representation (Griffin and Newman 2008; Hero and Tolbert 1995; Kerr and Miller 1997; Weissberg 1978). Dyadic representation resembles delegate or constituency‐based representation, while collective representation may take place regardless of (or in addition to) district preference variation. Turning the tables on (and paraphrasing) Griffin and Newman's explanation of collective minority representation, a minority representative may behave differently than a White Democrat or Republican in the same district context because they believe they are also representing minorities outside of their district (2008, 61–62; Kerr and Miller 1997; see also Gay 2007; Tate 2003; Whitby 1997). This behavior will not correlate with district context, but instead will be evident via legislator characteristics.         "
"7","The current literature, nonetheless, is less equipped than many suggest to disaggregate the effects of district context from descriptive representation. Whether limited to a small number of legislative chambers, or failing to account for important controls, there is still a good deal of uncertainty regarding the delegate versus trustee roles of representatives of minority constituents. To extend the empirical basis of the evaluation of the effects of descriptive representation and constituency, a research design and appropriate data that overcome some of the inherent problems in congressional‐level and small‐N state studies are needed. In particular, a more robust test of minority descriptive representation would be based on comparisons between White and minority legislators in similar contexts while avoiding dissimilar samples on which effects are estimated. For instance, empirical models should evaluate the effect of descriptive representation within majority‐minority districts—a design that is not possible in most studies due to the rare event of a non‐minority lawmaker representing such districts. And, constituency and legislator effects should be estimated based on representatives from large (or majority) minority population districts to avoid the bias produced by districts where White legislators represent almost no minority constituents. This is an obstacle in the current literature due to data limitations. Below we introduce a dataset and analysis that overcome these problems by extending the study of representation to all 50 state legislatures in a unique and far‐reaching examination of the issue."
"8","To more clearly and rigorously test the arguments of the trustee and delegate models of minority representation, we turn to state legislative district data, the characteristics of the lawmakers representing these districts and their voting behavior. Using state legislators and their districts as the units of analysis provides important benefits. First, unlike the U.S. Congress, there is a good deal of variation across the states in terms of the key variables of Black and Latino representation, their legislative record, and district characteristics. Second, state legislatures are understudied given the centrality of state power over a variety of important policies. Finally, no published work has looked at state legislative voting the way that we do here, comparing all state legislators in the United States using relative measures of roll‐call ideology (NOMINATE scores). We believe our results can be reliably contrasted with results of studies done in Congress using a single chamber (Cameron, Epstein, and O’Halloran 1996; Canon 1999). The sample is comprised of demographic, political, and economic characteristics from all state legislative districts in the 50 states in 1997 (both upper and lower chambers), with representative votes coded for the 1999–2000 legislative sessions. The sample covers 99 legislative chambers, roughly 7,400 total legislators (although a few cases are omitted in various analyses due to missing data), 187 Latino lawmakers, 587 Black legislators, over 70 non‐minority legislators from majority‐minority districts, and over 150 minority members who do not represent respective majority‐minority districts (see the supporting information for descriptive statistics on all variables). The amount of empirical leverage these data apply to questions of minority substantive representation is massive and unique, and allows for our analysis to rigorously test relevant hypotheses while avoiding the inferential pitfalls of sample limitations reflected in most previous studies.         "
"9","The data come from multiple sources. By compiling roll‐call votes for each legislator for all contested roll calls, Gerald Wright's (2004)Representation in the American Legislature datasets are used to construct NOMINATE scores for state legislators in the 1999–2000 sessions, as well as their partisan affiliation. Latino state legislators were coded from the National Directory of Latino Elected Officials published by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO 1999, 2000), and the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies’ database provided a means to code Black legislators. Constrained by this time period (1999–2000), district demographic data from 1997 are coded from the Almanac of State Legislatures (Lilley et al. 1999). Descriptive statistics for all measures are found in the online supporting information (SI).         "
"10","The key independent variables are the proportion of Latinos or Blacks in a district and the racial or ethnic background of the individual legislator. In addition, the analysis controls for the proportion of the population that is Asian, the unemployment rate, median household income, the overall population, the proportion of the population with some college education, and dummy variables for urban, rural, and suburban districts. These variables are common predictors of legislative behavior and are necessary controls often omitted in state‐level studies."
"11","Since the partisan makeup of the district may affect the behavior of legislators once in office, a measure of Republican strength is coded for each district. To correspond to our dependent variable of legislator ideology, the variable is a relative measure of the district's party orientation in that it captures the degree to which a Democratic or Republican legislator's share of the vote in the most recent election (1996 or before) deviates from the average Republican support within his or her respective chamber. Lower (often negative) values indicate that the legislator received more Democratic votes relative to his or her chamber, while higher (often positive) values indicate the legislator received relatively more Republican votes.6"
"12","While previous studies have employed a variety of dependent variables to capture minority substantive policy representation of legislators, we employ legislators’relative roll‐call ideology based on well‐known NOMINATE scores as the dependent variable to assess the impact of Latino and Black population and descriptive representation. Legislator roll‐call behavior is not a perfect measure of minority representation since there are a great deal of alternative legislative behaviors which may be used to advocate for minority interests, such as bill introductions, committee assignments, floor speeches, and constituent services. It is, nevertheless, a prominent and valid measure that reflects the generally consistent ideological differences between minority populations and White populations, and has been used to estimate differences across groups in a variety of settings (cf. Griffin and Newman 2008; Grose 2005; Lublin 1997). The measure also includes more votes for its estimates than interest group scoring, which in particular has been criticized for deviations from broader group interests (see Strolovitch 2007). Moreover, if minority representation is distinct from partisan and district correlates, it should be more difficult to model using a broad ideological estimate, thus biasing against finding substantive differences using this measure.         "
"13","To measure relative ideology, roll‐call data from the Representation in the American Legislature project (Wright 2004) are used to construct W‐Nominate scores for each member based on a scaling procedure for parametric unfolding binary choice data that is applied to the roll‐call votes for each legislator in the sample (Poole and Rosenthal 1997). In all of the states included in the analysis, a single ideological dimension dominated roll‐call decisions and was consistently explained by a Democratic‐Republican split. This first dimension is thus called the traditional left‐right, or liberal‐conservative, dimension and it serves as the focus for the analysis. All legislator scores were coded such that negative values indicated a more liberal (or Democratic) orientation while positive scores indicated a more conservative (or Republican) orientation within each legislator's respective chamber (the coding for Republican voting strength in the district correlates positively with this ideological measure).         "
"14","Since the raw Nominate scores for each legislator are appropriately applied only to estimate ideology within chambers, one cannot directly compare such scores for legislators across states. Instead, the benefit of Nominate scores is that they produce a uniform metric for ideology, from −1 to 1, within each chamber using a large number of roll‐call observations to more accurately measure broad ideological orientations. The uniform metric of Nominate scores allows us to estimate any legislator's ideological distance from a useful vantage point: the median legislator in the chamber. The dependent variable is the Ideological distance from the median legislator, which is the legislator's Nominate score minus the median Nominate score for the chamber. This distance measure is directional and thus indicates whether legislators are more liberal (negative values) or more conservative (positive values) than their respective chamber or party medians.7"
"15","Figures 1 and 2 plot the effect of different minority populations on the legislator ideological distance measure. Democrats (D) generally fall below the median (negative values) and Republicans (R) lie above the median (positive values)—a good sign for the validity of the ideological difference measure. Most Latino and Black Democrats (LD and BD) are found in districts that have relatively high proportions of Latinos and Blacks. They are also consistently positioned on the liberal (negative) ideological side of their chamber. These are the first ideological maps ever created of substantive representation and minority population variation in state legislatures. Despite different state contexts, a general partisan responsiveness to minority populations is observed. However, there is not an obvious relationship between minority population and ideological distance for either the Latino or Black representatives.         "

"17","Positive y‐values indicate more conservative members than their state‐chamber median, and more negative values indicate comparatively liberal members. White Republicans (R), White Democrats (D), Latino Republicans (LR), and Latino Democrats (LD) are displayed."

"19","Positive y‐values indicate more conservative members than their state‐chamber median, and more negative values indicate comparatively liberal members. White Republicans (R), White Democrats (D), Black Republicans (BR), and Black Democrats (BD) are displayed."
"20","There is, though, a significant difference between Black and Latino members and other legislators.8 To control for district effects on legislator ideology, we employ a multiple regression analysis with the directional distance for each legislator from their chamber median (each member's distance from the 0 point in the figures above) as the dependent variable. The key independent variables in Tables 1 and 2 are Latino population and Black population (constituency effects), as well as the party‐race/ethnicity of each member (member effects). These models also include the demographic and Republican strength variables discussed above, a dummy variable for Upper Chamber (1 = upper chamber), a dummy variable coded 1 if a legislator is a Member of the Majority Party, and the Nominate score for each Chamber Median. This last variable, the chamber's median raw Nominate score, controls for a ceiling effect since there is a possible tendency for standardized distances below the median to increase as the median reaches its upper limits in the sample. Finally, the percentages of Black and Latino members in each chamber are included to control for legislative bodies in which they make up a large percentage of the officeholders, thus potentially influencing the median of the chamber.         "
"21","We characterize responsiveness to minority constituents as other scholars do, as a “liberal” response to increases in minority populations, all else equal. Generally, we expect when looking at the entire sample that the average member will be significantly more liberal (negative ideological distance) when the Latino or Black population is higher. This is indeed what we find in the OLS regression results reported in Table 1. The coefficients for the main constituency variables, proportion Latino and proportion Black, are negative and significant. The presence of more Latino or Black voters is associated with more liberal representatives overall, regardless of the party of the member or any other relevant characteristics in the district.         "
"22","Descriptive representation is addressed with five categories of representatives, which allow us to distinguish between the effects of descriptive representation and minority population size and overcome the empirical design problems in studies of Congress or individual state legislatures. The five categories are Democrats (non‐Latino, non‐Black), Latino Democrats, Latino Republicans, Black Members, and Republicans (non‐Latino, non‐Black). White Democrats serve as the baseline group, and each of the remaining groups are coded as dummy variables. After controlling for district population characteristics, Latino and Black Democrats remain significantly more liberal than their White partisan counterparts. Latino Republicans, however, are no more liberal than their co‐partisans (an F‐test for equity in their coefficients could not reject the null). These results are noteworthy in part because none of the effects of the general political control variables, nor the effects of minority population variables, can account for the independent effects of the race or ethnicity of Democratic state legislators on their ideological orientation.         "
"23","In terms of the validity of our dependent variable, the results for the control variables in Table 1 are important in that there are few surprises, if any. As would be expected, strong Republican districts have members who are more conservative than their chambers. Districts with higher median incomes are also associated with more conservative members, while urban districts and those with higher education levels are associated with more liberal members. These findings validate the dependent variable in strong terms by revealing district effects that are consistent with prominent theoretical predictions.         "
"24","The models also account for a good deal of variation in the dependent variable (R2= .78), leaving little room for a measure of a member's race/ethnicity to exert an effect. Yet, the effects of descriptive representation are quite large. In Figure 3, the standardized effects of the main independent variables of interest are displayed alongside one another to provide some comparison of the relative impact of each of the factors. The effect size of Latino Democrats and Black Democrats is comparable to, or surpasses, the first and second standard deviation effects of all of the other representative covariates, with the exception of party affiliation (which dominates all of the models as expected; see the SI for additional graphics).         "

"26","*Estimates based on the results displayed in Table 1 for the full sample, except for Black and Latino Maj‐Min district effects. Overall partisan effects dominate the models (see Table 1) and are presented in graphical form in the SI (Figure 5).                     "
"27","While the above results provide a general evaluation of the effects of legislator and constituency effects, one key benefit of the current dataset is that it allows for more restrictive samples to directly compare minority legislators to White legislators, specifically in the instances where those from the same party represent similar constituencies. If the replaceable thesis is correct, then co‐partisans of any race/ethnicity should be similar. And, if differences are found, the results pass a level of rigor that is impossible to implement using previously available data."
"28","To further assess the validity of the results presented in Table 1, we evaluate models of legislator ideology estimated from five subsamples: Republicans; Democrats; White Democrats; Majority‐Minority Districts; and White Democrats in “Mixed Districts” and Minority Democrats. The results of these separate analyses are displayed in Table 2. The Republican sample reveals that Republican minority members are not significantly different from other Republicans. African Americans and Latinos are, however, significantly more liberal than other Democrats after controlling for all other variables (column 2's Democrats model). Further, both Republicans and Democrats are generally responsive to Latino and Black population differences, reflecting much of the work in this area. Democrats and Republicans are also substantively responsive to other political variables, and all in the anticipated directions. Members from urban, highly educated districts are more liberal in both parties, while Republican members are more conservative in high‐income districts.         "
"29","The data prove to be most valuable, however, by allowing even more proximate contextual comparisons, such as limiting the sample to White Democrats that represent “mixed” or majority‐minority districts. This is prohibitively difficult to do at the congressional level of analysis, which is why the results reported in columns 2 (Democrats) and 3 (White Democrats Only) where the sample is limited to White Democrats are extremely important. The constituency hypothesis asserts that any representative of a majority‐minority district will be more liberal than his or her co‐partisans because voters in these districts induce responsive liberal behavior no matter the race/ethnicity of the legislator. The dummy variable majority‐minority districts White Democrats enables us to test this hypothesis, as it captures White Democrats from such districts (72 out of 3,213 White Democrats represent majority‐minority districts). The variable is statistically insignificant, and the coefficient is small and opposite the expected direction. If minority representatives, who reside predominantly in majority‐minority districts, are policy replaceable, then White Democrats in these same contexts should exhibit significantly different policy behavior as well. They do not. These majority‐minority district White Democrats look more like other White Democrats than they do minority representatives.         "
"30","How big are the differences between Black and Latino representatives and the representatives who would most likely replace them (White Democrats from similar districts)? Column 4 (Majority‐Minority Districts Only) displays results of models with all Democratic representatives in majority‐minority districts (N = 679), and this subsample is enlarged to include Democrats from mixed districts as well in column 5 (White Dems in “Mixed” Districts & Minority Dems). These two groupings allow for the strictest tests possible for differences between minority members and the legislators to whom they are most often compared. The differences persist and are as large as those found in the full sample; indeed, in majority‐minority districts the differences are larger. These representative effects are plotted in Figure 3 in gray. Not only are Latino and African American representatives generally irreplaceable, but they are also particularly dissimilar in the legislative contexts in which they are most likely to hold office. In short, the selection process, or the types of representatives elected in near‐majority or majority‐minority districts matter a great deal.         "
"31","Are minority representatives different? The results of this study indicate they are, and in doing so they validate much of the past research on descriptive representation. With unprecedented sample size and variation in the dataset of state legislators, we are able to demonstrate that minority representatives not only respond to minority populations (as do White representatives), but they also express additional ideological variation that is unique to their racial/ethnic background."
"32","The key to this finding lies in the greater variability and subsequent leverage provided by focusing on state legislative districts rather than congressional districts. Unlike the very rare instance of minority members of Congress representing non‐majority‐minority districts or the equally rare set of non‐minority members of Congress representing majority‐minority districts, the sample allows for adequate degrees of freedom to examine several critical comparisons. In particular, the analysis demonstrates that not only do minority representatives add explanatory power to models of ideological orientation, but also that White legislators in majority‐minority districts do not. Thus, the analysis reveals that delegate‐style representation does indeed describe the representational roles of both White and minority lawmakers, but minority representatives add a level of representation that resembles the trustee model for minority interests. This characteristic is not evident among White lawmakers, even those from similar district contexts. This is an important confirmation of one of the mechanisms for the substantive representation of minority interests in legislative settings. Moreover, these findings hold not only for Blacks, a relatively cohesive political demographic, but also for Latino representatives."
"33","One implication of the results is that scholars need to incorporate both trustee and delegate behavior in their theoretical and empirical models of descriptive representation. One important application of this insight is a call to expand the set of factors used in districting schemes that attempt to make trade‐offs in districts where minority constituents can influence the behavior of their legislator while potentially sacrificing influence in the aggregate chamber (Lublin 1997). The findings provide new and confirmatory evidence that White Democrats are not replacements for minority lawmakers. It is not simply a matter of trading descriptive representation for minority influence in districts represented by White lawmakers. White lawmakers are ideologically different from minority lawmakers, with the latter not only providing responsiveness, but also acting as trustees for minority interests.         "
