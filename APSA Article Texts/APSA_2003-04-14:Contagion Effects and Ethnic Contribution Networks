"1","Although the idea that the patterns behind campaign contributions have a spatial component has scarcely been tested empirically, the reasoning behind why contributions would exhibit a spatial pattern is not lacking. Some of these reasons are spatial (i.e., attributable to geography), while others are aspatial (i.e., attributable to non‐geographic components such as income). For instance, one reason why campaign donations would exhibit a spatial pattern is that campaigns are strategic but have limited resources, and so attempt to allocate these resources wisely. This may mean that a candidate will focus on specific media markets, bombarding the campaign battlegrounds while leaving air time in another part of the country relatively barren. Because this courting is geographically definable, donations may appear to be rolling in in geographic clusters rather than emerging as random, independent events across the United States."
"2","As well, candidates may appeal to specific electoral groups. For instance, it is well known that minority groups (especially blacks and Latinos) tend to favor Democratic candidates. To the extent that these ethnic groups are segregated, whether voluntarily or not, geographic clustering of behavior may again appear. Similarly, Asian Americans tend to reside in clusters. If a candidate is especially attractive to or adept at courting minorities, his set of campaign donations will appear to have some spatial structure, even though the mechanism creating that structure is not a spatial process per se, but is, rather, connected to the dispersion of the minority population."
"3","Alternatively, simple proximity to others exhibiting a certain type of behavior may also be a factor. Social networks may develop in response to “mobilization” so that active solicitation of donations by a candidate has spillover effects via the formation of networks (Putnam 2000; Weatherford 1982). Campbell et al. (1960) identify two factors, community identification and perceived community standards, that serve as the basis for an explanation of community influence. An idea behind this literature is that the initial impetus may be an individual action or a neighborhood fundraiser that then, through social interaction, diffuses to neighboring areas and emerges as a spatial pattern.         "
"4","Lastly, since money is involved in campaign donations and financial donations are not obligatory, income level always emerges as an obvious explanatory variable. Indeed, research on the origins of campaign donations often focus on socioeconomic factors such as age, education, and income. Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995) single out income as “overwhelmingly, the dominant factor” in political contributions. According to their analysis, “[e]ducation, vocabulary, and civic skills play no role” (1995, 361). Gierzynski (2000) concurs, stating that “a look at individual contributors reveals a disproportionate representation of those of higher socioeconomic status” (107). The Brown, Powell, and Wilcox study found that contributors “are generally white, male, well‐educated, affluent, and active in contributing at several levels of government” (1995, 49). Rosenstone and Hansen find that education is the most crucial resource in defining participation levels in various political acts with one exception, “[i]ncome—not education—is the most crucial resource for donations of money to political campaigns” (1993, 136).         "
"5","Socioeconomic variables, especially income, are, then, our chief candidates for aspatial explanatory variables that might be producing the spatial patterning that we observe. Certainly, education and income levels are found in clusters throughout the U.S. Whether the socio‐demographic variables are the sources of spatial patterning or if the patterns can be attributed to a more pure spatial process (such as a neighborhood effect) will be the focus of the modeling to follow, but it should be clear that there are many reasons why the campaign finance data may be spatially clustered."
"6","In short, there are many theories behind the dynamic of campaign contributions, both with spatial and aspatial roots that would result in clear spatial patterning. Notably, spatial explanations do not take away from the aspatial findings that have been proposed previously, since both sets of findings can be true simultaneously. There can be a spatial component that complements the nonspatial components. Alternatively, we may find that the spatial explanations comprise a greater proportion of the overall explanation than we had previously thought, i.e., the nonspatial components become less significant or even disappear when viewed in light of the spatial components. In the past, the nonspatial theories have received more attention but not necessarily rightly or justifiably so. The bias results more from a paucity of research in the spatial realm than from a lack of theories."
"7","The immediate goal here is to gain insight into how and why contribution patterns appear as they do across the country. Is there some type of spatial or time‐related pattern to the data or are these levels of political behavior solely attributable to decision making that occurs outside simple geography. If the decision‐making process is mostly a function of individual traits, then in a unit‐level analysis of donation levels, covariates such as partisanship or income levels might be significant predictors, but the spatial parameters should not be significant in the model specifications that control for these covariates. On the other hand, if the contribution dynamic is primarily a diffusion process, driven by network or neighborhood effects, then the spatial lag will be significant, while the socioeconomic indicators will not be significant."
"8","It may also be the case that the patterns can be explained by elite political mobilization, driven perhaps by candidate appearances. Since this analysis does not incorporate a variable such as candidate appearances, if the spatial patterning were the result of this unmeasured variable, the spatial error model would be a relevant spatial specification, and the fit of the spatial error model or evidence of remaining spatial error dependence should provide evidence for or against a mobilization theory. Alternatively, and perhaps most likely, the effect may be a combination of the (measured and unmeasured) spatial and aspatial sets of variables. So, there may be “neighborhood effects” as well as effects that are more directly and narrowly connected to individual characteristics and elite tactics. It is important to note here that the specific mechanism that produces the spatial patterns is unknown and not determinable via the spatial analyses that are employed here. What we can uncover are patterns that are consistent with the specific mechanisms that produce the contribution patterns that we observe.         "
"9","The focus of this study is on ethnic contribution networks, specifically, Asian American contribution networks. Akin to the literature on campaign finance behavior, little is known about ethnic contribution networks. In the minority realm, as in the nonminority realm, research has focused on individual‐level decision making. For Asian Americans, the impetus behind the contribution dynamic also has roots in socioeconomic factors. One large difference is the importance of ethnic cues and ethnic candidates (Cho 2001, 2002). These factors are, again, based on individual traits, not on social context or contribution networks. In this sense, the research presented here complements and augments the vast literature that has amassed on political behavior and minority political behavior. Individual effects are considered, but alongside the context in which individuals find themselves.         "
"10","The data for this project are from the FEC (1980–1998). The database includes contributions to candidates for federal office as well as PACs and party organizations. The specific data for this article include a subset of these data: all contributions from Asian American donors.12 The Asian American group is perhaps the only group that can be reasonably identified solely by name and so the only group that can be extracted reliably from the FEC data.12 Since this smaller data set is still quite large (over 65,000 observations), there is not much lost in asymptotics.12"
"11","An important feature of the FEC data is that they are objective whereas surveys rely on self‐reported accounts, which may limit the generalizability of the analysis.12 There are two main drawbacks to the course taken here. First, the analysis is conducted at the level of a geographic unit rather than at the individual level. This does not take away from the spatial component and the ability to evaluate spatial effects, but only the inferences that we can gather about individuals. Second, because the FEC data are not rich in variables as surveys often are, we can observe and model the spatial patterning of contributions, but an extensive study of contributor motives is not possible.         "
"12","To perform a spatial analysis, one needs data units that are geographic. Accordingly, the unit of aggregation here is the zip code, and all of the FEC data have been aggregated to the zip code level. The zip code level was chosen because the it is the lowest level of aggregation for which we can obtain data from both the Census and the FEC.12 In this analysis, the dependent variable is the amount in contributions received from Asian ethnic groups (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese).12 The independent variables are from the U.S. Census (Census STF3b file), and have been merged to the FEC data. The independent variables include several measures of socioeconomic status, including income, education, and age. The income variable is the median income in the zip code, measured in $10,000s. The education variable is a 7‐category variable that measures the mean educational attainment. The age variable is a 5‐category variable that measures the mean age in the zip code. Also available from the census is total population in a zip code12 and the percentage of the zip code that various groups (such as Asian Americans, blacks, and Latinos) comprise.         "
"13","The first step in a spatial analysis is to determine whether there is any spatial autocorrelation in the data at all. Accordingly, we want to test the null hypothesis of spatial randomness against the alternative hypothesis of spatial autocorrelation. Spatial autocorrelation occurs when values of a certain variable are systematically related to their geographic locations. That is, there is some relationship between the levels of donations in neighboring area. Evidence of such a relationship would support the spatial theories. If the spatial autocorrelation statistic is statistically significant, however, further analysis needs to be conducted to determine the source of the autocorrelation. The Moran's I statistic (Moran 1948; Cliff and Ord 1973) is the most commonly employed method of assessing the significance and/or degree of spatial autocorrelation in the data (Cliff and Ord 1981). A positive and significant Moran's I indicates spatial clustering of contribution amounts. Specifically, the Moran's I statistic is               "
"14","We can see from Table 1 that the global Moran's I statistic is highly significant for every year of the FEC data.12 However, note that even if the pattern seems to be spatially clustered, the pattern of contributions may, in fact, be spatially random, driven simply from clustering of demographic traits such as income. So far, we have only observed spatial patterns. We cannot yet make any claims about why these patterns occur, because we have not conducted any analysis of this type. We have simply surmised that the pattern of contributions, without controlling for any variables, is not random.12 We will explore the source of the spatial dependence in the spatial regression models to follow.            "
"15","We can obtain a more detailed look at spatial autocorrelation by examining the local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) statistics (Anselin 1995). This local Moran statistic is closely related to the global Moran's I statistic. Specifically, the local Moran's I statistic is               "
"16","Two observations are immediately obvious from this set of plots. The first observation is that the number of sites where contributions originate generally increases every two‐year cycle. An examination of the data indicate that the sheer number of contributions generally increases every election cycle as well. We can see this graphically in the plot on the left in Figure 1. So, as a group, Asian Americans are becoming increasingly active in this form of political participation. The number of contributors is rising and their geographical diversity is growing. Second, more observations have significant LISA statistics at the end of the time cycle than at the beginning. In other words, with each passing election cycle, more observations are correlated with their neighboring values, giving one more reason to explore possible diffusion effects. We can see this graphically in the plot on the right of Figure 1. The dotted line in this plot indicates that despite the clear rise in both the sheer number of significant observations and the clear upward swing of the numeric base of correlated values, the percentage of all LISA statistics that are significant in a given year does not change dramatically over time.            "
"17"," LISA Statistics and Rise in Contribution Activity The plot on the left shows the rise in the sheer number of contributions and the rise in the number of sites where contributions originate. The plot on the right shows a rise in the number of significant LISA statistics each year and the relatively stable percentage of significant LISA statistics.                        "
"18","If we make the leap to assume that the spatial autocorrelation is more likely to originate from donors who have resided in the U.S. for a longer period of time, because they have simply had more opportunities to integrate into a neighborhood structure, the patterns in the LISA statistics might implicate some themes in the literature. For instance, there may be evidence for the idea that newly arrived immigrants behave uniquely relative to those who have resided in the U.S. longer because their incentives and cost structure differ significantly (Cho 1999; Wong 2000). Relatedly, others have argued that one's stake in the political system and thus one's level of political participation rises concurrently with the amount of time an immigrant is in the U.S. (Uhlaner, Cain, and Kiewiet 1989). For Asian Americans, then, the continuous rapid flow of immigrants serves to supply a constant set of new immigrants to the mix as well as to expand the base of potential contributors. The rising number of significant LISA statistics imply that these contributors are spatially related. This phenomenal growth shows no sign of yielding. The flow of Asian immigrants into the U.S. has been nothing short of dramatic in the last few decades. The growth in the number of contributors has almost kept this same phenomenal pace.            "
"19","It is clear from these census figures and the plots in Figure 1 that campaign finance is an increasingly pertinent arena for those interested in the political behavior of the most rapidly growing group in the U.S. With the passing of each election cycle, a growing number and a broader geographic mix of Asian Americans are engaging in this form of political participation. Perhaps more importantly, and more indicative of the sophistication behind this form of behavior, the spatial patterns imply that the web that underlies this form of behavior is growing in size as well as complexity.            "
"20","Given that we have significant spatial autocorrelation in our data, both on a global scale as well as a more local scale, as indicated by the Moran's I statistic and the large number of significant LISA statistics every year, the next step is to determine whether these spatial effects are true spatial effects, or if they are spurious, in the sense that they can be attributed entirely to patterns in other variables such as income or education. If we control for all of these other factors and the spatial variable remains significant, then we have evidence that the pattern is consistent with a “neighborhood effect”(via a spatially lagged dependent variable), or perhaps an elite mobilization effect (via an unmeasured mobilization variable), but not an effect that is solely attributable to socioeconomic characteristics of these areas. In other words, if contribution amounts are determined solely by the structural factors included in the model as independent variables, no remaining spatial patterning of contribution amounts beyond those resulting from socio‐demographic similarity of geographically‐proximate areas should remain."
"21","For the national data, the spatial dependence that appears in the contributions data may be modeled as a spatial lag model.12 The robust Lagrange Multiplier diagnostics for each of the years, excluding 1986, indicate that the spatial lag route would be profitable. In the spatial lag model, an otherwise routine regression has an additional regressor that takes the form of a spatially lagged dependent variable, Wy. That is, the spatial lag model would take the form               "
"22","The spatial lag model is most consistent with contagion theories and diffusion processes. The explicit inclusion of the spatial lag term implies that the influence of a “neighbor's” (as defined by the weights matrix) contribution amount is not an artifact of measured and unmeasured independent variables, but that the contribution amounts in neighboring areas actually increases the likelihood of campaign contributions in its neighbors. Note that the evidence of a diffusion or contagion effect is indirect. The spatial regression models cannot identify the specific mechanism that produces the spatial effects. Instead, the value added is that if the observed phenomenon were actually characterized by a diffusion process, then we would expect to see these spatial imprints emerge. The discovery of spatial effects, then, behooves future research to place some emphasis on uncovering the mechanisms that would produce diffusion.            "
"23","These data also exhibit qualities consistent with spatial heterogeneity as indicated by spatial Chow tests on the overall coefficient stability across regimes. In particular, we can see from Table 2 that a spatial Chow test indicates that observations in the West differed significantly from observations in other states for each election cycle beginning in 1988. Given the evidence of distinct spatial regimes, a disaggregated modeling strategy is pursued for these data. That is, we analyze separate models for each region and examine each of these models separately for evidence of spatial dependence. In addition, spatial Chow tests for the non‐western states also indicate that the states in the Northeast are significantly different from the other non‐western states for each of the years from 1988–1998, except 1990. These pockets of distinctive behavior are not surprising given our substantive inclinations about the Asian American group. The bulk of the Asian American population resides in the West, and proportionally, the West bears more than its share of campaign contributors. The Northeast bears many of these same qualities, but to a lesser degree.            "
"24","The models for the entire nation are reported in Table 2.12 The models for the other regions are displayed in Tables 3 and 4. Spatial lag models are indicated by a value for the spatial lag variable, while spatial error models are indicated by a value for the spatial error variable.12 In each of the tables, the column heading is the year indicator. The dependent variable is the amount in contributions received from Asian donors, and observations are zip codes.12"
"25","The results vary somewhat from year to year, but some consistent themes are evident as well. One implication of these patterns of change and stability is that the logic behind Asian American contributions is evolving, not static in this twenty‐year time period. Although one might prefer and expect an overarching story, the lack of a single story throughout this time period is not unusual and should not necessarily be expected given the phenomenal growth and compositional change that has characterized this time period for the Asian American group. Asian Americans have been arriving in droves only since the late 1960s, after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 eliminated racial quotas. One can hardly expect in some 15–30 years that they would have established deep‐set grooves of political behavior in an American system that was, until just recently, largely foreign to them. Integrating into the political mainstream certainly does not occur instantaneously (see e.g., Reedy 1991 and Glazer and Moynihan 1972), and so we should not expect that a group's political presence would appear instantaneously with its physical presence. Moreover, we would expect the establishment of a pattern of political behavior to follow later yet.            "
"26","The theme of change is one that has been uncovered by previous studies (Tam 1995; Wong 2000; Lien 2001). Indeed, as will see, several themes of the Asian American political behavior literature will be uncovered again, while some will appear to have changed. The difference is that spatial effects are explicitly considered here. The interplay between spatial effects and the traditional individual‐level variables affects the results. In some instances, the effects will be evident simultaneously. In others, one effect may dominant the others or negatively impact the others.            "
"27","Strikingly, the early patterns of contributions do not seem to be related to income. The lack of relationship here is surprising given the strong relationship between an individual's income level and campaign contributions that has been uncovered by more than one study (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Verba, Scholzman, and Brady 1995; Brown, Powell, and Wilcox 1995; Gierzynski 2000). In these data, the relationship between income and contributions does not appear to be established until the mid‐1980s. Once this pattern emerges, the analysis indicates that it persists. Although this relationship may not concur with the bulk of the literature on campaign finance, one must consider that the population bases for these previous studies have been comprised of primarily native‐born Americans. Variation on the native‐born/foreign‐born dimension in those studies was virtually absent and if present, not a primary concern in the analysis.            "
"28","These data, in contrast, are rich in variance on the nativity dimension, permitting us to catch a glimpse into the unfolding of the political incorporation dynamic. Hence, while the initial reaction to an insignificant income coefficient is somewhat surprising, some reflection on the context of these data mutes this initial reaction. Despite the oft‐heard claim that Asians contribute primarily because of their high income levels (Lew 1987), then, the evidence here implies that the dynamic is considerably more complex. The evidence for a contagion effect is becoming stronger with each passing election, implying that Asian Americans are becoming increasingly sophisticated political actors with more and stronger intragroup ties.12 As indicated by the significant income coefficient in later years, income levels may partly explain the behavior, but it is certainly not the sole determinant, and not even a significant part of the explanation in the earlier years.            "
"29","Another strong similarity between the results in the various regions is that the “Percent Asian” variable is significant and generally rising throughout. The only exception is in the “Other Regions,” where Asian Americans are also the most sparse. In the rest of the country, however, the main jump in values for this variable, as for the income variable, again occurs in the mid‐1980s, where the magnitude of the coefficients makes a clear rise to a new plateau. At this point, activity rises, and the organization of this activity becomes more evident. The basic interpretation of the coefficient on “Percent Asian” is that as the percentage of Asians in a zip code rises, so too do the dollar amounts that are donated by Asians from those areas. Note that this is not simply a function of a larger population base in some areas, since the model controls for differences in population. The effect is over and above the population effect. Hence, Asian Americans are at least as active as others in terms of donating, and far from passive in this form of political behavior. This effect is present even when the income effect is absent, so it is not necessarily related to socioeconomic factors."
"30","On more than one dimension, then, the confluence of a number of factors in the mid‐1980s seems to have signaled a silent “new age” for Asian American politics, one that gives credence to the claims that the Asian American group is a “sleeping giant.” The giant still appears to be in a state of semi‐slumber, but there is evidence that the giant is beginning to stir. Notably, the observed changes in the 1980s coincide with the appearance of the first significant numbers of Asian American candidates for political office.12 So the period of the 1980s for this group was indeed characterized by change on many political dimensions.            "
"31","The most notable difference between the results for various regions is that, in all regions except the West, as the percentage of other minority residents rises, there seems to be little to no effect on campaign contributions from Asian Americans. In the West, however, we can see from Table 3 that there is a significant and negative effect. So, on a national scale and in the non‐western states, after controlling for other variables, the dollar amounts that flow to candidates neither rises nor falls as the heterogeneity of the minority composition increased. In the West, the dollar amounts from Asian Americans decline in areas that are more ethnically heterogeneous. Hence, while there seems to be some ethnic contribution network at play among Asian Americans, this web of donations does not appear to cast itself more widely to include other ethnic groups on a national scale, and is negatively affected by other ethnic groups in the West. This result accords with much of the ethnic studies literature on political coalitions, namely, that Asian Americans do not generally align themselves with other minority groups to form a broader coalition (Saito 1998; Cho and Cain 2001; Lien 2001). The field of campaign finance, where Asian Americans are especially active, does not appear to be an exception.            "
"32","Interestingly, even after we control for socio‐economic and demographic factors, variables widely recognized to be influential, the spatial lag is still significant. This result holds for every year examined in the entire U.S. (except for 1986) as well as just the western region. The general pattern holds in the other regions as well. In the West, although the patterns among all of the variables is roughly the same, the magnitude of the spatial lag effect is larger and the models generally explain more variance in the data. It is not particularly surprising that the West would exhibit more spatial effects given that it has traditionally hosted and continues to host the bulk of the Asian American populace. The type of ethnic networks that we seek through the analysis pursued here are most likely to occur in locations where Asian Americans have resided the longest. As the length of time increases, there are more opportunities to integrate into the community as well as into the political scene."
"33","Moreover, as the size of the community grows, there are more opportunities and outlets to integrate into the community. Hence, what is surprising is the simple existence of spatial effects that is evident apart from the tried‐and‐true socioeconomic indicators. Contribution amounts, then, are not generated solely by the nonspatial structural factors that have been identified by earlier research. Given that these effects exist, the relative magnitude of these effects in the West and in the nation align with initial expectations. While some of these spatial lag effects may seem small initially, note that the dependent variable is dollar amounts. In this time span, Asian Americans have contributed millions of dollars. The spatial lag effects, in terms of proportion, has remained largely the same, but the dollar amounts have increased seven‐fold, and have regularly exceeded 7 million dollars in the 1990s. Thus, the effect is both substantively and statistically significant.12 These effects are also likely to be tempered because the Asian American group is considered as a whole here, but ethnic networks are likely to be stronger within the various ethnicities that comprise the larger group.            "
"34","The autocorrelated geographic patterns that we see in the models with significant spatial lag effects are typical of those patterns we might observe if contagion or diffusion effects were at play. People influencing people, and contributions begetting more contributions. Socio‐economic factors are also at play, but contrary to studies that examine only the atomistic actor outside of the context in which he resides, there is considerable evidence that contextual factors are also at play. The exact manner in which these webs operate is not clear from this analysis. However, we can see the emergence of the idea that candidates can tap into a ethnic contribution network."
"35","For some of the years in the national data, 1988–1998, diagnostics for the spatial model indicate that some spatial error dependence remains. In the data for the western region, there appears to be some remaining spatial error dependence in a few of the years as well (1990, 1992, 1998). The spatial effects in these years are more complex than in the years where the diagnostics indicate no remaining spatial error dependence. That these years are clustered toward the end of the time period examined appears to indicate again that the complexity underlying the contribution dynamic is growing. In earlier years, the spatial lag was sufficient.12 Because there are remaining spatial effects in these latter years from some unmeasured variable or variables, it is more difficult to expound on the origins of the spatial patterning. There seems to be some effect that can be captured via a spatial lag (i.e. an effect consistent with a diffusion process), but also some effect that may be, perhaps, consistent with a political mobilization or candidate effect story, where the variable (or variables) that measures these effects are not included or perhaps not available. Exploring these additional sources of spatial patterning and the mechanisms that may be lurking beneath these spatial patterns is an obvious extension of the analysis presented here. In general, fit statistics and diagnostics indicated that the spatial lag model was more appropriate, although some spatial error dependence did remain in several of the years. In the Northeast, the spatial error model was more appropriate for two of the years. The evidence, then, seems more consistent with a contagion effect than a mobilization effort, though there is some evidence of a mobilization effect as well. In any case, these data are complex on the spatial realm, with manifestations of many forms of spatial effects, from lag dependence to error dependence to spatial heterogeneity.            "
"36","Donation rates across the country vary. Most of the analysis of these rates, however, have focused on the individual actor, acting within his own realm, making decisions based upon his own personal resources. For instance, past research has suggested that socioeconomic factors figure prominently in the decision to contribute (Sorauf 1988; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Verba, Scholzman, and Brady 1995; Brown, Powell, and Wilcox 1995; Gierzynski 2000). In the Asian American context specifically, research suggests that socioeconomic factors are at play, but that ethnic cues are also important. In neither the research on minority nor nonminority groups is there a focus on social context and how that might affect the contribution dynamic.         "
"37","A central question in this article is whether the individual effects remain even after spatial effects are controlled. If the spatial lag is not significant, then we can explain the clustering of donation rates with covariates that measure individual characteristics. That is, “imitation” or diffusion through social networks cannot explain the clustering. Alternatively, if some clustering effect remains even after the covariates related to individual characteristics are controlled, then a diffusion process is likely to be a factor. As we saw from the analysis, spatial effects remain even after individual effects are controlled, implying that some type of diffusion force prominently underlies the Asian American campaign contribution network. In some of the later years, additional spatial error dependence remains, implying perhaps that some elite mobilization effort or candidate effect is fueling some of the spatial patterning. In either case, these spatial effects do not originate solely from the socioeconomic variables included in the model or completely within the realm of the individual‐level explanations offered by previous research. Clearly, context plays a role."
"38","By the end of the time span examined here, the patterns that we would expect to occur among the general populous manifest themselves among Asian Americans. Both the spatial lag as well as the socioeconomic indicators become significant predictors of geographical patterns of contributions. Whether these patterns will endure or how these patterns may morph in the future may be questionable, but the roots of the contextual effects have been laid. From the analysis presented thus far, we can see that the story is partly one of the atomistic actor acting alone, but it is also the story of the individual actor within the context of a more broadly defined neighborhood. In this way, the ethnic contribution network is nothing to balk. While less sophisticated political actors act alone, without a clear understanding of the immense benefits that arise from collective action, there is now evidence that Asian Americans are tending away from the less sophisticated individual‐level model, and toward a more complex and involved networked model of behavior."
"39","To be sure, Asian Americans bear some unique qualities as only one group of the polity. Nonetheless, the diffusion story likely underlies all of the campaign finance data and has broader implications for political behavior theories.12 Certainly the social context literature has already advanced these theories, and so empirical studies will not lag much further behind. Here, limiting the analysis makes it feasible. Although broad and varied theories of network and neighborhood effects are posited without matching empirical verification, this analysis begins to move in a new direction and gives gusto to the adage that context matters.         "
