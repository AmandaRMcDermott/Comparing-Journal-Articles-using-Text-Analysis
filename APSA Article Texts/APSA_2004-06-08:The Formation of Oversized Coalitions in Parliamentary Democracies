"1","As stated above, Riker (1962) argues that governing coalitions should always be minimum winning. Oversized coalitions would simply divide the perks of office among more actors than necessary. This intuition has resurfaced repeatedly in various theoretical treatments of policy making in parliamentary governments and other legislatures (Baron 1998; Baron and Ferejohn 1989; Van Deeman 1989). However, while the logic of minimal winning coalitions has remained robust, the empirical record has not supported its point prediction. Not only are more governments minority or oversized than minimum winning, but even early empirical work found that policy positions are more important than size in determining coalition formation in parliamentary democracies (Browne 1970; de Swaan 1973; Franklin and Mackie 1984; Taylor and Laver 1973).5 The following five theories all move beyond the minimum winning logic to explain the conditions under which nonminimum winning governing coalitions are formed.6"
"2"," Axelrod's (1970) theory of coalition formation starts with three not‐uncommon assumptions: (1) parties use office to seek policy goals; (2) preferences can be represented in one dimension; and (3) policy preferences are single‐peaked. Axelrod then makes one critical additional assumption: in pursuing policy goals, parties want to form governments that minimize the conflict of interest among the governing coalition members. That is, Axelrod assumes that a governing party's utility increases as the variance in policy positions among the governing parties decreases. This assumption means that parties prefer to form coalitions with other parties that are ideologically close to themselves, if at all possible. For example, consider five parties—Greens, Socialists, Liberals, Christian Democrats, and Conservatives—arrayed in a one‐dimensional policy space from left to right in the order listed. In Axelrod's theory, the Christian Democrats and Conservatives would rather form a governing coalition with Liberals than with Socialists. This result is intuitive and not in any way uncommon to other models of coalition formation.7 However, the attempt to minimize the coalition's variance in Axelrod's model also motivates the creation of certain types of oversized governments. In particular, even if the Conservatives and Liberals had enough seats together to form a government without the Christian Democrats, they still would include the Christian Democrats because doing so actually reduces the variance—or conflict of interest—within the governing coalition. More generally, Axelrod predicts that governments should consist of the most‐closely‐aligned, minimal set of parties possible while still ensuring that the governing coalition does not omit any parties located between two other governing parties. That is, governments should consist of minimum connected coalitions. Governments will be minimum winning when no excess internal parties are present and oversized when such parties are present and thus included.            "
"3","Like Axelrod (1970), Crombez (1996) starts by assuming parties are policy driven. However, there the commonality ends. Unlike Axelrod, Crombez assumes: (1) the policy space is multidimensional; (2) there are three parties in the parliament; (3) parties gain side‐benefits from being in government; and (4) those benefits can be divided among the coalition partners. Finally, Crombez also explicitly models the government formation process, focusing on the case in which none of the three parties controls a majority of seats. As he specifies the model, the largest party gets the first opportunity to propose a government and division of side‐benefits. That proposal is then either accepted or rejected. If accepted, a government forms. If rejected, any of the three parties can be randomly recognized—with the probability of recognition approximately proportional to party size—to propose a new government. Rejection of the second proposed government leads to a caretaker government in which all parties receive zero utility. Once a government is formed, any member of the coalition can provoke a vote of no confidence by withdrawing from the government. If the government is minority or minimum winning, a new party is recognized to attempt to form an alternative government. If the government is oversized, the formateur has an opportunity to reshuffle cabinet posts—i.e., reallocate the side‐benefits of being in office—before the vote in an effort to maintain majority support in the chamber. If the existing government does not survive and the newly proposed government is not accepted, a caretaker government is implemented.            "
"4","While the model may not characterize a number of configurations of parties in parliaments,8 it does produce very clean predictions. Specifically, Crombez finds that the bargaining position of the largest party is positively related both to its size and to its centrality in the policy space. The larger the party, the greater its chance of being recognized to make future proposals. The more central the party, the more extreme the other parties are in relative terms, and therefore the cheaper they are to buy‐off through side‐benefits (because they fear the formation of a coalition in the opposite extreme direction).            "
"5","For example, returning to the stylized party system described previously, suppose a 100‐member chamber is divided as follows: 35 seats for the Socialists, 25 seats for the Liberals, and 40 seats for the Christian Democrats. In this chamber the Christian Democrats have the advantage of getting to make the first proposal. However, what kind of offer they can make depends upon the size of their majority. The more seats they control, the larger the probability they get to make the counteroffer if their first one is rejected, and therefore the more self‐serving an initial offer they can make and have accepted. Moreover, the centrality of the Christian Democrats matters as well. Holding the distance between the Liberals and the Socialists constant, the more centrist the Christian Democratic Party is, the less it needs to offer a potential coalition partner in policy concessions. This is because the Christian Democrats can credibly threaten to form an even‐less‐attractive coalition with the other potential coalition partner if the offer is rejected."
"6","The model's findings directly motivate when we should observe minority, minimum winning, or oversized coalitions. When the largest party is sufficiently large and central, it can offer the smallest party no seats in government and get its support to form a minority government. When the governing party is only moderately large and/or somewhat central, it must offer the smallest party some seats in government, and with those seats the smallest party will remain in the minimum winning coalition for the duration of the government. And finally, when the largest party is too small and too extreme, it must offer seats to both opposition parties to maintain a stable government. Doing so ensures the stability of the government by creating a coordination game between the two smaller parties. Each individually would like to bring down the government once the government is formed, but each knows that unilaterally withdrawing from the government will not achieve this goal because there are enough votes to keep the government in office even if it does withdraw.9"
"7","Like Crombez (1996), Baron and Diermeier (2001) start from the notion that parties are bargaining over multidimensional policies and that they can divide the benefits from holding office. However, whereas Crombez's results arise from an elaborate government formation and stability game, Baron and Diermeier incorporate an election period and derive their results through “efficient proto‐coalition bargaining.” Their game is designed as follows.            "
"8","Based upon preferences over a multidimensional policy space, voters elect parties into a legislature. Assuming no single party gains a majority of seats, parties then bargain over forming a coalition government. If the parties in the proposed coalition all agree to form a government, and if they gain majority support in the legislature, then they enter a legislative phase in which they simultaneously agree upon how to divide the benefits from gaining office and pass a new policy."
"9","While both Crombez and Baron and Diermeier fundamentally see government formation as a bargaining process over policy and office perks, Baron and Diermeier derive very different implications from their model. Whereas Crombez determines explicitly that oversized coalitions are not a function of status quo policies, Baron and Diermeier find that oversized coalitions should only form when existing policies are rather extreme, as during a “crisis” situation.10"
"10","This difference arises because Crombez requires all side‐payments to coalition partners to be positive while Baron and Diermeier do not. That is, in both models, when parties form a government they negotiate over a division of some fixed pool of benefits. However, while in Crombez's model all parties must gain at least zero benefits, Baron and Diermeier's model allows negative benefits—the formateur party can keep all of the benefits from office holding and can extract additional payments from coalition partners. When the status quo is extreme, these added transfers create an incentive for a formateur to include surplus parties in its government. A surplus party will gain some benefit from the creation of a more moderate policy, and as a result the formateur can extract side payments from its coalition partners. The partners agree to this deal in the game because refusal yields a continuation of the status quo. Thus, for a very extreme status quo, the formateur selects an oversized coalition with a centrist policy in order to extract maximal side payments from as many parties as possible.            "
"11","To illustrate, return again to the generic party system defined previously. Suppose the Christian Democrats have the opportunity to propose a government. They have enough seats that they can control a majority with the Liberals alone, but they are considering whether also to include the Conservatives in an oversized coalition. Whether the Christian Democrats will include the Conservatives depends upon the current policies in place. If a center‐right coalition has been in office and set policy for the last decade, the Christian Democrats have little reason to include the Conservatives. However, this story changes if a leftist coalition has set past policy. Now the status quo will be relatively far from the preferences of the Conservatives, and the Christian Democrats can try to extract concessions from them. Effectively, the Christian Democrats can invite the Conservatives into government on the condition that the Conservatives give some benefits to the Christian Democrats. The Conservatives agree, not because they want to provide the rents, but rather because refusal means a delay in overturning the very undesirable status quo."
"12","The models of Crombez (1996) and Baron and Diermeier (2001) both assume parties are bargaining over a unique multidimensional ideological policy and some distribution of side‐payments. In contrast, Carrubba and Volden's (2000) model examines coalition formation from a logrolling perspective.11 There, we assume: (1) each bill provides benefits to a single party (or single legislator), (2) the costs of the bill are broadly distributed, (3) there are no side‐payments, and (4) policymakers interact repeatedly with the possibility of passing many of these bills.            "
"13","In the absence of majority party government, each party must rely on others to secure bill passage. Without side‐payments, the only currency available to legislators involves votes. Thus, groups of legislators may agree to form logrolls—or coalitions—in order to pass their bills. Importantly however, Carrubba and Volden do not allow precommitment in logrolls. Thus, each bill must be voted on independently and legislators who have their bills passed early on in the logroll then have an incentive to defect and not vote for others' bills subsequently. In fact, the only incentive for these legislators not to defect from the logroll is the fact that there will be future logrolls from which they do not want to be excluded."
"14","Carrubba and Volden find that the stronger the individual incentive to defect from the logroll, the larger the logroll will be. To understand the logic, consider first the case with minimal incentives to defect from the coalition. If the expected cost of being excluded from future coalitions is larger than the benefit of defecting from the present logroll, then minimum winning coalitions are expected. For the party proposing the coalition, adding members only increases the costs of the logroll. However, if the incentive to defect from a minimum winning coalition is too great, that same proposer will suggest an oversized coalition. To see why, consider a coalition containing one more party than minimum winning. Suppose the extraneous party's bill is passed and for a variety of reasons it would rather defect and be excluded from future coalitions than allow the remaining bills to pass. If the logroll were minimum winning, the coalition would collapse. However, because the logroll is not minimum winning, that party must enlist the help of a second party to bring down the coalition. This creates a prisoners' dilemma situation among the potential defectors. The two parties might like to bring down the coalition by not passing the remaining bills, but each also has an incentive to “defect” from the defecting group because doing so increases the chances of such a “double‐crossing” party being in future coalitions. Since adding more surplus parties increases the incentive to be a double‐crosser, the stronger the incentive to defect from the logroll, the larger the coalition proposed. The smallest coalition that will yield a stable logroll is what Carrubba and Volden label a minimal necessary coalition (MNC).12"
"15","For example, suppose the Socialists control enough seats to form a government with either the Greens or the Liberals, with each party hoping to secure its ideal policy in the policy area it finds most important. This presents the possibility for a logroll, with each party setting policy in a different policy area. Unfortunately, the Greens are far to the left, the Socialists are somewhat left, and the Liberals are actually a bit to the right. Thus, each finds the agenda of the others rather undesirable. In fact, each party would find passing the other parties' preferred policies quite costly. Thus, if the Socialists formed a minimum winning coalition with either party, whoever got their policies passed first would probably renege on the deal and bring down the government. Anticipating this problem, the Socialists invite both parties into government. While the Socialists now have to pass more policies that they do not really like, they are better off in total because the oversized government will successfully form and pass the package of policies, which includes the Socialists' ideal policy in the policy area of greatest salience to them."
"16","This finding yields a number of testable predictions. Carrubba and Volden predict that logrolls should be harder to sustain, and therefore coalitions are more likely to be oversized, when: (a) the number and diversity of actors in a legislative chamber is greater, (b) bills are harder to pass, and (c) legislation is more costly (or less beneficial). The more and the greater the diversity of actors, the more interests need to be satisfied in the logroll, and therefore the greater a party's incentive to defect upon passage of its desired legislation. The harder bills are to pass, the less benefit an actor is going to anticipate from being in future coalitions, and therefore the lower the expected cost of defecting. And, the more relatively costly legislation is, the more costly agreeing to other coalition members bills will be and therefore the greater the incentive to defect from the coalition.13"
"17","Two scholars, Lijphart (1984) and Sjölin (1993), posit one last simple, but highly plausible, motivation for why parties might choose to form oversized coalitions. Simply put, if parties care about passing policy through legislation, bicameralism can create an incentive for them to form oversized coalitions. A minimum winning coalition in the lower house that does not control a majority of seats in the upper house might choose to include additional parties for the express purpose of ensuring a majority in the upper chamber. For example, if the Liberals and Christian Democrats control enough seats in the lower house to form a government, but they do not control enough seats to also have a majority in the upper house, they might include the Conservatives in order to get that second majority. Thus, according to this conjecture, we should observe oversized coalitions in systems when: (1) an upper chamber has the ability to influence legislative outcomes, and (2) the governing parties cannot form a MWC that controls a majority in both the upper and lower houses.14"
"18","As can be seen from the above discussion, scholars differ in their views about what motivates politicians in parliamentary democracies. Such differences in motivation lead, in theory, to different conditions under which oversized coalitions are expected to form. In this section, we test the above five theories individually and jointly. Such an analysis not only helps us understand the formation of oversized coalitions, but also sheds light on the motivations of policymakers in parliamentary democracies more generally."
"19","Testing among these theories requires operationalizing a variable that appropriately captures coalition size. While Crombez (1996) predicts and tests across minority, minimum winning, and oversized coalitions, the remaining theories do not explicitly consider minority governments. Thus, consistent with past analyses (from Browne 1970, de Swaan 1973, and Taylor and Laver 1973, through Franklin and Mackie 1984, and through Warwick 1998), we code coalition size as a dichotomous variable that takes a value of zero if the government is minority or minimum winning and one if the government is oversized. An oversized government is defined as any coalition in which at least one party can be removed with the remaining members still controlling a majority of seats. We code these values for 24 parliamentary or semipresidential systems over the time span from 1955 to 1998.15 An observation is generated for each country based on the government in power at the end of each year. Further, if multiple governing coalitions form in a given year, each coalition is coded as an independent observation. Thus, there is at least one observation for each country in each year and occasionally more than one. To ensure that our findings are not sensitive to this coding decision, a separate analysis was performed when including only one government per country per year.16 As shown below, results are also robust to including one observation per government formed. We also confirmed that results are robust to including or excluding elections that resulted in majority parties—the results we report include these observations since there are instances in which oversized governments with majority parties occurred. Data descriptions and sources are given in the appendix.         "
"20","Independent variables are formulated to capture the conditions under which parties may be more or less likely to form oversized coalitions according to the theories described above. For many of the theories, doing so requires the ability to locate parties' positions (and sometimes status quo positions) within a common policy space. Both expert surveys (see Castles and Mair [1984] for a systematic analysis) and party manifestos data (see, for example, Kim and Fording 1998) have been used for this purpose previously. Consistent with recent research on coalition formation in parliamentary democracies (Martin and Stevenson 2001), we use Gabel and Huber's (2000) principal components approach to place all political parties studied through manifestos data over time on a common unidimensional left‐right scale.17"
"21","To test Axelrod's theory of minimal connected coalitions, we mimic the process by which such connected coalitions would come about. Starting with the formateur party, additional parties are selected to join the coalition based on their ideological proximity to the formateur party.18 This process of adding proximate parties continues until the coalition contains a majority of seats in the parliament. This creates a connected coalition approximately centered around the formateur. Such a coalition may or may not contain a small party internal to the coalition that is not needed for the coalition to maintain a majority of votes. If it does, this is the condition under which Axelrod would expect an oversized coalition. We create a dummy variable Expected Oversized Connected Coalition that takes a value of one when this hypothetical connected coalition contains a surplus party, and zero otherwise. Thus, if oversized coalitions are formed because governing parties desire connected coalitions, the coefficient associated with this variable should be positive and significant.            "
"22"," Crombez (1996) predicts that oversized coalitions should form when the largest party within parliament controls fewer seats and when that largest party is more ideologically extreme. We test this theory by including measures of the Percent of Seats Controlled by the Largest Party, and the Noncentrality of the Largest Party. Noncentrality is measured as the squared distance between the largest party's left‐right policy position and the centroid left‐right party position of the parliament.19 If Crombez is correct, the larger the percent of seats controlled by the largest party and the more central the largest party, the less likely an oversized coalition is to form. Thus a negative coefficient is expected on the Percent of Seats measure and a positive coefficient on the Noncentrality variable.20"
"23","The third set of predictions arises from the work of Baron and Diermeier (2001). They predict that oversized coalitions will form when the status quo policy is extreme relative to the preferences of the parliament's current members. Consistent with Baron and Diermeier's explication of their theory (2001, 938), we operationalize the status quo as the previous government's centroid left‐right position, to be contrasted with the current parliament's centroid left‐right position.21 The measure Status Quo Extremism is the absolute distance between these two numbers.22 If Baron and Diermeier are correct, the greater this distance, the more likely an oversized coalition is to form.23 A positive coefficient is anticipated.            "
"24"," Carrubba and Volden's (2000) logrolling theory predicts oversized coalitions under three conditions: (1) when a parliament is comprised of more and more‐diverse actors, (2) when bills are harder to pass, and (3) when legislation tends to be more costly or less beneficial to coalition members. The first prediction is that coalitions will be more oversized in legislative chambers comprised of more decisive actors. Because party discipline varies across systems (Laver and Schofield 1990, 15–35; Laver and Shepsle 1990b; Luebbert 1986; von Beyme 1983), different measures may be appropriate to different situations. In a political system with weak party discipline, the number of decisive actors can be measured by the Number of Seats—i.e., legislators—in parliament. In a political system with strong party discipline, the number of decisive actors is best measured as a function of the Number of Parties. Rather than make an arbitrary distinction between weaker and stronger party systems, we include both seat‐based and party‐based measures in the analysis. Each variable is expected to be positively related to the use of oversized coalitions.            "
"25","The second prediction from the logrolling model is that oversized coalitions are more likely when bills are harder to pass. This can happen for a number of reasons. Here we focus on one particular interpretation, that additional veto players make bill passage harder (Carrubba and Volden 2000, 2001). Veto players can take many forms, including independent bureaucracies, legal systems with judicial review, additional legislative chambers, and independent executives, among others (Tsebelis 1999).24 Because additional veto players only make bill passage harder when their preferences differ from the lower house, and because we are interested in variables that capture more than just country fixed effects, we test this hypothesis by including the variable, Bicameral with Upper and Lower House Divided. This measure is a dummy variable that takes a value of one if the largest party in the lower house differs from the largest party in the upper house. Where the largest parties are the same, or in unicameral systems, this variable takes a value of zero.25 If this theory is correct, this variable should be positively related to coalition size.26"
"26","The last proposition from the logrolling model is that oversized majorities are more likely when the legislation under consideration has a higher cost to benefit ratio—i.e., the legislation in some sense is less attractive. One possible approach to testing this hypothesis would involve measuring the costs and benefits of legislation bill‐by‐bill. However, this option is infeasible for at least two reasons. First, as a practical matter there is no realistic way to code all bills in all countries over many decades and place them on a comparable scale. Second, even if there were some way to do this, we would then have to make a number of judgment calls over which bills would be proposed as part of a potential coalition, and which would be considered superfluous. Thus, instead, we include two measures that allow us to tap into how costly and how beneficial bills are on average. The first measure is an indication of the Polarization of the legislative chamber. The more polarized the legislative chamber—measured by the weighted variance of left‐right positions among the chamber's parties—the more costly parties or individual legislators should find agreeing to each others' bills on average. For example, suppose Greens, Socialists, and Liberals are forming a government. As part of a logroll agreement, the Greens are going to get a piece of environmental legislation passed, the Socialists are going to get a welfare bill passed, and the Liberals are going to get a free‐trade bill passed. The more polarized the chamber, the more the Greens and Liberals will dislike each other's bills, and therefore the more costly they will find agreeing to one another's bills. Thus, the more polarized the chamber, the more costly passing a logroll in which every member must get something they want, and therefore the more likely an oversized coalition will be needed all else equal.27 The second measure is the percent of the economy controlled by the government, as indicated by a Taxes/GDP variable.28 The larger this ratio, the bigger the size of the pie being divided by members of parliament. The bigger the pie, the easier it should be for a set of parties to create a logroll that substantially benefits the coalition members while foisting the cost onto the opposition (Baron 1991), and therefore the less likely the government should be to include surplus members. Thus, if this theory is correct, we should observe a negative coefficient.            "
"27","Finally, Lijphart (1984) and Sjölin (1993) predict oversized coalitions when the MWC in the lower house is insufficient to generate majority support in the upper house. To test this hypothesis, we examine every possible MWC comprised of parties from the governing coalition in each government in each country. If no such MWC contains parties that control a majority in the upper house, this theory suggests that an oversized coalition is needed. We construct a dummy variable MWC Insufficient for Upper House Majority that takes a value of one under this condition. It takes a value of zero if no additional parties are needed beyond those in the MWC to gain an upper house majority, or if there is no upper chamber with substantial policymaking powers.29 A positive coefficient on this variable would support the Lijphart and Sjölin hypothesis.            "
"28"," Table 1 summarizes the theoretical arguments advanced to explain the use of oversized coalitions and notes the variables used to test these theories.            "
"29","As noted above, the form of the data analysis conducted here is a time‐series cross‐sectional analysis of a dichotomous dependent variable that takes a value of one for oversized coalitions and zero otherwise. We thus rely on a logit analysis. Given the data structure, concerns may arise regarding heteroskedasticity and time dependence. We rely on the “cluster” specification within Stata to account for both of these potential problems.30 The cluster procedure calculates Huber/White robust standard errors assuming independence in the cross sections and potential dependence within each country over time. As expected, compared to an assumption of each observation being independent, this procedure produces larger standard errors upon accounting for within country dependence over time. Initial results are reported in Table 2.         "
"30","The five models in the table analyze each hypothesized set of variables separately. Although each of these models is thus underspecified relative to the subsequent full model, they are included to allow us to describe the findings for each set of hypotheses separately before turning to the full analysis. They are also included to help demonstrate that the findings in the full model are not simply products of multicollinearity across these different hypothesized categories.31 Moreover, these individual models help us understand the interrelationships among the five theories examined here. Model 1 tests Axelrod's minimum connected coalition hypothesis. As can be seen, the coefficient is significant and positive, indicating that oversized coalitions are more likely when the expected connected coalition formed around the formateur party includes small internal surplus parties. Specifically, under the conditions when we would expect an oversized coalition based on minimum connectedness, the odds of an oversized coalition forming in reality increase by over 350%. Thus, consistent with previous studies and alternative approaches (Martin and Stevenson 2001), we find strong initial support for Axelrod's theory.         "
"31","Model 2 includes the variables constructed to examine the hypotheses advanced by Crombez's proposal power model. Percent of Seats Controlled by Largest Party has a negative coefficient, as suggested by the theory, and this coefficient is statistically different from zero. In particular, each additional percent of the parliamentary seats controlled by the largest party is associated with more than an 8% decline in the odds of forming an oversized coalition. The coefficient on the Noncentrality of Largest Party variable has a positive coefficient, but is not statistically significant (p = 0.80).32 However, for any theory represented by more than one variable, a suitable test of the theory as a whole is based on the joint significance of all variables included for the test. Here, a likelihood ratio test of joint significance indicates strong initial support for this theory (χ2(2) = 12.0, p < 0.01).         "
"32","Model 3 tests Baron and Diermeier's status quo extremism prediction. Here we find the Status Quo Extremism coefficient to be in the opposite direction from that predicted. That is, the larger the distance between the status quo and the centroid of this period's parliament, the less likely an oversized coalition is to form. However, the coefficient does not achieve statistical significance at conventional levels (p = 0.14). The initial evidence does not support the expectation from the Baron and Diermeier model."
"33","Model 4 includes five variables to test Carrubba and Volden's (2000) logrolling model. Both coefficients for the variables operationalizing the number of decisive actors are positive, as expected, although only one is statistically different from zero (p = 0.11 for the other, Number of Seats. Each additional party in parliamentary size is associated with a 64% rise in the odds of forming an oversized coalition. The Bicameral with Upper and Lower House Divided variable has a significant and positive coefficient, as expected. Such an arrangement is predicted to make legislative passage more difficult, thus forcing a greater reliance on oversized coalitions. Here, this arrangement is linked to a 10‐fold increase in the odds of forming an oversized coalition. The positive coefficient on the Polarization variable is as expected. A one‐standard‐deviation increase in Polarization is associated with a 45% rise in the odds of an oversized coalition. And finally, the Taxes/GDP variable has a negative coefficient, as anticipated, although it is not statistically significant (p = 0.21). Thus, all five variables have the predicted sign, three of the five are individually statistically significant, and the five variables are jointly highly significant (χ2(5) = 33.2, p < 0.001). This provides initial support for the logrolling approach to understanding coalition formation.         "
"34","Finally, Model 5 includes the dummy variable MWC Insufficient for Upper House Majority to examine Lijphart and Sjölin's hypothesis. Contrary to expectations, the coefficient on this variable is negative, indicating a lower likelihood of an oversized coalition when additional parties are needed for an upper house majority. This coefficient is not statistically different from zero, however (p = 0.18). Consistent with Druckman and Thies (2002), there is no support here for the Lijphart and Sjölin claim.         "
"35","The models presented in Table 3 simultaneously test the five alternative theories. Model 6 shows the results relying upon one observation per government per year, as used in Table 2. As can be seen, the results are fairly consistent with the findings from the first five analyses. First, there continues to be no support for Sjölin (1993) and Lijphart's (1984) upper house majority hypothesis or for Baron and Diermeier's (2001) status quo extremism expectation. In both cases, the relevant coefficients have the wrong signs and are insignificant. Second, support for Crombez's (1996) proposal power model remains, but now is somewhat more mixed. While the coefficient on Percent of Seats Controlled by Largest Party maintains its significance and has the predicted sign, the coefficient on Noncentrality of Largest Party now is neither significant nor of the expected sign.33 Third, support for Carrubba and Volden's (2000) logrolling model is even stronger, with all five coefficients now attaining statistical significance. Taken together, the joint significance of the five variables included to examine the logrolling theory becomes even stronger (χ2(5) = 274.0, p < 0.0001).34 Finally, Axelrod's Expected Oversized Connected Coalition variable's coefficient approaches zero and becomes insignificant. Why might this have happened? As described above, the minimum connectedness theory anticipates oversized coalitions when the connected coalition contains small superfluous internal parties. This is more likely when there are many parties and when the largest party is rather small. Thus, it appears that the significance of the Expected Oversized Connected Coalition variable in Model 1 arose because this variable served as a proxy for the party size and the number‐of‐parties variables in the alternative theories. Once we control for these other theories, the evidence suggests that oversized coalitions are not a result of governments seeking to minimize the variance in policy positions among the governing parties.         "
"36","Model 6 does a good job of explaining the existence of oversized coalitions.35 Moreover, it is worth emphasizing that these findings hold up under a number of alternative modeling specifications. The results are generally robust to restrictions of the dataset either to one observation per country per year (Model 7) or to one observation per government in the year that government was formed (Model 8). As can be seen in Table 3, this specification of one observation per government increases support for the Carrubba and Volden logrolling theory with respect to four variables, although the Taxes/GDP variable now loses statistical significance (p = 0.11). All variables maintain their previous signs, although MWC Insufficient for Upper House Majority and Noncentrality of Largest Party now attain statistical significance, providing stronger refutation of the Lijphart and Sjölin theory and lessening support for the Crombez theory.

"37","The results found in Table 3 are also robust to the inclusion of additional variables that allow the exploration of other explanations for oversized coalitions, ranging from fractionalization to antisystem parties, and from “vote buying” to varying rights of dissolution.36 Also, as noted above, the possibility that the observations were not independent within each country was controlled for by the cluster procedure in Stata.37Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998) offer an alternative approach that specifies the nature of this dependence to be a temporal dependence, as would be the case if the same conditions persist in a country over time and lead to the same types of coalitions being formed. As an alternative approach, and to test for robustness, we ran the models in Table 3 again, using the Beck, Katz, and Tucker natural cubic spline method and found very similar results.38 As a further alternative, we explored the full model with the generalized estimating equation (GEE) method, which did not substantially change most of the results, again yielding significant support for the logrolling theory, but now providing no support for any of the other four theories.39"
"38","Based on data from 24 countries over 43 years, this study focuses upon five prominent theories of coalition formation in parliamentary democracies. Taken as a whole, the data work most strongly supports Carrubba and Volden's (2000) logrolling model. It offers mixed support for Crombez's (1996) proposal power model, and no support for Axelrod's (1970) minimum connectedness theory, Lijphart (1984) and Sjölin's (1993) bicameralism conjecture, or Baron and Diermeier's (2001) status quo extremism hypothesis. These findings offer three implications worth highlighting.         "
"39","First, the models of Crombez, Baron and Diermeier, and Carrubba and Volden are, in many ways, quite similar. All three models focus on coalition formation as a way of achieving desired policy outcomes; all three are multidimensional; and all three incorporate some way of attaining majority support—Crombez and Baron and Diermeier via side‐payments and Carrubba and Volden via logrolling. What may be the critical distinction is the fact that both Crombez and Baron and Diermeier restrict passage to a single omnibus policy with side‐payments, while Carrubba and Volden require support on many bills over time. Indeed, all of Carrubba and Volden's predictions arise from the need to create a coalition that can sustain legislative cooperation over time when there is no precommitment. The empirical findings presented here suggest that coalition choice may be more a product of the need to create sustainable logrolls, than the need to sculpt a majority to support a particular multidimensional policy. Put simply, different parties want different things. When each party controls a minority of seats in parliament, no one party alone can pass its legislative agenda. Rather, each relies on exchanges with other members of parliament. Such exchanges may be institutionalized in the formation of a government, which may need to be oversized to help ensure that the logrolls across parties can be maintained over time."
"40","Second, to the degree that governmental coalitions are being formed based on a bargain over a spatial policy outcome and some set of office perks, Crombez's model better fits the existing evidence than does Baron and Diermeier's model. Why might this be? As discussed in the theory section, these two arguments at their core are very similar. Both assume parties join governments in an effort to influence policy and gain office perks. However, while the two theories differ in a number of important ways—i.e., Crombez defines a much more elaborate government formation game, while Baron and Diermeier explore an election stage—we believe the critical difference actually lies in the common bargaining stage of the two models.         "
"41","To the point, Crombez assumes the side‐payments achieved through the allocation of office perks must be positive, while Baron and Diermeier allow parties to actually gain negative perks, with coalition partners having to pay out of hand to join the government. Without this assumption, Baron and Diermeier's model would not predict that oversized coalitions should form when the status quo is extreme. There would be no incentive for the formateur to include additional extreme parties if the formateur could not extract rents from those parties through negative side‐payments. Thus, the evidence presented here suggests that scholars might more accurately characterize parliamentary behavior through models that do not rely on coalition partners having to offer side‐payments to be part of the government.         "
"42","Finally, in the absence of other control variables, we find support for the existence of oversized connected coalitions (Model 1). However, when tested in competition with a series of other explanations for oversized coalitions, we find that minimum connected coalitions do not seem to be forming for the reason claimed by Axelrod—i.e., including surplus parties to ensure that the governing coalition is connected. Rather, the evidence most strongly suggests that these coalitions are forming because they are efficient minimumnecessarycoalitions. That is, oversized coalitions form when minimum winning coalitions would not be able to sustain a logroll because: (1) there are many decisive actors in the chamber, (2) external veto players make the passage of legislation harder, and (3) bills that tend to benefit one group also tend to be more costly for other groups. Thus, consistent with Carrubba and Volden's theory, formateur parties appear to be creating governing coalitions that are large enough to allow logrolls to be sustainable, but no larger. These coalitions may also frequently be connected coalitions because connected coalitions tend to be less polarized, therefore making passage of each other's preferred legislation less costly on average.         "
"43","Beyond these implications for understanding the politics behind the formation of oversized coalitions, this article points to the potential benefits of using a logrolling approach to study policy making in parliamentary democracies more generally. When characterizing the policy motivations behind parliamentary politics, political scientists traditionally have eschewed explicit logrolling or pork barrel considerations across bills and over time in favor of a focus on single policy adoptions or omnibus legislation (see summary work by Laver and Schofield 1990). If the importance of multiple issue exchanges for coalition formation and stability over time is borne out in studies beyond the present one, this points to a potentially fruitful alternative way to understand politics and policy making in modern parliamentary democracies.
