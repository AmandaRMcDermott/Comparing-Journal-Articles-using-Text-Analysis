"1","When considering the independence of an executive agency from the president or Congress, one must first define the term “agency.” Yet cataloging administrative agencies is difficult. Congress defines “agency” in relation to particular laws, and courts adjudicate what constitutes an agency on a case‐by‐case basis.2 As a result, every published list of federal executive agencies is slightly different. I define an agency to be any executive entity led by one or more political appointees appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate and any subpart of such entity that both Congress and the president recognize as organizationally distinct. This definition allows me to consider large agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and smaller bureaus like the DHS's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.         "
"2","Just as defining “agency” is a complicated task, determining what it means for an agency to be “independent” is also difficult. The most commonly cited statutory definition of “independence” comes from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which defines an independent establishment in the federal government as “an establishment in the executive branch (other than the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission) which is not an Executive department, military department, Government corporation, or part thereof, or part of an independent establishment.”3 In contrast to this inclusive definition of an independent agency, the definition of “independent agency” most commonly cited by federal courts comes from the description in Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which suggests that a truly independent agency is one that is headed by a multimember body whose members serve fixed terms and are protected from removal except for cause.4"
"3","Scholars treat these independent commissions as distinctive because their structure arguably allows for more autonomous policymaking in the agency. For example, because the president cannot remove members except for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, scholars generally view commissions as less responsive to the president than other agencies (e.g., Hammond and Knott 1996; Lewis 2003; MacDonald 2007; Shotts and Wiseman 2010; Wood and Waterman 1991). Yet the organization of agencies aside from the three features traditionally associated with commissions can be similar across independent agencies, commissions, and executive agencies (see Devins 1993; Miller 1986; Moreno 1994; Strauss 1984). Because agencies across the executive branch have structural features that insulate them from presidential and congressional influence, scholars would benefit from moving beyond sparse, rigid categories of agencies (independent or not) to a more nuanced approach that takes into consideration the wide variety of structural features that affect political influence and recognizes that structural features can change over time.         "
"4","Congress organizes agency‐authorizing statutes in very similar ways. First, it is important to note that each time Congress passes a public law, that law is entered into the United States Code for codification by subject matter and consolidation with previous public laws. Thus, the United States Code contains every provision of the law that dictates the current structure of federal agencies. Typically, each section of the Code that establishes an agency also specifies its mission, describes the agency's key leadership structure, and then explains how the agency should implement policy. For example, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) statute first establishes the agency as a bureau within the Department of Health and Human Services, describes the agency's mission to promote public health, and then elaborates on the structure and powers of the Office of Commissioner of Food and Drugs, the agency's leader.5 Next, the statute authorizes the FDA to implement a wide array of policies, describes when the agency should engage in rulemaking and adjudication, and specifies when the FDA should consult with Congress, the president, other agencies, and various constituencies when making policy decisions.6 The substance of these provisions can change with the makeup of Congress. For example, since 1994, Congress has amended the FDA's regulatory authority with respect to drug approval 22 times.         "
"5","Given the way Congress organizes agency statutes, it appears that the United States Code generally elaborates on two aspects of agency design. First, an agency's statute will describe the qualifications and characteristics of individuals employed by an agency. In the example of the FDA, most of these provisions are found in the sections that elaborate on the structure and powers of the Commissioner's Office. Second, an agency's statute will describe how the agency should implement policy and explain when the agency should or should not involve political actors like the president and Congress when making policy decisions. For example, the FDA's statute requires the agency to hold an adjudicatory hearing (which prohibits external actors like members of Congress from privately communicating with the agency regarding the policy issue in question) when the FDA takes certain policy actions relating to the importation of drugs.7"
"6","Both aspects of an agency's authorizing statute have important implications for agency autonomy. Statutes that specify an agency's leadership structure place limitations on political officials’ ability to appoint or remove individuals on the basis of loyalty, ideology, or programmatic support. Similarly, statutes that describe how an agency should implement policy place limits on principals’ centralized review procedures and allow agencies to make policy decisions without concern over political interference. Because these two aspects of design account for an agency's autonomy in making policy, it is important to consider both when explaining structural independence."
"7","The first aspect of agency design related to independence consists of statutory limitations or qualifications placed on the officials in the agency's leadership. Presidents use political appointees in an effort to gain control over federal policymaking (e.g., Heclo 1977; Lewis 2008; Moe 1985). However, an agency's statute can restrict appointments in a number of ways. First, a statute can place limitations on the type of individual appointed and provide for qualifications related to expertise, party, or other characteristics. For example, the authorizing statute for the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board mandates that not more than three board members may be of the same political party and that members must be civilians, must be respected experts in the field of nuclear safety, and cannot have a significant financial relationship with the Department of Energy or any of its contractors.8"
"8","In addition to placing limitations on the appointment of federal officials, some statutes fix the terms of political appointees and an official's removal except for cause. A statute can further limit opportunity for political influence if the terms are staggered. When the terms of members of a board expire at different times, as in the Farm Credit Administration,9 political principals cannot change the entire makeup of the agency's key decision makers at once.10 In the case of multimember boards or commissions, some agency statutes require that a certain number of members be present for the agency to conduct business. This ensures that agency leaders cannot enact policies that are unpopular with the board by scheduling votes when only the policy's supporters are present.            "
"9","Some statutory features actually make it easier for the president to exert influence. In contrast to many agencies and bureaus where the Senate must confirm a presidential appointment, some agency statutes, like that of the International Trade Commission, allow the president to designate the chair.11 Presidents may use chairs in these cases to advance a specific agenda (Breger and Edles 2000; Strauss 1984). Some agency statutes specify that certain officials in the agency serve at the pleasure of the president, implying that the president can remove the official for political reasons.            "
"10","An agency's location in the bureaucracy also affects political influence. Agencies in the Executive Office of the President are commonly recognized for their loyalty to the president, and the president has a significant amount of freedom in the structure and management of those agencies (e.g., Patterson 2008; Relyea 1997). Whether an agency is a bureau that operates within a larger organizational structure is also important. Bureaus like the Department of Defense's Defense Intelligence Agency receive direction not only from the president and Congress, but also from the department secretary.            "
"11","In addition, some bureaus are established in statute, some are statutorily permitted (but not mandated), and still others are established by executive order or departmental action. This distinction is important because it can leave the existence and structure of a bureau to executive discretion. While agencies established by legislation are more durable over time, agencies created by executive action are designed in ways that significantly increase the president's influence (Howell and Lewis 2002).            "
"12","Finally, while a majority of federal employees are covered by civil service laws and regulations that, among other things, protect federal employees against removal without cause and regularize pay grades, some agency statutes exempt employees from these provisions. When agency employees work outside of civil service laws, increased flexibility in personnel management can allow for lower adherence to the civil service system's merit principles and invite opportunities for political influence."
"13","Another important aspect of autonomy is the ability of an agency to make policy decisions without political interference. Commonly thought of as political principals’ tools of ex post influence, these structural features provide for review of agency policy decisions for adherence to presidential and congressional preferences."
"14","First, most agencies must submit budgets, legislative materials, and economically significant administrative rules to the White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for centralized coordination.12 Submission of these materials allows the president to keep tabs on agency decisions. Knowledge of agency programs and activities (and the president's veto power) helps the White House influence agency policy. Yet not all agencies are subject to OMB review. In addition, agency litigation generally is centralized through the attorney general's office (see, e.g., Devins 1993, 1994; Karr 2009).13 While control of federal litigation is typically centered in the Department of Justice in order to promote coherence and consistency, several agency statutes exempt the agency from this requirement and authorize the agency to litigate on its own.14"
"15","Some statutes specifically require that an agency submit policy to an administration official outside of the agency for approval before the policy's implementation. For example, the administrator of the Small Business Administration must consult with the attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission before taking certain research and development actions and then submit the program to the attorney general for approval before implementation.15 In addition, some agency statutes still contain legislative veto provisions.16"
"16","Arguably the most important congressional tool for controlling administrative agencies is the ability to appropriate funds.17 Whether in the text of appropriations bills, or implied threats to withhold appropriations, Congress uses funding as an instrument to exert influence over agency policy (e.g., Devins 1987; MacDonald 2010; Note 2012; Stith 1988). However, some agency statutes authorize the agency to collect and spend funds outside of congressional appropriations.            "
"17","The Inspector General Act of 1978 established offices in some agencies across the executive branch in part as a way for Congress to remain informed about problems relating to the administration of agency programs and operations.18 The act adds a layer of agency accountability to political officials, as each agency's inspector general must submit semiannual reports summarizing the office's review of agency activities to congressional oversight committees. The purpose of these reports is to provide additional policy direction relating to agency programs and to keep Congress informed of agency programs.19"
"18","Another important aspect of agency decision making involves the use of advisory committees. The most notable example is the FDA's authorizing statute, which requires the FDA to consult with no fewer than 13 advisory committees concerning agency policy.20 Advisory committees allow for the participation of external political actors, and Congress may use advisory committees to gain influence over agency policy decisions (e.g., Balla and Wright 2001).            "
"19","Finally, most agency statutes include language that explicitly authorizes the agency to promulgate rules and regulations. However, some agency statutes also include provisions that permit the agency to make policy through adjudication and to use administrative law judges (ALJs). An agency's choice of whether to pursue rulemaking, adjudication, or some other policymaking tool is likely to have an effect not only on policy outcomes, but also on the ability of interested parties to influence the agency's activities (Magill 2004). Agencies that have the authority to engage in both rulemaking and adjudication have the flexibility to choose among various regulatory strategies to achieve desired policy and make it more difficult for political principals to review and reverse them (see, e.g., Nou 2013).            "
"20","In summary, there are two distinct aspects of agency design that relate to structural independence—provisions that specify the agency's leadership structure and provisions that explain how the agency will implement policy. Agency statutes that place limitations on the appointment of individuals in key decision‐making positions restrict political principals’ ability to control who makes policy within an agency. Agency statutes that limit principals’ review procedures allow agencies to make policy decisions outside of political influence. Given these two categories of agency design, an informative description of agency autonomy should account for both."
"21","One of the problems confronting scholars who seek to measure structural independence is the ability to capture patterns of association among several observed variables that reflect the presence of the latent independence variable. For example, scholars seeking to capture democracy or to explore the ideology of various political actors look to understand how observable features relate to an unobservable but theoretically important characteristic (e.g., Clinton and Lewis 2008; Martin and Quinn 2002; Pemstein, Meserve, and Melton 2010). This problem of classifying patterns of association among several observed variables to capture an unobserved latent variable requires a statistical measurement model that allows the scholar to make inferences about the latent trait. Yet because the latent trait cannot be measured directly, the observed response variables are imperfect indicators of the unobserved trait (e.g., Quinn 2004; Treier and Jackman 2008). Because of the desirability in accounting for this imprecision in my estimates, I use a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate structural independence.21"
"22","In addition to requiring the appropriate model, measuring structural independence also requires data on the current structure of agencies. Despite recognition of the importance of agencies’ structural features (e.g., Lewis 2003; Wood and Bohte 2004), there is no authoritative treatment on the current structure and organization of the federal executive branch. Therefore, I collect information on the structural characteristics found in the current authorizing statute of 107 federal agencies and 214 bureaus located within those agencies.         "
"23","I identify the structural features of the 107 agencies in the federal executive branch that are led by one or more political appointees appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Given the political importance of many agency bureaus (e.g., FDA, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau), I also include the 214 bureaus within these agencies that (1) promulgated a rule covered by the Congressional Review Act from 1996 to 2012,22 (2) are listed in both the September 2012 Employment Cube in the Office of Personnel Management's FedScope and in an agency's organizational chart in the 2012 Government Manual, or (3) are excluded from all of the above for security reasons.23 In total, my data set includes seven agencies and one bureau in the Executive Office of the President (EOP), 15 executive departments and 205 bureaus within the departments, and 85 agencies and eight bureaus located outside of the executive departments and the EOP.            "
"24","For each agency or bureau in my data set, I identify the original public law that established the agency and that law's corresponding citation in the current United States Code. I collected information on a total of 50 structural features. These include the location of each agency, features of agency governance, agency powers, and aspects of political oversight.24 For a few variables, notably those relating to OMB review, congressional oversight, and agency administrative law practices, I referenced materials outside of the agency's statute.25 Where possible, I validated my data using a variety of different sources.26"
"25","My data set is unique because it captures the current structure of each agency and bureau, as opposed to the initial design features of the agencies when they were first authorized (see, e.g., Howell and Lewis 2002; Lewis 2003; Wood and Bohte 2004). While examination of the public law that originally authorizes an agency is informative when exploring questions related to initial design, the original public law is not as useful in understanding the current structural features that influence independence. Congress routinely amends the statutory characteristics of agencies, and few agencies operate under the same rules as initially designed. For example, Congress has amended the authorizing statute for the Department of Commerce at least 61 times since its initial passage in 1903. In order to understand how the Department of Commerce operates today, it is necessary to account for all of these changes.            "
"26","However, my focus on current authorizing law does place limitations on the data. Statutory provisions located outside of the current authorizing statute may impose additional requirements on an agency. For example, the United States Code references the United States Postal Service (USPS) in 32 different titles. While my data set focuses on the USPS's structure as laid out in Title 39, other titles undoubtedly impose additional reporting requirements, procedures, and the like. In addition, not all structural features are detailed in statute. Some are determined by agency action, and administrative law clarifies others. In particular, federal regulation or agency directives elaborate upon the structure of many bureaus. I rely solely on statutory law for the sake of consistent coding across all agencies and bureaus and so that I may capture the structural agreement that currently exists between Congress and the president."
"27","In order to capture the relationship between the structural variables found in agency and bureau statutes and structural independence, assume each of the j = 1, . . . J structural features of an agency or a bureau are theorized to correlate with the unobserved independence of an agency i. A Bayesian latent variable model allows me to construct an estimate of structural independence xi* that not only describes the independence of an agency relative to other agencies and bureaus, but also shows how much uncertainty I have regarding the estimate. For all agencies and bureaus, i ∈ 1. . . N, I assume               "
"28","This model assumes that the observed correlates of structural independence x are related to independence in identical ways across all N agencies and bureaus, but different measures may be related to independence in different ways.27 For example, I assume the presence of staggered terms is related to structural independence in the same way across all agencies and bureaus, but it may be related to independence in a different way than whether the agency or bureau is located in the Executive Office of the President. The model specification allows me to recover estimates of the latent structural independence xi* (factor score) and the extent to which the observed structural features are related to the latent trait (factor loadings).            "
"29","Given the discussion of structural characteristics above, I seek to estimate structural independence in two dimensions. To identify the center of the latent parameter space, I assume that the mean of x[1]i* (independence in the first dimension) and x[2]i* (independence in the second dimension) are both 0. To fix the scale of the recovered space, I assume that the variance of x*[1] and x*[2] are both 1. For every structural feature that limits political influence in an agency's or a bureau's policy process, I assume that β[1] = 0, and for every structural feature that places limitations on who may serve in an agency's or a bureau's key leadership positions, I assume that β[2] = 0.28 Thus, each legal mandate that places limitations on who may serve in an agency's or a bureau's key leadership positions determines only the first dimension (Independence of Decision Makers), and the structural features that affect political influence in an agency's or a bureau's policy process determine only the second dimension (Independence of Policy Decisions). While I define the dimensions based on theoretical considerations, exploratory factor analysis confirms my theoretical argument that the observed statutory design features fall within these two dimensions.29"
"30","I use the Bayesian latent factor model described by Quinn (2004) and implemented via MCMCpack (Martin, Quinn, and Park 2011). I use 100,000 estimates as a “burn‐in” period to find the posterior distribution of the estimated parameters and then use one out of every 1,000 iterations of the subsequent 1,000,000 iterations to characterize the posterior distribution of the estimates.30 For most variables, I do not assume a structural feature is positively or negatively correlated with independence. However, for some features like “for cause” protections, there is considerable consensus among legal and political science scholars about the relationship between that particular structural feature and independence. In those seven cases, I constrain the variable to be either positive or negative.31"
"31","Figure 1 graphs the relationship between an agency's structural features and the independence of that agency's decision makers. The circles indicate coefficients, and the lines estimate the precision associated with those coefficients. In general, the variables relate to the independence of an agency's key leadership in expected ways. Bureaus, placement inside the cabinet, and location in the EOP are negatively correlated with the independence of an agency's decision makers. The relative permanence of an agency, as indicated by whether the agency is mandated by statute, is positively correlated with independence.            "
"32","Variables associated with leadership structure are most strongly correlated with the independence of agency decision makers. Consistent with previous research, the presence of a multimember board or commission at the top of an agency hierarchy has a strong relationship to independence. The presence of long and staggered terms, for cause protections, and quorum requirements is also highly correlated with independent decision makers. Of the leadership structure variables, whether a statute specifies that an agency head serves at the pleasure of the president appears to have the weakest relationship to structural independence. This may be because in the absence of for cause protections, all agency heads are assumed to serve at the pleasure of the president.32"
"33","As expected, all limitations on appointments are positively correlated with the independence of decision makers. In addition, exemption from civil service laws is positively related to independence. This may be the result of two factors. First, some statutes permit agencies to exempt certain employees from civil service requirements to allow for the recruitment and retention of highly specialized workers. These provisions can increase the expertise of an agency relative to political principals and create an impediment to political control (see, e.g., Freeman 1958; Rourke 1972; Weingast 2005). Second, if the president or Congress wants to direct agencies through changes in the personnel policy, there is no common personnel system, and expertise in employment is decentralized in exempt agencies.            "
"34","Finally, despite legal research theorizing that selection of an agency chair by the president decreases the independence of the chair, the coefficient associated with presidential selection is positive, and statutes that provide for the head of an agency to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate are relatively uncorrelated with independence. This may be a reflection of design decisions made by Congress. While Congress allows the president to select the head of agencies that are otherwise very independent, Congress reserves a role for the input of the Senate in more political agencies."
"35","Figure 2 graphs the extent to which the structural features that limit political influence in an agency's policy process are related to the independence of an agency's policy decisions. Provisions that remove an agency from OMB review, allow the agency to litigate on its own, and remove an agency from the congressional appropriations process are positively related to independence. The requirement that an agency obtains outside approval before implementing policy, the use of advisory commissions, and the application of the Inspector General Act to an agency are all positively correlated with structural independence. This may be because Congress uses these tools to gain information on otherwise independent agencies. Finally, both the ability of an agency to choose between adjudication and rulemaking and the presence of administrative law judges are positively correlated with structural independence.            "
"36","The model of structural independence produces estimates of the independence of agencies in each of the two dimensions.33 I validate these estimates in two ways. In order to assess the face validity of the estimates, I highlight the estimates of five different agencies. As a check on the predictive validity of the measure, I examine the relationship between the two dimensions and federal administrators’ perceptions of political influence over agency policy.         "
"37","First, a detailed examination of five agencies illustrates the face validity and utility of my measure. Figure 3 plots all agencies in my data set and then highlights the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FED), the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the Office of Acquisition Policy (OAP), the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In Figure 3, a black diamond indicates the point estimates of each of the agencies, and the ellipse around the diamond indicates the 95% confidence interval associated with the estimates. The decision makers dimension is on the x‐axis, and the policy decision dimension is on the y‐axis.         "
"38","The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is generally recognized as one of the most autonomous agencies in the federal executive establishment. This agency conducts the nation's monetary policy by influencing monetary and credit conditions in the economy. The seven members of the board serve 14‐year staggered terms (the longest of all federal agencies), are protected from removal except for cause, and may only take action when five or more members of the board are present.34 Thus, the estimate of the structural independence of the agency's decision makers is quite high (2.235). While the board is subject to oversight by Congress, its decisions do not have to be ratified by the president or any other member of the executive branch, and the agency is completely exempt from the appropriations process. As such, one would expect a high estimate of policy decision independence, and the board and its bureau, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have the two highest policy decision estimates at 3.867 and 4.100, respectively.         "
"39","In contrast to the Federal Reserve Board, agencies located in the Executive Office of the President are traditionally considered to be extremely political. One such agency is the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which advises the president on drug control issues and coordinates drug control activities. The director of the office, formally known as the Director of National Drug Control Policy, is often referred to as the drug “czar.” Given the location of the office, the political importance of its director, and the need for the office to work closely with politicians and other federal agencies to coordinate policy, one would expect the ONDCP's estimates to be low on both dimensions. Indeed, the estimate of the independence of the ONDCP's decision makers is relatively low at 0.434, and the estimate for the independence of the office's policy decisions is among the lowest of all federal agencies at –0.727."
"40","There is a large cluster of agencies with estimates that are lower than those of the ONDCP and other EOP agencies on the decision maker dimension. The vast majority of these agencies are bureaus that are not established in the United States Code, and thus their structure, policy, and even existence are not guaranteed in statute. In contrast to agencies created in statute, it is easier to reorganize or terminate these bureaus. One such agency is the OAP, which has one of the lowest estimates of all agencies and bureaus on the decision maker dimension (–0.380). The OAP is a bureau within the General Services Administration (GSA) responsible for writing the Federal Acquisition Regulation (the rule book for all federal agency procurements). In doing so, the agency must consult with politicians and other agencies and has one of the lowest estimates on the policy decision dimension (–0.540)."
"41","The OAP, ONDCP, and Federal Reserve Board are three examples of agencies at the extremes in terms of independence. Yet there are agencies with high estimates on one dimension and low estimates on the other. Take, for example, the FAA, which is a bureau located in the Department of Transportation authorized to implement law relating to aviation safety. While the FAA's decision maker estimate is relatively low at 0.024, the FAA's decisions are largely insulated from political review. The FAA bypasses both OMB budget and legislative communication review, is authorized to deal in property as the agency deems necessary, and uses ALJs in making policy. As such, the FAA's policy decision estimate is relatively high at 2.256."
"42","In contrast to the FAA, the independence estimates of the Broadcasting Board of Governors are relatively high in terms of limitations placed on political principals’ ability to appoint key decision makers and relatively low on the policy decisions dimension. The BBG is the multimember agency that oversees U.S. civilian media international broadcasts. The BBG's authorizing statute contains many limitations on the appointment and removal of key agency officials,35 resulting in a high estimate on the decision makers dimension (1.719). In contrast, the BBG's statute contains no limitations on political review of agency decisions and looks very similar in that regard to more political agencies. Thus, the estimate for the agency on the policy decision dimension is –0.563.         "
"43","In summary, a detailed examination of five agencies that vary on the different dimensions demonstrates the face validity of the estimates. These comparisons suggest that the estimates allow us to distinguish among agencies that would otherwise look similar if we simply evaluated whether an agency's structure has one or two specific features. For example, the authorizing statutes of both the Federal Reserve Board and the Broadcasting Board of Governors provide for multimember bodies and fixed terms, but the agencies differ greatly with respect to the number of limitations placed on political review of agency policy. In addition, a comparison of the estimates of agencies that are generally categorized as independent commissions suggests that the agencies differ in terms of structure.36 For example, estimates for independent commissions on the decision makers dimension range from 0.136 (Foreign Claims Settlement Commission) to 2.346 (Federal Reserve Board), and the estimates for commissions on the policy decision dimension range from –0.267 (National Mediation Board) to 3.867 (Federal Reserve Board).         "
"44","Of course, no agency is completely immune to politics. An agency's structural features may place barriers on political influence, but political actors can work hard to overcome these roadblocks. For example, even though the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) estimates are relatively high on both dimensions (1.312 and 3.566, respectively), in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, SEC policy reflected presidential preferences (see, e.g., Bressman and Thompson 2010). The relationship between agencies and their political principals varies with the political landscape. The structural independence estimates set aside factors such as political saliency and simply take into account the statutory barriers designed to limit political influence.         "
"45","I assess the predictive validity of my estimates by exploring whether structural design features correlate with political principals’ influence over agency policy. Scholars have conducted important work showing how agency ideology and structure can influence responsiveness to elected officials (e.g., Lewis 2003; Snyder and Weingast 2000; Wood and Bohte 2004; Wood and Waterman 1991, 1993). However, this work generally is limited to traditional considerations of whether an agency falls into specific categories of agencies like fixed terms, autonomous budget authority, or location in the cabinet.         "
"46","To measure the influence of political principals, I use the Survey on the Future of Government Service,37 a survey of nearly 2,400 appointed and career federal executives from across the federal bureaucracy. I use the following survey question: “In general, how much influence do the following groups have over policy decisions in your agency?” The question then proceeds to ask about the “White House,” “Democrats in Congress” (the majority party in the House and Senate at the time of the survey), and “Republicans in Congress” (the minority party in the House and Senate at the time of the survey). To facilitate comparing relative influence, respondents assessed the influence of each group using a grid that lists all of the groups being rated. The relative influence of each group ranged from 0 (“None”) to 4 (“A great deal”). Because I am interested in variation in responses at the agency level, I use the average response of executives in each agency as my dependent variable.         "
"47","To explore whether an agency's structural independence is correlated with perceptions of political influence, I use both dimensions of the new estimates of independence. These two dimensions are correlated at 0.342. Given that the survey question asks respondents to assess the influence of political principals over agency policy decisions, I expect that as the independence of an agency's policy decisions increases, the perceptions of political principals’ influence over agency policy should decrease."
"48","However, it is not clear whether to expect a relationship between the independence of decision makers and perceptions of influence. One of the benefits political principals, and most specifically the president, derive from the ability to make appointments is that these individuals will presumably make desired policy without any need for political interference. In agencies with few statutory restrictions on who may serve in key leadership positions, administrators may not perceive political influence because principals should not have to exert influence over their own people. In agencies with many statutory restrictions on key leadership positions, administrators may not perceive political influence simply because key decision makers are insulated."
"49","Of course, other factors influence executives’ perceptions of political principals’ influence. As such, I estimate models with a number of controls. First, because the number of committees that oversee an agency may affect the relative influence of the agency's political principals (Clinton, Lewis, and Selin 2014; Gailmard 2009; Hammond and Knott 1996; Laffont and Tirole 1993; Miller and Hammond 1990), I control for the number of committees that have oversight jurisdiction over each agency.38 Second, I control for the ideology of each agency (Clinton and Lewis 2008) to account for the possibility that an agency's ideology either affects the actual influence over agency policy or else influences executives’ perceptions of influence. Finally, I include the natural log of the number of individuals employed by the agency.         "
"50","I estimate regression models using ordinary least squares.39 In order to compare the utility of my estimates against that of including an indicator variable for independent commissions, I include two separate models for each measure of influence—one with the two dimensions of my measure and one with an independent commission indicator. Table 1 presents the results of the models estimating the influence of the White House, Democrats in Congress, and Republicans in Congress over agency policy.         "
"51","As anticipated, structural features that limit political influence in an agency's policy process are negatively correlated with perceptions of influence. As an agency's policy decisions estimate increases, the influence of the White House and congressional Democrats and Republicans decreases. The sizes of the effects are similar across all three principals. For example, moving from an agency structured like the ONDCP to an agency structured like the Federal Reserve Board, holding all other variables at their means, is estimated to decrease perceptions of White House influence from 2.728 to 1.572. This a difference of 1.5 standard deviations and the equivalent of moving from an answer that the White House exerts “a good bit” of influence over agency policy to responding that the White House exerts “some” influence."
"52","In contrast, statutory limitations on who may serve in an agency's key leadership positions do not significantly or substantively correlate with perceptions of influence. This is not to say that these types of limitations are ineffective in insulating agency decision makers. It may be that key officials in agencies with low estimates on the decision makers dimension do in fact implement the policies that political principals prefer. However, they likely do so without administrators perceiving political intervention."
"53","Consistent with studies that suggest structuring an agency as a commission removes the agency from presidential influence, respondents in independent commissions report less White House influence than those in other agencies but do not perceive a statistically different amount of congressional influence. While the results regarding independent commissions are consistent with conventional wisdom, the models estimated with my estimates of independence suggest that the traditional focus on the structure of independent commissions as they relate to insulating decision makers (multimember, fixed terms, for cause protection) may be misplaced. Instead, it appears that a lack of influence is correlated with statutory provisions that insulate agency policy decisions from review by political principals."
"54","The other covariates included in the models have reasonable effects. The number of oversight committees has little correlation with perceptions of influence. As an agency becomes more conservative, agency administrators perceive less influence from the White House and congressional Republicans. Finally, as an agency increases in size, executives report more influence from both the White House and Congress."
"55","The models of political influence over agency policy decisions suggest that even accounting for traditional considerations of independence relating to statutory restrictions on who may serve in key leadership positions, there is substantial variation in influence due to other forms of structural independence. When agencies are structured in ways that insulate policy decisions from political review, federal executives perceive less political influence over agency policy."
"56","One of the benefits of relying on the United States Code, as opposed to the original public law that established each agency, to determine agency structure is that the United States Code captures the current structure of each agency in the federal executive establishment. This is important, as the structural features of an agency can change over time. In order to explore these over time, I compare the initial public law authorizing a random sample of 25 agencies in my data set to the current statutes authorizing those agencies."
"57","I difference the estimates on both dimensions for each agency as initially structured from the estimates for each agency as currently structured to obtain a measure of structural change. Thus, positive values indicate an increase in structural independence and negative values indicate a decrease in independence. Figures 4 and 5 depict these changes. In each graph, the acronym for each agency indicates the change in point estimates on the dimension in question, and the lines indicate the level of precision associated with the estimates. In general, current limitations on the appointment and removal of key agency decision makers (Figure 4) are statistically indistinguishable from the initial agency design. The only agency in my sample with any distinguishable change in leadership structure is the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund Board. Established in 1935, the board oversees the financial operations of the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, which helps finance Medicare. The board has grown more independent on the decision makers dimension largely because, in 1988, Congress added two public members of the board who serve fixed terms and must be from different political parties.         "
"58","In contrast to the decision maker dimension, several agencies have grown more independent over time on the policy decision dimension. Financial agencies have the largest changes in this dimension, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board, and the Securities and Exchange Commission all growing more independent. Since initially being established, both the Fed and the SEC have gained independent litigating authority,40 and their statutes have further elaborated upon the agencies’ financial independence from Congress. Over time, the FDIC has gained adjudicative authority and now uses ALJs when making policy.         "
"59","Perhaps the biggest change in the independence of these and other agencies on the policy decision dimension resulted from the development of OMB review. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 first granted the president the responsibility for coordinating federal agency budget proposals and creating a unified national budget. Similarly, the development of centralized OMB review of communications from agencies to Congress in 1979 and review of proposed agency rules in 1981 further increased political control over federal agency policy. However, over time, several agencies have been granted exemptions from one form or all forms of White House review. These exemptions have resulted in an increase in agency independence."
"60","This comparison of initial and current agency design suggests that the structural features of agencies, at least as outlined in statute, do not remain constant. Changes in design choices can reflect the interests and politics of a particular moment in time, concerns about concentration of power in the executive branch, or the need for bureaucratic accountability. In particular, as Congress and the president develop new ways of reviewing agency policy and exerting political influence, these tools of control will affect the independence of agencies. In order to understand how today's political principals can exert influence over bureaucratic policymaking, it is important to account for these changes."
"61","The structure of the Federal Trade Commission presented an obstacle to President Roosevelt's desire to fill the leadership of the FTC with individuals who shared his preferences. Since then, the limitations placed on the president's ability to appoint key decision makers within the agency have remained largely the same.41 However, the FTC has become increasingly more independent over time as a result of the addition of structural features that insulate the agency's policy decisions from political review. For example, the agency's ability to implement policy through adjudication and its employment of administrative law judges protect certain policy decisions from political interference. The addition of structural features like these illustrates the importance of considering statutory characteristics outside of those traditionally associated with agency independence. Because the United States Code generally elaborates on the qualifications and characteristics of individuals employed by the agency and on the features insulating agency decisions from political influence, it is important that scholars account for both aspects of agency design.         "
"62","Using a new data set of the structural characteristics found in the current authorizing statute of 321 federal agencies, I estimate structural independence on two dimensions using a Bayesian latent variable model. I illustrate how agencies vary across both dimensions and then demonstrate the utility of the new measure by exploring whether structural design features correlate with political responsiveness. I find that agencies that are insulated from political review report less congressional and presidential influence over agency policy. Finally, I examine changes in structure over time for a random sample of agencies in my data set and find that bureaucratic structure is not static."
"63","Several implications emerge from this analysis. First, it is important that we consider the current structure of agencies when evaluating political control of the bureaucracy. While the examination of the initial public law that established an agency is informative for exploring questions related to initial delegation and design, it is necessary to account for all subsequent legal changes in attempting to understand how an agency operates today."
"64","Second, many structural features influence the degree of control political principals have over federal agencies. Not only are limitations on leadership structure like fixed terms and for cause protections important, but also statutory provisions such as those that grant an agency the ability to choose how to implement policy or remove employees from civil service protections can influence an agency's independence. Discussions of agency design, delegation, and political control should reflect these differences. The extent to which the bureaucracy is responsive to elected officials when implementing policy depends on the statutory restrictions placed on the ability of those officials to appoint key decision makers and review agency policy."
