"1","“Territorial representation” is a frequent feature of contemporary democracies. Several of the world's most studied democracies are federations employing diverse forms of representation of their territorial units in policymaking at the federal level (e.g., state representatives in an upper chamber of parliament).1 How do such arrangements of territorial representation affect the translation of public opinion into policy? To whom exactly should we expect policy to respond under strong territorial representation, and who will get policies congruent with her preferences in such systems? The rich literature on policy representation has mostly focused on the effects of economic inequality and policy attributes on the opinion–policy linkage (e.g., Gilens 2012; Gilens and Page 2014; Hobolt and Klemmensen 2008; Jennings 2009; Jennings and John 2009; Lax and Phillips 2009, 2012; Soroka and Wlezien 2010) and paid little attention to the effects of federalism and territorial representation more broadly. If anything, scholars have argued that federalism may weaken the opinion–policy linkage since it obscures the clarity of responsibility for voters (John, Bevan, and Jennings 2011; Wlezien and Soroka 2012). But no work has comprehensively investigated how territorial representation affects the very focus of representation, that is, whose preferences are represented.         "
"2","I argue that to understand the effects of territorial representation on the opinion–policy linkage, we must consider differences in opinion and public salience across constituencies/states. Assuming territorial representatives (e.g., senators, state governments) have considerable influence in federal policymaking and follow the median voter in their state, conflicts about policy between the publics of different territories can be resolved by state representatives’ vote trading and logrolling. Representatives will offer their agreement to policy change that is undesired by the majority of their constituents if this opinion is ambivalent or less salient, and they will—in return—demand support from other representatives if their constituents’ opinion is clear and salient. As a consequence, federal policy will be particularly responsive to the opinion of citizens in those states that care about an issue, and most likely to match majority opinion in a state the clearer and the more salient state‐level opinion is.         "
"3","I test these claims with a novel data set from European Union (EU) politics containing information on cross‐national public support for policy change as well as the EU's adoption record for 211 policy issues on the EU's agenda between 2004 and 2011. Methodologically, the data set builds upon “best practices” from studies of policy representation in the United States (e.g., Gilens 2012; Lax and Phillips 2012). The EU case is a suitable case to test whether territorial representation matters for the opinion–policy linkage, as opinion and salience vary across member states, interregional logrolls are standard practice, and territorial dynamics are facilitated by a weakly integrated party system (Hix 2002; Hix and Lord 1997; Hix, Noury, and Roland 2007).         "
"4","Empirically, the analyses of responsiveness of EU‐level policy reveal that different averages of public opinion weighted by the salience of an issue to national publics are better predictors of policy change than EU‐wide mean opinion. Inversely, the analysis of over 6,000 dyads of EU‐level policies and related opinion in each of the member states shows that congruence between state‐level opinion and EU‐level policy becomes more likely the more salient and clear‐cut state‐level opinion is. I also determine that this finding is driven by variation in opinion and salience across states for the same policy issue and cannot be traced back to differences in mean opinion between policy issues.         "
"5","The results highlight that under territorial representation, mean opinion may not always be the focus of policy representation. If salience and opinion vary starkly across geographies, disproportionate political influence may be attributed to the opinions of citizens in certain parts of the polity on an issue‐by‐issue basis. The presence of these complex dynamics in the EU challenges our image of the union as an unresponsive, democratically deficient system (Føllesdal and Hix 2006).         "
"6","A wide range of studies have investigated the relationship between public opinion and policy in various Western democracies. Many of these studies find significant empirical support for the responsiveness of policy outputs to public opinion (i.e., a change in opinion induces a change in policy in the same direction), as well as congruence of policy with majority opinion (i.e., adopted policies match the preferences of the majority of citizens; e.g., Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Gilens 2012; Hobolt and Klemmensen 2008; Jennings 2009; Jennings and John 2009; Lax and Phillips 2012; Soroka and Wlezien 2010).         "
"7","However, the existing studies hardly address the question of how territorial representation affects the opinion–policy linkage. To be clear, by territorial representation, I refer to the representation of subnational units or states in political decision making at the federal level by regionally, (in)directly elected “territorial representatives.” Territorial representation is typically a core element of the definition of federalism (e.g., Wibbels 2005, 26) and is prominently associated with state representatives in an upper chamber of the national legislature. How do such arrangements affect policy representation, especially if views of citizens diverge across territories? This lacuna in existing research is particularly surprising, as several federal systems—most importantly, the United States, Canada, and Germany—have been the focal point of research on the opinion–policy linkage.         "
"8","Some limited work has scrutinized the effects of federalism, but its focus has been on federalism's impact on citizens’ responses to policy change in the “thermostatic model” of public opinion and policy (e.g., Wlezien 1995). This work highlights that the various layers of policymaking under federalism make it difficult for citizens to identify responsibility for policy and therefore cushion citizens’ reactions to policymaking (Soroka and Wlezien 2010; Wlezien and Soroka 2012). This, in turn, diminishes electoral incentives for governments to represent public opinion in policymaking (John, Bevan, and Jennings 2011). Beyond this clarity of responsibility mechanism, the representation literature has paid little attention to the possibility that federalism may alter the very focus of representation at the federal level, (i.e., whose preferences are represented).         "
"9","To my knowledge, Bølstad's (2015) study of EU policymaking is most relevant to but still distant from the question of how the focus of representation is affected in federal systems. Bølstad finds that public opinion on EU integration has a “core” and a “periphery” trend, represented by different groups of states (e.g., Germany, France, Italy vs. UK, Denmark, Ireland), and that EU policy output responds to both series. However, he does not theorize or analyze under what conditions opinion in one group of member states becomes more influential compared to opinion in the other. Moreover, as he relies on support for EU membership as a measure of “public mood for integration,” he cannot identify substantive conflicts over specific policies between citizens in different countries.         "
"10","In turn, I here develop a microfoundational argument about the interactions of subnational, territorial representatives that predicts when certain publics should be influential in federal‐level policymaking. Moreover, as I employ opinion data on very specific policy issues, I can ascertain who gets their preferences realized in case of disagreement."
"11","To analyze the impact of territorial representation on the opinion–policy linkage, presume a basic model of policy change in which policy is set by coalitions of legislators who command majorities in the relevant decision‐making bodies. Furthermore, assume a standard model of “anticipatory representation” (Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Mansbridge 2003). In particular, assume that representatives are purely motivated by reelection and aim to forestall future electoral sanctions by accommodating the preferences of the median voter in their electoral district.2 In turn, constituents reward (sanction) representatives for past policymaking that was in line with (against) their preferences, even though control of policymaking is divided among all representatives in the coalition.         "
"12","Presume that the size of the electoral reward (sanction) for representatives depends not only on constituents’ preferences but also on issue salience (i.e., the importance of issues to constituents). The more constituents support policy change, and the more important this change to them, the higher the electoral reward from change will be. In turn, if constituents do not care about an issue, and are largely divided as supporters and opponents of change, electoral rewards and sanctions will be limited. On the microlevel of a single voter, the role of salience is incorporated in various models of issue voting (e.g., Enelow and Hinich 1984; Fournier et al. 2003; Rabinowitz, Prothro, and Jacoby 1982). On the macrolevel, several studies show that policy representation is strengthened by public salience (e.g., Jennings and John 2009; Lax and Phillips 2009, 2012; Page and Shapiro 1983; Soroka and Wlezien 2010). I advance these arguments by considering how the territorial distribution of salience impacts processes of representation.         "
"13","Let us first consider the case of no territorial representation, such as a system with a powerful single‐chamber legislature elected by nationwide proportional representation (PR). In this case, all representatives in the coalition stem from the very same polity‐wide electoral district. Hence, anticipatory representation suggests that all representatives will follow public opinion in this district (i.e., polity‐wide mean opinion) and agree on whether to change policy or not. The probability of policy change should increase with polity‐wide mean support for policy change, potentially moderated by the polity‐wide salience of issues. This simply is the conventional responsiveness hypothesis from the extant literature. Similarly, the probability that majority opinion is congruent with adopted policy should increase with polity‐wide mean opinion and salience. This is the garden‐variety hypothesis about congruence. Hence, the prominent notion that policymaking should react to polity‐wide mean opinion (Wlezien and Soroka 2007), in theory, rests on the assumption of no territorial representation. I call this the “standard model” of policy representation.         "
"14","What happens under territorial representation? A standard example for territorial representation is a two‐chamber legislature in a federal system, where representatives in the second chamber are elected in various districts, often territorially identical to subnational units/states (e.g., the U.S. Senate, the Swiss Council of States). At least in the second chamber, often also in the first, different representatives in the coalition may face constituents with conflicting opinions on policy issues. Change may be favored and issues may be salient to the constituents in some states but not in others."
"15","If representatives represent such conflicting opinions and favor different outcomes, the potential for bargaining arises. A wide class of “exchange,” “logrolling,” or “vote trading” models developed in political science and sociology (e.g., Carrubba and Volden 2000; Coleman 1966; Riker and Brams 1973; Stratmann 1992)3 suggests that representatives can “exchange their partial control over issues that interest them little for greater control of those that interest them more” (Coleman 1966, 615). To maximize their electoral reward from a set of issues, representatives can engage in logrolling or vote trading across issues. In essence, representatives agree to undesirable policy changes or status quos on issues their constituents care little and are ambivalent about, and, in return, they receive the support of other representatives on issues their constituents care about and have a clear opinion on. Note, however, that representatives may vary in their success in these exchanges due to differences in bargaining power that may be due to exogenous (e.g., apportionment of votes) as well as endogenous (e.g., position in the bargaining space) factors (Bailer 2004).         "
"16","We can now see the consequences of territorial representation for the opinion–policy linkage. Regarding responsiveness, the probability of policy change on a particular issue should increase if more representatives face strong support for policy change at home and constituents who care about the issue. As a consequence, we should not always expect policy to follow polity‐wide mean opinion. If the public mostly opposes policy change, but in some states constituents support it and care strongly about the issue, their representatives may be able to secure a majority for change by logrolling and trading votes with the other representatives. This will particularly be the case if the representatives of these states have high bargaining power. Hence, under strong territorial representation, we should expect policy change to be responsive to salience‐ and power‐weighted opinion across states rather than mean opinion.         "
"17","Under territorial representation, we can also redefine congruence at the constituency or state level and ask whether federal‐level policy is congruent with majority opinion in each state. Since we expect representatives to focus their logrolling and vote‐trading activities on mobilizing majorities for or against policy change on issues their constituents care intensely about and have clear‐cut opinions on, the probability of congruence should increase in the product of state‐level opinion and salience of the issue. I refer to these theoretical expectations as the “territorial model.” A formalization of these arguments can be found in Section 1 in the supporting information.         "
"18","The more dispersed opinion and salience across territories and the more disproportional the power of representatives to constituencies’ voter populations, the stronger the consequences of territorial representation for the opinion–policy linkage should be. Moreover, the more powerful an upper, territorial chamber vis‐à‐vis a lower, territorially undivided chamber (e.g., elected by polity‐wide, pure PR), the stronger the effects of territorial representation should be."
"19","However, even in diverse federations with strong disproportionalities and a powerful upper chamber, an integrated party system may absorb many effects of territorial representation by thwarting interregional bargaining (Beramendi 2009, 768; Filippov, Ordeshook, and Shvetsova 2004, 190–96; Rodden 2006). Interregional logrolling may be minimized wherever federal party leaderships can discipline subnational party elites and territorial representatives through career incentives or organizational command (Riker and Brams 1973, 1238). Party leaders may sanction representatives for vote trades and instead gear policymaking to polity‐wide mean opinion. This is especially rational if federal party leaders’ own career ambitions are linked to a polity‐wide constituency (e.g., if the core executive is elected by popular vote or by a pure‐PR lower chamber of parliament).         "
"20","To test whether territorial representation can make a difference for the opinion–policy linkage, I focus on policymaking in the EU as a “likely case.” The EU's political system shares strong territorial representation as a central design principle with federal states. In legislative politics, the Council of the EU (henceforth, the Council) is effectively the system's upper chamber. Depending on the decision rule (unanimity or qualified majority voting; henceforth, QMV), it features unit representation or largely population‐proportional representation of states. In most domains of legislative politics, the Council faces a formally equal co‐legislator in the European Parliament (EP), the lower chamber. In constitutional politics, bargaining between national governments as territorial representatives is dominant, with some involvement of the EP."
"21","Importantly, the EU's party system is only very weakly integrated. Parties in the member states are largely independent from each other and only loosely organize transnationally in several “Europarties” with rather weak organizational and financial resources. Europarties play an important role in EU legislative politics, such as by lowering transaction costs (Hix, Noury, and Roland 2007), but they lack command and control over EU‐level legislators. Not even members of the EP, let alone national ministers in the Council, have been found to be consistently loyal to their European party (Hix 2002, 2004; Hix and Lord 1997; Hix, Noury, and Roland 2007).         "
"22","The lack of a disciplining federal party system is reflected in logrolling and package deal practices within the Council and across EU institutions (e.g., Aksoy 2012; Golub 2012a; Kardasheva 2013; König and Junge 2009). The so‐called “compromise model,” which is closely related to the aforementioned models of vote trading and logrolling concerned with binary choices (particularly to Coleman 1966), has been found to best explain bargaining in the Council over continuous policy alternatives (see Achen 2006a, 2006b; Thomson 2011, 212–26). Other well‐performing models of Council negotiations also focus on exchanges and trades (see chapters in Thomson et al. 2006).         "
"23","Given these features, the consequences of territorial representation for the opinion–policy linkage should be significant in the EU case. However, the EU is likely no singular case. In particular, the distribution of formal power resources in the Council under QMV is much more population‐proportional than, for instance, in the U.S. Senate. Moreover, while important recent work shows that governments represent their national publics in Brussels (Hagemann, Hobolt, and Wratil 2017; Schneider 2018; Wratil 2018; see also Section 5 in the supporting information), the total extent to which policymaking is driven by public opinion may still be lower in the EU than in other Western democracies, given the lower systemic salience of EU politics for national publics. This may deflate the consequences of territorial representation.         "
"24","Building on the general expectations from the last section, hypotheses for the EU case can be specified. Whereas opinion on and salience of a policy issue can be directly measured from public opinion data, we must make assumptions about the distribution of bargaining power among territorial representatives. Specifically, I assume that member states have largely equal bargaining power, irrespective of their size, suggesting higher endogenous power resources of small states. A rather uniform distribution of power is found in various studies investigating legislative as well as constitutional EU decision making (e.g., Arregui and Thomson 2009; Bailer 2004; Cross 2013; Golub 2012b; Slapin 2008; Thomson 2011). Moreover, virtually no empirical work finds a consistent bargaining advantage of large states, not even under QMV. Nevertheless, below I also test alternative specifications assuming bargaining power is proportional to votes.         "
"25","Moreover, we must consider that the EP and the European Commission (henceforth, the Commission) may be able to pull policy in the direction of EU‐wide mean opinion, assuming they aim to represent the “average” European voter (e.g., Sorace 2018). While some important work finds significant power of the supranational institutions in shaping EU policy outcomes (König et al. 2007), most work describes their power as limited or even negligible (e.g., Costello and Thomson 2013; Franchino and Mariotto 2012; Thomson 2011). For the sake of parsimony, I neglect the supranational institutions in my baseline specification of the territorial model, but incorporate them in alternative specifications below.         "
"26","Hence, if we assume governments to dominate EU politics and their power to be largely equal, which eliminates power as an analytical factor, we can specify the expectations from the last section for the EU case:            "
"27","To test these expectations, I collected an original data set of public opinion and policy change in EU politics. The data cover 211 concrete policy issues that occurred on the EU's legislative or constitutional agenda after the bloc's Eastern enlargement to 25 members in May 2004 and before the end of 2011. To my knowledge, this is the first data set on policy representation in EU politics. The new data and the data collection approach, which closely replicates approaches used in prominent U.S. studies (e.g., Gilens 2012; Lax and Phillips 2012), are described in detail in Section 2 in the supporting information.         "
"28","In a nutshell, human coders first identified survey items asking respondents for their opinion on policy change from the Commission's regular Eurobarometer survey series.4 These survey items represent the policy issues. Since some items were asked in more than one survey, I decided to include each item up to once per calendar year to assign more weight to prominent issues. This leads to 250 observations (i.e., administered questions) relating to 211 policy issues (i.e., distinct survey items). Coders ascertained whether change occurred on these issues within a period of 6 years5 following the survey's fieldwork. Policy change was usually achieved through EU secondary law, sometimes through primary law, and rarely through bureaucratic acts or changes in bureaucratic practice.         "
"29","The key adoption variable is binary, with 0 indicating the status quo prevailed and 1 denoting policy change. Policy change occurred in 36% of the cases and after a median time lag of 1,191 days. EU‐wide and state‐specific opinion and salience measures were constructed from the Eurobarometer data using post‐stratification weights rendering estimates representative for the EU‐25/27 population as well as the populations in each member state. This provides precise measurements given sample sizes of 500 to 2,000 respondents per country. First, a measure of opinion reflects the fraction of respondents (excluding “don't know” and refusal responses) who support a change in policy. The EU‐wide mean support for change across all questions is 0.64."
"30","Second, in line with existing literature (Brooks 1990; Gilens 2005, 2012; Page and Shapiro 1983), the salience of a policy issue for the public is measured through the share of “don't know” (DK) and refusal responses (of all responses). As Page and Shapiro (1983, 181) put it: “When the proportion of don't knows is relatively low—that is, when more people are willing to offer a preference—it is a sign of more public interest and attention and perhaps also stronger, more intensely held opinions.” This operationalization is not without problems, since some evidence suggests that respondents select DK due to ambivalence (e.g., Presser and Schuman 1980) or a lack of knowledge (e.g., Bishop, Tuchfarber, and Oldendick 1986) instead of the importance of an issue. Section 3 in the supporting information reviews these concerns in depth and concludes that they pose no major problem in my specific application. Importantly, ambivalence as well as a lack of knowledge should diminish (the predictability of) issue voting, and, hence, from the representative's perspective, they have the same effect as a lack of salience.         "
"31","The data reveal substantial variation in opinion as well as salience across EU member states, which ties in with findings on country‐level variation in opinion on and salience of policies in the extant literature (e.g., Jæger 2009; Shapiro and Young 1989; Singer 2011; also see Section 4 in the supporting information). For instance, the median range in opinion by policy issue—that is, the difference between the member state with the most support and the member state with the least support—is remarkable at 35 percentage points. The median range in salience by issue is 19 percentage points. This is evidence of striking territorial variation, especially when compared to U.S. studies focusing on differences between income groups. For instance, in Gilens's (2012, 86–87) Affluence and Influence, the difference in opinion between the highest and the lowest income group is less than 10 percentage points on about 60% of the policies.         "
"32","Assigning policy issues to 14 hand‐coded policy areas demonstrates that the data are broadly representative of the EU's political agenda (see Table A2 in the supporting information). The data capture the EU's strong focus on constitutional issues during the 2004–11 period (e.g., Constitutional and Lisbon Treaties, EU‐27 enlargement), which account for 22% of the data. The second most covered area relates to internal market issues that make up 19% of observations (e.g., revision of the tobacco, data protection, and public procurement directives). New policy areas such as health, environment (e.g., nuclear energy safety), and justice and home affairs (e.g., refugee relocation) are represented with 8 to 10% of observations each. Further, 8% of the data cover key issues in economic and financial affairs (e.g., financial transaction tax, macroeconomic surveillance, Eurobonds) that entered the agenda during the economic and financial crisis."
"33","Arguably, the close link between Eurobarometer questions and the EU's political agenda is partially due to the fact that Directorate‐Generals of the Commission buy question items on the survey to assist in their policy preparation and negotiations with the other institutions (Hartlapp, Metz, and Rauh 2014, 234–35). This raises the question of whether the Commission may instill biases in questionnaire design in order to receive “desired answers.” I therefore caution against interpreting correlations between the absolute figures of support for policy change in the Eurobarometer and policy adoption as a proof of policy representation. However, I argue that relative figures of differences in support across member states—my main focus—still provide accurate information about the relative distribution of preferences.         "
"34","In summary, the new data set broadly reflects the EU's political agenda and provides precise measures of relative differences in opinion between EU member states."
"35","In the following, I ascertain whether the opinion–policy linkage in the EU is affected as predicted by the hypotheses about responsiveness and congruence."
"36","In a first step, I investigate responsiveness by modeling the probability of policy change using the binary adoption measure as the dependent variable. To test Hypothesis 1, I create a measure of opinion on policy issue j that is the salience‐weighted mean of opinion across all I member states (indexed by i) whose representatives decide on the issue: . The salience weights  are the fractions of DK responses rescaled between 0 (minimum salience across all observations) and 1 (maximum salience across all observations).6 Hence, opinion in member states where citizens answer DK less often on a question contributes more to this measure. This represents the baseline specification of the territorial model assuming no influence of the EP or the Commission and equal bargaining power of member states. I call this the “Council: equal power” specification.            "
"37","To assess the sensitivity of results to assumptions about EU decision making, I also test alternative specifications of the territorial model. First, I operationalize potentially varying bargaining power between states with a salience‐ and power‐weighted average of opinion across member states, where the power weights  are member states’ number of votes in the Council rescaled between 0 (Malta) and 1 (Germany, France, Italy, UK),7 and both types of weights are added: . I call this the “Council: unequal power” specification. Second, since the EP and the Commission have been found to be most powerful if the Council decides by QMV (Franchino and Mariotto 2012), I assign the midpoint between the salience‐weighted opinion measure and EU‐wide mean opinion to all issues potentially decided under majority voting. This reflects equal bargaining power of the intergovernmental and supranational institutions. For all unanimity issues, I keep the salience‐weighted measure. I call this the “Council‐EP/Commission” specification.            "
"38","We are interested in whether these specifications of the territorial model explain policy change in the EU. The main confounder for identifying their effect is EU‐wide mean opinion (e.g., across the EU‐25/27 population). If the EU system responds to mean opinion across Europe, this would bias results since the territorial opinion measures are highly correlated with EU‐wide mean opinion, up to 0.99 across the whole sample. This is not only due to the aggregation of national opinion estimates in a single weighted estimate but also reflective of the fact that the expectations of the territorial and the standard model only significantly diverge if national publics actually disagree over policy change."
"39","Therefore, I also consider a reduced sample of “conflict issues.” I define these as issues on which majority opinion across the EU was split so that in more than 15% of the member states, a majority of citizens favored either change or no change, while national publics in the other states favored the opposite.8 This applies to 72 of the 250 observations. In this sample, bivariate correlations between the territorial opinion measures and EU‐wide opinion are between 0.88 and 0.93. High correlation is a common problem when comparing different measures of opinion in policy representation research. For instance, in Gilens and Page (2014), the opinions of the 50th and the 90th income percentiles correlate at 0.94 (see Bashir 2015).            "
"40","Simply including EU‐wide opinion and the territorial opinion measures in the same regression model may be problematic, since correlated measurement error from the survey sampling as well as multicollinearity may lead to erroneous results (e.g., Achen 1985; Bashir 2015). Nevertheless, I report results from such regressions in Table A8 in the supporting information. They all show a significant effect of the territorial measures but no effect of EU‐wide opinion in the expected direction. Here, I apply model discrimination tests as more appropriate methods to deal with the high correlation of measures. For such tests, I run separate logistic regression models predicting policy change with one opinion measure each and compare whether the models with territorial measures of opinion fit the data better than the model with EU‐wide opinion.            "
"41","First, I use the Clarke test for non‐nested model selection (Clarke 2007). The test is implemented by calculating the log‐likelihoods for each observation in the sample based on each of two non‐nested models. A simple paired sign test applied to the observation‐specific differences in the log‐likelihoods from the two models indicates whether one model fits the data significantly better. Compared to alternative tests of its sort, the Clarke test is more likely to select the correct model in situations with small samples, high canonical correlation of the models, and leptokurtic distributions of the log‐likelihood differences (Clarke 2007). All of this applies in our situation (in particular, note the leptokurtic distributions in Figures A3.1–A3.6 in the supporting information). Importantly, the test has been applied to models with very high canonical correlation (i.e., 0.88), and it has good properties in such situations according to simulations (Clarke 2001, 2007).            "
"42","Second, I rely on Bayesian inference and the Bayes factor for model comparison. The Bayesian approach allows us to make statements about the relative posterior probability of competing models. Such a statement about odds is attractive compared to the Clarke test, which simply tests a null hypothesis of both models fitting the data equally well. Assuming two models are equally probable a priori, which appears appropriate in our case, the posterior odds of two competing models  and , , are equal to the Bayes factor, which is defined as the ratio of the models’ marginal likelihoods. To derive Bayes factors, I reestimate frequentist logistic regression models of policy change in a Bayesian setting using a random‐walk Metropolis algorithm.            "
"43","I run both tests, Clarke and Bayes factors, for all three specifications of the territorial model, comparing them to the standard model with EU‐wide opinion using the full sample as well as the reduced sample of conflict issues. In all logistic regression models, I control for the EU's competence level in acting on the policy issue (mainly national competence, mixed competence, mainly EU competence), as I expect that EU‐level adoption is more likely with clear competences at that governance level. I also control for the decision rule used in the Council (unanimity, unclear decision rule, QMV), since I expect that unanimity requirements should make policy change less likely.9 The full results for all models are in Tables A6.1, A6.2, A7.1, and A7.2 in the supporting information.            "
"44","The key results of the discrimination tests are in Table 1. They showcase consistent support for the territorial model of policy representation. In all 12 tests, the territorial model fits the data better than the standard model of responsiveness to EU‐wide mean opinion. In the Clarke test procedure, about 60–74% of the observation‐specific log‐likelihood differences are in favor of the territorial model, which is reflected in p‐values well below the conventional 5% threshold. The Bayes factor also consistently speaks in favor of the territorial model. Using the full sample, Bayes factors of 5 to 10 can be interpreted as positive evidence for the superiority of the territorial model. In the sample of conflict issues, all Bayes factors exceed 20, which is the threshold for “strong” evidence against the alternative model according to Kass and Raftery (1995).            "
"45","Note that my focus is not on ascertaining which of the specifications of the territorial model is the “true” or “best” one. When testing the specifications against each other, the tests reveal no clear evidence for the superiority of any of the specifications. Instead, the data simply provide substantial evidence that a variety of alternative specifications of the territorial model of policy representation are more likely to characterize the data‐generating process than the standard model."
"46","To illustrate the substantive magnitude of responsiveness, I use the logistic regression estimates from the “Council: equal power” specification (using the full sample) and plot the effect of salience‐weighted opinion on the predicted probabilities of policy change in Figure 1. This reveals a strong status quo bias of EU policymaking. Even if there is a solid majority of 60% salience‐weighted support for policy change, the probability of change is only 27%. Nevertheless, it substantially rises with opinion up to 60% probability of change if support for change is 90%.            "
"47","Salience‐Weighted Opinion and Policy Change"
"48","Note: Gray line is Pr(policy change) = 0.5; 95% confidence intervals are indicated as dashed lines.                        "
"49","In a second step, I model the probability of congruence between EU‐level policies and the opinion of the majority of citizens in each individual member state. Following Hypothesis 2, the main interest is in an interaction effect of the opinion majority for or against policy change and the salience citizens attach to the issue, both measured for each member state separately.10 Hence, we operationalize Opinion majority size as the absolute amount by which the opinion majority exceeded 50% support for either policy change or no change in the member state (i.e., ). In turn, state‐ and issue‐specific Salience is operationalized through the share of DK and refusal responses (i.e., 1 − DK/refusali,j). The interaction of these variables represents the “Council: equal power” specification.            "
"50","Recall that the other two specifications of territorial representation are closely related to this specification. According to the “Council‐Commission/EP” specification, we would simply expect that the opinion majority size and salience interact less strongly in situations in which the supranational actors hold substantial power to align policymaking with EU‐wide mean opinion (e.g., under QMV). According to the “Council: unequal power” specification, we would expect the interaction between the opinion majority size and salience to be further moderated by potentially unequal bargaining power of governments (e.g., approximated by the number of votes). Hence, finding evidence that the probability of congruence increases in the product of the state‐level opinion majority size and state‐level salience is in line with all three specifications of the territorial model, but it is not compatible with the standard model, in which state‐level factors are irrelevant.            "
"51","In the case of congruence, we can elegantly rule out the EU‐wide opinion majority size as a confounder by including fixed effects for each question in the regression models. While the EU‐wide opinion majority size and salience correlate highly with their state‐specific counterparts (0.82 and 0.69, respectively), fixed effects for questions remove all question‐level variation—the only variation that could be explained by EU‐wide mean measures. Note that the use of fixed effects is superior to simply controlling for the EU‐wide opinion majority size, since it rules out any other question‐level confounder and also works if the effect of the EU‐wide mean is nonlinear."
"52","Logistic regression models are used to estimate the probability of congruence. The binary dependent variable is 1 if either the opinion majority in a member state was against policy change and the status quo prevailed, or the opinion majority was in favor of policy change and change occurred. Otherwise, it is 0. This yields 6,506 observations of opinion–policy dyads and reveals that EU‐level policy and national opinion were congruent in about 57% of the cases. First, I regress congruence on the interaction between the opinion majority size and salience using fixed effects for questions as well as member states. Implementing this estimator leads to complete separation for questions on which the opinion majorities across all member states were either uniformly supporting or opposing change—that is, we are left with cases of at least one national opinion majority disagreeing with the others.            "
"53","The results are reported as Model 1 in Table 2. They fully support the relevance of territorial representation with a statistically significant coefficient on the interaction term. Recall that according to the standard model, we should not observe any effects of state‐level opinion majorities or salience on congruence, once we have removed all between‐question variation with fixed effects, ruling out EU‐wide opinion and salience as confounders. Hence, the results provide the most unequivocal evidence for the core argument that territorial representation has significant consequences for the opinion–policy linkage.            "
"54","Figure 2 plots the predicted probability of congruence depending on the opinion majority size at different levels of salience based on the results from Model 1. This demonstrates that when public salience is low (e.g., 25% DK/refusal), the probability of congruence is just below 50%, irrespective of opinion. But if a policy issue is important to the national public (e.g., 0–10% DK/refusal), the probability of congruence increases from around 50% to about 61–69%, as the opinion majority increases from 50 to 95%.            "
"55","Interaction between Opinion Majority Size and Salience"
"56","Note: Gray line is Pr(congruence) = 0.5; 95% confidence intervals are indicated as dashed lines.                        "
"57","Model 2 yields virtually the same results when only using the reduced sample of conflict issues. Model 3 replicates the results on the full sample using a random effect for questions instead of fixed effects, which avoids separation. Instead, I control for the EU's competence level and the decision rule as question‐level confounders. In the supporting information (see Table A10), I fully operationalize the other two specifications of the territorial model and find little evidence that they would more accurately describe the opinion–policy linkage in the EU compared to the “Council: equal power” specification."
"58","How often does territorial representation lead to different policies compared to systems with polity‐wide mean representation? While assessments of the substantive consequences of representation are a central theme in the literature (e.g., Branham, Soroka, and Wlezien 2017), it is hard to gauge the impact of territorial representation since we only have data from an EU system that operates under territorial representation. We lack a counterfactual EU system without territorial representation.         "
"59","To provide at least some indication of the substantive difference territorial representation makes, I compare predicted probabilities of policy change from the “Council: equal power” specification of the territorial model using salience‐weighted opinion to those of the standard model using EU‐wide mean opinion (see Table 1, first column). Note that this likely underestimates the difference territorial representation makes. If the territorial model underlies the data‐generating process, all estimates of the standard model are biased toward the territorial model (and vice versa), which will mask differences.         "
"60","Irrespective of this caveat, the average absolute difference in predicted probabilities of policy change from the territorial and the standard model is 2 percentage points using the full sample. However, in the sample of conflict issues (i.e., several national publics disagree about policy change), this difference is 7.9 percentage points on average. In specific cases, the differences are more than 20 percentage points. Table 3 displays the 10 cases with the largest difference in predicted probabilities between the two models using the sample of conflict issues. These cases include highly prominent and important policies, such as EU enlargement (to Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania), the EU budget, or the EU's financial transaction tax. Clearly, the EU would look different if Bulgaria had not joined and EU citizens residing in other member states could vote in national elections in these countries—two scenarios the standard model favors, whereas the territorial model rejects them. Note that on eight out of 10 issues, the prediction of the territorial model is closer to the outcome.         "
"61","In order to assess whether 7.9 percentage points’ difference in predicted probabilities is substantively large, we can compare it to the difference public opinion makes itself. For those policy issues surveyed more than once, the average over‐time change in EU‐wide mean opinion on conflict issues from one survey to the next (on average, 826 days later) is about 3 percentage points. According to the standard model estimated on the sample of conflict issues, such changes induce about 7 percentage points’ change in the predicted probability of policy change. Hence, on average, the difference territorial representation makes is about equal to the difference public opinion makes according to the standard model. This strikes me as substantively very significant (also see section 10 in the supporting information).         "
"62","I have argued that the standard model of policy representation does not accurately capture the opinion–policy linkage in systems with strong territorial representation. Where opinion on and salience of policies vary starkly across geographies, and state representatives have considerable power in policymaking, logrolls and vote trades may take place that redistribute influence to subnational publics on an issue‐by‐issue basis. Given equal bargaining power of territorial representatives, the publics to which policymaking will respond and be most congruent with are typically those who care a lot about the issue and have a clear opinion on it. My analyses of the opinion–policy linkage in the EU provide strong empirical evidence for this argument."
"63","The findings contribute to our substantial knowledge about the opinion–policy linkage (e.g., Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Gilens 2012; Lax and Phillips 2012; Soroka and Wlezien 2010). In particular, they stress the importance of the very distribution of opinion and salience across constituencies under territorial representation. Wherever constituents across the polity disagree about policy change and differ in the importance they attach to issues, territorial representation may lead to unexpected results. Representatives who fully and only comply with their territorial electoral mandates may pass policies that are not favored by the polity‐wide median voter and reject policies that are favored. This may be an alternative, or at least additional, mechanism to the clarity of responsibility weakening the linkage between polity‐wide opinion and policy in federal systems (John, Bevan, and Jennings 2011; Wlezien and Soroka 2012).         "
"64","This work also contributes to the growing literature on the opinion–policy linkage in the EU (e.g., Bølstad 2015; Franklin and Wlezien 1997; Toshkov 2011). It is the first assessment of policy representation on the level of actual, substantive, and specific policies, whereas previous studies were confined to investigating patterns in rough aggregate measures of policy, such as the number of EU directives. The results further challenge the widely held view that the EU system is largely unresponsive to public sentiment (e.g., Føllesdal and Hix 2006). In contrast, the evidence suggests an intact opinion–policy linkage in the EU that follows a specific form of the territorial model, providing each national public with a chance for representation depending on relative preference intensity.         "
"65","As I have pointed out, the EU case is a likely case for the impact of territorial representation. This poses the question of the generalizability of the findings. From my perspective, the United States, Brazil, and Switzerland are probably the federal states with the highest likelihood of territorial representation effects due to strong upper chambers and comparatively weak or weakly integrated party systems. Note that in all these cases, unit representation in the upper chamber is more population‐disproportional than in the EU's Council under QMV. Future work should (re)investigate the opinion–policy linkage in these or other federal systems and test the generalizability of the argument.         "
"66","While this study demonstrates that we can gain a better understanding of the opinion–policy linkage when we shift our attention to one level below the federal level, future work may push this argument further and explore the effect of regional or even local differences in opinion and salience. In the EU case, for instance, some work argues that despite their limited formal role, representatives of subnational regions (e.g., “paradiplomats” from regional offices in Brussels) are increasingly able to influence EU policymaking (e.g., Keating, Hooghe, and Tatham 2015; Tatham 2018). Will this be visible in the opinion–policy linkage? For instance, will the opinions of Bavarian or Catalonian citizens become decisive for EU policy change on issues salient to these regions?         "
"67","Last, I would like to stress that territorial representation has potential implications for normative debates about the quality of democracy. Wherever scholars apply a model of polity‐wide median voter representation as a yardstick to evaluate democracy, they potentially risk unintended conclusions when assessing systems with territorial representation. Should they really downgrade the democratic quality of federal systems because policy in such systems may be more prone to follow salience‐weighted than mean opinion? Do we have to develop assessment criteria that do more justice to territorial logics? The criteria used here—responsiveness to salience‐weighted opinion and congruence between constituency‐level opinion and federal‐level policy—may serve as preliminary ad hoc suggestions to assess federal democracies. Developing and applying more normatively informed criteria are key tasks for future work."
