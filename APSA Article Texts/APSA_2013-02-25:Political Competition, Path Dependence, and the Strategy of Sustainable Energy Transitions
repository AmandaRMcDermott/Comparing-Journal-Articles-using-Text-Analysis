"1","Sustainable energy transitions consist of the extensive deployment of clean energy, such as wind and solar power, to reduce the environmental burden of the national economy (Beddoe et al. 2009; Sanden and Azar 2005; Smil 2010; Smith, Stirling, and Berkhout 2005). Our interest is in the empirical conditions for successful transitions driven by public policies, such as subsidies for renewable energy. Emphasizing political competition and path dependence, we develop a theory of the strategic logic of sustainable energy transitions.         "
"2","In general, the difficulty of sustainable energy transition stems from the “carbon lock‐in” that industrialized societies have undergone (Unruh 2000). The current “techno‐institutional complex” favors fossil fuels and discriminates against new energy technologies. Due to increasing returns to scale, large investments in fossil fuels have put new energy technologies at a disadvantage (Sanden and Azar 2005; Schmidt and Marschinski 2009). Consequently, public support is necessary to break the carbon lock‐in (Safarzyńska and van den Bergh 2010; Schwoon 2006). However, if public policies overcome the initial hurdles, positive reinforcement begins to improve the competitiveness of clean energy.         "
"3","This dynamic is one example of the more general phenomenon of “tipping points” (Schelling 1978). Causal mechanisms of tipping include economies of scale, learning by doing, and network externalities (Arthur 1989; Pierson 2000). If some practice, such as technology, manages to attain a critical mass of users through these mechanisms, the incentive to adopt it grows, and a transition to a new equilibrium occurs (Atkeson and Kehoe 2007; Schilperoord, Rotmans, and Bergman 2008; Schmidt and Marschinski 2009). A sustainable energy transition requires policies that allow the society to reach a tipping point.         "
"4","In the context of sustainable energy transitions, competition between technologies plays a key role (Anderson and Tusman 1990; Arthur 1989; Safarzyńska and van den Bergh 2010; Unruh 2000; Zeppini and van den Bergh 2011). If a given energy technology becomes dominant, mechanisms of positive reinforcement amplify its advantage vis‐à‐vis its competitors. For example, a century of technological progress has made it difficult to replace the internal combustion engine with electric or hydrogen alternatives (Cowan 1991; Schwoon 2006). Thus, a sustainable energy transition requires that clean energy sources somehow overcome systemic obstacles to challenging fossil fuels.         "
"5","While our argument is most directly related to the study of sustainable energy transitions, our theory also relates to the political economy literature on policy lock‐in and electoral competition. This literature emphasizes the strategic dimension of policy formation. For example, Alesina and Tabellini (1990) argue that governments strategically manage public debt in view of the possibly diverging fiscal preferences of their successors. In a similar vein, Maggi and Rodriguez‐Clare (1998) and Staiger and Tabellini (1999) explore the possibility that governments use trade agreements to tie their own hands, so that the impossibility of trade protection induces domestic producers to enhance their competitiveness by undergoing dynamic adjustments. We build on these ideas, but our theoretical model incorporates exogenous international shocks and focuses on negative externalities.         "
"6","In our model, a government decides how much public support to offer to clean energy. Public support is defined as policies that give individuals and companies incentives to deploy clean energy. Thus, public support influences the number of clean‐energy producers: as the profitability of clean energy increases, the number of energy utilities using clean energy also grows. If this number grows due to public support at time t = 1, the government's incentive to support clean energy at time t = 2 increases due to the creation of new vested interests (Michaelowa 2005). However, the initial government may lose power between these two periods (Alesina and Tabellini 1990; Hovi, Sprinz, and Underdal 2009; Moe 2005).         "
"7","To model the relationship between positive reinforcement and political competition, we rely on a number of simplifying assumptions. However, our reduced‐form representation is grounded in general models of political economy. Following Aidt (1998), who presents a Grossman and Helpman–style (1994) analysis of environmental policy, we assume that economic activity produces negative externalities (Cropper and Oates 1992). Clean energy reduces such negative externalities, and the government's willingness to incur the economic cost of clean energy depends on its constituencies’ preferences. The model of political competition is based on Alesina and Tabellini (1990), who analyze equilibrium policy formation in a repeated game with government turnover. In short, our model is a hybrid of these two general models.         "
"8","Our approach to the government's preferences is a variant of Wittman's (1989) approach to democratic politics. Governments are motivated by policy: they prefer to implement policies that maximize the payoff to the constituencies supporting them. In the context of clean energy, this entails balancing the benefits of clean energy (environmental quality, profits to clean‐energy producers) against the costs of clean energy (fiscal cost of subsidies, political opposition from the heavy industry).         "
"9","To reflect dynamics the game has two periods, t = 1, 2, indicated by subscripts. In each period t, the government chooses how a public support policy for clean energy, .2 The degree of public support determines how much clean energy the society will produce.3"
"10","We examine a two‐period model for simplicity. Our model features positive reinforcement, political competition, and exogenous shocks, so obtaining an equilibrium solution for a dynamic model with an infinite time horizon would require drastic simplifications. The two‐period model retains the key intuition: in the first period, the government has incentives to consider the consequences of policy choice for second‐period behavior and payoffs. The primary limitations of this approach are the following. First, our model cannot capture the complex evolutionary dynamics of technological change. For example, our model does not account for technological competition or tipping points.4 Second, we cannot account for the consequences of repeated government turnover. We are able to isolate analytically the consequences of government change, and expectation thereof, but we cannot examine more complex sequential changes. However, in the supplementary appendix, we offer a simple mathematical demonstration that the key insights from our model would survive in a plausible dynamic game with multiple time periods.5"
"11","The political‐economic environment at time t is shaped by an exogenous state of the world, Yt, a real number that reflects the societal benefits of clean‐energy production. As Yt increases by one unit, a government's marginal benefit from increasing clean energy also increases by one unit. We leave the interpretation of this state of the world open. It may depend on particular circumstances, including oil prices, nuclear accidents, and economic recessions. For example, if Yt measures oil prices, an increase in oil prices would be interpreted as an increase in Yt. In turn, this increase would increase the government's willingness to offer a high level of public support to clean energy, Qt. Without loss of generality, let Y2 = 0. To reduce notation, we write Y1 = Y. If Y > 0, the first period is more favorable to clean energy than the second period. If Y < 0, exactly the opposite is true. Thus, we allow both favorable and unfavorable shocks in the first period.6"
"12","Let A denote the clean‐energy premium of the original government and B the clean‐energy premium of the challenger (potential replacement), where A, B > 0. These premia measure how much the government's constituencies value clean energy independent of the external shock, Y. If A > B, the incumbent government is willing to pay more for clean energy than challenger B. For example, the values A and B could reflect the combined number of environmentalists and wind turbine manufacturers in the government's constituency in the beginning of the game.7 As A increases, the incumbent's incentive to offer public support to clean energy increases. As B increases, the challenger's incentive to do so increases. To ensure that both governments benefit at least marginally from clean energy, the cost notwithstanding, suppose A − Y > 0.8"
"13","Between the two periods, elections are held. The original government is replaced by another government holding different preferences with replacement probability . In the main text, we leave the replacement probability exogenous for simplicity. This straightforward formulation allows us to derive the comparative statics in closed form, and this greatly increases the accessibility of the formal analysis. In the supplementary appendix, we show that the results remain unchanged when we allow endogenous reelection. In this extension, we show that the government still considers the possibility of electoral defeat, and thus the strategic logic of our model without endogenous reelection remains intact.9"
"14","An important new feature of the model is a “positive reinforcement” parameter, . It measures how much of public support at time t = 1 spills over to the next period, t = 2. For high levels of , high initial levels of public support Q1 greatly increase the second‐period government's incentive to support clean energy by choosing a high Q2. Exactly the opposite is true if  is low.            "
"15","It is essential to emphasize that positive reinforcement is interpreted as a political mechanism. If the government selects a high level of public support for clean energy at time t = 1, the long‐run effects of this support depend on the strength of positive reinforcement. Suppose, for instance, that a country is home to multiple companies that manufacture technologies required in clean‐energy production. In such a country, increased public support creates vested interests who prefer that the support policies be continued in the future. Thus,  would be high. In another country without clean technology manufacturers, a government's policies would have less durable effects due to the absence of a preexisting advocacy coalition for renewable energy.10"
"16","Each government is forward‐looking and thus maximizes its payoff from the two periods. This assumption implies that the first‐period government is interested in second‐period outcomes even conditional on losing power. The assumption is natural: even if government A loses power, its supporters remain active in the second period. Thus, government A must consider second‐period outcomes already in the first period.            "
"17","The general logic of the payoffs is the following. At each time, the government obtains some benefits (environmental, economic, reputational) from each unit of clean energy. However, the government must also pay a cost for promoting clean energy (subsidies, opposition from energy utilities)."
"18","In the second period, the payoff to government of type  is               "
"19","This payoff reflects the government's preference for policy outcomes. It could have both a material and an ideological component. The expression is similar to the ones used in Alesina and Tabellini (1990) and Aidt (1998).            "
"20","This expression has two terms. First, for each unit of clean‐energy support, Q2, a government's marginal benefit is . On the one hand, the marginal benefit depends on the government's type. As T increases, so does the benefit. On the other hand, the marginal benefit also increases with the positive reinforcement from the first period. Specifically, prior public support Q1 is multiplied by the positive reinforcement parameter : for each unit of prior public support Q1, the number of clean‐energy producers in the government's constituency increases by a factor of . For example, this could reflect additional votes from new clean‐energy producers.11"
"21","Second, the marginal cost of production, Q2, increases at the margin.12 This cost comprises the fiscal burden of subsidies and the government's aversion to policies that harm influential energy utilities. In other words, the cost of subsidizing clean energy is a combination of the economic and political cost. As usual, the assumption of increasing marginal costs can be justified with reference to the fact that the cost of replacing dirty energy with clean energy varies within the country. Thus, the government has an incentive to first use the most cost‐effective opportunities (low marginal cost) and then move to the less cost‐effective opportunities (high marginal cost).13"
"22","In the first period, the government can strategically choose public support Q1 in view of the expected positive reinforcement, . Recall that in the first period, government A is in power. It maximizes the following payoff with respect to the first‐period policy Q1:               "
"23","In the first term, (A + Y) is the marginal value of supporting clean energy to government A in the first period. This expression is similar to the marginal benefit in the second period, except that it includes the exogenous shock Y. Again, the exogenous shock Y is added to the government's ideal point, so as to emphasize the fact that external circumstances affect the incumbent government's incentive to support clean energy regardless of the ideal point A.            "
"24","The expression also contains a product term for the second period, . Even if the government may lose power, it anticipates future outcomes and adjusts the first‐period policy accordingly.14 Since the negative shock disappears in the second period, Y2 = 0, the government's marginal benefit from future clean energy policy is only a function of the government's initial ideal point A. For every unit of clean energy produced in the second period, the government obtains a payoff of A. This payoff does not yet contain the positive reinforcement, , because the  new clean‐energy producers do not yet exist. Thus, the government ignores their preferences. Instead, the government maximizes its current constituencies’ payoff, as captured in the ideal point A.            "
"25","The initial exogenous circumstances Y will not condition the value of second‐period clean energy. While the government's preferences T will continue to hold influence throughout the game, the exogenous circumstances Y are of temporary importance only. Notably, the second‐period policy Q2 is set by the challenger B with loss probability p. Nonetheless, the choice of Q1 will have an effect on Q2 because the positive reinforcement  will increase the second‐period government's incentive to support clean energy by exactly  units, as new producers enter the market.            "
"26","The probabilistic elections notwithstanding, this is a game of complete information. Thus, the appropriate solution concept is subgame‐perfect equilibrium. An equilibrium of the game characterizes the government's second‐period policy  as a function of the government's type, T = A, B, and the inherited first‐period policy Q1. The equilibrium also characterizes a first‐period policy  for the original government. The first‐period policy  must be optimal given the best responses  for T = A, B. As usual, the game can be solved through backward induction.            "
"27","A government of type T maximizes expression (1), so it selects Q2 to meet the first‐order condition                  "
"28","Thus, the second‐period policy will be                  "
"29","This condition highlights two issues. First, public support for clean energy depends on the government's initial policy preferences T. As long as , the two governments will choose different levels of public support in the second period. Second, it will also depend on the first‐period policy Q1. As Q1 increases, the number of clean‐energy producers in the society also increases. Consequently, the political value of public support for clean energy increases. The magnitude of this marginal effect depends on the parameter . For every unit of first‐period clean energy Q1, second‐period public support increases by .               "
"30","We now work our way backward to the first period. The original government correctly anticipates second‐period choices under different electoral outcomes and then maximizes the expected payoff over the two periods for a given first‐period policy Q1. Formally, we insert  from expression (4) to expression (2). Accounting for the uncertain electoral outcome and simplifying, this yields                  "
"31","First, the positive reinforcement  will increase both the cost and benefit of second‐period clean energy. While the benefits are apparent, the total cost will also increase because the second‐period governments choose higher levels of public support. Positive reinforcement may even prompt overinvestment in the second period. Second, the probability of electoral replacement is essential. With probability p, government B will be in power, choosing public support worth . With probability 1 − p, government A stays in power, choosing  instead. Finally, the exogenous circumstances Y are also relevant.               "
"32","To maximize its payoff, government A must select the first‐period policy Q1 to meet the following first‐order condition:                  "
"33","This condition shows that the optimal choice of Q1 features several interesting considerations. First, the government preferences A and B do not directly feature on the benefit side, except as the benefit multiplier A + Y. The second‐period policies chosen by the second‐period government are only linearly dependent on type T. Thus, the effect of changing Q1 on the benefits from the second period are independent of whether A or B will be in power. By contrast, the type T is featured on the cost side. The reason is that the marginal cost of additional clean‐energy production is increasing. If the government's type changes in the second period, so does the marginal cost of increasing Q1. As either A or B increases, so does the effect of an increase in Q1 on the total cost of clean energy Q2 in the second period.               "
"34","Using this condition, the first‐period policy Q1 is chosen such that                  "
"35","The first term in the numerator, A, shows the pure effect of increasing government A's preference for clean energy. The second term, , shows that the difference A − B is also important. As it grows, the government's willingness to provide clean energy for strategic reasons increases. The size of this increase depends on the probability of electoral loss, p, and the strength of positive reinforcement, . If government A expects to win the elections, the preferences of government B are not particularly relevant. And if positive reinforcement is weak, government A's first‐period policy has little effect on the second period. Thus, both p and  must be high for public support for clean energy to produce strategic benefits. The state of the world Y also naturally increases the incentive to offer public support to clean energy.               "
"36","Positive feedback plays a dual role. On the one hand, it conditions the importance of the electoral mechanism: the political incentive  is multiplied by the positive reinforcement . On the other hand, it also appears in the denominator, reducing the importance of all changes in the numerator: positive reinforcement causes the second‐period governments to invest more in clean energy, so first‐period public support may lead to second‐period overinvestment.               "
"37","Interestingly, the positive reinforcement parameter  is squared in the denominator: the negative effect of positive reinforcement on first‐period policy Q1 exhibits increasing returns to scale. Positive reinforcement causes costly overinvestment in the second period through two channels. First, it increases the future government's incentive to support clean energy. Second, each unit of additional clean energy carries a higher marginal cost than the previous one because the marginal cost of policy is assumed to be increasing within each time period. Each effect strengthens the other, so the  parameter is squared.               "
"38","In this section, we derive testable hypotheses. While the effects of government preferences T and the exogenous circumstances Y are straightforward, changes in the electoral loss probability p and the strength of the positive reinforcement  can have complex effects. All of our empirical predictions can be derived by differentiating the equilibrium values, (7) and (4), with respect to the parameter of interest.         "
"39","Consider the original government's preferences. Differentiating expression  with respect to A, the marginal effect of increasing the original government's benefits from clean energy has the following effect on first‐period support policy:               "
"40","This expression is positive. The effect increases with the probability of losing office, p. When the probability of losing power is high enough, , the effect also increases with the positive reinforcement parameter . A high reelection probability 1 − p ensures that government A will remain in power, and a strong positive reinforcement mechanism implies that these benefits will be substantial.            "
"41","How does this change affect expected second‐period clean‐energy production? Consider expression (4). The change in the first‐period clean energy  is exactly . Regardless of T, positive reinforcement prompts an increase of  in . Additionally, the fact that government T = A is increasingly green implies that with probability 1 − p,  increases by yet another unit (regardless of ). With , the effect on clean energy in the second period may thus exceed unity.15"
"42","Consider next the political challenger's preferences. Differentiating  with respect to B,               "
"43","As the political challenger becomes greener, the number of first‐period clean‐energy producers  decreases. If the challenger also invested in second‐period clean energy, lock‐in through positive reinforcement is unnecessary. If the challenger is very green, so that B − A is high, the challenger is certain to overinvest in clean energy from the perspective of the original government. The size of the effect also depends on the probability of losing office. If the political challenger will probably win (lose) the elections, strategic considerations are important (unimportant).            "
"44","The effect on expected clean‐energy production is again a combination of two factors. First, with probability p, the new government T = B increases  by exactly one unit (regardless of ). Second,  multiplied by the effect in the first period, , is the decrease in the positive reinforcement effect. This effect is negative, but again lower than the effect in the first period because positive reinforcement is not perfect, . In total, the combined effect of an increase in B is positive in the second period.16"
"45","The third factor is the exogenous shock Y. We again differentiate , though now with respect to Y. This gives the following expression:               "
"46","Increasingly favorable first‐period circumstances will induce additional clean‐energy deployment. However, the importance of the exogenous circumstances Y actually decreases as the strength of the positive reinforcement  increases. While this interaction may appear highly counterintuitive, it follows directly from strategic considerations. When  is low, the only issue that the original government considers is the effect of clean‐energy deployment on the first‐period payoff. Thus, the importance of the current exogenous circumstances is paramount. But as  increases, the government must consider the effect of present choices on behavior in the second period. The exogenous circumstances Y are no longer present in the second period, and so positive reinforcement only conditions the relevance of Y through strategic channels. As  increases, the cost of overinvesting from the perspective of the second period grows. Therefore, changes in the first‐period circumstance Y will lose importance. The marginal effect of a first‐period exogenous shock on the second period is exactly , as the positive reinforcement does not depend on the preferences of the government in the second period, T = A, B.            "
"47","Consider now changes in the electoral loss probability p. The effect on the first‐period policy  is               "
"48","This effect is positive if and only if A − B > 0, so that the original government is more interested in clean energy than the political challenger. The original government prepares for the political challenge by increasing the provision of clean energy to induce positive reinforcement and ensure that second‐period clean energy would also be abundant after electoral loss. Positive reinforcement can help a government tie a future government's hands.            "
"49","What about the total effect on second‐period clean energy? On the one hand, the fact that challenger B will gain power with a higher probability implies that the expected clean energy production changes by B − A given any first‐period choice . On the other hand, the change in p also induces a change in , as shown in expression (11). This change multiplied by the positive reinforcement parameter  is the indirect effect on second‐period clean energy production. Again, governments can strategically use the positive reinforcement to influence expected public policies in the second period.            "
"50","Finally, we analyze positive reinforcement. The marginal effect is not linear:               "
"51","The effect may be positive or negative. The second term in the numerator, , is negative by assumption. Thus, expression (12) will be negative as long as the first term, , is small. This requires that  be small enough and A − B be negative or only slightly positive, while p is high enough. In these circumstances, the effect of positive reinforcement on first‐period clean energy  is negative. Specifically, we need               "
"52","If we have , the effect of increasing  on  is negative. When the political challenger is environmentally aware, so that B is high, and the probability of replacement p is high, the original government A has an incentive to underinvest clean energy in the first period, so as to avoid the resulting overinvestment by the political challenger in the second period. The second‐period effect is simply this effect multiplied by , so it is positive whenever the first‐period effect is also positive.            "
"53","To facilitate empirical testing, we now present two explicit hypotheses from the model.               "
"54","This is our primary hypothesis: while exogenous shocks increase demand for clean‐energy policy, their effects decrease as the value of the positive reinforcement parameter.               "
"55","This hypothesis captures the role of rational expectations in a strategic context."
"56","The formal model produces hypotheses on the development of clean energy across countries and over time. To test the model, we built a dataset on 28 current OECD member countries that spans the years 1989 to 2008.17 The panel is almost perfectly balanced, with an average time series per country of 17 years. We limit ourselves to OECD countries because data for other renewable producers are sparse and often of poor quality. Summary statistics for all variables can be found in Table A1 in the supplementary appendix.         "
"57","We evaluate the validity of the hypotheses regarding the effect of exogenous shocks (Y), positive reinforcement (), and political competition p. First, Hypothesis 1 states that the effect of exogenous shocks on renewables capacity should decrease with the positive reinforcement parameter. While we expect that governments respond to exogenous shocks most aggressively when positive reinforcement is limited, standard path dependence theories imply that exogenous shocks should be particularly important when they hit fertile countries with strong positive reinforcement mechanisms (Laird and Stefes 2009; Lipp 2007).         "
"58","Second, Hypothesis 2 states that green governments oversubsidize renewable energy under stiff political competition, whereas brown governments undersubsidize it in similar circumstances. This hypothesis is difficult to test directly because the true loss probability p would be very difficult to estimate for a cross‐national time‐series dataset. Fortunately, an indirect test is available: if political competition prompts strategic under‐ and overregulation, then shifts in the partisanship of the government due to electoral loss should have a very strong effect on renewables policy. As government A is replaced by government B, the shift toward government B's ideal point should be very powerful because government A had previously enacted policies in a strategic fashion. If A > B, government A should overregulate, and this implies that replacing A with B should produce a substantial increase in renewables growth. If A < B, government A should underregulate, and this implies that replacing A with B should produce a substantial decrease in renewables growth.         "
"59","Since our theoretical model produces predictions regarding changes in renewables capacity, our dependent variable is measured in first differences. We derive pooled least squares estimates with panel‐corrected standard errors (Beck and Katz 1995). We omit country fixed effects from the main analyses, as they would subsume the temporal trend with a first‐differenced dependent variable. However, our results are similar when estimating our model including country fixed effects.18 Some models are estimated with year fixed effects to capture common shocks other than oil price changes. The Wooldridge tests failed to reject the null of no serial correlation, generally with p > 0.9. While the results presented here assume no serial correlation, our results hold when we include an AR(1) correction and cluster the standard error by years.19"
"60","Our dependent variable is the growth rate (first difference) of the share of renewables in electricity generation capacity (measured on the [0, 100] interval) for a given country‐year.20 This variable is ideal for our test. First, generation capacity is a more reliable measure than annual generation because the latter fluctuates with exogenous but unobserved conditions. Second, a focus on electricity is warranted because the most important new renewable technologies, wind and solar, are particularly suited for electricity generation. Finally, the use of growth rates instead of levels is suggested by our model.21"
"61","Of course, renewable capacity growth is not a direct measure of policy. Ideally, we would aggregate the various renewable energy policies into a comprehensive indicator of policy. However, such data do not exist for a large number of countries over time. Therefore, we are forced to rely on an indirect proxy. This proxy is warranted for three reasons. First, the literature on renewables is rather unambiguous on the centrality of public policy for the growth of renewable energy (Johnstone, Hascic, and Popp 2010; Lipp 2007; Mendonca 2007). Second, we focus on growth instead of levels, so we need not worry about traditional forms of renewables such as large hydro (Norway) and geothermal energy (Iceland) biasing our results. Finally, we also examined the correlation between renewables growth and average feed‐in tariffs, a major policy tool for renewable energy, in select OECD countries, 1989–2005. The data are from Johnstone, Hascic, and Popp (2010). As shown in the supplementary appendix, the correlation is positive and highly statistically significant.22 This test lends credence to the validity of our proxy.            "
"62","To measure positive reinforcement , we exploit data on renewables technology innovation provided by the OECD.23 The data measure the number of international patent applications from an OECD country filed at the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). To account for variation in country size, we divide the number by population (measured in millions).24"
"63","We use international renewable technology patents as our measure of positive reinforcement for several reasons. First, patenting activity suggests that domestic companies are producing clean technology (Nemet 2006; Soderholm and Klaassen 2007). The existence of companies producing clean technology means that the government's policies reinforce existing vested interests. This is exactly what the positive reinforcement parameter  is supposed to capture. Second, domestic technology innovation implies that profits from clean energy accrue to domestic actors. In the absence of domestic innovation, a large share of the profits from clean energy would go to foreign companies. Finally, patent data are readily available for all countries and years in our dataset.            "
"64","Given that we use patents to measure positive reinforcement, it is important to address endogeneity concerns. While changes in renewable share will certainly increase technology innovation in the long run, our statistical specification is chosen to reduce such concerns. First, we lag our patents variable by one year to reduce the simultaneity bias. Second, and more importantly, our dependent variable is the annual change in renewables electricity‐capacity share. Thus, even if the size of the renewables advocacy coalition increased technological innovation, annual changes would not immediately materialize in increased technological innovation. While imperfect, our model specification is a reasonable way to mitigate endogeneity concerns. As discussed above, we also include the share itself as a control variable, so that the possible correlation between current share and change thereof should not cause endogeneity bias.            "
"65","Since we emphasize the political foundations of positive reinforcement, it is essential to verify that our results are not an artifact of the patent measure. In the supplementary appendix, we report results from alternate estimations that rely on employment in high‐technology industries as a proxy for the potential for positive reinforcement.25 The literature emphasizes that high‐technology industries stand to gain from renewable energy growth (Lewis and Wiser 2007; Lipp 2007; Lund 2009). Employment is also a natural proxy for the size of the advocacy coalition: if many people are employed in a sector that would benefit from clean energy policy, then these people presumably have political clout. We find that our main results hold if we replace patents with this measure. They hold even if we use high‐technology employment as an instrumental variable in a two‐stage least squares estimation.            "
"66","Our theory emphasizes the importance of exogenous shocks. A straightforward way to capture such a shock is to consider international oil prices. When oil reaches higher prices, it makes alternative energy sources more competitive, ceteris paribus. Energy analysts generally agree that oil prices are also highly correlated with other energy prices, such as natural gas (Villar and Joutz 2006), and high oil prices also underline energy‐security problems in countries that depend heavily on foreign oil imports (Muller‐Kraenner 2010). We naturally expect higher oil prices to have a positive effect on renewables growth. We also estimate the models using moving averages, with oil prices averaged over the three years prior to an observation (i.e., from t − 4 to t − 1).26"
"67","One of the key implications of our model is that exogenous shocks and the positive reinforcement, measured as technological innovation and commercialization capacity, have an interactive effect. Hypothesis 1 states that as positive reinforcement  increases, the effects of changes in the exogenous shock Y decrease. This counterintuitive hypothesis leads us to expect that the coefficient of the interaction of oil prices and past capacity will be negative.            "
"68","A second set of claims relates to domestic political competition. Hypothesis 2 states that while partisan preferences matter, so do elections and the probability of being elected to power. Unfortunately, we do not have good data on party preferences over environmental and energy issues. The Comparative Manifesto Project provides interesting data, but the time coverage is inadequate for our purposes, as most of our variation is observed in the latter part of the 2000s (Budge et al. 2001). We hence follow a simpler empirical strategy based on data from the World Bank's Database on Political Institutions (Beck et al. 2001). We first use dummy variables to identify the effect of left versus right government, with center being the excluded category.            "
"69","We expect that leftist parties achieve higher growth levels of renewable capacity because public support for clean energy generally increases public spending and economic regulation (Agnolucci 2008; Lipp 2007). Based on standard theories of left‐right cleavages on governmental regulation (Garrett 1998), we would expect that left‐wing governments are less hostile to mechanisms such as feed‐in tariffs or portfolio standards. To test this idea, we also examined correlations between environmental preferences and willingness to regulate using CMP data on different political parties. We found that the correlation between positive references to environmental protection and government regulation in party manifestos was positive.27"
"70","We also include two dummy variables that capture political transitions after elections. The first dummy is valued 1 in years when the executive power shifts from a rightist to a leftist party; the second variable is valued 1 in years when a rightist executive replaces a leftist executive (again, we omit the centrist case). Recall that while we cannot directly measure the loss probability p, we can indirectly test the competition effect by examining the effects of partisan shifts (see discussion above). Based on Hypothesis 2, we expect leftward (rightward) shifts to have large positive (negative) effects on renewable capacity growth. If a previous leftist (rightist) government strategically overregulates (underregulates), then a partisan shift should induce a violent swing in the pendulum back to the other direction. After all, the initial government's policy increases in , and loss of power means that the new government has very different political preferences.            "
"71","In sum, we estimate the following models:               "
"72","We control for a range of other factors that might influence renewables growth. First, we include the previous share of renewables in electricity generation. Our model highlights the importance of endogenous growth in the the renewable sector after exogenous shocks. We thus expect that past generation capacity is a positive predictor of future growth. To smooth the data, we use a three‐year average of past renewable shares (from t − 3 to t − 1).            "
"73","Per capita income and GDP growth are included because wealth allows countries to invest in clean energy (Grossman and Krueger 1995). We also include the share of government expenditures of GDP. This accounts for the size of the government and thus proxies for public involvement in the national economy. Similarly, we control for the share of investment in a country's GDP to proxy for the country's general tendency to invest in production capacity. Trade openness, defined as the ratio of exports and imports to GDP, is also included because previous research suggests that export industry creation is a key factor in clean‐energy policy (Lewis and Wiser 2007; Lund 2009). All are measured in constant dollars from the Penn Tables (Heston, Summers, and Aten 2009).            "
"74","Finally, we also control for past de facto energy policy decisions by including the share of electricity produced by nuclear plants and hydro installations, as recorded by the United States Energy Information Administration.28 An increase in oil price (our exogenous shock) may lead to an increase in such sources of electricity instead of the development of renewable sources. For instance, France's lack of renewable electricity production could be the result of reliance on nuclear power. Similarly, we include a measure for the generation share of conventional thermal electricity — oil, natural gas, and coal used in power generation — to account for a government's political cost of going against the interests of the fossil fuel industry.            "
"75","Table 1 summarizes the results. Models (1) and (2) present the simplest version of the model. In these models, we regress the annual change in renewable energy capacity on all political covariates, including our key variables: partisan shifts, oil prices, and positive reinforcement. In Models (3) and (4), we add the energy variables, to capture the conditions under which renewables grow. Models (5) and (6) include additional economic control variables. In addition, Models (2), (4), and (6) are estimated using year fixed effects.29"
"76","As expected, the patent measure for positive reinforcement (lagged by one year) significantly increases the share of renewables in the electricity mix. The effect is strong even in the absence of interactive effects (at oil prices close to zero), as each additional patent per million inhabitants leads to an increase of .5% in renewable capacity. This supports our expectations: the higher the positive reinforcement , the higher the rate of deployment of renewable electricity.            "
"77","Yet exogenous factors also count. High oil prices, which we interpret as a form of exogenous shock Y, positively affect renewables electricity generation. The effect is highly significant. Each additional dollar leads to an increase in the share of renewables of 0.01 − 0.02% even in the absence of technology innovation in a country. While this may seem weak, remember that the highest level of renewables capacity share in our data is Denmark with a proportion of 30%. Hence, an increase of oil prices (in constant dollars) by USD10 has a nontrivial effect on renewables growth.            "
"78","One of the most counterintuitive findings of the formal model is that exogenous shocks (high Y) have less effect as the positive reinforcement () increases. We test this hypothesis by including an interactive term relating innovations and oil prices in our model. Intuitively, one would expect the coefficient of this variable to have a positive sign, whereas we expect it to be negative. Indeed, the interaction coefficient is negative and highly significant in all configurations.            "
"79","As Brambor, Clark, and Golder (2006) show, the statistical significance and substantive magnitude of interaction effects cannot be read directly from a regression output table. To examine the interaction effect, we plot the marginal effect of both increasing positive reinforcement  (measured as international patents) at various oil prices and of oil prices for various levels of positive reinforcement in Figure 1 (using Model (3)'s estimates). The left‐hand side of the graph shows that the effect of renewable technology innovation on capabilities is decreasing as oil prices increase. For oil prices above 40 dollars, the effect loses statistical significance. Consistent with our theoretical expectations, positive reinforcement  seems to have a positive effect only when the exogenous shock Y acquires sufficiently low values. Its effect is actually negative when oil prices are above 80 dollars. Similarly, the effect of oil (Y) is decreasing as positive reinforcement mechanisms become more potent. Notice that the majority of observations have levels of positive reinforcement lower than 1.            "
"80","The second set of hypotheses that we test pertains to the identity of the office holder and the dynamics of political competition. We find mixed evidence that partisan preferences matter: left governments tend to let renewable capacity grow more (or contract less) than right governments. However, the effect is not statistically distinguishable from zero in the model specifications that we report. This may reflect the fact that there is considerable variation among both left‐wing and right‐wing parties in their support for renewable energy."
"81","Perhaps more important are our predictions regarding partisan shifts. We use dummies to capture swings of power from the left to the right, and vice versa. We find that a move rightward is followed by a drop of 0.2 to 0.24% in the share of renewables in electricity generation. The leftward swing is more pronounced and highly significant, as it leads to an increase of up to 0.3% in all models that we estimate. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that leftist (rightist) governments engage in strategic overregulation (underregulation)."
"82","Consider now the control variables: we find evidence that wealthier countries are more likely to grow their share of renewables in electricity generation. This is understandable given the economic cost of subsidizing renewables. From a political perspective, it is also interesting to note that reliance on conventional thermal electricity has a strong negative effect on the growth of renewable energy capacity. This seems to suggest that energy utilities relying on fossil fuels have incentives to oppose governmental support to clean energy. In sum, the coefficients for both of these control variables accord with our formulation of the government's cost of subsidizing renewable energy."
"83","The effect of government size is unclear, but our estimates suggest that the effect is generally positive. The effect of investment is highly significant and positive, indicating that investment preferences are important. Finally, we find some evidence that renewable energy grows faster in open rather than closed economies."
"84","Concerns about environmental sustainability and energy security have made sustainable energy transitions a prominent political question in industrialized countries. Previous research has proposed that external shocks and positive reinforcement dynamics are central to understanding such transitions (Jacobsson and Lauber 2006; Lipp 2007; Unruh 2000). Similarly, the literature on the domestic responses to international shocks emphasizes that international pressures influence national politics in variegated ways (Gourevitch 1978; Ikenberry 1986). However, these theories do not offer insights into the political strategies that underpin or impede sustainable energy transitions. In this article, we have attempted to fill this gap by presenting a new formal theory of sustainable energy transitions and supporting it with quantitative evidence.         "
"85","Our findings suggest that the effects of positive reinforcement on policy and outcomes depend on political competition. Specifically, we found policymakers exploit positive reinforcement dynamics for political gain. Any decisions made today will influence future policies and outcomes by strengthening or weakening different constituencies. Environmentalist governments strategically lock in decarbonization efforts by overregulating, while antiregulation governments offer even less support to clean energy than they would do without strategic concerns. Consequently, the effect of positive reinforcement on actual outcomes is highly contingent on government preferences."
"86","Our model focuses on policy formation, so we cannot comment on policy effectiveness. However, the negative interaction between oil prices and positive reinforcement provides some reason for cautious optimism. Even under low oil prices, clean energy technologies are deployed in forerunner countries. Under high oil prices, other countries also invest. It seems plausible that these developments could achieve a tipping point in the future."
"87","The findings have broader implications for the political economy of environmental sustainability and energy security, as well as for political science more generally. First, path dependence itself does not determine political outcomes (Laird and Stefes 2009; March and Olsen 1996; Pierson 2000). We have found that positive reinforcement mechanisms do not yield empirically falsifiable predictions without ancillary information on government preferences and other surrounding circumstances. Second, strategic considerations figure prominently in sustainable energy transitions and domestic responses to international pressures. Failure to account for strategy is a major obstacle to understanding both path dependence and domestic responses to international pressure.         "
