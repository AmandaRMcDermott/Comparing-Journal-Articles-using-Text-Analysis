"1","The U.S. Courts of Appeals are an increasingly important venue for judicial policy making. Indeed, since the Supreme Court rarely reviews, much less reverses their decisions, the circuit courts provide “the final forum for the resolution of most disputes over the meaning of federal law” (Songer, Sheehan, and Haire 2000, 16). This importance is reflected in the high‐stakes nature of judicial nominations and confirmations to these benches as well (Scherer 2005). Given the finality of their decisions and the increased attention to those who staff these courts, it becomes more important to understand why circuit judges make the decisions they do, and also, with what level of variability. Litigants may seek to understand the degree to which the judges' behavior is consistent in deciding to bring a case (de Figueiredo 2005). The legitimacy of these courts also may depend on the perception that judges follow principles of formal justice and practice consistency in their decision making by treating like cases alike (Gribnau 2002). Scholars may seek to understand the degree to which judges' behavior is consistent both in order to make claims about the extent to which these lower courts serve as keepers of the rule of law in this country (Nardin 2001) and to more fully understand the nature of their decision making.         "
"2","On the U.S. Courts of Appeals, a myriad of goals shape judicial choices (Klein 2002) so that “judges' decisions are a function of what they prefer to do, tempered by what they think they ought to do, but constrained by what they perceive is feasible to do” (Gibson 1983, 9). This view of judging on these courts is well supported by empirical research. Studies suggest that judicial ideology matters (Giles, Hettinger, and Peppers 2001; Goldman 1975) and that other motives, including those that take into account legal policy, matter as well (Songer, Ginn, and Sarver 2003). Institutional features of the circuit have been found to be influential (Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek 2004), and the circuits' mid‐level position in a hierarchical judicial bureaucracy also affects their decision making (Songer, Segal, and Cameron 1994). Finally, studies indicate that litigant strength and case characteristics are powerful predictors of circuit judges' votes (Benesh 2002; Songer and Sheehan 1992).         "
"3","To evaluate the variance around the choices made by circuit court judges, a model of decision making which takes into account the complex portrait of judging, as suggested by these brief references to existing scholarship, must first be specified. Vote choices are expected to reflect this mix of influences. Judges with more liberal policy preferences will be more likely to cast a liberal vote. The probability of a liberal vote will also be more or less likely depending on the ideological predisposition of the three‐judge panel and the circuit majority as well as the ideological direction of the circuit's precedent. In addition, liberal voting will be more likely when recent Supreme Court doctrine supports such an outcome. Finally, the model of vote choice takes into account the case context and, therefore, includes controls for the deference accorded to trial court decisions, to the position taken by the U.S. government if it is a litigant in the case, and to case type.1"
"4","Questioning the assumption that judges on the same court respond to the same influences to the same degree, Baum suggests that scholars adopt “statistical models that allow for differences among judges in the determinants of choice… (to) facilitate more precise explanations of judicial behavior” (2006, 174). Consistent with this view, the model specified below tests hypotheses that account for the variance around vote choice. Career effects are posited as central to understanding predictability in decision making, especially given the current system of judicial selection. The variance model also takes into account the effects of institutional considerations and case‐specific characteristics."
"5","To date, most judicial studies examining the impact of career stage have focused on exploring the nature of judicial behavior during a judge's first few years on the bench (but see Higgins and Rubin 1980). Indeed, many scholars have examined “freshman” or “acclimation” effects on judges in attempts to discern whether judges experience a freshman period that is unique in some respect from their behavior in later years (e.g., Bowen and Scheb 1993; Brenner and Hagle 1996; Heck and Hall 1981; Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek 2003; Hurwitz and Stefko 2004; Shipan 2000; Snyder 1958; Wood et al. 1998).            "
"6","Although much of this research is focused on the freshman effects experienced by Supreme Court justices, Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek (2003, 794–95) argue that institutional features of circuit court decision making (e.g., decision making in rotating three‐judge panels and possible review of decisions by the circuit sitting en banc) along with caseload pressures might result in heightened freshman effects for circuit judges. Moreover, as Wasby noted in his interview‐based study of Ninth Circuit judges, the process of acclimating to the role of circuit judge might be more difficult as the result of judges being “dispersed throughout the circuit” (1989, 12).            "
"7","Understanding career effects on the consistency of vote choice, however, should not be limited to a focus on acclimation and therefore should consider other changes over the course of a judge's entire tenure on the bench. Vocational studies, for example, often focus on the effects of “career stages” (e.g., Allen and Meyer 1993; Aryee, Chay, and Chew 1994; Brooks and Sears 1991; McElroy, Morrow, and Wardlow 1999). As McElroy, Morrow, and Wardlow describe this research, “the basic premise is that employees pass through distinct stages over the course of their careers,” with their “expectations, attitudes, and goals” varying across the stages (1999, 508). It is quite likely that a judge's experience on a given circuit bench is also marked by various stages in which the judge is influenced by different concerns to different degrees.            "
"8","Specifically, when one accounts for the relationship between judicial selection processes and liberal or conservative voting, newcomers will more likely exhibit consistency in voting attributed to the appointing administration. These judges, recently minted through an extremely partisan process (Epstein and Segal 2005) but without the institutional knowledge and/or commitment that tenure can bring, will more likely vote in accordance with their preferred policy disposition. In other words, judges are conditioned to think ideologically by the process through which they obtain their seat. Circuit Judge Carolyn King lends credence to this argument, arguing that judges are selected today because they can be “relied upon to further the activists' policy agendas” (King 2007, 15).            "
"9","Nevertheless, the influence of ideology and other predictors of voting may vary over a judge's career. Although there are important differences in the nature of career models put forth by scholars, “three‐stage models” are frequently employed (Brooks and Seers 1991, 54, citing Rabinowitz and Hall 1981 and Slocum and Cron 1985).2 As Brooks and Seers describe, “most three‐stage models appear to distinguish employee needs to get established, to advance, and finally to play out their roles in a terminal position” (1991, 54). Taking these types of studies into account, much can be gained by examining circuit judges who are new to the bench, those who are in the middle stage of their organizational tenure, and, finally, those who are nearing the end of their circuit careers. While the selection process for circuit judges tends to yield individuals with well‐formed ideological preferences that match their appointing president's and, thus, who are more likely to vote in accordance with their preferences, as circuit judges gain experience on the bench, they develop an understanding of the institutional responsibilities of the circuit. To the extent that the process of judicial socialization fuels competing goals and conflicting values, one would expect to find less predictable voting with increased experience on the bench as the effect of judges' policy preferences becomes tempered by institutional considerations. For example, one prominent judge has repeatedly stressed how workload shapes judicial choices (Posner 1995). As “time on the job” accrues, one would expect to see a cumulative effect associated with workload constraints as “overworked” judges develop strategies to maximize leisure time (Posner 1995). In doing so, they may be less likely to achieve their ideal decision (Baum 2006).            "
"10","Studies also suggest that judges are motivated by collegiality and winning the respect of one's colleagues on the circuit (Baum 2006; Klein 2002). Attachment to informal norms which advance these shared goals should become more entrenched with tenure. Thus, it is expected that those judges who are in the early stage of their careers will be more predictable, responsive to ideological concerns, whereas midcareer circuit judges will become more variable in their decision making, responsive to concerns other than policy‐related ones.            "
"11","Judges in a midcareer stage may behave distinctively from more senior judges in ways that are reflected in the variance of vote‐based models of judicial choice as well. Since most circuit judges are not promoted to the Supreme Court, the vast majority will spend the remainder of their judicial careers as circuit judges, with many opting to take “senior status,” a role that allows such judges to continue participating in case dispositions without the weight of administrative obligations and heavy caseloads (Yoon 2005). Consequently, like freshman judges, those judges nearing the end of their careers have firmly entrenched policy positions but, unlike their freshmen colleagues, they have been thoroughly socialized in the norms of their circuit. Unlike their midcareer colleagues, however, they are facing retirement. This may affect the predictability of their vote choices.            "
"12","Regardless of the situation in which a judge finds him‐ or herself, career stage matters. Consequently, the first hypothesis tested is that newer judges will behave distinctively; they will exhibit less variability (largely due to ideological priming from their confirmation) in their decision making than their more senior colleagues. In other words, the career stage (here, the number of years on bench) in which a judge finds him‐ or herself will affect the extent to which the judge votes in a consistent ideological fashion. However, given the possibility that influences on circuit behavior might vary across multiple stages of a judge's career, this variable should have a nonlinear component as well. Consequently, a variable that squares the years on bench variable is included to further explore this possibility. This variable is expected to be negative, reflecting the more variable decision making of those in midcareer, because of the additional institutional commitment they have relative to circuit newcomers and the voting ramifications of such. Those with the most tenure, however, while having firm policy preferences and institutional knowledge, may either begin to more consistently vote according to their political preferences as they become free of administrative obligations, or they might be more consistently influenced by circuit institutional variables.3 Either situation, however, should result in a lower error variance surrounding votes cast by these judges.            "
"13","In addition to length of service on the circuit bench, judicial experience prior to appointment may affect decisional variance. Since the Carter administration, a majority of appointees to the U.S. Courts of Appeals have had previous experience on another court (Goldman et al. 2003). That previous experience can be expected to be a source of consistency in judicial voting. For administrations advancing a policy agenda with judicial appointments, a nominee with a trial court record may be attractive insofar as it reduces the uncertainty associated with predicting the subsequent behavior of the nominee (Savchak et al. 2006). In this respect, the trend toward selecting circuit judges with previous judicial experience (either at the lower federal or state court levels) may result in a stronger observed empirical relationship between presidential policy preferences and appointees' decision making and, thereby, reduce unobserved variability in models of judicial choice (but see Szmer and Songer 2005). Hence, voting by judges with prior experience on the bench will exhibit less variability than those with no prior judicial experience.4"
"14","For judges on the U.S. Courts of Appeals, it has been noted that the process of recruitment, viewed broadly, tends to “homogenize the social composition, training and value structure of members of circuit courts” (Howard 1981, 102). Over time, appointees to the courts of appeals have been predominantly Caucasian, affluent, politically active, 50‐year‐old males who attended prestigious educational institutions (Goldman et al. 2003). In recent years, the demographic makeup of the bench has shifted slightly as administrations have appointed more women and minority candidates. The policy consequences of greater diversity on the federal bench have been difficult to evaluate. Scholarship testing for differences in decision making on the federal courts has found that votes of women and minority judges are often similar to their Caucasian male colleagues (Walker and Barrow 1985). Yet, a few sharp differences have emerged in decisions dealing with claims of discrimination (Peresie 2005; Segal 1997; Songer, Davis, and Haire 1994). Although some research suggests that these differences are attributed to socializing experiences (Demo and Hughes 1990; Gilligan 1982), it is also possible that varying paths to the bench by female and minority appointees contribute to these narrowly defined differences in voting behavior (Slotnick 1984). Here, rather than modeling policy outcome‐based behavior, this analysis tests the argument that female and minority appointees will exhibit more variability in decision making. Indeed, the process by which these judges are recruited may have less to do with policy preferences as administrations seek additional goals with these appointments, including those associated with symbolic representation. Hence, voting by women and minority judges will exhibit greater variability when compared to votes by Caucasian male judges.            "
"15","Finally, the extent to which a given judge is “ideological” should affect the predictability of his or her vote (Collins 2008). In other words, judges who are extremely liberal or extremely conservative will be more consistent in their decision making. For these judges, models of decision making that account for individual policy preferences will successfully predict their votes; the probability of a liberal vote will not be accompanied by a large standard error. In contrast, the likelihood of a liberal vote will be more variable for those judges with moderate policy views as their voting record will be more balanced, with decisions that support both liberal and conservative policy outcomes. Hence, voting by ideologically extreme judges is expected to exhibit less variability than more moderate judges.            "
"16","Circuits are institutions with independent identities, which bind appeals court judges through organizational norms and practices (Lindquist, Haire, and Songer 2007). Formal and informal structures of individual circuits therefore establish the parameters of the decision‐making environment for appeals court judges (Cohen 2002). For example, by deciding cases in rotating three‐judge panels, voting often reflects cooperative behavior with deference to the majority position (Posner 2005).5 Given the potential for rehearing en banc, judges on the courts of appeals also must take into account the preferences of the circuit majority in their decision making. In ideologically homogenous circuits, one would expect to see less variable decision making as judges can more successfully gauge the preferences of their colleagues. A measure of circuit heterogeneity is therefore included, which considers the variability surrounding the mean ideological predisposition of the judges in any given circuit for any given year.            "
"17","Although rules and informal norms are designed to promote consensus in the lower federal courts, numerous studies document variation in dissensus by circuit, which also affects the extent to which predictions over outcomes can be made with certainty (Songer 1982). Scholars have suggested that these intracircuit interactions may correspond to stability and predictability in circuit law (Hellman 1999). As described by one appeals court judge, “(I)n our circuit there is an institutional value and belief in being unanimous if possible. Predictability in the law is viewed as an important value, so we work hard to find common ground” (Lindquist, Haire, and Songer 2007, 7). Indeed, a judge who decides a case in an environment characterized by dissensus is more likely to face a question on which he will be less certain of the circuit's position and, hence, more variable in decision making. In appeals courts characterized by near unanimity, judges will be more certain of the decision favored in the circuit and, hence, variability in decision making decreases. As a circuit's dissent rate increases, variance in voting by judges sitting on that court is also expected to increase.            "
"18","For similar reasons, the size of the circuit may affect the ability of any given judge to make decisions that accord with the preferences of the circuit as a whole. Sitting circuit judges also perceive a connection between size of court and clarity in precedent (Tjoflat 1993). The number of judges in the circuit is a proxy for circuit size, included in order to determine whether votes by judges sitting in larger circuits are less predictable.            "
"19","Finally, certain types of cases could engender more variability than others. Indeed, one would anticipate that variability in judicial voting will increase in “hard” cases where litigants on both sides offer persuasive arguments. For this analysis, complex cases are defined as those requiring more attention to the development of legal reasoning in published opinions. In these situations, judges might respond to different influences depending on their framing of the issues and, thus, exhibit more variability in their decision making. Hence, decision making in complex cases should be more variable than decision making in more routine cases.            "
"20","Additionally, certain issue areas might be “easier” to decide than those which potentially bring about value conflict. Because of the mandatory nature of the circuit courts' docket and the resultant large number of criminal appeals with little merit, there should be greater consistency associated with decision making in criminal cases than in other case types. In addition, issues raised in criminal cases are more likely to fall along a single policy dimension where judges have well‐established values concerning crime control and concern for due process. For these reasons, decision making in criminal cases should be less variable. In contrast, civil rights or civil liberties cases are more likely to raise contested issues, potentially requiring judges to weigh competing values. Compared to other case types, these claims also vary more in terms of litigant resources. For example, plaintiffs in civil rights cases vary from pro se prisoners to those being represented by the EEOC. Decision making, then, will be more variable than decision making in other issue areas. Finally, models of decision making in tax, patent, and copyright cases may yield more predictive errors as this issue area is not only technically complex, but also captures multiple, and changing, dimensions of policy preferences over time (see, e.g., Ducat and Dudley 1987).            "
"21","The analysis employs a heteroskedastic probit model6 to test whether variability in decision making is predicted by these influences. The heteroskedastic probit model differs from the conventional probit model in that the latter assumes constant variance. Since the probit model uses the normal distribution, this amounts to assuming the variance is homoskedastic and equal to 1. However, if that assumption of homoskedasticity does not hold, the MLEs of the probit model are inconsistent (meaning they do not equal the true population parameters) and the covariance matrix is wrong (Alvarez and Brehm 1995, 2002). Therefore, in order to obtain consistent (correct) estimates, one must explicitly control for the nonconstant variance. In this specification, one can simultaneously model predictors of both the vote choice (i.e., liberal or conservative vote) and the variance.         "
"22","By employing a heteroskedastic probit model, it is simple to test for the correctness of this proposition about unequal variance. Using a likelihood ratio test, one can discern whether adding the variance equation is necessary or not and, hence, gain perspective on the theoretical expectation that some judges in some situations behave differently in terms of the consistency of their judicial voting (especially with respect to their career stage). Warnings about the poor small sample properties of this method are heeded, and close attention is paid to model specification (Davidson and MacKinnon 1984; Keele and Park 2004). The analysis is based on a large sample (n = 17,224), and the carefully specified choice model is well grounded in theories of judicial decision making and fits the data well.7"
"23","The observations used for this analysis were drawn from the widely employed U.S. Courts of Appeals Database8 for the years 1968–96.9 Votes in the database are coded in terms of the policy content associated with the judge's position along a liberal‐conservative continuum. The dependent variable for this analysis is the likelihood of a judge's vote in support of the liberal position.10 Data on judicial appointments and career experiences were drawn from the Multi‐User Database on the Attributes of United States Appeals Court Judges (hereafter, the Auburn database),11 with updated information for appeals court judges and district court judges (which are used in the calculation of panel majority membership) drawn from the Federal Judges Biographical Database.12"
"24","To test for the effects associated with multiple career stages, two variables are included, a running tally of the number of years on the bench and the number of years on the bench, squared. The squared term allows for the effect to be nonlinear, as per the theory, i.e., for newly appointed and the most senior judges to behave more predictably. As time on the bench increases, the variance is expected to increase. However, an expected negative coefficient on the squared term will reflect the lower variance at early and late career stages posited by the model."
"25","To test the hypothesis that those who come to the courts of appeals with judicial experience will be associated with a reduction in the error variance, the model includes a dichotomous measure of prior judicial experience at the federal or state level. Information on both a judge's appointment year and previous career experience is found in the Auburn database."
"26","Beyond experience, the model also tests for other judge‐related factors. To test whether women judges and minority judges are more variable in their decision making, relative to their Caucasian male colleagues, two variables are included. The judge‐gender variable indicates whether the judge is a male, and the variable measuring race indicates whether the judge is Caucasian. Given the construction of these variables, they are expected to be associated with decreases in the error variance. To test whether more ideologically extreme judges will be more predictable in their decision making, the model includes a variable which represents an existing measure of judge ideology, squared. The Giles, Hettinger, and Pepper (GHP; 2001) scores of the judges are based on the common space NOMINATE scores for presidents and senators developed by Poole (1998).13 Higher values should be associated with decreases in the error variance.         "
"27","To evaluate whether institutional features of the circuit affect predictability in judicial voting, the model included variables to test the expectation that circuits characterized by high levels of dissensus, extensive ideological heterogeneity, and large numbers of authorized judgeships increase the error variance. Dissensus is operationalized as a three‐year moving average of dissent in published decisions for each circuit (computed from the sample of cases available in the U.S. Courts of Appeals Database). Since theoretical expectations suggest that dissensus contributes to variance, this measure is lagged by one year. Ideological heterogeneity is measured by the standard deviation of the GHP scores for all active judges in each circuit in a given year. The number of authorized judgeships for a given circuit in each year is obtained from the Federal Judicial Center."
"28","Finally, characteristics of the cases should affect the variability in judge votes. In particular, criminal cases will occasion less variability in decision making than other types of cases and civil rights and liberties cases, tax, patent, and copyright cases, as well as complex cases will occasion more. To measure the influence of issue type, three dummy variables are included to flag cases where the general issue area of the case is criminal, civil rights, or liberties, or tax/patent/copyright.14 Taking as an indicator of complexity the page length of the case (using total page length including separate opinions as documented in the U.S. Courts of Appeals Database), it is expected that more complex cases will increase the error variance.15"
"29","The results of the heteroskedastic probit estimation can be found in Table 1. While the results of the choice model are impressive and support findings of existing research, the focus here is on the model of the variance, which yields many interesting results.16 Recognizing first that the model as a whole fits well and that the Chi‐Square test for the variance model allows rejection of the null hypothesis that the variance is constant, the influences on the variance are detailed in this section.         "
"30","First, in terms of judicial characteristics, a nonlinear pattern emerges with respect to career effects on the error variance, as expected. As seen in the table, the coefficient estimating the effect of judicial tenure is significant and positive, indicating a positive relationship between years on the bench and the variance. However, this pattern does not persist. The results also reveal a negative and statistically significant coefficient on the squared term associated with this variable. Thus, the variance increases to a certain point and then begins to decrease for the most senior judges. Figure 1 shows this relationship graphically. These results suggest that the choice model better predicts the votes of judges in their early and late career stages. As noted above, this finding was expected due to the strong role of policy preferences in the modern nomination and confirmation process and the strong institutional effects that become salient as judicial tenure increases. Further analysis of judicial voting behavior by career stage supports that interpretation.17 Indeed, these results reject the oft‐theorized (with little empirical support) expectation that freshman judges will be “bewildered” or “inconsistent” in their decision making, as compared with their more seasoned colleagues.         "
"31","                 Error Magnitude by Years on the Bench                      "
"32","This figure illustrates the nonmonotonic nature of the error variance over judge career. Years on the bench is varied from its minimum to its maximum. Error magnitude is calculated by multiplying the coefficients from the variance model by the mean values of all of the independent variables except for years on the bench and years on bench, squared. Those two are varied together. This shows that variance is lowest at the extremes—new judges and very seasoned judges—and is highest in the middle, peaking around 14 years of tenure."
"33","The results with respect to women and minority judges are also noteworthy. The signs of both coefficients on these variables are negative as hypothesized, but only the race variable reaches any level of conventional statistical significance (p = 0.065). Thus, the results suggest that minority judges are more variable in their decision making."
"34","On the other hand, prior judicial experience does not appear to influence the variance. Moreover, ideologically extreme judges, contrary to the hypothesis, are not less variable in their decision making. While Collins (2008) finds that ideologically extreme Supreme Court justices exhibit less variation in decision making, that result is not generalizable to the lower federal appellate bench, at least not using the measures employed here.         "
"35","The analysis of circuit characteristics suggests that at least two of the three hypothesized influences affected the level of uncertainty around judicial choice. As shown in Table 1, dissent rate contributes substantially to the variance; that is, judges in circuits with high dissent rates are more variable (less consistent) in their decision making. Although ideological heterogeneity of the circuit does not appear to influence the variance as hypothesized, court size increases the variance as judges in larger circuits have wider error terms around their decisions than those sitting on smaller courts. As scholars continue to explore the role of institutional identities in judicial decision making, these findings reinforce judges' accounts and the conclusions of existing scholarship, which suggest circuit norms and practices mediate the choices judges make.         "
"36","Finally, the cases themselves can affect variability in decision making. As expected, increasing levels of case complexity correspond to greater unpredictability in judicial voting. Civil rights and civil liberties cases also contributed to increases in the error variance. Contrary to expectations, however, neither criminal cases nor those raising tax, patent, and copyright issues had a statistically significant effect on the variance."
"37"," Table 2 illustrates the magnitude of these effects, which shows the changes in the magnitude of the error for all of the significant influences on the variance. When all variables are at their respective means (and years on the bench squared is set to mean years on the bench, squared), the error is 0.712. That error increases by over 500% in the most complex case, 73% for the most nonconsensual circuit, 26% for the largest circuit, and 50% in a civil rights/liberties case. The “easiest” case in the dataset reduces the error by 50%; the newest judge has 12% less error, and the most senior judge has 50% less error, all else held constant.         "
"38","Scholars have increasingly recognized the important role played by the U.S. Courts of Appeals in the development of legal policy in the United States. Consequently, more attention has been paid toward investigating the determinants of voting decisions of the judges who staff these courts. In these attempts, scholars have learned that the decision‐making process of circuit judges is best understood to be a function of law, policy preferences, and institutional factors relating to the unique contexts in which these judges make decisions."
"39","What previous studies have failed to consider, however, is that the ability to predict these judicial decisions also varies in substantively important ways. Modeling the error variance in a vote choice model generated new insights concerning the role of judge‐level factors, institutional features, and case characteristics in explanations of judicial decision making. Notably, consideration of a judge's tenure in the model revealed decision making to be a dynamic phenomenon with a judge weighing policy preferences and institutional constraints differently, depending on the stage of his or her career. As life expectancy has increased and the average age of an appointee has fallen, the findings become particularly compelling with judicial careers likely to span several decades."
"40","The model also suggests the need to examine further whether minority and Caucasian judges respond to different sets of influences when deciding cases. Given the mixed findings of existing research, it may be questioned whether empirical tests of the direct effects of race on decision making can adequately capture the policy consequences of diversity on the federal bench."
"41","The results also suggested that select circuit court characteristics affect the ability to successfully predict judicial votes. In particular, increases in both circuit dissensus and court size positively contribute to the error variance in the choice model. These findings may have implications for those currently debating proposals to divide the Ninth Circuit."
"42","The importance of this study, however, extends beyond these contributions. Courts in the United States have been subject to criticism in recent years. Some members of Congress, for example, have leveled specific allegations against sitting judges (see, e.g., Goodnough 2005; Possley 2005; Stolberg 2005), and at least one conservative commentator has compared them with the 9/11 hijackers (Robertson 2005). Perhaps this negative attention is the result of increasing awareness that these lifetime appointees yield substantial policy influence. But, in fearing that influence, one assumes that these actors consistently, and in a partisan way, enact their policy preferences into law. The findings reported here question that assumption as those with more experience on the bench tended to exhibit more variable behavior, particularly in more complex cases. More broadly, these findings argue for additional research on the predictability of vote choice in other institutional contexts where political actors similarly enjoy long careers, including bureaucrats and legislators.
