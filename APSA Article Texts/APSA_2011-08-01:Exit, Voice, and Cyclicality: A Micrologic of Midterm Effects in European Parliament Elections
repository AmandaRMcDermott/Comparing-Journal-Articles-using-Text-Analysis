"1","EVL is a general model at the interface of economics and politics. It describes a market‐like situation where suppliers compete for the favor of consumers. The actors populating the model may be firms and customers, organizations and members, states and citizens, or (as in this article) parties and voters. But let us stick to the general terminology for the sake of a short refresher."
"2","The sequence of the model starts with a drop in quality of the product offered by a supplier. Due to incomplete information, the supplier does not learn immediately about this lapse but has to observe consumer behavior. Consumers who notice the drop in quality have two options. They may switch to another supplier (“exit”) or they may advise their supplier to address the problem (“voice”). A third, residual option is to remain inactive. Consumers’ choices among these options can be explained by a set of factors involving costs and benefits."
"3","One factor is loyalty. If consumers are loyal to their suppliers, voice is more likely (breaking a bond of loyalty implies psychological costs); otherwise exit prevails. A second factor is exit options. Attractive exit options make exit more and voice less likely (choosing a less attractive supplier implies opportunity costs). However, consumers may also use exit options strategically to lend credibility to their voice, which reverses the pattern (highly credible voice may generate maximum benefit). A third factor is consumers’ expectations of the influence they may exert on suppliers. High expectations make voice more and exit less likely (renouncing effective influence may lead to suboptimal payoff). This completes the basic structure of the model."
"4","EVL has been applied to numerous phenomena, and Hirschman himself reviewed these literatures (1974, 1986). However, even a more recent review (Dowding et al. 2000) did not find any applications in the field of voting behavior. This is particularly surprising given that Hirschman (1970, 62ff.) devoted an entire chapter to electoral competition and saw such problems as “privileged topics for the testing and refinement” (1974, 18) of his theory. Scholars have only recently begun to follow this hint, and several questions remain to be explored. My first aim is to sketch the elements of EVL in the electoral context. I will define exit and voice as electoral choices, relate loyalty to party identification, and interpret quality in terms of valence and position.         "
"5","Exit and voice in politics seem to imply grand efforts. Voice may require mass demonstrations or civil disobedience, and exit may go as far as forfeiting one's citizenship. In democracies, however, the people dispose of a more basic means: the vote. Most fundamentally, a citizen who is dissatisfied with her party may choose exit and support another party at the polls. In Table 1, this is represented by conversion, the combination of voting and exit. Moreover, the voting act also offers an opportunity for voice (Kang 2004; Kselman and Niou forthcoming). Casting a vote for a party other than the one usually supported may serve to signal dissatisfaction. In Table 1, this is represented by “voice‐by‐choice,” the combination of voting and voice.            "
"6","For voice‐by‐choice and conversion, the immediate observable behavior is vote switching. However, in electoral behavior more than in other domains of EVL, it is important to distinguish a formal act from its underlying motive (cf. Hirschman 1970, 104). Converts abandon their parties and do not intend to return. For voice‐by‐choice, however, defection is a short‐term strategy. The intention is to voice dissatisfaction with the old party, not to reward or stay with another one. Importantly, different motives have different implications for aggregate election outcomes: voice increases volatility, but exit may cause realignment.            "
"7","Exit and voice in elections are not restricted to switching, but may equally work through abstention. While Hirschman saw exit as a change of suppliers, exit by abstention gained prominence in Bélanger (2004) and Bélanger and Nadeau (2005), who investigate the effect of political disaffection on participation and third‐party choice. General dissatisfaction with party politics may lead to alienation, the combination of abstention and exit in Table 1. Unlike exit through conversion, alienation—as already in Downs (1957)—reflects exit from the whole party system. The potential consequences of exit therefore extend to dealignment and declining turnout.            "
"8","Somewhat paradoxically, abstention may also reflect voice. Citizens may withhold electoral support from a party to signal dissatisfaction. In elections, action and inaction are not mutually exclusive (cf. Ajambo 2007). Nonvoting does not necessarily imply abandonment of political influence (as in the case of alienation), but may also be interpreted as purposeful behavior. In Table 1, this is represented by “voice‐by‐silence,” the combination of abstention and voice.            "
"9","Loyalty is an attitude that influences the exit‐voice decision. Hirschman described it as a “less rational, though far from wholly irrational” motive (1970, 38). This hybrid nature reflects the double function of loyalty as “exit tax” and “voice subsidy” (Gehlbach 2006, 403). As exit tax, loyalty keeps dissatisfied voters from deserting their parties. As voice subsidy, loyalty animates voters to fight poor performance and malpractice. Loyalty thus combines two reference points: the organization that profits from voice and the individual who would suffer from exit.            "
"10","In the electoral context, the concept of party identification comes to mind. Tellingly, Pizzorno interprets Hirschman's loyalty “as a degree of identification” (1986, 360) that contributes to self‐identity and recognition. Anticipating Pizzorno's language, Miller saw party ID as giving rise to “an important part of the individual's self‐identity as a political actor” (1976, 22). In the classic Michigan study, the terms “identification” and “loyalty” are practically interchangeable (Campbell et al. 1960, e.g., 121). Party ID is an excellent candidate for the role of loyalty.            "
"11","Hirschman (1970) refers to the criterion that consumers use to evaluate suppliers as “quality.” A basic assumption is that all suppliers produce the same good, but they differ in their ability to deliver high quality. In the electoral context, such goods can be compared to valence issues where parties and voters agree on the desirable policy outcome (Stokes 1963). Voters choose according to the criterion where parties differ—their competence to deliver.            "
"12","A second expression of supply goes beyond valence. Hirschman (1976) noted that quality (and its decline) may not be the same for everybody. Consumers may disagree over what should be considered a high‐quality product in the first place. In electoral competition, this is the case of position issues where preferences over outcomes diverge (Downs 1957). In fact, Hirschman (1970, 62ff.) adopted the spatial model to illustrate the political logic of EVL. Valence and position reflect different dimensions of quality which both influence the attractiveness of exit options.            "
"13","To observe EVL in voting behavior, the EU offers an ideal environment. Since Reif and Schmitt (1980), scholars have considered EP elections to be “second‐order” contests. Although they are held concurrently across Europe and yield a common legislature, EP elections are primarily of national character: national parties are on the ballot and domestic issues dominate the campaigns. This makes EP elections excellent “windows into the national political processes” (Van der Brug, Franklin, and Tóka 2008, 589). But the institutional frame is different than in national elections. The EP cannot install a government and its legislative powers are still restricted. Reif and Schmitt derived three main predictions for EP elections: turnout declines, national governing parties lose, and small parties gain.         "
"14","EVL lends itself to the analysis of these typical “midterm” effects. First, previous studies diagnosed high continuity of voting behavior in EP elections which may be facilitated by loyalty (Caramani 2006; Schmitt and Mannheimer 1991). Second, scholars found protest voting against governing parties which may reflect voice (Van der Eijk and Franklin 1996). Third, changes in voter support have been explained by conversion which may be described as exit (Heath et al. 1996; Marsh 1998; Weber 2007). The correspondence between EVL and the second‐order model was noted by Reif and Schmitt (1980, 10), but it has never been spelled out. Unfolding this logic is a new contribution to EP elections research and an original test of Hirschman's theory.         "
"15","Reif and Schmitt saw midterm effects as a behavioral consequence of institutional differences: since there is “less at stake” in EP elections, domestic factors prevail. But although second‐order status is a constant institutional condition, midterm effects may be a matter of degree. In fact, Reif and Schmitt proposed that the popularity of a government is a function of the national electoral cycle. Losses in EP elections should be highest at midterm and fade toward the beginning and the end of a legislative period. Thus, while “midterm” is a single point in time, the “midterm effect” spans the whole electoral cycle with varying intensity."
"16","EVL also helps to explain the cyclical course of midterm effects. Remember that exit‐voice dynamics are triggered by a drop in quality on the supply side. Electoral research suggests numerous arguments for why we should expect such a drop to occur mainly during the midterm. All these mechanisms are related to the two dimensions of quality discussed above."
"17","For valence, the classical theory is that of political business cycles (Nordhaus 1975). Kousser (2004) finds that increases in unemployment indeed reinforce cyclical government losses in EP elections. Other arguments are closer to Hirschman's idea of unintended slack. Kernell (1977) proposed that negative aspects of public policy disproportionately affect performance evaluations, and Oppenheimer, Stimson, and Waterman's (1986) exposure thesis expects regression to the mean in party strength. In the parliamentary systems of the EU, the latter mechanism appears to work through the large number of ordinary party officials whom cabinet participation exposes to public scrutiny.         "
"18","For position, the classical theory is that of coalition decay. Mueller (1970) argued that a president/party wins office by securing the support of a coalition of minorities. But the coalition necessarily decays once ambiguous promises are transformed into unambiguous decisions. In EP elections research, a related argument traces a drop in the quality of representation back to spatial inflexibility during the midterm (Weber 2007). Retrospective evaluations hurt mostly governing parties, but national election campaigns serve to overcome constraints and to rebuild coalitions.         "
"19","Extensive tests found much support for the second‐order model (cf. Marsh and Mikhaylov 2010). In light of this success, however, it is striking that many studies are restricted to aggregate data and take the micrologic for granted. After Van der Eijk and Franklin (1996), scholars have only recently begun to exploit the benefits of individual‐level data (Carrubba and Timpone 2005; Hobolt, Spoon, and Tilley 2009; Marsh 2009; Schmitt, Sanz, and Braun 2009). I follow this trend by drawing on the EU‐wide postelection surveys of the 1999 and 2004 European Election Study (EES)1 to identify four voter types: core voters, protest voters, converts, and alienated voters.         "
"20","Core voters stick with their party in several elections. This should not be equated with loyalty, which is an attitude, not a choice. Still, many core voters are probably partisans.         "
"21","Protest voters temporarily withdraw support from their preferred party by switching or abstention. The term “protest” does not refer to some form of Euroskeptic voting, but to a domestic strategy. Protest voters formally choose exit in EP elections, but they do so as a signaling device to maximize the impact of their preferences at home, not in the European arena itself. This motive makes protest voting an expression of voice rather than of exit. In EP elections research, a similar concept is known as “voting with the boot.”2 I will refer to this behavior as “strategic” (for the difference from conventional strategic voting, see Franklin, Niemi, and Whitten 1994).         "
"22","Converts demonstrate a preference change in EP elections that extends into the national arena. These voters follow a clear‐cut exit strategy in Hirschman's terminology.         "
"23","Alienated voters not only abandon a party but the whole party system. This form of exit by abstention is treated separately from conversion because its motivation is not defined in relative terms (“Party A is better than Party B”) but by an absolute standard (“no party is good enough”).         "
"24","The level at which the behavior of these voter types will be evaluated is that of government and opposition. Movement within these camps is not considered (see Supporting Information). This simplification does justice to the two main phenomena of the second‐order model that are united by the EVL approach: government losses and low turnout (we will revisit the role of party size). My aim is therefore to model choices between government, opposition, and abstention.         "
"25","We are now ready to derive variables from the theoretical framework that explain how voters choose among the EVL options. The effect of quality is modeled on two different levels: elections and individuals. At the election level, the task is to test whether exit and voice indeed follow cyclical quality variations. The model includes the time between the EP election and the preceding national election divided by the overall length of the electoral cycle (cf. Reif 1984). A value of 0 indicates the date of the first national election, .5 is the exact midterm, and 1 the second national election. This cycle position is considered in its simple and squared form. The simple term dominates the initial course of the curve until the squared term takes over after midterm.         "
"26","At the individual level, I distinguish valence and position. The aim is to measure the outcome of the various mechanisms of Hirschman's “drop in quality” discussed above. Since these theories make similar predictions, discriminating between them is not crucial for my purposes.         "
"27","The position variable derives from the 10‐point left‐right scales of the EES. First the distance between a voter's self‐assessed position and her perception of each party's position is calculated. Then each voter is assigned her minimum value for a government party and for an opposition party.3 The final variable is the difference between these two measures, coded so as to assign high values to promising exit options. A value of 9 means highly attractive, −9 means highly unattractive. The variable thus evaluates the most attractive exit option while controlling for the level achieved without exit.         "
"28","As to valence, EES respondents are asked to name the most important problem facing their country (a question of saliency) and the party they think would be best at dealing with this problem (a question of competence). For government voters, a 3‐point variable is created taking a value of 1 for an opposition party, −1 for a governing party, and 0 for no party mentioned. For opposition voters the pattern is reversed. This variable too assigns high values to respondents with promising exit options and low values to attractive supply in the current political camp."
"29","Exit options could affect the likelihood of exit and voice in two ways, depending on the role of threat discussed above. They could simply make exit more likely, but they could also be used to lend credibility to voice. Therefore the hypotheses for protest voting and conversion are theoretically indeterminate and need to be explored empirically. In contrast, alienation should always be reduced by attractive exit options because the overall attractiveness of the party system is central."
"30","As already established, loyalty is represented by party ID. The EES asks respondents to name a party they feel “close” to and to rate this closeness on a 3‐point scale. Government voters are assigned this rating if they mentioned a governing party, opposition voters if they mentioned an opposition party. Loyalty should make core voting and voice more likely and exit less likely."
"31","Expected influence on party behavior is measured by two EES items tapping political efficacy and perceived system responsiveness: “So many people vote in elections that my vote does not matter” and “Most of the parties are so much alike that it does not make much of a difference which one is in government.”4 (Dis)agreement with these statements was recorded on 4‐point scales. I generated an additive index after scalability had been confirmed by polytomous Mokken analysis (Hemker, Sijtsma, and Molenaar 1995). The coding was inverted so that high values correspond to high expected influence and should be associated with more voice and less exit.         "
"32","Three control variables are included: age, education, and formerly communist countries. Owing to undeveloped habits, younger citizens should be less likely to support a party in the long run and more likely to become converted or alienated (cf. Franklin 2004). Younger citizens should also be less likely to voice because they lack the political experience required for this sophisticated two‐level strategy. Similarly, education (as measured by age when stopped full‐time education) should make voice more and exit less likely. Finally, postcommunist countries should exhibit less core voting and voice and more exit. Party system volatility there still complicates orientation for voters, and the “art of voice” (Hirschman 1970, 43) has had less time to evolve.         "
"33","Table 2 summarizes the concepts, variables, and hypotheses of my model.         "
"34","Testing the model still requires us to operationalize the dependent variable. For this purpose, EES respondents are now located in a typology with measures of behavior, preferences, and attitudes."
"35","Three survey items on voting behavior form the basis of the typology: reported vote choice in the EP election (EPE), reported vote choice in the previous national election (NE1), and vote intention in a hypothetical national election the day after the interviews (NE2). Differences between EPE and NE2 are often referred to as “quasi‐switching” (Van der Eijk and Franklin 1996; Van Egmond 2007). The aim of this approach is to reveal voter motives at the time of EPE. Vote intention in NE2 is therefore not a poor man's substitute for panel data but a measurement strategy in its own right. I adopt this approach and augment it with reported behavior from NE1.            "
"36","Core voters typically support the same camp (government or opposition) in three elections in a row. Moreover, mobilization of former nonvoters from NE1 is considered if EPE and NE2 correspond. This is necessary from a logical point of view because parties’ core support is in continuous flux at the margins, i.e., involving both outflow and inflow of voters."
"37","Protest voters abstain or switch parties in EPE. Usually they join the same camp in NE1 and NE2, but abstention in national elections is allowed if a reference party for voice can be identified. Abstention in NE1 implies that a voter has made up her mind only recently; abstention in NE2 suggests a voter who postpones her decision until potential effects of her voice occur."
"38","Converts are supposed to abandon their NE1 camp in the long run. Either they defect in EPE or they delay this decision until NE2. In the latter case, abstention in EPE may serve to minimize psychological costs involved in defection. But since conversion is defined as the combination of exit and voting (see Table 1), participation in NE1 and NE2 is essential.            "
"39","Alienated voters must indicate abstention in EPE and NE2. The intention to abstain in the long run is what distinguishes them from protest voters. Alienation also requires participation in NE1. As second‐order effects are about differences between national and EP elections, only the process of becoming alienated—but not the state of being alienated—is of interest.            "
"40","As Table 3 shows, three out of four voter types can be defined by behavioral criteria. Identifying protest voters is more demanding. For vote switching we have to ensure that the EPE party is indeed less preferred. And for abstention and switching alike, we have to ensure that the motive is indeed related to the national arena. I will address these problems in turn.            "
"41","Reif and Schmitt (1980) suggest two motives of switching in EPE. One of them is voice; the other one is a special form of sincere voting often called “voting with the heart” (Van der Eijk and Franklin 1996). Such a voter casts her ballot strategically in national elections so as to maximize its impact on government formation. EP elections, however, are a welcome opportunity to support the sincerely preferred party.5 Large parties are expected to suffer in EP elections from such behavior. To separate this effect from the dynamics of the government/opposition divide, we need to go beyond behavioral criteria and address voters’ strategic motives themselves.            "
"42","Arguably the best‐known solution for detecting strategic voting dates back to Converse's (1966) concept of a “normal vote”: voters “normally” support the party they feel close to while strategic voters contravene their party ID (see Heath et al. 1996 for an application to EP elections). I will follow a similar strategy proposed by Cain (1978) that uses more general evaluation scores of party preference. A sincere vote then means a respondent's behavior is consistent with her preference order; a strategic vote means the two are inconsistent. Such a “direct” approach is ideal for our task of identifying particular strategic voters (Blais, Young, and Turcotte 2005).            "
"43","With the “propensities to vote” (PTVs), the EES offers sophisticated measures of party preference. These items ask for the probability on 10‐point scales that a respondent “will ever vote for” each party; they are designed to capture Downsian utility (Van der Eijk et al. 2006).            "
"44","In our context, sincere and strategic voting can be distinguished on the basis of the PTV score of a voter's EPE party and the score of the reference party indicated by NE2 (or, if not applicable, by NE1). Protest voters deliberately cast a vote for a lower‐scoring party in EPE as a signal of dissatisfaction to their higher‐scoring party in NE2 (see Table 3, middle column). In contrast, “voting with the heart” would imply the choice of a higher‐scoring party in EPE than in NE2.6"
"45","This coding scheme assumes that the PTVs reflect sincere party preference. However, Van der Eijk and Franklin (1996) established that the measure already contains certain strategic aspects. In terms of expected utility, large parties with a high capacity to implement their policies should achieve higher scores owing to their sheer size. This would lead us to mistake some “voting with the heart” for “voting with the boot.” To counteract such distortion, I estimated the effect of electoral strength on the PTVs empirically and adjusted the PTV values accordingly.7"
"46","Another complication arises from the multilevel nature of democracy in Europe: besides national politics, factors related to the European arena itself may affect behavior in EP elections. Several recent individual‐level studies point in this direction (Clark and Rohrschneider 2009; Hobolt, Spoon, and Tilley 2009; Wessels and Franklin 2009). In our context, this means that abstention or switching in EPE does not sufficiently distinguish voice aimed at the national arena. I will therefore complement the behavioral criteria by attitudinal ones.            "
"47","Two criteria make sure that voice is not confounded with abstention due to (negative) attitudes toward the European arena. Protest voters must not show lower satisfaction with democracy in the EU compared to democracy in their home country, and they must not indicate lower interest in EU politics (interest in the preceding election campaign) compared to national politics (general interest in politics). If one or both of these criteria are violated, there is reason to believe that the nation‐specific scores are sufficient to make voters participate in NE1 and NE2, whereas the lower EU‐specific scores provoke abstention in EPE.8"
"48","Concerning vote choice, another criterion is used to avoid confusion of voice with switching motivated by party stances on European integration. EES respondents placed themselves and the major parties of their country on a 10‐point pro/contra integration scale. Protest voters must not be closer on this scale to their EPE party than to the party they support in national elections. If this criterion is violated, there is reason to believe that the voter was attracted by arena‐specific policy proximity rather than by the desire to signal dissatisfaction in the national context."
"49","Based on the criteria set out above, the size of the various groups in the EES of 1999 and 2004 can now be determined. We will first look at results from the pooled data and then attempt to model cross‐country variation. Table 3 shows two different percentages for each voter type: the first relative to the entire electorate, the second relative to the base of respondents who are theoretically “eligible” for a certain type given their behavior in NE1.9 For both bases note that core voters support a party of their respective camp, whereas all other types defect from it.         "
"50","Comparing the groups for government and opposition yields a surprise: protest voters, the “usual suspects” from the second‐order elections literature, do not cause government losses in EP elections. Certainly voice is widespread and contributes to generally low turnout, but it does not work against governing parties in particular. Opposition parties even suffer somewhat more from protest voting. The sources of government losses are exit through conversion and alienation. As a correlate, core voting for governing parties is less frequent than for the opposition.         "
"51","The message of these initial findings is clear. Unlike voice, exit reflects processes of sincere preference change. Defection from opposition parties remains at the protest level, but defection from governing parties passes into radical reorientation with the potential for long‐term change. In this respect, EP elections seem to have a clear role beyond being second‐order protest events."
"52","The results also contribute to an ongoing debate whether vote losses in EP elections are related to government status or to party size. The usual assumption is that government parties lose due to strategic voting in EP elections (“voting with the boot”), and large parties lose due to strategic voting in national elections (“voting with the heart”). My findings do not discredit the hypothesis of a size effect, but they do reject an interpretation of government losses as large‐party losses. Incumbency matters per se, and the process is about changing preferences, not about strategy."
"53","Skeptics may suspect technical artifacts behind these novel results. This is unlikely for two reasons. First, the typology covers defection from both government and opposition (with the latter usually being neglected). Since potential data deficits or changes of the operationalization concern both camps, the relative group sizes that yield government losses are robust. Second, voter motives are jointly determined by behavior, preferences, and attitudes. Manipulating an individual criterion is unlikely to affect the ratio of strategically to sincerely motivated voters.10"
"54","The strength of the typology is reflected in its coverage. The behavior of 60% of the electorate can be interpreted by a single theory. The remaining 40% do not fall into any EVL type. Many of them simply never vote, some may abstain or switch for reasons related to the EU, others may be indifferent between parties, and yet others may “vote with the heart” (see Supporting Information). The aim of my research design is not to isolate such additional types, and there is nothing about my theory that would require exhaustiveness. However, it is important to be aware that all voters had the opportunity to behave in an EVL fashion. To take account of those who finally decided differently, the following multinomial analysis includes a base category.         "
"55","The findings in Table 3 are challenging. What makes voters defect in EP elections? And how does one explain the specific pattern of protest, conversion, and alienation? Moreover, is there systematic variation across countries? To answer these questions, I now bring the elements of the analysis together and subject the EVL model from Table 2 to a final test.         "
"56","Predicting the likelihood of core voting, voice, and the two forms of exit requires a discrete choice model. Multinomial estimation of this model must reflect that not all respondents dispose of all options (as discussed regarding Table 3). To pass this logical information on to the statistical level, the model is estimated by multinomial conditional logistic regression. This allows me to manipulate the set of alternatives available to each respondent according to her NE1 behavior.11"
"57","As mentioned above, the base category consists of all voters not assigned to one of the four alternatives. But note that the complications of interpreting multinomial results in relation to a base category can be ignored. This is because we will not look at logit coefficients or odds ratios (which are rather abstract) but at marginal effects on probabilities (i.e., partial derivatives or slopes). This is the rate of change in the probability of an outcome related to a regressor with all covariates at their means. The estimates and their standard errors are based on 10,000 simulations drawn from the multivariate normal distribution of the coefficient vector and variance‐covariance matrix. To facilitate comparison, all variables were rescaled to a range of 0 to 1 (see Table 2).         "
"58","Another important issue concerns the multilevel structure of the data. Pooling surveys from 23 countries and 35 elections gives me power and leverage in two ways: First, I can use cross‐sectional data from countries at different times during their legislative periods to estimate cyclical effects in voting behavior, a task that would otherwise require an enormous time series. And second, I can model the behavior of voter types that would be represented by too few individuals in single‐country samples. But these advantages entail the risk that unexplained country‐level variance biases our estimates. Hierarchical linear modeling is an attractive solution to such problems. Unfortunately, estimating multiple random effects for the multinomial conditional logistic model was computationally infeasible.12 In order not to neglect the multilevel structure of the data, I will treat it as a nuisance by adjusting the statistical uncertainty of the estimates. This is achieved by reporting cluster‐robust standard errors at the election level.         "
"59","Table 4 presents the results. To begin with, the timing of an EP election in the national electoral cycle clearly affects the dynamics of EVL. Figure 1 plots the combined effect of the two cycle terms: the curves represent predicted probabilities, and different shades of gray indicate significance levels of the marginal effect. Thus, a dark line means that the rate of change of the probability of an outcome (not the probability itself) is significantly different from zero.         "
"60","                Predicted Probabilities through the Electoral Cycle                      "
"61","Note the differences in scaling. Curves are predicted probabilities. Different shades of gray indicate significance levels of the marginal effect: black—99%; dark gray—95%; gray—90%; light gray—insignificant."
"62","The effects on core voting are interpreted most easily. Core voting is least likely at midterm and most likely around national elections. The effect is stronger for the government (and barely significant for the opposition) and thus accounts for cyclical losses in EP elections."
"63","But what happens to former core voters? Exit plays its expected role: at midterm, voters are more likely to get converted or alienated, and the exit cycle is more pronounced for governing parties. The descriptive excess of exit from the government (cf. Table 3) mainly occurs during the midterm. The graphs also reveal that alienation of government voters is barely reversed toward the end of the cycle. We thus see the working not only of government losses in EP elections, but also of the general “cost of ruling” incurring in national elections (Paldam 1986).         "
"64","The most striking finding, however, concerns the role of voice. Voice against opposition parties follows the expected cyclical trend, but the same is not true for governing parties. Voice against the government is evenly distributed and does not seem to be conditioned by the timing of an EP election. Governing parties are not targeted by voice any more than opposition parties are (quite the contrary), and the absence of any midterm swing further calls the link between protest voting and typical second‐order effects into question. I will return to this puzzle below."
"65","Turning to the individual‐level variables in Table 4, loyalty (party ID) renders core voting more and exit less likely. Apparently loyalty absorbs incentives for change and stabilizes voting behavior over time. But we also find the expected positive effect of loyalty on voice: voters may actually defect from a party because they feel close to it! Long‐term attachment seems to motivate them to fight short‐term lapses by protest voting. Thus, loyalty does not only attenuate the effects of pure market forces, but it also helps to transform dissatisfaction into political action.         "
"66","Concerning the role of exit options, the valence variable shows similar effects for both camps. Attractive exit options encourage exit and discourage voice. The decision between the competing hypotheses on protest voting and conversion is clear: voters choose to exit when faced with a promising option rather than to use it to lend credibility to voice. Voice rather seems to be a desperate attempt of voters who have “nowhere else to go” (Hirschman 1970, 65).         "
"67","The position variable behaves somewhat differently. Attractive alternatives on the left‐right dimension still discourage voice for opposition voters but encourage it for government voters. Protest against governing parties is thus not only about conveying information, but it also seems to involve threat. Moreover, note that left‐right options barely depress core voting for the government, indicating that governing parties lose support across the ideological spectrum."
"68","The effect of exit options on alienation is also noteworthy. Although any reasonably attractive party should keep a voter from permanent abstention, we find the opposite. Arguably, cross‐pressures are at work: if voters learn that a party other than their “own” is better able to deal with their concerns, they may evade this problem of cognitive dissonance by abstaining. Rather than a profound aversion to all parties, this logic suggests a state of “confusion” about the organization of the party system that emerges during the midterm and is, as we saw above, hard to reverse.         "
"69","Traces of alienation also show up in the effect of expected influence. Exit from the party system is associated with low values on this variable. Voters who regard parties as categorically irresponsive cease to participate in democratic affairs. In contrast to this global logic, however, the specific hypotheses on strategic behavior do not hold. Efficacy should encourage protest voting at the expense of conversion because expected influence raises the likely payoff of voice and increases the opportunity costs of exit. Neither of these effects is observed."
"70","As for the control variables, we find several expected effects. There is less core voting and more alienation in postcommunist countries, and older voters are less likely to abandon their parties. However, the effects on voice run counter to my expectations. Voice is more likely among young, Eastern European, and rather uneducated voters. Political experience does not seem to characterize this voter type. Again, these findings shed light on the nature of voice through protest voting, which does not seem to be as strategic as expected."
"71","The model achieves remarkable performance with regard to the determinants of sincere behavior. Exit in the form of conversion and alienation follows the electoral cycle and reacts to the incentives postulated by the EVL framework. In contrast, the effects on voice in the form of protest voting initially do not contribute much to our insights into the dynamics of EP elections. Protest does not harm government parties in particular; voters do not often use exit options to apply pressure on their parties but rather exit to these options right away; expected influence on party behavior does not lead to voice but merely ensures stable support; political experience does not seem to be required to redefine a low‐stake election as an occasion to assert vital interests."
"72","All this points to one conclusion: EP elections are indeed protest events, but this protest seems to be largely free from strategic considerations. In second‐order elections, voters document dissatisfaction, but they do not attempt to bring about political change. Rather, their behavior reminds us of the concept of “expressive voting” (cf. Brennan and Lomasky 1993). In a nutshell, protest is about punishment, not about strategy. It does not differ categorically from the other types of behavior that underlie the second‐order effect, i.e., conversion and alienation. All these phenomena seem to reflect sincere motives, and protest voting may be best understood as a transitional stage. Voters remain at this stage if dissatisfaction is limited, no attractive exit option is available, or loyalty keeps them from defecting. Otherwise, radical change prevails.         "
"73","The even distribution of voice against governing parties through the cycle supports this interpretation. As a transitional stage, voice may occur where exit is about to develop or core voting is about to reemerge. All types of behavior, including voice, then seem to react to the same stimulus that is simply stronger for the government (provoking extensive and radical change with protest as a baseline) and weaker for the opposition (restricting defection to the protest level)."
"74","Voice in EP elections is not only less sophisticated than expected; it is also less effective. Hirschman (1970, 26–27) argued that competition may actually reduce the quality of supply. Even if dissatisfied customers exit, these movements may cancel out across firms and the management never learns about its lapses. A similar argument applies to protest voting. Protest does not affect government parties in particular. So, in the aggregate, voice fades away unheard.13 The same does not apply to exit where the difference between government and opposition is clearly visible. Exit, not voice, therefore signals dissatisfaction most effectively. Proposals to strengthen voice in elections through deliberative procedures target this anomaly (Gastil 2000).         "
"75","Do parties react to growing dissatisfaction? The cyclical development of exit suggests a trend toward realignment during the midterm (also see Miller, Tagg, and Britto 1986). At the time of an EP election, converts do not intend to return to their old parties. For some of them, second‐order elections serve as a trigger to enter new alliances. But many will change their minds and switch back, as suggested by the downturn toward the end of the cycle. After a period of disarray, parties seem to respond and upcoming national elections restore order (cf. Franklin and Weber 2010).         "
"76","Whereas high levels of conversion are unique to the second‐order arena, the consequences of alienation presumably spill over into the first‐order arena. This provides a substantive interpretation of Marsh's (1998) finding that EP election results affect party performance in subsequent national elections. A more general derivative is that especially the government's inability to mobilize its voters during the midterm contributes to the decline of turnout in many democracies. One could even speculate that by adding a low‐stimulus event to the electoral calendar, EP elections actually reinforce trends toward alienation (Franklin and Hobolt 2011).         "
"77","At first sight, Exit, Voice, and Loyalty is hardly impressive. It simply tells us what people do when they are dissatisfied with a social situation—do they complain or do they leave? At second sight, however, Hirschman's theory develops a kind of complexity that unites all sorts of social phenomena. Adopting EVL for the study of voting behavior proves feasible and fruitful alike.         "
"78","The empirical application has yielded novel insights into the dynamics of “second‐order” elections. Elections to the European Parliament do not seem to be prime venues for strategic protest. Instead, more fundamental processes of de‐ and realignment are evident that put a new complexion on midterm effects. These results feed back into theoretical debates about EVL. Interpreting voting and abstention as exit or voice highlights the importance of distinguishing between behavior and motives to explain reactions to dissatisfaction, and the cyclical course of EVL dynamics reflects the need to incorporate supply‐side factors into behavioral models."
"79","Three opportunities for further research stand out. First, I have modeled electoral dynamics between government and opposition, but not within these camps. Aspects of coalition formation, e.g., party size, may play a role here. Second, the EVL framework proved able to explain the bulk of voter choices, but I do not claim exclusivity. In particular, contestation in and of the European arena itself may be incorporated into the model. And third, I have used cross‐sectional data to analyze the motives behind voting behavior in EP elections, but tracing the long‐term consequences of second‐order effects is still frustrated by the lack of comparative panel data."
"80","The numerous issues I have addressed suggest that voters’ potentials to govern the outcome and implications of EP elections have been traditionally overrated. In contrast, second‐order elections research has been rather silent about the strategic capacities of parties (but see Tóka 2007; Weber 2009). Especially government parties are supposed to be caught in a protest trap. But are parties really resigned to their “European” fate, or do they follow strategies that require them to subordinate EP elections to other goals? Studies in management have long found that firms provide their employees with opportunities for voice in order to deter exit and to foster loyalty to an accessible organization (Cannings 1989; Spencer 1986). I may be pushing the analogy too far, but it seems that parties provide voters with EP elections for similar ends—to absorb protest, curtail realignment, and finally accentuate responsiveness in national elections.
