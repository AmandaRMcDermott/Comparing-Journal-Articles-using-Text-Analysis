"1","Drawing from Schelling (1960, 1966), Fearon begins his argument about audience costs with the fact that international crises take place before both external and, more importantly, domestic audiences. He argues that the latter pay attention to a leader's performance to derive estimates about the “the skill and performance of the leadership” (Fearon 1994, 580). In particular, if a leader escalates and then backs down, that leader will be viewed by audiences as having suffered a “diplomatic humiliation” (Fearon 1994, 580), not just for the leader but for the nation as a whole.         "
"2","Fearon (1994, 582) puts forward as a “plausible working hypothesis” the view that domestic audiences in democratic states have more opportunities to inflict punishment on leaders who do poorly in international crises than do such audiences in nondemocratic states.1 Therefore, he contends that escalation by a democratic leader provides a more powerful signal of resolve than does a comparable level of escalation by a nondemocratic leader, and, being more likely to experience audience costs, democratic leaders will be less likely than their nondemocratic counterparts to back down after a given level of mutual escalation.2 In light of this higher potential for audience costs, democratic leaders, other things being equal, resolve disputes among themselves at lower levels of threats, and they have a comparative advantage in inducing nondemocratic leaders to back down during a military crisis.         "
"3","The subsequent empirical literature on audience costs has produced mixed results. For example, Schultz's argument (2001) that democratic leaders add to the credibility of their threats against nondemocratic leaders when they do so with the approval of opposition political parties is consistent with an audience costs argument. However, Schultz does not argue that democratic threats will be credible because making empty threats will reduce domestic approval, but instead an opposing state recognizes that the opposition party in a democratic state has little incentive to collude in a bluff by that country's leader. Thus, if the opposition supports the leader when the latter makes a threat, then this “essentially confirms that the government is serious about carrying through of the challenge” (Schultz 2001, 95).         "
"4","Gelpi and Griesdorf (2001) focus more directly on the audience costs hypothesis. They argue that democratic leaders experience higher potential audience costs than do authoritarian leaders as they take escalatory actions during a crisis, and thus they will be more likely to achieve a favorable outcome. They demonstrate support for this hypothesis in an analysis of crisis outcomes from 1918 to 1994. They find that democracies that escalate higher than their opponents are likely to prevail in crises, whereas democracies that fail to match the escalatory behavior of their autocratic opponents are likely to capitulate. Relative escalatory behavior has little impact on crisis outcomes, however, when neither side has an audience cost advantage. These results are consistent with the audience costs thesis, but Gelpi and Griesdorf do not actually observe the imposition of audience costs, nor do they directly observe how autocratic leaders perceive the credibility of democratic escalatory behavior. Instead, they infer the impact of audience costs from the observed patterns of domestic institutions, escalatory behavior, and crisis outcomes.         "
"5","Tomz (2007) provides some direct evidence of audience costs—albeit within the context of hypothetical responses to a survey experiment in which subjects were presented with a scenario in which the U.S. president faced a decision on how to respond to a foreign military crisis. Tomz finds that respondents who were told the U.S. president took some counteraction but then desisted were much more likely to express disapproval of the president's performance than those who were told the U.S. president had decided to stay out of the crisis. Hence, Tomz inferred, presidents who respond to a crisis by starting down the path of escalation but then stop and fail are likely to experience audience costs.         "
"6","The studies by Schultz (2001), Tomz (2007), and Gelpi and Griesdorf (2001) provide some buttressing for the audience costs hypothesis. Yet Levendusky and Horowitz (2012) find that the audience costs effects in Tomz's (2007) experiment may be ephemeral if in a modified experiment presidents can offer explanations for why they elected not to escalate during a crisis. Chiozza and Goemans (2011) find in their statistical analyses very weak links between performance in international crises and leaders’ ability to retain office. Downes and Sechser (2012) argue that audience costs arguments do not explain the success and failure of democratic states in crisis bargaining that involve coercion. Snyder and Borghard (2011) find through an intensive qualitative analysis of numerous international crises that there is no systematic evidence that domestic constituents punish leaders by removing them from office for failing to follow through on a threat. Finally, Weeks (2012) finds that authoritarian leaders who rely heavily on support from an institutionalized civilian elite will be more sensitive to audience costs than other types of autocratic leaders, raising the question of whether they are not systematically different in their conflict behavior from democracies.         "
"7","While audience costs arguments have focused on the punishment of empty threats, other game‐theoretic work, and in particular the pathfinding work by Smith (1998), has examined the impact of domestic institutions on foreign policy in terms of the opportunities that foreign policy performance affords citizens to evaluate the competence of their leaders.3 Literature on diversionary war, for example, argues that the domestic response to the use of force will depend on the outcome of the military operation (Hess and Orphanides 1995; Richards et. al 1993). Similarly, Bueno de Mesqita et al. (1999, 2004) suggest that democratically elected leaders will be punished (i.e., they will be at a heightened risk of being removed from office) based in part on popular assessments of their foreign policy success. Empirical literature on U.S. public opinion also suggests that public responses to the use of force will depend critically on the success and wisdom of the operation (Eichenberg 2005; Gelpi, Feaver, and Reifler 2009; Jentleson 1992).         "
"8","Constituents could view a wide variety of aspects of participation in a militarized dispute as evidence of foreign policy incompetence—including the occurrence of a larger than expected number of casualties, the failure to achieve the desired objective, the selection of an inappropriate or unwise military mission, or simply having the dispute last longer than constituents deem necessary. Rather than try to specify ex ante which aspects of MID participation will lead to inferences of incompetence, we suggest measuring domestic judgments of foreign policy incompetence through constituents’ approval of the handling of militarized disputes by their leader."
"9","Some literature on U.S. public opinion and foreign policy has already examined the impact of candidates’ handling of foreign policy issues on their appeal to voters (Aldrich, Sullivan, and Borgida 1989; Anand and Krosnick 2003; Nincic and Hinkley 1991). Most of this work has focused on electoral behavior and especially the reelection of incumbent presidents. The general consensus in this literature is that public attitudes toward foreign policy frequently have an impact on individual voting choices, although the resulting impact on electoral outcomes is difficult to estimate (Aldrich, Sullivan, and Bordiga 1989). For example, assessments of foreign policy may have been important in individual evaluations of George W. Bush in 2004 (Gelpi, Reifler, and Feaver 2007; Hillygus and Shields 2005), but it is not clear what impact foreign policy had on Bush's bid for reelection (Karol and Miguel 2005; Norpoth and Sidman 2007).         "
"10","More generally, if audience costs can only be expressed in terms of the removal of leaders from office, then the opportunity for imposing audience costs within the context of democratic political systems (especially those with fixed election cycles and term limits) is extremely limited. After an American president has served 4 years in office, for example, constituents have one opportunity to impose audience costs. Even if Americans care only about foreign policy when casting their vote, the United States is generally involved in several militarized disputes during each presidential term. Thus, presidential performance in any single dispute will inevitably be only one part of a voter's single decision about whether to support an incumbent running for reelection."
"11","In thinking about where we might find costs at home for poor performance abroad, we turn to the finding from American politics that an elected leader is likely to value public support because of the policy goals that this support allows her to accomplish. In particular, Fenno (1973) found in his study of members of Congress and their strategic choices in congressional committees that a political leader cares about her standing with voters not just because of the latter's impact on leadership tenure but also because of the leverage that this popularity can give her in accomplishing her policy goals, which in turn have an intrinsic value to that leader. More recently, Cohen (1997) has suggested that American presidents need to be responsive to public opinion and to show leadership on public policy matters, including foreign policy, and that striking a politically viable balance between these two tendencies is a central determinant of presidential performance in the modern era. Cohen suggests that a president might even sometimes pursue policies that cut against public opinion, but by attaining successful policy outcomes, the president can reattain public confidence. Such success is important for two reasons: It contributes to building a favorable posttenure legacy, and more salient for our analysis, “desirable policy outcomes boost the confidence of the public, which leads to greater levels of approval and popularity. This may translate into reelection victory, greater influence with the Congress, and greater leeway in future policy decisions” (Cohen 1997, 234, emphasis added).         "
"12","Cohen's (1997) suggestion about presidential influence with Congress leads us to our contention that we might be able to observe and measure competency costs by way of an investigation of possible links between public approval of a president's handling of foreign policy crises and that president's ability to establish laws that move domestic public policy toward his or her preferred position.         "
"13","Public perceptions of incompetence on foreign policy issues could reduce an elected leader's ability to pass legislation as a result of the operation of at least two different mechanisms. First, public perceptions of a leader's foreign policy incompetence may cause legislators to be less willing to make concessions to the leader in order to pass legislation. Those who are generally supportive of the leader may become less flexible because they fear that an unpopular chief executive may not be able to provide them with “coattails” that will sweep them back into office. Thus, they may feel unable to make “tough” votes that may be controversial with their constituents if they lack confidence that support from the chief executive can help them retain office. Those who are generally opposed to the leader, on the other hand, may become less willing to make concessions to an “incompetent” leader because they believe that they can gain some advantage with their constituents by opposing an unpopular chief executive."
"14","Second, perceived foreign policy incompetence may limit a leader's domestic legislative success because foreign policy issues may begin to crowd domestic items off the legislature's limited agenda. As the public becomes dissatisfied with a leader's handling of a foreign policy issue, legislators may feel increasing pressure to address these issues by holding hearings or more generally engaging in public debate on the issue, either in an effort to change the policy toward a more effective one or simply to distance themselves from the failure in the eyes of their constituents. Discussion of these foreign policy failures thus may crowd domestic items—especially controversial ones—off the legislative agenda."
"15","We believe that this argument will apply quite broadly to democratically elected leaders. However, we also expect that substantial cross‐national differences in the electoral rules, the structure of national legislatures, and the relationship between the legislative and executive branches will make it difficult to test these expectations with a general cross‐national statistical model. Thus, we focus our analysis on the American presidents’ efforts to push legislation on domestic affairs through the U.S. Congress."
"16","While in one sense the United States provides us with only one “case study” of the impact of foreign policy competence on legislative success, for a number of reasons it is an especially helpful test of our argument about competency costs. First, the United States is the most powerful democratic state in the world and has been engaged in more militarized disputes than any other state over the past half century. Thus, U.S. domestic audiences have had more opportunity to judge the competence of their leaders in foreign crises than voters in any other nation. Second, the United States is a presidential system with fixed election cycles and a term limit on the chief executive, making it difficult for constituents to impose costs through the generally hypothesized mechanism of removal from office. Thus, while the United States is only one country, it represents something of a “most important case” for our competency costs argument."
"17","Our central hypothesis is that a president who performs well in military crises will earn a popular perception for foreign policy competence. This popular perception of competence will generate greater political leverage with regard to the legislature that will translate into a higher probability of moving preferred laws on domestic matters through Congress. On the other hand, a president who performs poorly in military crises will earn a popular perception of foreign policy incompetence that will undermine his leverage with legislators and prevent him from pressing the administration's domestic legislative agenda.            "
"18","We base our analysis of foreign policy competence and domestic legislative success closely on recent work regarding presidential influence with the U.S. Congress. In particular, we build on work by Beckmann (2010). He focuses in the first instance on the circumstances under which the president is successful in having domestic policy bills of interest to the administration brought to a vote in Congress. Most importantly for our concerns, he also models the conditions under which Congress actually passes bills that move U.S. domestic public policy toward the preferred issue position of the president.         "
"19","Beckmann (2010) pays special theoretical and empirical attention to the effect of lobbying efforts by the president in advancing the administration's domestic legislative agenda. He seeks in particular to account for the impact of such lobbying on the variation in presidential legislative success on 769 domestic legislative bills that were given sustained consideration in Congress between 1953 and 2004. In our analysis below, we examine 744 domestic legislative bills that were considered between 1953 and 2001, the time period covered by MIDs Version 3.1.         "
"20","Figure 1 presents the overall distribution of the 744 bills in our study across seven domestic policy domains, and it describes the distribution of bills within each of the 10 presidential administrations we examine. Clearly, we observe substantial variation in the incidence of bills by policy domain during the second half of the 20th century: While tax bills represented 3% of the total congressional bills considered between 1953 and 2001, about 15% dealt with energy issues, and 26% concerned U.S. health policy.4"
"21","Interestingly, however, this distribution of bills remains fairly constant across presidential administrations. The exception to this pattern is the health policy domain: It rose to relative prominence only with the Johnson administration, after which it became the domestic policy domain that garnered the largest relative incidence of domestic legislation in Congress."
"22","Beckmann (2010) finds that the degree to which the president actively worked to move a bill through Congress (e.g., speaking publicly in support of the bill, reaching out to contact members of Congress to press for its approval) is positively associated with domestic legislative success. In seeking to estimate the impact of such presidential activity, Beckmann controls for the partisan and ideological makeup of representatives and senators, the temporal place of the president (honeymoon period as opposed to being a lame duck), the type of domestic issue the law relates to, and the “political capital” the president enjoys (which is measured by combining two variables, polling on presidential approval and the growth rate in U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP). Most importantly for our purposes, Beckmann's only engagement with the foreign policy literature is to include a measure of “exogenous” events, such as scandals or wars, that may affect the president's legislative success (Beckmann 2010, 175). We build upon Beckmann's work by incorporating a measure of competency gains and costs arising from the president's performance in foreign military crises into an analysis of presidential domestic legislative success.         "
"23","As noted above, we base our measure of perceived competence on public approval of the president's handling of foreign military crises, and in particular MIDs. A militarized dispute is an instance in which one state threatens to use force against another state, undertakes displays of force against another state, or actually employs military force against another state. The United States was involved in 218 different MIDs between 1953 and 2001. As can be observed in Figure 2, the United States became involved in at least one new MID in each of the years between 1953 and 2001. On average, between 1953 and 2001, the United States became involved in about four new MIDs each year, and since MIDs sometimes continued for more than one year (notably, the Vietnam War), the United States was involved in an average of almost six MIDs per year. Total MID and new MID involvement both reached high levels during the Eisenhower, Johnson, Reagan, and Clinton administrations.            "
"24","America's level of MID involvement across presidential administrations varies substantially from lows of 10 and 12 disputes, respectively, for Presidents Ford and George H. W. Bush (for whom we have only one year of data), to highs of 53 each for Presidents Reagan and Clinton, and 43 for President Eisenhower. But a great deal of the variation in presidential MID involvement appears to be related to the number of years different presidents served. Figure 3 displays total MID involvement and MID involvement per year across all 10 presidential administrations that we examine. If we consider administrations without regard for the number of years in office, we observe a range in total MIDs by president from a low of five to a high of 53 MIDs, with an average of 28 MIDs, and a standard deviation of almost 18. If, by contrast, we consider the annualized participation rate by each president, the range of MID participation shrinks from a low of three disputes per year for George H. W. Bush to a high of about eight MIDs under Lyndon Johnson, with an annualized average of about six MIDs, and a standard deviation across administrations of 1.5.5 Hence, it would seem that on an annual basis, presidents found it necessary to deal with a roughly comparable number of MIDs. Our question, however, focuses on how the public assessed their performance in those MIDs and how that perceived performance affected the capacity of presidents to advance their domestic legislative agenda.            "
"25","To address this question, we searched the database at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of Connecticut Database for all survey questions that were fielded to a national random sample of adults relating to U.S. involvement in each MID in which the United States was involved between 1953 and 2001. After compiling all questions referencing U.S. participation in a militarized dispute, we selected only those that asked respondents for their approval of the mission involving the MID, their approval of the president's handling of the mission, or their judgments about the success of the mission. We excluded questions that asked for hypothetical judgments about future events or potential policy choices. For each of the remaining questions, we divided the response categories into those that were supportive of the president, those that were opposed to the president, and those that were neutral (e.g., not sure, don't know). We dropped neutral responses and recorded the proportion of the positive or negative responses that were supportive of the president.6"
"26","For each MID, we averaged the supportive responses to all questions about each MID during each year. That is, we calculated the average public support for each MID during each year in which the MID occurred. Since the United States was often involved in more than one MID in a particular year, we then averaged the support for each of the MIDs in each year to calculate the average level of support for the president's handling of all U.S. militarized disputes during each year. Since MIDs vary greatly in terms of their public salience (and therefore their likely impact on competency costs), we assign a weight to each MID in the form of the log of the number of casualties incurred in that MID during that year.7"
"27","An example may help to clarify our coding procedures. In 1991, the United States was involved in four militarized disputes. Two of these disputes—the Persian Gulf War and the Iraqi No‐Fly Zones—were salient enough to generate polling questions. We identified 80 questions about the Persian Gulf that met our coding criteria, and these questions had an average approval rating of 82%. We also identified 21 questions in 1991 related to the No‐Fly Zone dispute, with an average approval rating of 72%. The United States suffered 143 killed in action in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and zero casualties in the No‐Fly Zone dispute. We added the constant e (e.g., 2.781) to the number of casualties in all disputes in order to make the log transformation possible. As a result, the Persian Gulf War approval rating receives a weight of 0.83, whereas the No‐Fly Zone dispute approval rating receives a weight of 0.17, and by consequence President George H. W. Bush receives a foreign policy approval rating of approximately 80.5% for 1991."
"28","As noted above, the United States was involved in at least one MID during every year between 1953 and 2001. However, these crises were not all salient enough to generate polling questions from the media about the dispute. Thus, we created a dummy variable identifying years in which the United States was involved in a MID that generates at least one polling question. Including this variable in our analysis accounts for the fact that we are measuring the impact of approval contingent on a question being fielded to a national sample of adults.8"
"29","While our polling data and Beckmann's (2010) data on bill passage allow us to measure support for the handling of MIDs at the annual level, we also conduct an analysis measuring the average level of foreign policy support for the president within each congressional term from the 83rd Congress to the 108th. Many analyses of congressional behavior—including Beckmann (2010)—analyze significant legislation by congress rather than by year. Aggregating support across congressional terms limits the variation in our key independent variable and thus represents a conservative test of our argument. At the same time, conducting these analyses brings our work more closely in line with congressional scholarship.            "
"30","Finally, we include a measure for the log of casualties the United States suffered in combat each year. We include this variable both because it is used as a weight in the measure of public approval and because a number of analyses emphasize the importance of casualties in shaping public approval of military conflict. By including this variable, we can separate out the impact of casualties on legislative success from other factors that may create public perceptions of foreign policy competence."
"31","We drew the remainder of our data directly from Beckmann's (2010) analysis of presidential influence and domestic legislative success. Beckmann's unit of analysis is the individual bill. The dependent variable for each case is whether the legislative result was the signing of a bill into law that moved domestic policy on the issue in question closer to the president's position than the status quo ante. If the president was successful in passing such a bill, Beckmann codes the outcome with a value of 1. Otherwise he codes a 0. Cases coded as 0 could include instances in which no law was passed, or in which the House and Senate successfully overrode a presidential veto and moved policy away from the president's preferred position.            "
"32","Figure 4 displays the annual rate of domestic legislative effectiveness based on Beckmann's (2010) data as well as our annual estimate of public support for the president's handling of foreign military crises from 1953 to 2001. The average annual level of public support for the president's handling of MIDs was 60.1%, but it dropped as low as 26% and rose as high as nearly 83%. These data suggest that during the period under review the American public was generally fairly supportive of the president's handling of MIDs,9 but they also suggest substantial variance in support. Interestingly, while support for the president's handling of MIDs declined during the Vietnam War, it actually reached its nadir during the Cold War scares of the mid‐1980s under President Reagan. Foreign policy support reached its peak, on the other hand, as George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton confront Saddam Hussein's Iraq in the early and late 1990s, respectively.            "
"33","One striking feature of Figure 4 is the very large number of years in which the public was polled about U.S. involvement in one or more MIDs. As we noted above, the United States was actually engaged in MIDs during every year of this dataset, but the data in Figure 4 demonstrate that many of these disputes were salient enough that media organizations chose to ask the public their opinions about them. While there are a few gaps in the public assessment of MIDs, especially during the early years of Jimmy Carter when the United States was engaged in few publicly salient MIDs, these data suggest that we have sufficient evidence to assess the impact of public support for the handling of MIDs on domestic legislative success.            "
"34","Figure 4 also indicates that the average annual rate of presidential legislative success during this period was 43%, but once again this level varies widely. Not surprisingly, presidents seem to enjoy greater domestic legislative success under unified government. Specifically, the average rate of legislative success when the president's party was in control of both houses was 58%, whereas the average rate of success was 27% otherwise. Lyndon Johnson achieved the highest annual rates of legislative success in 1965 and 1966 at over 90%, and Reagan met with the greatest gridlock on Capitol Hill in the mid‐1980s with success rates of less than 20%.            "
"35","Finally, while one should be careful about inferring relationships from the visual inspection of a bivariate graph, the data in Figure 4 do seem to suggest that there may be some connection between public evaluations of presidential crisis performance and the president's level of domestic policy success on Capitol Hill. Specifically, the bivariate correlation between foreign policy support and legislative success on an annual basis is 0.21. A simple Prais‐Winsten regression of average annual levels of foreign policy support on legislative success reveals a strongly positive and statistically significant relationship. Specifically, a 1% increase in support for the president's handling of MIDs leads to a 0.74% increase in the percentage of legislative wins for the president (p < .01).10 Of course, this analysis does not allow us to control effectively for numerous other causes of legislative success, such as White House lobbying, the Senate filibuster pivot, and so on. For that analysis, we turn to a replication and extension of Beckmann (2010).            "
"36","Beckmann's (2010) analysis of presidential legislative success focuses primarily on the president's lobbying efforts. He measures this concept with a three‐category variable that identifies whether the president actively lobbied, endorsed a position on the issue, or took no public position. Beckmann also includes control variables measuring the policy distance (in DW‐Nominate scores) between the president and the median member of the House on the issue at stake in the bill, as well as the policy distance between the president and the filibuster pivot in the Senate. His model accounts for the salience of the bill both with a word count of statements connected to the bill in the Congressional Quarterly (CQ) record as well as a dummy variable identifying bills in which a CQ “key vote” occurred in at least one chamber. Beckmann also includes dummy variables marking the honeymoon and lame duck sessions for each president as well as the president's total tenure measured as a count of the total number of congresses each president has faced. Finally, Beckmann accounts for the amount of political capital that a president has by combining his average Gallup approval rating for the year with a measure of economic growth, and he records the total number of salient external events (as identified by Lebo and Cassino 2007) that occurred during each year.            "
"37","Following Beckmann, we use a probit model to estimate the president's likelihood of “winning” on each domestic policy bill.11 We begin our analysis by replicating the results of Beckmann (2010). The results in the first column of Table 1 are virtually identical to those Beckmann reports (2010, 141).12 This is Beckmann's most comprehensive model of presidential legislative success, which he calls the “most important” indicator of presidential influence in Congress (2010, 129).         "
"38","Consistent with Beckmann's (2010) expectation, presidential lobbying efforts have a significant impact on his success in passing legislation that moves domestic policy toward his preferred position. This is the central finding of Beckmann's book, and in his view presidential power is illustrated by the great efficacy that the White House has in pushing legislation when the administration in office chooses to do so. Not surprisingly, the president's policy distance from the House median and Senate filibuster pivot also significantly influences legislative success, as does the salience of the bill in Congress, the president's overall level of political capital, and the number of external events going on during the year the bill was passed.         "
"39","In the second and third columns of Table 1, we add our measures of perceived foreign policy competence during MIDs measured at the annual and congressional levels. In addition, we include our dummy variable for the existence of a MID salient enough to generate a question on a national poll, as well as the log of U.S. casualties suffered in all MIDs during each year. We should note that including these variables in Beckmann's (2010) model of legislative success is an especially stringent test of our hypothesis because we retain his control variables for presidential political capital and the occurrence of salient external events.13 Thus, our analysis captures the impact of popular judgments of foreign policy competence over and above the president's overall standing with the public in terms of popularity and economic growth as well as the impact of the simple existence of external events.         "
"40","Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that support for the president's involvement in foreign military crises has a positive and statistically significant impact on his ability to persuade Congress to pass laws that move policy closer to his preferred position on domestic policy. Moreover, we find that this relationship remains robust regardless of whether we measure support on an annual or a congressional basis. The coefficients for the presence of a foreign policy crisis large enough to generate a poll question are negative and statistically significant, but these coefficients must be interpreted with some care. Since our measure of foreign policy support is essentially an interaction term that measures popular support when a poll question is fielded, the coefficient for the foreign policy poll question allows the model to estimate separate intercepts for legislative success when foreign policy crises are and are not salient enough to generate polling questions. Consequently, this coefficient measures the difference between circumstances in which a poll question is not asked and circumstances in which a poll question is asked and popular support is zero. Since we never observe foreign policy support lower than 26% in our data, this coefficient is modeling a data point that extrapolates our model well outside the observed data. We investigate the impact of not having a foreign policy crisis more carefully when we evaluate predictions from our model."
"41","Surprisingly, the log of casualties is positively associated with legislative success. While we did not specify a hypothesis about the impact of this variable, one would not intuitively expect casualties to generate support from Congress. As we shall see below, however, this finding is not robust. The public appears to be forming more specific judgments about the president's handling of militarized disputes that are more complex than an automatic aversion to casualties."
"42","All of the coefficients in Beckmann's (2010) model remain relatively unchanged by our introduction of the foreign policy variables. The distance from the president to the House median is only statistically significant at the .10 level rather than the .05 level. This shift is due to an increase in the size of the estimated standard errors, not a change in the substantive size of the estimated coefficient. Additionally, the coefficient for the number of external events becomes insignificant in our analysis of support aggregated by congress.         "
"43","Next, in Table 2, we further investigate the robustness of the relationship between foreign policy support and domestic legislative success by adding additional controls. The models in the first and second columns of Table 2 account for any idiosyncratic aspects of legislative success that may be associated with a particular president. Lyndon Johnson, for example, was widely viewed as a skilled legislator on Capitol Hill and an effective legislative lobbyist on Pennsylvania Avenue, whereas Jimmy Carter has often been judged as an ineffectual or perhaps even counterproductive advocate for legislation. But Johnson's tenure in the White House was also associated with foreign policy casualties and substantial variance in perceived foreign policy competence, and Carter experienced relatively few militarized disputes and no American casualties. The association of these idiosyncratic legislative leadership characteristics with the experience or handling of militarized disputes might confound our analysis.         "
"44","Fortunately, these results indicate that the impact of foreign policy support on legislative success is essentially unchanged by the inclusion of presidential fixed effects. The coefficients for foreign policy support remain nearly identical to those reported in Table 1. The coefficient also remains statistically significant in our analysis at the congressional level. The coefficient in our analysis of annual support remains unchanged, but the inclusion of fixed effects drops the statistical significance below the 5% level to p < .07. In both of these models, the positive effect of casualties noted in the previous analyses disappears. This result suggests that the association between casualties and legislative success is purely a function of Lyndon Johnson's legislative prowess, which is obviously associated with a substantial number of U.S. casualties in Vietnam. American casualties per se did not appear to hinder Johnson's ability to push domestic legislation through Congress, but public disapproval of his handling of Vietnam did.         "
"45","The third and fourth columns of Table 2 demonstrate that our results also remain robust when we control for the domestic issues at stake in each of the bills. Presidents are generally more successful in passing certain kinds of bills—especially those related to taxes and spending. These results ensure that our results are not a function of the differing mixes of bills considered by each congress.         "
"46","Having demonstrated that popular assessments of foreign policy competence are associated with legislative success, our next task is to assess the substantive size of the effects—both in absolute terms and relative to the key determinants of legislative success identified by Beckmann (2010). The impact of foreign policy support is very stable regardless of whether we measure it annually or by congress, and so we focus on the estimated effects at the annual level. These estimated effects are slightly weaker than the predictions from the congressional‐level data, and so they represent a more conservative description of the impact of foreign policy competence.         "
"47","Figure 5 displays the impact of foreign policy support along with several of the key variables from Beckmann's (2010) model. The columns represent the change in the probability that a president will “win” on a particular bill (i.e., that Congress will pass a law moving policy in that president's preferred direction) as each variable changes from its 5th to its 95th percentile. The vertical black bars represent the 95% confidence intervals around these estimated effects. The figure indicates that an increase in popular support for the president's handling of military crises from the 5th to the 95th percentile (e.g., from 38% to 78%) increases the probability that Congress will pass a bill that the president supports by approximately 20%. This effect is roughly comparable to the impact of all the major variables highlighted by Beckmann in his analysis. Changing the distance between the president and the House median from the 5th to the 95th percentile reduces the probability of success by 17%. However, this result does not quite achieve statistical significance at conventional levels, as indicated by the fact that the 95% confidence interval for this effect crosses zero. The impact of the president's distance to the Senate filibuster pivot is slightly larger at 23%, and this effect is statistically significant. Additionally, the impact of White House lobbying efforts—Beckmann's central variable—has the largest marginal impact at 24%. Overall the impact of the president's perceived competence at handling foreign policy crises has a comparable impact to many of the factors that congressional scholars would more typically emphasize as central to legislative success. Finally, the far right‐hand column in Figure 5 indicates that a change in the president's overall political capital from the minimum to the maximum level increases the probability that he will “win” on a bill by about 17%. Thus, the impact of perceived foreign policy competence is as influential as other aspects of political capital captured in Beckmann's model.         "
"48","The results in Figure 5 demonstrate that changes in foreign policy support have a significant impact on legislative success on domestic policy issues. But these effects only compare the effects of popular and unpopular conflicts. How does legislative success in the wake of competent or incompetent crisis behavior compare to legislative success in the absence of any substantial foreign policy disputes? Do presidents involved in crises receive a rally effect in the legislature similar to those observed among the public (Mueller 1970; Oneal and Bryan 1995)? Or, alternatively, does avoiding international disputes lead to greater success on Capitol Hill than even the most successful handling of crises? Figure 6 depicts the change in the predicted probability that a president will “win” on a particular bill as we change our foreign policy support variable from a situation in which that president is not engaged in any disputes to a situation in which he or she is engaged in disputes that receive a weighted average of 80%, 50%, and 30% support, respectively. The columns reflect the predicted change in the probability of success on a particular bill, and the vertical black bars indicate the estimated 95% confidence intervals around those predicted effects.         "
"49","The left‐hand column indicates that MID involvement reduces a president's chances of legislative success by 2% even if he or she receives 80% public support for his or her handling of a crisis relative to a situation in which there is no engagement in an international dispute. However, this effect is substantively negligible, and the wide vertical bars around this column indicate that the estimated effect does not approach statistical significance. If a president's handling of a foreign policy dispute receives a more mixed 50% level of support, on the other hand, the probability that he or she will succeed in passing a bill declines by a more substantial 17% relative to no dispute involvement. Also, the fact that the vertical black bars do not cross zero indicates that this drop in legislative effectiveness is statistically significant. Finally, if a president becomes engaged in an unpopular dispute that receives only 30% popular support, his or her probability of legislative success drops by a striking 25% relative to a situation in which there is no engagement in a militarized dispute. This reduction in legislative success is statistically significant and is also substantively quite large—since the predicted probability of legislative success in the absence of polling on a MID is 43%."
"50","Taken together, the results in Figures 5 and 6 indicate that the incompetent handling of military crises by a president is very costly both relative to the competent handling of crises and relative to the avoidance of crises. That is, our results suggests that public judgments about presidential competence in handling foreign crises are truly competency costs with regard to the president's influence on Capitol Hill. Once he or she is involved in a conflict, a president must maintain public support for his or her handling of a dispute or he or she will lose legislative influence. However, a president gains no leverage over Congress by consequence of achieving a foreign military success. When considering military involvement, the best that a president can attain with respect to Capitol Hill is that he or she will succeed abroad and thus not lose legislative leverage at home. However, presidents who escalate international crises are placing their domestic legislative agenda at risk. Should their handling of the crisis become unpopular, they will suffer costs on Capitol Hill for their incompetence.         "
"51","Audience costs have become one of the most widely cited mechanisms for generating credible threats in the context of international crisis bargaining. This argument has played an especially prominent role in the development of the literature on the democratic peace (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 1999, 2004; Fearon 1994; Gelpi and Griesdorf 2001; Schultz 2001; Smith 1998; Tomz 2007). But recent empirical work has raised questions about the efficacy of audience costs in creating credible threats (Downes and Sechser 2012), and even about the existence of domestic audience costs as a phenomenon (Levendusky and Horowitz 2012; Snyder and Borghard 2011).         "
"52","In response to this controversy, we have argued for the necessity of both a theoretical and an empirical reevaluation of the audience costs argument. On a theoretical level, we believe that the audience costs literature has become overly focused on the specific costs incurred by leaders as a result of capitulating after issuing public threats. At its core, the audience costs argument is about domestic constituents’ evaluations of the foreign policy competence of their leaders based on their (public) performance in international crises. The making of empty threats is only one of many possible indicators of foreign policy incompetence, and we see little reason to privilege it over all other indicators or, more to the point, the overall assessment by the public of the leader's competency during the crisis taken as a whole."
"53","On an empirical level, we note that the audience costs literature has become highly focused on removal from office as the execution of this cost. This focus is understandable, since many (if not most) theories of political behavior begin with the assumption that leaders seek to obtain and retain office. But threatening political survival is not the only kind of cost that domestic audiences can impose on leaders, and in many contexts it may not be the easiest or most efficacious punishment to carry out. For example, in many democratic polities—especially presidential systems with established term limits—constituents have very limited opportunities to remove their leaders from office. And these rare opportunities are also powerfully influenced by a wide variety of factors completely outside the realm of international politics. If voting out an incumbent leader is the only way to impose audience costs, then it seems unlikely that such costs could provide a substantial constraint on the behavior of many democratic leaders—including U.S. presidents."
"54","But while leaders do seek to obtain and retain office, they also seek to carry out a policy agenda while they are in office. Especially in democratic political systems, carrying out this agenda requires a great deal of time and effort throughout a leader's tenure in office. Thus, we have suggested that a fruitful area in which to search for evidence of the capacity of the public to punish or reward foreign policy performance by leaders may be the impact that perceived competence in foreign policy crises has on a leader's ability to push her policy agenda through the legislature. Perceived foreign policy incompetence may in particular make it difficult to pass legislation both because legislators may become less willing to make concessions to a leader who is perceived as incompetent and because the agenda of the legislature itself may become crowded with efforts to investigate and evaluate the foreign policy failures of the chief executive. This crowding of the agenda with recriminations over foreign policy failure may leave less time for both the leader and the legislators to focus on the domestic policy agenda."
"55","We have tested these arguments in the U.S. context through an analysis of public evaluations of presidential handling of MIDs and legislative success in Congress between 1953 and 2001. We have found strong and consistent support for our hypothesis that public perceptions of foreign policy incompetence reduce the president's ability to persuade Congress to pass laws that move domestic policy in his or her preferred direction. At the same time, while public dissatisfaction with the president's handling of disputes reduces legislative success, we find no evidence that high levels of public support for the president's handling of MIDs yield a higher rate of success on Capitol Hill than the president would have enjoyed in the absence of engaging in MIDs in the first place. Thus, engaging in militarized disputes opens the president to the risk of competency costs in the event that the resolution of the crisis is unsatisfactory, but MIDs do not provide the president with an opportunity for a domestic legislative rally effect."
"56","It is important to recognize the limitations of our results as well as the remaining opportunities for future research. Our analysis is clearly limited by our focus on the United States. While we believe that the general logic of our competency costs argument should apply across all democratic polities, the great cross‐national variations in the structure and function of executives and legislatures make it difficult to conduct a single aggregated cross‐national test. We believe that the United States is an excellent place to begin the investigation of our competency costs argument both because the United States plays a prominent role in many military conflicts and because the United States possesses a presidential system with term limits that make the imposition of traditionally conceived audience costs through removal from office so difficult to observe. We hope that future research seeks to expand this research agenda to include not just other possible forms of competency costs but other democratic polities as well."
"57","Our results are also limited to the post–World War II era. While it will be possible to update our analysis to include more recent disputes as the MIDs dataset continues to expand, an analysis of this type is limited by the availability of survey data and the use of scientific survey techniques. In the United States, survey data are not generally available prior to the mid‐1930s, and the sampling techniques used in surveys prior to the 1950s make handling those older data problematic (Berinsky 2009; Braumoeller 2010). In other democratic polities, survey data may not be available until more recently. Future research might be able to address these measurement problems—and thus allow the examination of competency costs in the presurvey era—by developing alternative measures of perceived foreign policy incompetence, such as the content analysis of media reporting on militarized disputes.         "
"58","Finally, it is worth noting that while our results provide evidence that democratically elected leaders suffer competency costs as a result of the perceived mishandling of international crises, our analysis cannot address the question of whether these costs allow leaders to make credible threats in international crises. Nor can we address the question of whether democratic leaders feel these competency costs more acutely than autocrats, or whether this sensitivity gives democratic leaders a “competency costs advantage” in crisis bargaining. These are all important questions that require further exploration. However, our results do make an important contribution to this literature by demonstrating the presence of competency costs in the real world. It is the documentation of these costs that makes the investigation of their consequences for crisis bargaining an interesting and important question."
"59","In sum, we find real‐world evidence of substantial costs that presidents pay in the event that the public becomes dissatisfied with their handling of militarized disputes. These results are good news from a normative perspective inasmuch as presidents should be mindful that the initiation, escalation, and/or unsatisfactory termination of military conflicts may jeopardize their ability to enact many of the policies that are both the reason that they ran for office and the foundation of their hopes for reelection. Yet, at the same time, our results provide no evidence of incentives for a president to engage in legislation through diversion by initiating or escalating a militarized dispute in order to push his or her domestic agenda through the legislature."
