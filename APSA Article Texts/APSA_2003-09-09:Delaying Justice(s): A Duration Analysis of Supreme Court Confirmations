"1","Given the importance of the Supreme Court in the national policy‐making process, it is not surprising that social scientists have paid a great deal of attention to Supreme Court appointments. Many studies have focused specifically on the confirmation process, taking (at least implicitly) the existence of the nominee as exogenous to the process.3 These studies have provided substantial insights on a number of topics. For example, scholars have examined the influence of policy preferences on senators' voting decisions (Cameron, Cover, and Segal 1990; Segal, Cameron, and Cover 1992), the institutional factors that affect confirmation (Scigliano 1971; Segal 1987; Silverstein 1994), and the relationship between the characteristics of the position that has opened on the Court and a nominee's success (e.g., Ruckman 1993). In addition, scholars have looked outside the three branches to examine the role played by interest groups (Caldeira and Wright 1998; Segal, Cameron, and Cover 1992) and the role of citizen preferences on issues such as race (e.g., Overby et al. 1992).         "
"2","Other studies have focused on a variety of features of the nomination process. Some of these studies have emphasized the primacy of policy concerns during the nomination stage (e.g., Watson and Stookey 1995; Moraski and Shipan 1999; Bailey and Chang 2001), while others have focused on the significance of personal attributes and factors (e.g., Yalof 1999; Nemacheck and Wahlbeck 1998).3 Many of these studies either explicitly or implicitly treat the nomination process as a game in which a president will anticipate the Senate's action and, based on his knowledge of the Senate's preferences, will choose a nominee who is closest to his ideal point and whom the Senate will approve. To the extent that such anticipatory behavior occurs, we would expect the Senate to approve all presidential nominees. And in fact, that is close to what we observe. Since the end of the Civil War, the Senate has confirmed nearly 90% of the nominees that it has considered.         "
"3","While there is very little variance in the outcome of the confirmation process, this does not mean that the Senate treats all nominations equally.3 Perhaps the single biggest difference across nominations has to do with how quickly the Senate completes the confirmation process. As Figure 1 shows, there is plainly a great deal of variance in the duration of the confirmation stage. The Senate addresses many nominations very quickly, acting upon (and usually confirming) a majority of nominees within 24 days of their nomination. For a substantial number of nominees, however, the process takes longer than this. Some, such as Sandra Day O'Connor, take slightly longer, but are approved within 50 days. Others, such as David Souter or Anthony Kennedy, are approved within 75 days. And still others, such as William Rehnquist or Clarence Thomas, take up to 100 and 125 days, respectively. While all of these examples, and most other nominees, were eventually approved, clearly there is a large amount of variance in the process leading to Senate action that needs to be explained in order for us to have a more complete understanding of the politics of confirmations.         "
"4","                 Duration of Supreme Court Nominations                      "
"5","While scholars have begun to investigate the causes of delay in the confirmation of lower federal bench nominees (Binder and Maltzman 2002; Binder 2001; Martinek, Kemper, and Van Winkle 2002; Bell 2002; Hartley and Holmes 1997, 2002), very little is known about the factors that influence the duration of the confirmation stage for Supreme Court justices. Yet understanding the variance in this duration is important for a number of reasons, some of which have to do with policy implications, others of which have to do with political implications, but all of which create the incentive for the Senate to behave strategically.            "
"6","First, given that the Supreme Court makes crucial policy decisions across a wide range of policies, delaying the confirmation of a nominee may have important policy implications. Supporters of a nominee want to get him or her on the Court as soon as possible, so he or she can start influencing arguments, deliberations, and case decisions. Opponents, on the other hand, want to delay this process. Even if these opponents know that most nominees will be approved, the longer it takes the nominee to reach a seat on the Court, the longer it will take him or her to start affecting the Court's policy decisions. While long durations are not standard, as Figure 1 demonstrates, they also are far from rare. And because the Court generally continues to hear and decide cases during confirmations, this creates an opportunity for members of the Senate to engage in strategic behavior, sometimes expediting the process and sometimes delaying it.            "
"7","Taking this logic one step further, the longer opponents can delay the nomination, the better chance they have of rejecting the nominee, perhaps due to the discovery of a scandal (Cameron and Segal 2001). And our data verify that confirmations that take longer are more likely to fail: the number of days of Senate deliberation and the final outcome of the nomination are negatively correlated (r =−.37, p < .001). In addition, Figure 2 takes the duration categories from Figure 1 and reveals that the more days spent in deliberation, the less likely the nominee is to be confirmed. Thus, opponents not only delay the date on which the nominee takes a seat on the Court, but in some cases, by increasing the duration, they increase the likelihood that a nominee will be rejected.            "
"8","                 Probability of Confirmation                         "
"9","Second, Supreme Court confirmations are pivotal events in American politics. These are the most high‐profile appointments that a president makes, and in some cases a new justice can shift policy outcomes toward the president's ideal point. But the importance of the confirmation process to the president extends well beyond its policy significance. To begin with, a long, hard‐fought battle over a nominee can affect a president's standing with the public and with the Congress. Recent work by Groseclose and McCarty (2001), for example, has demonstrated that a political actor (e.g., Congress) can use the presence of a third party (e.g., the public) to inflict political damage on its opponent (e.g., the president) in a bargaining situation. In the case of Supreme Court appointments, it is possible that as the Senate drags out the confirmation process, the president will suffer politically. To the extent that this occurs, the Senate will benefit in numerous other ways, such as in bargaining with the president over legislative bills, the budget, executive branch acts, and other appointments.            "
"10","To determine whether there is any evidence that the president might suffer politically from a long, drawn‐out confirmation process, we collected Gallup's presidential approval data from 1937 to 1994. For each nomination, we determined the president's approval rating at the time closest to the nomination and also at the time closest to the final action (confirmation, rejection, withdrawal, or end of session), then subtracted the initial approval rating from the final approval rating. Thus, this is a positive number if a president's approval ratings went up during the nomination battle, and a negative number otherwise. Next we looked to see whether there was a correlation between the length of the process and the change in presidential approval. The correlation is negative and strong (r =−.38, p < .05). This cannot be taken as conclusive proof that longer confirmations lead to lower presidential approval ratings, as it may be that declining approval ratings cause confirmations to take longer. Yet, we can say with confidence that longer confirmations go hand‐in‐hand with a decline in approval ratings. Consequently, the president is likely to be weaker, vis‐à‐vis the Senate, at the end of a long confirmation process.3"
"11","Third, lengthy hearings bring attention to specific political and policy issues. During the Thomas confirmation, for example, the Senate and the public initially focused on Thomas's attitudes toward abortion; but later the focus shifted to the issue of sexual harassment and, to a lesser but still important extent, race. Similarly, O'Connor's nomination forced questions over abortion to the fore (O'Connor 1996). During the Bork nomination, questions about ideology and the meaning of the Constitution took central stage. Earlier nominations raised other issues, such as the debate about the relationship between religion and government that ensued from the nomination of Louis Brandeis. Conversely, shorter hearings can limit the likelihood that any damaging issues will be raised. Questions about the role that a former Ku Klux Klan member should play in the government might have arisen in the case of Hugo Black, as his connection with the Klan was known prior to his confirmation. But because the nomination was rushed through the Senate without hearings, the issue did not come up during his confirmation and became a controversy only after he was approved (Watson and Stookey 1995).            "
"12","Finally, the study of the duration of the confirmation process can provide us with some insight into a separate issue: the consequences of divided government. Over the past decade, many scholars have followed Mayhew's (1991) lead and have attempted to sort out whether the presence of divided government reduces the likelihood the government will pass important laws (e.g., Howell et al. 2000). Others have looked at the influence of divided government on a variety of other topics, including the partisanship of laws (Thorson 1998), the use of presidential vetoes (Cameron 2000), and delegation to bureaucracies at both the federal and state levels (Epstein and O'Halloran 1999; Huber and Shipan 2002; Huber, Shipan, and Pfahler 2001). Given the relationship between divided government and these other things, it might be expected that divided government would influence whether the Senate approves a president's Supreme Court nominees.            "
"13","Somewhat surprisingly, however, divided government does not seem to affect the likelihood that the Senate will approve a nominee. In Table 1 we create a variable called Confirmed, which takes on a value of 1 if the Senate confirms the nominee and 0 otherwise, and use probit to regress this variable on Divided Control, which takes on a value of 1 when the president's party does not control the Senate and 0 when his party does control the Senate. The results show that divided control is not a significant predictor of a nominee's success or failure.            "
"14","In one sense, the results in Table 1 are not surprising. Krutz, Fleisher, and Bond (1998), in their comprehensive analysis of all presidential nominations to all offices and positions between 1965 and 1994, found that divided government was not a significant predictor of Senate confirmation. On the other hand, we might expect that if divided government is important in a range of other areas, then it would certainly be significant for appointments to the Supreme Court.3 It is possible, however, that divided government does have an influence on the confirmation process, but that the influence is subtler than simply determining whether the nominee is accepted or rejected. Instead, divided government may affect the pace at which a confirmation occurs, which in turn leads to all of the consequences discussed earlier in this section.            "
"15","As this discussion makes clear, the duration of Supreme Court confirmations has a number of implications for policy and politics. It also may provide additional insight into the effects of divided government on the political process. Yet at this point, we know very little about the duration of Supreme Court confirmations. In the next section we begin to remedy this gap by building on a theory of the appointment process."
"16","In a recent article, Moraski and Shipan (1999) develop a theory that explores the interaction among the president, the Senate, and the Supreme Court over nominations to the Court. The primary goal of their “Nomination Game” is to identify which of these institutions will be influential (and when) during the nomination process. More specifically, the game spells out the conditions under which the president will or will not be constrained in his choice of a nominee. Thus, the theory focuses specifically on how institutions and preferences shape Supreme Court nominations.         "
"17","Moraski and Shipan model the process as a game in which all actors seek to obtain the best possible policy outcomes from the Court. In the first stage of the game, the president acts strategically and considers the preferences of the Senate when selecting a nominee.3 The Senate then considers this nominee and ultimately votes to confirm or reject him. Based on this sequence, the model identifies three distinct nomination regimes. While the interested reader is directed to Moraski and Shipan's article for the model's details, for our purposes we need to spell out the conditions under which each of these nomination regimes occurs and to see what implications these regimes have for the confirmation process.         "
"18","The first regime exists whenever xs < xp < xj, where xs is the ideal point of the median member of the Senate, xp is the President's ideal point, and xj is the ideal point of the median member of the Court.3 Under this regime, the president is completely unconstrained and can choose a nominee, xn, who shares his ideal point (i.e., xn=xp), since any nominee he chooses will move the new Court median toward not only his ideal point, but also toward the Senate's ideal point as well. Certainly, the Senate would prefer a nominee located at xs, but it prefers one located at xp to one located closer to xj, and it also prefers the new median produced by the president's nominee to the status quo.         "
"19","In the second regime, the Senate is closer than the president to the Court median, and the president and the Senate median both are more liberal, or more conservative, than the Court.3 Under these conditions, the president may choose a nominee who moves the Court toward his ideal point; but unlike in the first regime, he is somewhat constrained by the Senate and cannot simply choose a nominee who shares his ideology. Instead, he must choose a nominee who will be located near the Senate median (i.e., such that xn= 2xs–xj). From the Senate's point of view, this will produce a new Court median that is just as good as the status quo. Furthermore, most senators will favor this nominee because of his close proximity to the Senate's ideal point and because he may cause future Court decisions to shift toward the Senate median.         "
"20","Regimes 1 and 2 exist whenever the Senate and the president both are more liberal, or both are more conservative, than the Court. In the third regime, however, the Senate and president are typically more ideologically distant from each other and are situated on opposite sides of the Court (e.g., when xp < xj < xs). Given such a configuration of preferences, the president is fully constrained in his choice of nominees—he cannot move the Court in his direction at all, because any movement in this direction is a movement away from the Senate's ideal point. Similarly, the Senate cannot force the president to nominate someone who will move the Court toward its preferred point, as this would represent a movement away from the president's ideal point. Hence, the equilibrium prediction for this third regime is that the president will nominate someone whose ideal point is located at the current Court median (i.e., xn=xj).         "
"21","What implications do these three nominations have for the duration of the confirmation stage? In the first two regimes, if the Senate approves the president's nominee, it will gain from approving a new justice whose policy preferences are similar to those of the median member of the Senate and who causes the new Court median to be at least as good, and often better, than the status quo. To the extent that senators are motivated by policy concerns—either because they treat policy as an intrinsic goal, or because they view policy as a means toward another goal, such as reelection—they will want to move quickly to approve nominees in these first two regimes."
"22","The third regime, however, is different. We expect the Senate to be more likely to delay approval in this regime for three reasons. First, since there is little likelihood that the president will nominate someone who would move the Court toward the Senate in this regime, the Senate will have no incentive to confirm the nominee quickly. That is, unlike the first two regimes, in which the Senate benefits, both immediately and in the future, from approving the president's nominee, in the third regime there is no policy payoff to approving a nominee and hence no incentive to act quickly. Given that senators have limited amounts of time, and numerous ways to spend this time, they will see little payoff to acting quickly in this regime."
"23","Second, it is conceivable that in such a regime, the president might attempt to move the Court toward his own ideal point and away from the Senate's ideal point (Johnson and Roberts 2001). While the Nomination Game is one of perfect information, we can briefly consider what would happen in Regime 3 if the Senate and president were uncertain about the exact location of the nominee. Instead of a nominee whose ideal point is equal to xj, consider a nominee located at xj+ω, where ω ∈ [−ɛ,ɛ]. To begin with, if we assume that senators are risk averse, they will prefer the status quo, with the Court median remaining at xj, to a nominee whose ideal point is distributed around this point. Furthermore, because the Senate will worry that the president might try, even in such a regime, to move the Court toward his ideal point, it will spend more time evaluating such a nominee in an attempt to learn the sign and size of ω. Thus, uncertainty about the location of the nominee in this regime will lead to a longer confirmation period.3"
"24","Third, and perhaps most importantly, the Senate may benefit from prolonging the confirmation process and might achieve some political, as opposed to policy, benefits from drawing out the confrontation over a nominee in this regime. As we discussed in the previous section, Congress can benefit from prolonged showdowns with the president, and evidence indicates that a drop in presidential approval is correlated with the length of the confirmation process. To the extent that the Senate prefers to face a politically weakened president—most likely because the president and the Senate majority are from different parties—it will see some benefit in a protracted battle over confirmations. Thus, we expect the Senate to benefit from delay in the third regime, because it is in this regime that we are most likely to see a great degree of ideological disagreement between the president and the Senate, with a liberal president opposing a conservative Senate or a liberal Senate opposing a conservative president."
"25","The preceding discussion shows that although the primary purpose of the Nomination Game is to explain the ideological position of nominees, it also has clear repercussions for confirmations. More specifically, it has implications for the speed of the confirmation process. The Senate will have an incentive to act more slowly, for both policy and political reasons, in the third regime than in the first two regimes. We turn now to a test of this hypothesis."
"26","To test our hypothesis about the relationship between the political regime and duration, we have collected data on all Supreme Court appointments since the nomination of Henry Stanbery in 1866. We chose this time frame because it allows us to examine all nominations that have taken place under the stable two‐party Republican‐and‐Democrat system and during the period in which the size of the Court has remained fixed at nine members. The resulting dataset has information for 87 nominees. Of these 87 nominees, the Senate confirmed 75, rejected 7, and took no action on 2. The remaining three nominations were withdrawn from consideration."
"27","For our empirical test, ideally we would like to determine the specific regime type for each nominee to the Court. Unfortunately, Moraski and Shipan's analysis provides regime classifications for only a limited number of nominees, those nominated in the post‐WWII era. Furthermore, although Moraski and Shipan find strong support for their model based on the regime classifications that they computed, Bailey and Chang (2001) have introduced an alternative method for determining interinstitutional ideal points that casts some doubt on these classifications.         "
"28","Fortunately, we can draw on the definition of the third regime to develop appropriate and available proxies. Recall that the primary characteristic of the third regime is that the Court's ideal point lies between the ideal points of the president and the Senate. To the extent that the president and Senate are located close together, the nomination is more likely to be in the first two regimes, under which we expect quick confirmations. On the other hand, when the Senate and the president are located far from each other—when they are ideologically distant—the Court is much more likely to be located between these other two actors."
"29","Thus, one good proxy for Regime 3 is Divided Control, which takes on a value of 0 when the president's party controls the Senate and 1 otherwise. Under divided control, the president and Senate are more likely to be ideologically far apart from each other, thereby increasing the likelihood that the Court lies between the two. Another good proxy for Regime 3, one which taps into the partisan underpinnings of ideological disagreement that we discussed in the previous section, is the distance between the president and the median member of the Senate majority party. The greater this distance, which we call President‐Majority Party Distance, the more likely it is that the Court lies between the president and Senate. To determine the median position of the majority party in the Senate, we use first‐dimension DW‐NOMINATE scores, which are available for our entire time period and which are scaled to allow comparisons across time. Because these scores are not available for presidents before Truman, as a proxy for the president's ideal point, we follow McCarty and Razaghian (1999) and McCarty and Poole (1995) and use the value for the median member of the president's party in the Senate.3 Since we take the absolute value of the difference between the two parties' medians, this variable will take on a value of 0 under unified control and positive values under divided control.         "
"30","The primary hypothesis derived from the theory is that delay is more likely during periods where the president and Senate are farther apart ideologically. To measure this ideological distance, we therefore rely on the two measures described above—a dichotomous measure (Divided Control) and a more continuous measure derived from DW‐NOMINATE scores (President‐Majority Party Distance, which is actually the same as the distance between the two parties interacted with Divided Control). Because these two variables are so highly correlated with each other (r = .94, p < .001), we test both in separate equations, but do not include them in the same regressions.3"
"31","While Divided Control and President‐Majority Party Distance are the primary theoretical variables we wish to test, we recognize that a number of other factors might also cause the Senate to give greater scrutiny to a nominee, thereby prolonging the confirmation process. While these do not derive directly from the Nomination Game, they are factors that other empirical and descriptive studies have identified as influencing the confirmation process and need to be included in our statistical tests.            "
"32","First, the nominee's personal characteristics might affect the length of the confirmation process. In particular, following our earlier discussion, any characteristics that decrease the Senate's uncertainty about a nominee will reduce the duration. To begin with, if, for example, the nominee is currently or has previously served in the Senate, we expect a quicker confirmation. We particularly expect less delay for nominees who are currently serving in the Senate, as other senators will be familiar with the nominee and will take less time to gather information during confirmation hearings. As Abraham has argued in his vivid history of Supreme Court appointments,"
"33","                              "
"34","Would any of the thirty [nominees] who failed in being confirmed have been approved had they been members of the Senate at the time of their nomination? The evidence is persuasive that they would have: the Senate almost invariably treats as a cas d'honneur the Presidential designation of a sitting member and normally also, although not so predictably, of a past colleague in good standing. (1999, 33)                  "
"35","To capture this effect we create two variables—Current Senator and Previous Senator—which we set equal to 1 for nominees who fit those descriptions.            "
"36","We also include the age of the nominee as an independent variable (Palmer 1983). Because appointments to the Court are lifetime appointments, it is conceivable that a younger nominee, who might have a long tenure on the Court, will come under greater scrutiny than an older nominee. Thus, we expect that as this variable, Age, increases, the duration of the confirmation should decrease.            "
"37","Another nominee characteristic that might influence the duration of the confirmation battle is the nominee's level of qualification, since all else equal, highly qualified nominees are likely to be approved more quickly than less‐qualified nominees (Spaeth 1979). To account for this factor, we rely on measures of nominee quality that are accessible for all nominees in our data.3 We employ three dichotomous variables, State Court Experience, Federal District Court Experience, and Federal Appellate Court Experience, which indicate whether the nominee served on a court at one of these levels. Such experience serves as a measure of quality (Hartley 2001) and also can decrease the Senate's uncertainty about the nominee's ideology. Hence, we expect the presence of such prior judicial experience to expedite the confirmation process.            "
"38","Second, characteristics of the position on the Court itself might influence the duration of the confirmation process. One such characteristic is whether the nomination is to the position of chief justice. Such nominations might take longer than other nominations, as the chief justice has numerous powers, such as the power to assign opinions when he is part of the majority, that are greater than those possessed by associate justices (e.g., Maltzman, Spriggs, and Wahlbeck 2000). To account for this, we include a variable called Chief Justice, which takes on a value of 0 for associate justice nominations and 1 for chief justice nominations.            "
"39","While all appointments to the Court are important, some are more important than others because they hold out the possibility of an immediate change in the Court's behavior. Following Ruckman (1993), we define a Critical Nomination as one that would have a substantial influence on the partisan balance of the Court—more specifically, a nomination in which the replacement of a departing justice by someone from the opposing party would lead to a one‐member partisan split, create a partisan deadlock, or establish a new partisan majority on the Court. Furthermore, we would expect that while all critical nominations will take longer than noncritical nominations, those critical nominations that take place during divided control are likely to come under even greater scrutiny. Thus, following Binder and Maltzman (2002), we also include the interaction of Critical Nomination with Divided Control.            "
"40","Third, we include variables that capture the role of the Senate and the president. Divided Control and President‐Majority Party Distance, which were discussed at length earlier, obviously tap into the level of disagreement between the president and the Senate. In addition, we also need to control for the timing of the nomination within the congressional session. Grossman and Wasby (1972) note that the timing of nominations is occasionally a key factor in confirmation, particularly for late‐session nominations under a Senate that is attempting to complete business before the end of the session. A nomination made near the end of each session will reach its final outcome, whether approval, rejection, or the end of the session, more quickly than a nomination made earlier. To capture this potential effect, we include a control variable called Time Remaining in Session, which we operationalize as the number of days from the date of nomination to the last day of that congressional session.3"
"41","It is also possible that factors specific to the president will affect the length of the confirmation. Based on studies of Supreme Court confirmations (Segal 1987; Ruckman 1993) and also the duration of lower court appointments (Binder and Maltzman 2002; Martinek, Kemper, and Van Winkle 2002), we include two such factors: Unelected, which equals 1 for presidents who obtained their position through succession rather than through election, and Last Year, which is set equal to 1 in the last year of a president's term (Segal 1987).            "
"42","We recognize that there are other factors that might influence the duration of the confirmation process. A nominee who faces a scandal, for example, can be expected to face a more drawn‐out confirmation process than a nominee with a spotless record. Of course, it is possible that the discovery of a scandal is endogenous to the duration—the longer the duration, the more time opponents have to uncover a scandal (Cameron and Segal 2001). More importantly, perhaps, there are no readily available historical data on scandals; and since the focus of our article is not on scandals, we do not pursue this issue further.3 We also lack precise data on a number of other factors that might influence the duration of a nomination. For example, presidents with higher approval ratings might be able to move their nominees through the Senate more quickly. Similarly, we might expect nominees who are strongly supported by major interest groups to sail through the Senate more quickly than nominees who face significant opposition. However, these sorts of data are unavailable for our entire time period.            "
"43","We use a hazard rate model to test our hypotheses about delay in the confirmation process (McCarty and Razaghian 1999; Bell 2002; Binder and Maltzman 2002; Martinek, Kemper, and Van Winkle 2002). The hazard model is particularly well suited for investigating the duration of the confirmation process, as our dataset contains several nominees on whom the Senate took no action. This methodological approach is superior to alternatives such as OLS, where information on these right‐censored nominations would be lost. A duration model allows us to treat these nominations as right‐censored and to avoid the selection bias that would occur if we eliminated nominees on which the Senate took no final action.         "
"44","A hazard model allows us to estimate the effect of variables on the hazard rate of an event (Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones 1997). Since we are interested in explaining the length of the confirmation process, in this case the hazard rate is the “risk” of Senate action—that is, the risk of confirmation or rejection.3 Thus, the hazard rate tells us the likelihood that the confirmation process will reach its conclusion at time t +1 if it has not done so at time t.         "
"45","For our analysis we use the Cox proportional hazard model, which makes the least restrictive assumptions for the baseline hazard in the class of continuous time‐event history models.3 The hazard rate formula is:            "
"46","We can determine if a variable increases duration by looking at its effect on the baseline hazard rate. A positive coefficient indicates that the variable increases the hazard rate, which means that the presence of the variable increases the rate at which the Senate is likely to take action. A negative coefficient indicates that the variable decreases the hazard rate of action, or that it delays such action.3"
"47","To estimate the model, we collected data on the length of time each nomination was considered before the Senate confirmed or rejected the nominee, using Epstein et al. (1996). The nomination's duration consists of the total number of calendar days from the date of the president's nomination to the date of final action.3 For reasons discussed earlier, we include all nominations sent to the Senate between 1866 and 1994 in the analysis.3 In the following sections we present the results of our Cox proportional hazard analysis.3"
"48","In columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 we provide a basic and initial test of our primary theoretical prediction. The results in these two columns demonstrate preliminary support for our theoretical proposition, with both coefficients being significant and having the expected sign. Column 1 shows that Divided Control produces additional delay in the confirmation process, while column 2 shows that as President‐Majority Party Distance increases, so does the length of the confirmation process. Interestingly, these results starkly contrast with those in Table 1, which showed that divided control had no effect on the success or failure of a nomination. Clearly, then, there is more going on during the confirmation battles than a simple “confirm” or “reject” decision, and time is an important political aspect of these battles.         "
"49","Of course, we need to control for the other variables that we identified as possibly influencing the duration of the confirmation process. Columns 3 and 4 present the results when we include these other independent variables in our analysis. The most important finding in these columns is that even when we include all of these other potential influences, our proxies for the third regime remain significant in the predicted direction, with Divided Government and President‐Majority Party Distance significant at p < .01 and p < .05, respectively.3"
"50","In addition, many of the other independent variables we identified also influence the length of the confirmation process in the ways we expected them to. Among the nominee's characteristics, we find strong support for the role of Current Senator.3 In addition, we find support for two of the three qualifications variables, with experience on a state or federal district court leading to a shorter confirmation process.3 Unexpectedly, however, appellate court experience, which is the most prestigious and visible judicial experience a nominee could have, is not significant.3"
"51","Two of the variables associated with the nature of the position have the predicted effects. First, we find that an appointment to the position of chief justice takes longer than an appointment to a seat as an associate justice. Second, we find that critical nominations take longer than other nominations, although we do not find that this effect is exaggerated under divided control. Interestingly, Binder and Maltzman's (2002) findings are exactly the opposite. For lower courts, they find that critical nominations take longer than noncritical nominations only when control of the government is divided. This discrepancy between the findings for the Supreme Court and lower courts is certainly worthy of future exploration.         "
"52","Finally, we find little support for the institutional variables.3 The amount of time remaining in the session does have a significant effect on the duration. More specifically, a nomination that is made closer to the end of the session results in a shorter confirmation process. We do not, however, find any support for the presidential variables that denote whether a president is unelected or whether he is serving the last year of his term. Furthermore, a variety of other potential presidential variables that we examined, such as whether the president is serving his second term, whether this is his first nomination, and the total number of justices he has placed on the Court, have no effect on duration.3"
"53","Based on the results shown in columns 3 and 4 of Table 2, we can calculate the substantive effect of our primary theoretical variables. As shown in Table 3, a nominee's hazard rate decreases by 47.80% during periods when partisan control of the Senate and the presidency is divided. Similarly, when the president was the most ideologically distant from the majority party in our data, the nominee's hazard rate fell by 54.16%. Consistent with Abraham's observation reported earlier, the Senate's hazard rate increased by a whopping 1,193% when the nominee was serving in the Senate at time of consideration. Table 3 shows how the hazard rate decreases for chief justices and critical nominations and increases for nominees with federal district or state court experience.         "
"54","Because of the important role that the Supreme Court plays in setting policy, the nomination and confirmation of justices to the Court is a supremely political process. Here we have shown a specific way in which political factors, such as the ideological separation between the president and the Senate, affect confirmations. Namely, these political factors affect the duration of the confirmation process."
"55","It is worth emphasizing that we derive our primary hypothesis about the effects of ideological separation from a model of the nomination process. Although the appointment process consists of two clearly related stages—first, the nomination, and second, the confirmation—previous studies of the Senate's confirmation process generally have treated these stages in isolation from each other (although see Massaro 1990 for an important exception). More specifically, most studies of the confirmation process simply take the existence of the nominee as given and ignore any implications that the politics of the nomination stage might have for the confirmation stage. Such an approach does not take into account the fact that the president's choice of a nominee is a strategic, political decision, one that is shaped by institutional configurations that may affect not only the nomination but also the confirmation. In contrast, we derive a hypothesis about confirmations from a model of nominations. Given that our results support this hypothesis, our analysis suggests that future studies of the confirmation process should not treat the nomination stage as exogenous, but rather should consider the underlying politics that led to a nominee being chosen in the first place.         "
"56","Our empirical results demonstrate that confirmation proceeds more quickly for some nominees, such as those who are sitting senators or have prior judicial experience, than for other nominees. More importantly, our results confirmed our primary hypothesis that ideological disagreement between the president and the Senate would increase the duration of the confirmation process. This hypothesis itself is not all that surprising; we might have simply stated this hypothesis as an empirical observation and used that to defend our inclusion of independent variables that measure conflict between the president and the Senate. But our approach in this article has the benefit of providing a solid theoretical basis for the inclusion of such variables and of showing how the regime type of the nomination stage can affect duration at the confirmation stage."
"57","Future research can build on this study in a number of ways. First, rejections were more common prior to the Civil War. It would be interesting to see whether delay similarly occurred during these earlier years of the republic; or if senators opposing the president have substituted delay for rejection. In addition, it would be useful to obtain more nuanced measures of some of our variables, especially qualifications. Along other lines, while some of our results are similar to those found for lower courts (Binder and Maltzman 2002; Martinek, Kemper, and Van Winkle 2002; Bell 2002), others are not, and it is worth considering why these differences might occur. For example, it would certainly be worth investigating the ways in which the higher level of salience for Supreme Court confirmations might alter the costs and benefits, relative to lower court confirmations, of delay. While these sorts of improvements would add to our overall understanding of the confirmation process, our results here have demonstrated that Supreme Court confirmations vary in theoretically predictable ways. To recognize this, scholars need to look not only at the final confirmation, which masks important political aspects of the process, but also the effect of time in the confirmation battle.         "
