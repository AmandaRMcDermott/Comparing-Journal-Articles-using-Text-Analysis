"1","From the full set of resignations we have removed cabinet reshuffles and some retirements (where there was no resignation issue). Figure 1 looks at the aggregate number of cases within each administration. Margaret Thatcher's long administration has the largest number of resignation issues overall. However, on an annual basis the number of resignation issues has increased over the past three administrations. John Major's administration (1990–97) is notable in that the number of resignations is only slightly lower than the number of nonresignations (16 resignations, 19 nonresignations). All other Prime Ministers have a far lower resignation to nonresignation ratio.         "

"3","A resignation issue may be of greater or lesser significance. A call for resignation which comes from the opposition. Moreover some calls for resignation receive very little attention from the media; the first the public may know about a particular issue is when a minister actually resigns. To distinguish the effects of these different cases we have coded all cases in terms of their media coverage. We classify an issue as one of high coverage that has been featured on the front page and/or editorial of The Times newspaper, the main source for our data (see appendix for more detail). Figure 2 shows the number of high coverage resignation issues which arose in each parliament and how many of these lead to resignation.         "

"5","Intuition suggests that a resignation issue will affect the government's popularity, but we do not believe that this is constant; rather it will vary with the corrective effect of a corresponding resignation(s). In order to ensure unbiased estimates of this corrective effect we include a relatively rich set of variables which take into account prevailing economic and political conditions. To take account of objective economic and political conditions, we follow Pissarides (1980) who estimates the effects of current objective economic indicators on the government's lead over the opposition. We include variables for the percentage change in consumption expenditure, for the first difference in the spot dollar exchange rate, for the number of claimants of unemployment benefit, for inflation measured by the percentage growth in the GDP deflator, and for the total revenue from income and expenditure taxes. Following Pissarides we also include a term to measure the time in quarterly periods to the nearest election. We also control for other political effects: we include a dummy “Labour in power” measured 1 when there is a Labour government and 0 otherwise; a variable “Terms in power” which measures the number of consecutive terms a single party has been in power; and a dummy “At war” measuring 1 for the periods of the Falklands and the Gulf wars and 0 otherwise. These data are explained more fully in the appendix. Although Figures 1 and 2 show the data aggregated within each parliament, for statistical purposes we require higher frequency data. We estimate the corrective effect of ministerial resignations on quarterly government popularity and the descriptive statistics are provided in Table 1.         "
"6","We can estimate the corrective effect of ministerial resignations on quarterly government popularity with the following ordinary least‐squares regression            "
"7","The Durbin Watson statistic for model 1 would lead us to reject the null hypothesis of no serial correlation in the error terms. However, with the Lq,t−1 term in models 2 and 3, the Durbin h statistic would lead us to fail to reject the null hypothesis of no first‐order serial correlation and so the estimates of these models should not be biased due to correlation in the error terms. The significant effects of “Labour in Power” and “Consecutive Terms in Power” in model 3 leads us to suspect, however, that the estimates in model 2 may be biased due to the omission of these variables. Model 3 then provides the best OLS estimates we have for the hypothesized corrective effect. The results are encouraging. We observe a positive corrective effect through the term RESq*HCRES.ISSUEq. For resignation issues which receive front page or editorial coverage there is a negative effect on government support of around 5% which is offset by a 6.4% point increase if there is a corresponding resignation.         "
"8","The estimates in Table 2 may understate the true effect of resignations if, as intuition suggests, ministers are more at risk when the relative support of the government is low. If the government is polling poorly in comparison to the opposition or its lead is narrowing, the replacement of one minister by another may be seen as a short‐term remedy. If this is so then the terms involving resignations in (1) will be correlated with the error term leading to inconsistent estimates of the effects of resignations on government popularity. If there is a negative relationship between the level of support for the government and the likelihood that a resignation occurs, the direction of the bias in the estimates will be downwards. Since we wish to estimate the short‐term incentive for the Prime Minister to fire, IV regression presents a framework within which we can address this issue. We estimate an endogenous resignations model consisting of the following equations:            "
"9","             "
"10","             "
"11","             "
"12","In order for IV to provide consistent estimates they must be correlated with the RHS variables in the structural equation, but uncorrelated with its error term. This precludes the use of Lq,t−1 as an instrument. To overcome this problem we follow a three‐stage procedure. We first‐estimate Equations (3–5) with unadjusted variables using IV procedures. From this regression we then get an estimate  of the first‐order serial correlation from the regression of  on  We then construct the differenced variables by multiplying the values of each variable using the Prais‐Winston transformation . We then estimate Equations (3–5) using the differenced variables to obtain consistent and unbiased IV estimates (Greene 2000, 688–89).         "
"13","The instruments are valid only if there is indeed a strong correlation with the resignation terms. We show the first‐stage regressions in Table 3. The sign of the estimated effects is expected. There is a negative correlation between age and resignations in each of our first‐stage estimations. The effect of the quadratic–age term is positive indicating the existence of a smaller second‐order effect. The strength of the negative effect of age on resignations is decreasing with the age of the minister. The overall R2 of each of these models is reasonably high and the F‐tests on the variables which are excluded in the second‐stage regression indicate that it is very unlikely that the age terms are not significantly correlated with resignations. Bound et al. (1995) also suggest that, to be valid as instruments, the variables which are excluded from the second‐stage regression should improve the overall correlation; hence we also show the partial R2, (the squared partial correlation between the instruments which are excluded in the second equation and the endogenous regressor). In addition to ensuring that the instruments are correlated with the endogenous terms in Equations (3–5) we also require that they are orthogonal to the error term in the popularity equation. Under the null hypothesis of valid instruments the Sargan test statistic, which is N times the R2 from the regression of the residuals of the popularity equations on the instruments, follows the Chi‐square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of overidentifying restrictions which in this case equals 6. We also report Hansen's J statistic which unlike the Sargan statistic does not rely on the assumption of conditional homoskedacity (see Hayashi 2000). The Sargan and Hansen J statistics are presented in Table 4, and both would easily lead us to accept the null hypothesis of valid instruments.         "
"14"," Table 4 also presents the IV estimations. We find that if the resignation issue receives front page or editorial coverage support will adjust downwards (22%) with a corresponding upward adjustment of 37% if there is a resignation giving a corrective effect of around 15% if there is a single resignation issue in the quarter which is both high coverage and which leads to the resignation of the minister concerned. However, with the IV estimates we find that a resignation issue which does not receive front‐page or editorial coverage has a positive effect on government support with a corresponding resignation having a downward effect. Indeed if the resignation issue has not received high coverage then the effect of a corresponding resignation reduces support overall by 2%. The IV estimations of the corrective effect are larger than the corresponding OLS estimate. Whilst these estimates are consistent they are not efficient, but nevertheless we can easily reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. So our results suggest that a resignation more than corrects for the downward effect of a high‐profile resignation issue.         "
"15","We now turn briefly to our results on other political and economic effects. Our findings on the impact of the electoral cycle are consistent with previous research. The expected lead of the government decreases the further away the nearest election, and this feature of the statistical model is consistent with the “mid‐term blues” that pollsters often highlight. We also find support for a long‐term incumbency effect. All things being equal the popularity of the government is affected significantly by the number of terms it has served. Of the economic variables included we find the strongest effect for consumption growth, supporting previous work which establishes a synergy between “feel good” effects in the economy and support for the government."
"16","All things considered we find some support for the view that there are political and economic determinants of government popularity; more specifically we find support for the hypothesis that ministerial resignations will have a positive effect on popularity although not all of our results are consistent with the hypothesized corrective effect. Our results suggest some questions for which our theoretical framework does not provide answers. Why should we observe an increase in support for the government when there is a resignation issue which receives little press coverage? Moreover, why should a corresponding resignation in such cases lead to a fall in popularity?"
"17","The fact that we observe the opposite of a corrective effect for resignations over issues which have received relatively little coverage is surprising. In all there are 15 cases (just over a fifth of our sample of 72 resignations) where the issue has not received front‐page or editorial coverage. As a first step we can then check whether resignations over particular issues and/or involving a particular type of minister are likely to get less coverage. We classify the resignation according to two criteria: first, whether the resignation is due to policy disagreement; second, whether the minister involved is in the Cabinet or not.5"
"18"," Table 5 shows the coverage of the resignations cross‐classified into those concerning policy disagreement and those concerning other issues. Where the resignation occurs when a minister disagrees with the policy of the government (that is, with the policy of another minister) the resignation tends to receive low coverage. Of 20 resignations due to policy disagreement, 11 received low‐coverage, whereas of the other 52 resignations only four received low coverage. This translates into odds of receiving low coverage roughly 15 times higher for resignations involving policy disagreement.6Table 5 also shows resignations cross‐classified according to whether the minister involved was of cabinet rank or not. The odds of receiving low coverage are considerably lower for noncabinet ranked ministers. Of 44 resignations involving noncabinet ranked ministers, 12 received low coverage. Of 28 resignations by cabinet ranked ministers only three received low coverage. This translates into odds of receiving low coverage roughly 23 times higher for resignations of noncabinet ranked ministers.         "
"19","We can then summarize our results as follows: there is a corrective effect of ministerial resignations but this corrective effect does not hold where there has been little press coverage. Indeed in such cases we find the opposite: resignations lead to falls in government popularity. In exploring this issue we find low coverage resignations tend to involve noncabinet ministers and often occur over policy disagreement. Junior ministers are much more likely to resign over a policy disagreement partly because they have less influence on policy formation and partly due to the belief that such resignations may not harm their career in the long‐run (as we saw with Churchill, Eden, and Wilson). It is not obvious why we do not observe a “corrective effect” in these cases. We can conjecture that where a noncabinet minister is involved and the press does not give issue wide coverage then the first the public hears about it is when the minister actually resigns. As such the resignation cannot act as a corrective since there was nothing happening previously to correct. Furthermore, a minister resigning because s/he does not agree with government policy may ring alarm bells over the cohesiveness of the government as a whole. Hence one might expect to see the support for the government to waver. These conjectures may prove fruitful for further investigation."
"20","When a government faces problems, be they of policy failure, incompetence in a department or by a minister, or when there are personal scandals surrounding a minister, we should expect the government's popularity to go down. Resignations should act as a corrective to this fall. We have found strong empirical support for the hypothesis that resignations will positively affect government popularity. Our results suggest that when there is an issue deemed serious enough for there to be calls for a minister's resignation and where this issue has received substantial media attention, then a corresponding resignation will correct for the effect the problem has on government popularity. Indeed, it will more than correct for it, suggesting that Prime Minister should welcome a certain number of resignation issues so that they can fire ministers thereby enhancing government popularity. We find the opposite relationship when it comes to issues which have little media attention. Here calls for resignations seem to increase government popularity, and resignations to lower it. Examining these cases more closely suggests that they they tend to involve policy disagreement and/or protest resignation which signals a split in the party of power. Since they involve cases where the public's attention is brought to the issue by the resignation itself they cannot act as a corrective device. Rather they a signal that a problem exists."
"21","This article concentrates upon the effects of ministerial resignations in terms of government popularity. Given that prime ministers are concerned with the popularity of the government we should expect that these effects of resignation will also be causally related to resignations. The corrective effect may be found for other chief executives. Presidents' may dismiss cabinet ministers or agency heads, so might State Governors or perhaps more appropriately mayors in major cities. In more complex systems of cabinet government where multi‐party coalition governments are the norm further considerations may cloud aspects of the corrective effect. In multi‐party governments the corrective effect might be much weaker given the blurred lines of responsibility. Sacking ministers in coalition governments often requires the cooperation of other coalition leaders, and failure to secure such cooperation may have unclear effects on the popularity of the various parties involved in the coalition. Nevertheless, even in coalitions we should expect prime ministers to react to scandal or policy problems centered on a particular ministry or minister in a such a manner to enhance support for the government as a whole. The UK is a particularly clear‐cut case for the corrective effect of ministerial resignations. Demonstrating the corrective effect in other countries might prove more problematic."
