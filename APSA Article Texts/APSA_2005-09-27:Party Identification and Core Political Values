"1","In classic and neoclassic perspectives party identification is defined as a sense of personal, affective attachment to a political party based on feelings of closeness to the social groups associated with the parties (Campbell et al. 1960; Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002). People decide which party (if any) they identify with based on how they feel about the social groups that comprise the party base. For example, the closer one feels toward social groups typically seen as Republican, such as business people or born again Christians, the more strongly one identifies with the Republican Party and the warmer one regards fellow partisans. In short, social identification and partisan affect are the key conceptual attributes of party identification.         "
"2","Since party coalitions are quite stable at the macrolevel, individual‐level partisan identities should persist over time in the minds of citizens (Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002). How much continuity is there in individual partisan identities? When structural equation modeling techniques are used to disentangle attitude change among respondents from the unreliability of the survey instrument (see Wheaton et al. 1977), party identification proves to be very stable. For instance, Green, Palmquist, and Schickler (2002, 74) report disattenuated continuity correlations for party identification that average .97 across 13 panel surveys.3 Of course, the impressive stability of party identification need not render it completely impervious to change. This insight is central to revisionist conceptions of party identification, which posit that party loyalties are updated in response to a number of short‐term political forces, such as retrospective judgments about national conditions (Fiorina 1981). Thus, the revisionist approach maintains that citizens adjust their partisan self‐images as warranted by experience and evidence.         "
"3","Although theoretically plausible, this account has not fared well when subject to rigorous empirical testing. As Green and Palmquist (1990) point out, all revisionist work ignores the deleterious effects random measurement error has on the parameter estimates in multivariate statistical models and therefore overstates the instability of partisanship. When random measurement error is accounted for using two‐stage least‐squares regression or structural equation modeling techniques, the evidence of partisan malleability weakens dramatically.4 In short, party identification is an extremely stable predisposition, it colors a wide array of political perceptions, and it is largely unaffected by such perceptions (Bartels 2002).         "
"4","Turning to core political values, social and political psychologists agree that values share five conceptual attributes (Kinder 1998; Rokeach 1973; Schwartz 1992, 1994). According to Schwartz (1994, 20) values are (1) abstract beliefs (2) about desirable end states or behaviors that (3) transcend specific situations, (4) guide evaluation and behavior, and (5) can be rank‐ordered in terms of relative importance. These formal features delineate values from other psychological constructs such as attitudes and schema, but they provide no insight into the different types of values that exist. Schwartz has identified 10 general value domains containing sets of discrete but interrelated values that satisfy one or more of the three universal needs confronting all individuals and societies. These universal needs include the requirements of individuals as biological organisms, the requirements of society for coordinated social interaction, and group survival and welfare requirements (Schwartz 1992). For instance, values in the tradition domain (e.g., respect for traditional customs and devout) serve group maintenance needs, whereas values in the self‐direction domain (e.g., freedom and independence) advance the needs of individuals.         "
"5","Since core political principles develop early in the adult life cycle and are reinforced subsequently by the broader political culture (Feldman 1988), they should persist over time in the minds of individuals and lie beyond the influence of short‐term political forces. What does the extant evidence show? Analyses that employ structural equation modeling techniques furnish some support for both propositions. First, Feldman (1988) reports a one‐month stability coefficient of .86 for latent beliefs about equality, while McCann (1997) reports a two‐year corrected continuity correlation of .84 for traditional morality and .41 for latent egalitarianism. These correlations suggest that core political values are rather stable in absolute terms, though less so than party identification. Second, McCann (1997) uses panel data to model the dynamic relationships between moral and egalitarian values on the one hand and specific policy preferences on the other, finding that the former systematically constrain the latter. Policy preferences, in turn, do not affect political values. Lastly, he demonstrates that core values and candidate evaluations shape one another simultaneously. To sum up, core political values are reasonably stable (though less than party identification) and largely, though not entirely, immune to the influence of short‐term political forces (unlike party identification, which is almost completely immune to such forces).         "
"6","Party identification and political values are the central, long‐term predispositions in the political belief systems of citizens; however, it is unclear whether these constructs are related. Do partisan loyalties shape abstract beliefs about society and public affairs or are party ties grounded in such principles? Theories of partisan information processing and value‐based reasoning suggest both mechanisms may be at work."
"7","To begin with, the “partisan influence” hypothesis maintains that party identification influences value positions. The theoretical rationale is as follows. First, research on the development and persistence of party identification suggests that it colors political perception. As Campbell et al. noted long ago, party identification “raises a perceptual screen through which the individual tends to see what is favorable to his partisan orientation. The stronger the party bond, the more exaggerated the process of selection and perceptual distortion will be” (1960, 133). Hence, partisan bias “plays a crucial role in perpetuating and reinforcing sharp differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans” (Bartels 2002, 138). To put it another way, partisans process political information in manner that yields the “correct” partisan conclusions. While this process may occur spontaneously, citizens should be especially susceptible to partisan reasoning when primed by public officials (Zaller 1992). Specifically, when people are exposed to value‐laden messages from political elites with the same partisan affiliation, they should accept the implications of these messages without much reflection and shift their political values, even if only slightly, in the appropriate direction. In contrast, opposition party supporters should reject these implications and subtly shift their values in the opposing direction. As this process repeats over time, party identification shapes views about the good and just society. To illustrate, citizens should have reacted differently to Newt Gingrich's repeated calls in the mid‐1990s to limit the power of the federal government. Republicans should have accepted Gingrich's claims and moved to the right on limited government, while Democrats should have rejected them and moved left.         "
"8","In contrast, the “political values influence” hypothesis posits that core political principles shape partisan identities. Value centered models of political reasoning and judgment maintain that people employ a number of abstract values to construct preferences on a wide range of more specific issues within and across multiple policy domains (Alvarez and Brehm 2002; Feldman 1988). As Alvarez and Brehm put it: “The utility of values for the survey respondent arises from the economy of a generalized standard that can be used in a wide‐ranging set of political domains. Instead of maintaining separate political attitudes over diverse questions, respondents need only assess the relevance of the questions to a relatively limited set of core values” (2002, 18). Such influence may extend to more basic predispositions. Insofar as core political values are more central elements of mass belief systems than party identification, it seems reasonable to posit that citizens will from time to time evaluate and, if necessary, update their partisan identities to ensure correspondence with their values. To illustrate, someone committed to limited government in domestic affairs should move in the Republican direction over time, while someone who believes in strong government should gradually shift in the Democratic direction. Thus, just as values “predispose us to favor one particular political or religious ideology over another” (Rokeach 1973, 13), they should also predispose us to favor one political party over another.         "
"9","Four principles are included in this article: equal opportunity, limited government, traditional family values, and moral tolerance. Equal opportunity is defined as the belief that society should ensure that everyone has the same chance to get ahead in life (Feldman and Zaller 1992). Limited government is defined as the degree to which someone opposes a strong, active government in domestic political affairs (Kinder 1998). Traditional family values can be conceptualized as the extent to which a person is committed to conventional notions about the nuclear family (i.e., heterosexual, two‐parent households; McCann 1997; Miller and Shanks 1996). Lastly, moral tolerance denotes a willingness to accept or put up with people whose beliefs and behaviors regarding right and wrong differ from our own (Miller and Shanks 1996; Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus 1982).         "
"10","Each of these constructs represents an abstract belief about a desirable end state or mode of conduct that transcends different situations, motivates political evaluation, and can be ordered in terms of relative importance. Thus, each construct possesses the formal attributes that constitute the definition of values as delineated above. In addition, three of these principles correspond rather closely to exemplary values within a value domain identified by Schwartz (1992, 4–12): equal opportunity and moral tolerance are motivated by universalistic concerns for understanding, tolerating, and protecting the well‐being of all people and traditional family values are motivated by respect for, and commitment to, the norms and customs that religion and culture impose upon individuals.         "
"11","What of limited government? Although a number of public opinion scholars identify limited government as a core value in American political culture (Feldman and Zaller 1992; Kinder 1998; Markus 2001), it does not appear as an exemplary value in any of the ten value domains identified by Schwartz (1992), which suggests the construct is perhaps better thought of as a general policy prescription. However, one could make the argument that limited government derives its motivation from individual needs for independence and thereby represents, albeit imperfectly and somewhat narrowly, the value of freedom in the self‐direction domain (Kinder 1998; Markus 2001). It is beyond the scope of this article to resolve definitively the conceptual term that most accurately describes limited government; nevertheless, I include it in the analysis because it figures so prominently in public opinion research on political values and culture.         "
"12","I measure the constructs and test the hypotheses by applying structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to panel data from the 1992–94–96 NES survey.5 I estimate dynamic models of attitude stability and constraint with data from the 92–94–96 and 92–96 components of the panel survey. Using two‐ and three‐wave panel data allows me to model the stability of, and relationships between, partisanship and political values over varying time frames and thus provides for multiple tests of the theories. Three indicators are available for party identification, equal opportunity, and limited government, while two indicators per construct exist for family values and moral tolerance. These measures are available for all constructs across all three panel waves, with the exception of the limited government items which appear on the 1992 and 1996 surveys. The three‐wave three‐indicator stability model is presented in Figure 1.6 I report the unstandardized factor loading (λj) of each indicator (xj) on each construct (ξt) at each time point;7 the validity of each indicator, signified by its correlation with the construct (i.e., the standardized factor loading); the reliability of each indicator (i.e., the squared standardized loading); and the unstandardized (βk) and standardized (βk) stability coefficient for each predisposition across adjacent panel waves. In addition, I generate, but do not report, estimates of the error variance of each indictor (δj), correlated error variances (indicated by the curved arrows linking the δs), and disturbance variances (ζt).         "
"13","                 The Three‐Wave Three‐Indicator Stability Model                      "
"14","Model fit is assessed via the χ2 test of global model fit8 and three supplemental fit measures. The latter include the chi‐square/degrees of freedom ratio, in which values of 5.00 or less indicate good fit; the robust comparative fit index (CFI) where values of .90 or more reflect good fit; and the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) with values less than .10 denoting good fit (Hu and Bentler 1995; Kline 1998; Wheaton et al. 1977).9"
"15","I measure latent party identification using the standard 7‐point self‐placement scale and the feeling thermometer scores for the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.10Table 1 contains the three‐ and two‐wave estimates for the party identification model.11 Beginning with the three‐wave model, the first point to note is that the hypothesized model fits the data exceptionally well. The χ2 ratio (2.07) is less than 5.00, the robust CFI (1.00) exceeds .90, and the SRMR (.02) falls well below the .10 cutoff. Second, each item effectively taps latent partisanship. For the 7‐point scale, the item‐factor correlations range from .92 to .97 and latent partisanship accounts for 85–94% of the observed item variance. The Republican thermometer correlations with latent partisanship range from .58 to .63, indicating that latent identification accounts for 34–40% of the item variance. Latent partisanship correlates with the Democratic thermometer scores in the −.68 to −.75 range and accounts for 46–56% of item variance. Third, latent identification is very stable over time as shown by the standardized stability estimates (βk) of .92 for 1992–94 and .96 for 1994–96. That is, 1992 identification explains 85% of the variance in 1994 identification, which in turn explains 92% of the variance in 1996 identification. Fourth, the unstandardized estimates (βk) of 1.01 for 1992–94 and 0.97 for 1994–96 show that the distance between strong Republicans and strong Democrats remains constant over time. That is, strong Republicans are as far apart from strong Democrats in 1996 as they were in 1994 and 1992. Fifth, the estimates from the two‐wave model are virtually indistinguishable from those of the three‐wave model on each measure of global and component model fit. Substantively, the β1 estimate of .91 indicates that 1992 partisanship explains 83% of the variance in 1996 partisanship, while the β1 coefficient of 1.02 means that the distance between strong partisans remains constant over the four‐year time frame.         "
"16","The analysis of core political values begins with equal opportunity. I measure this construct with three items that ask respondents about the need for more equal opportunity and treatment in society.12 The three‐ and two‐wave stability estimates are presented in Table 2. To begin with, the χ2 ratio, the robust CFI, and the SRMR surpass the thresholds of acceptable fit in both models. Second, the item‐factor correlations for the first two items are fairly strong and latent equal opportunity accounts for roughly half of the observed variance across these items. However, the validity and reliability of the third item are not quite as good. Third, in the three‐wave model the βk coefficients of .74 for 1992–94 and .78 for 1994–96 reveal that equal opportunity is moderately stable over time. Specifically, equality92 explains 55% of the variance in equality94, which explains 61% of the variance in equality96. For the 1992–96 period β1 drops to .67, indicating that equality92 accounts for 45% of the variance in equality96. Fourth, the βk estimates of 0.66 for 1992–94 and 0.77 for 1994–96 show that the gap between the strongest and weakest egalitarians closes by 34% over the first wave and 23% over the second (recall that the factor scales range from 0.00 to 1.00). The β1 estimate of 0.59 for the full 1992–96 period implies that the gap narrows by 41% over four years.         "
"17","I now turn to the principle of limited government, which is measured using three items regarding abstract beliefs about the size and scope of government. Table 3 has the estimates (recall that data are available for the 1992 and 1996 waves). First, global model fit is fine on all measures. Next, the factor correlates reasonably well with each indicator, from .66 to .78, and accounts for 44–61% of the observed item variance. Third, beliefs about limited government are moderately stable: the β1 coefficient of .70 indicates that limited government92 explain 49% of the variance in limited government96. Finally, the β1 coefficient of 0.70 shows that the distance between supporters and opponents of limited government closes by 30% over the four‐year period.         "
"18","Next, I measure traditional family values with a pair of items asking respondents about traditional family ties and new lifestyles. The estimates appear in Table 4. Once again, model fit is fine on the fit measures in the three‐ and two‐wave models. Next, latent family values correlates fairly well with both indicators (varying from .56 to .81) and accounts for 31–66% of their variance. Third, in the three‐wave model the βk coefficients of .83 and .90 indicate that latent family values are quite stable. Family values92 explains 69% of the variance in family values94, which in turn accounts for 81% of 1996 variance. The β1 estimate for the 1992–96 period equals .80, meaning that 1992 family values accounts for 64% of the construct's variance in 1996. Finally, the βk coefficients of 0.77 and 0.89 indicate that the distance between those strongly committed to family values and those weakly committed narrows by 23 and then 11% over adjacent panel waves. Across all four years the distance between family values “conservatives” and “liberals” narrows by 30%(β1= 0.70).         "
"19","The final principle under consideration is moral tolerance. I measure this construct using a pair of items on tolerating moral diversity, the estimates of which are presented in Table 5. First, model fit is excellent across the board. Second, the items correlate fairly well with latent tolerance (ranging from .62 to .79), with the latter accounting for 38–62% of the variance in the former. Third, the βk coefficients of .83 for 1992–94 and .87 for 1994–96 demonstrate that latent moral tolerance is quite stable: lagged tolerance accounts for 69 and 76% of the variance in 1994 and 1996 tolerance, respectively. For 1992–96 lagged tolerance explains 61% of current tolerance (β1= .78). Finally, the βk coefficients of 0.77 and 0.83 imply that the distance between the intolerant and tolerant narrows by 23 and then 17% across the respective panel waves. Over four years this gap narrows by 34%(β1= 0.66).         "
"20","The next set of analyses focuses on the cross‐lagged structural relationships between latent partisanship and latent core principles.13 Since the constructs are coded so higher scores signify conservative leanings, positive coefficients are expected. The three‐wave cross‐lagged model is specified as follows:            "
"21","The two‐wave cross‐lagged model is specified as follows:            "
"22"," Table 6 contains the estimates for the party identification‐equal opportunity models.15 To begin, the model fits the data extremely well for both the three‐ and two‐wave models. The χ2 ratio is less than 5.00, the robust CFI exceeds .90, and the SRMR is less than .10. Next, equal opportunity does not influence party identification in either model. All lagged equal opportunity coefficients are statistically indistinguishable from zero. Substantively, weak egalitarians are no more likely than strong egalitarians to move in the Republican direction over time, controlling for lagged partisanship. In contrast, party identification systematically affects equal opportunity in both the three‐wave and two‐wave models. To illustrate with data from the 1992–96 estimates, strong 1992 Republicans are predicted to be 0.15 units more conservative on equal opportunity in 1996 (0.00–1.00 scale) than strong 1992 Democrats. The standardized coefficient further underscores the substantive significance of the relationship (β4= .20). To reiterate, partisanship constrains abstract beliefs about equality, which do not in turn constrain partisanship.         "
"23","The estimates for the party identification‐limited government model are reported in Table 7. First, model fit is acceptable on all three fit measures. Second, partisanship shapes limited government while limited government does not shape partisanship. More precisely, the effect of partisanship92 on limited government96 is powerful statistically and substantively, controlling for limited government92. Strong Republicans in 1992 are predicted to score 0.35 units higher on limited government in 1996 than strong 1992 Democrats. The β4 coefficient of .28 reinforces the magnitude of this substantive effect. In contrast, the effect of limited government92 on party identification96 is insignificant, controlling for lagged partisanship. In sum, the results support the partisan influence hypothesis.         "
"24","Are party identification and traditional family values related? The evidence in Table 8 suggests that this is not the case. First, lagged partisanship has a significant effect on family values over the 1994–96 waves, but no comparable effect emerges over the 1992–94 waves. Second, lagged family values have a significant effect on party identification over the first period, but not over the second. Third, neither predisposition affects the other over the 1992–96 waves. Finally, we can see that model fit is excellent for both sets of estimates. In sum, the Table 8 results indicate that party identification and traditional family values are independent of one another and thus fail to support either hypothesis.         "
"25","The structural estimates for the party identification‐moral tolerance relationship are presented in Table 9. The results support the proposition that party identification constrains core principles and fail to support the rival claim that principles constrain partisanship. To begin with, model fit is exceptional across the board. Next, lagged party identification significantly affects current moral tolerance, controlling for lagged moral tolerance, across all panel waves. To illustrate using the unstandardized estimate across the 1992–96 waves, movement from the strong Democrat to strong Republican end of the partisan continuum in 1992 is associated with a 0.16 increase in moral intolerance in 1996. The standardized estimate equals .24. Finally, lagged moral tolerance is not systematically related to current party identification, ceteris paribus. Although tolerance has a correctly signed and statistically significant effect on partisanship from 1992 to 1994, it is incorrectly signed and statistically insignificant thereafter, and it is statistically insignificant over the 1992–96 period.         "
"26","Overall, the analyses presented above yield three important conclusions regarding the stability of, and the dynamic relationships between, party identification and core political values.16 First, partisan identities are more stable than the core principles analyzed here. The standardized estimates in Tables 1–5 show that lagged partisanship explains an average of 88% of the variance in current partisanship over the two two‐year periods and 83% of the variance over the full four years; lagged family values explains 75% of current family values across the two‐year waves and 64% over the 1992–96 period; lagged moral tolerance accounts for 72% of current moral tolerance in the shorter periods and 61% of the variance in the longer period; lagged equal opportunity accounts for 58% of the variance in current equality across the two‐year waves and 45% of the variance across the four‐year wave; and lagged limited government explains 49% of the variance in current limited government over the full four‐year period.         "
"27","Next, note that party identification is almost as stable over the four‐year period as it is over each two‐year period, whereas the stability of the political values declines more significantly over the longer time frame. That is, lagged partisanship explains an average of 88% of current partisanship over the two‐year panel waves and 83% over the four‐year period. Lagged family values, the most stable core principle, accounts for an average of 75% of current family values over the two‐year periods and 64% over the four years. Thus, not only are partisan ties more stable than core political values in absolute terms, they are more stable for longer periods of time. Overall, these estimates suggest that party identification is an exceptionally durable predisposition; that traditional family values and moral tolerance are also quite stable, though less so than partisanship; and that equal opportunity and limited government are moderately stable, and hence, far less durable than partisanship."
"28","The second and third major conclusions concern the structural relationships between partisanship and core political values. Put simply, the estimates in Tables 6–9 yield fairly strong support for the partisan influence hypothesis and no support for the political values influence hypothesis.17 Specifically, party identification has a statistically significant effect on equal opportunity, limited government, and moral tolerance in the three‐wave and two‐wave models. Next, traditional family values lies beyond the reach of partisan influence. Finally, there is no empirical evidence that any of these political values systematically constrain partisan loyalties.         "
"29","To what extent are these statistically significant effects substantively significant as well? If we focus on the direct impact of partisanship on political values across the two‐year time frames, the effects are modest. For instance, the standardized coefficients summarizing the effect of partisanship on equal opportunity across the 1992–94 and 1994–96 waves equal .15 and .13, respectively (see Table 6). However, the effect of partisanship is more pronounced when its direct and indirect effects are tallied up. To illustrate, Table 6 indicates that (1) partisanship94 has a direct effect on equal opportunity96 of β8= .13; (2) partisanship92 directly affects equal opportunity94(β6= .15); and (3) equal opportunity94 affects equal opportunity96(β7= .71). Thus, the total effect of lagged partisanship on equal opportunity96 sums to .24. And when attention turns to the two‐wave model, the direct impact of partisanship92 on equal opportunity96 equals .20. Next, from Table 9 we can infer that the total direct and indirect effects of lagged partisanship on moral tolerance96 equals .20 in the three‐wave model and the direct effect of partisanship92 on tolerance96 is .24 in the two‐wave model. Finally, Table 7 shows that the direct impact of partisanship92 on limited government96 is .28. In sum, while the direct impact of party ties on political values over a two‐year period is somewhat limited, the accumulation of direct and indirect effects over a longer period of time may lead to a noticeable shift in value positions. Thus, the influence of partisanship on core political values is psychologically real and politically consequential.18"
"30","Party identification and core political values lay at the center of mass belief systems. Their influence on political evaluation, judgment, and decision making is broad and deep (Kinder 1998). Despite their theoretical and substantive importance, we know little about how these predispositions are related. I address this issue by testing rival hypotheses on partisan and value‐based influence with NES panel data and therefore provide the first attempt to analyze systematically how these fundamental predispositions affect one another. The empirical analyses have come down in favor of the partisan influence hypothesis on three scores. First, partisan identities are more stable and resistant to change than abstract beliefs about equal opportunity, limited government, traditional family values, and moral tolerance (although the latter two are also quite stable). This pattern of results is, of course, consistent with the notion that causes are more temporally stable than effects. Second, party identification systematically constrains beliefs about equal opportunity, limited government, and moral tolerance. This influence, while far from overwhelming, is substantively meaningful, and therefore, can produce genuine shifts in value preferences over extended periods of time. Third, party identification lies beyond the reach of these four values. While core political principles constrain policy attitudes, they do not appear to affect identification with a political party.         "
"31","These findings must be qualified on several fronts. First, equal opportunity, limited government, traditional family values, and moral tolerance represent only four principles19 from the broader universe of political values. Social psychologists might point out that many germane values in the works of Rokeach (1973) and Schwartz (1992, 1994), such as protecting the environment, national security, and social order, are excluded from my analyses. Political scientists might wonder about the relationship between party identification and principles like self‐reliance (Feldman 1988), political tolerance (Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus 1982), humanitarianism (Feldman and Steenbergen 2001), post‐materialism (Inglehart 1990), and so on. Unfortunately, a lack of suitable data makes it impossible to model such relationships at this point in time and thereby underscores the need to exercise caution in generalizing beyond the relationships observed here and to develop new data sources covering a richer set of values.20"
"32","The next qualification concerns the extent to which partisanship shapes principles that are especially deep‐seated or weakly held for various subsets of the electorate. To illustrate, my results suggest that party identification constrains beliefs about equal opportunity to the same degree for all citizens. Would the same conclusion emerge for individuals who rank equal opportunity as their single most important value among a dozen political values? Would the same conclusion hold for those who rank it the least important? Since the NES surveys do not furnish respondents with an opportunity to rank their political values in terms of personal importance, these questions cannot be addressed with extant data. Thus, we cannot determine how variance in the personal importance people ascribe to different political values moderates their susceptibility to partisan influence. Once again, the need for future research that utilizes much richer data sources is apparent."
"33","The final qualification centers on the generalizability of these results over time. The 1992–94–96 NES panel covers a period of intense elite polarization in the American political system. Objective indicators of elite polarization include heightened levels of party voting (Fleisher and Bond 2000), ideological divergence (Hetherington 2001), and incivility (Jamieson and Falk 2000) in one or both houses of Congress. For example, Hetherington (2001) demonstrates that from the 81st Congress of 1949–51 to the 104th Congress of 1995–97 ideological polarization peaked in the three most recent legislative sessions. This naturally raises the question of whether party elites had unusual opportunities to influence mass thinking during the period covered by the NES panel survey. To put it differently, would the same pattern of results have emerged during periods of moderate or weak partisan polarization? While a lack of suitable data makes it impossible to address this question empirically, it seems reasonable to speculate that the potential for partisan influence was probably weaker in the past. However, since elite polarization seems likely to be the norm going forward, party identification should continue to shape core political values for some time.         "
"34","Overall, the preliminary nature of the findings reported here and the need for additional research along the lines sketched above suggest that we are far from having definitive answers about the relationship between party identification and political values. Nevertheless, these initial findings do make several contributions to the study of public opinion. To begin with, the results contribute directly to a long line of work on the stability of political attitudes and predispositions (Converse and Markus 1979; Saris and Sniderman 2004). Consistent with prior work (Converse 1964; Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002; McCann 1997), my analyses demonstrate that party identification is the most stable political predisposition in the minds of citizens; that moral values like traditional family ties and moral tolerance are also quite stable; that abstract beliefs about equal opportunity and limited government are moderately stable; and that these predispositions are generally more stable than concrete policy attitudes.         "
"35","Next, these findings have some important implications for theories of partisan information processing and value‐based reasoning. My results affirm some of the central theoretical claims of the Michigan model of party identification (Campbell et al. 1960; Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002) more powerfully and convincingly than prior work. While a long line of research shows that party identification influences short‐term political evaluations (i.e., retrospective assessments) which are known to reside in the more peripheral regions of political belief systems and to fluctuate a great deal over time (Green and Palmquist 1990), my results suggest that partisanship shapes important long‐term political predispositions as well. To put it more directly, not only does party identification color how individuals see the hurly burly world of everyday politics, it also colors some of their most abstract and enduring beliefs about society and public affairs.

According to this perspective, when evaluating government and politics citizens should rely on core political values in lieu of more simple‐minded propensities to follow party cues. My results suggest that this distinction may be more imagined than real, because political values are shaped to some degree by social identification with a political party. This is not to say that partisanship is the prime mover of value preferences: people believe what they believe about “virtue and the good society” (Kinder 1998, 808) for reasons having little to do with politics, such as their unique life experiences, the manner in which they were raised, their position in the social hierarchy, and so on (Schwartz 1992, 1994). Rather, my results suggest that political elites activate latent partisan biases in the minds of citizens, which in turn subtly affect their core political values. Party identification does not determine value positions, but it appears to shape them.         "
