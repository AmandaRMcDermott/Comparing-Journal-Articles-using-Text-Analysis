"1","Ministerial Payoffs and Performance The Prime Minister appoints a minister to his post by selecting him from a talent pool of suitable candidates. A minister enjoys a flow payoff  which reflects his salary, the perquisites of office, and the benefits of being in a position of power and influence. Unlike textbook principal‐agent models of labor relations, salaries are exogenous and so performance‐related pay cannot be used to provide incentives.            "
"2","Once in post, a minister can allocate effort to different tasks. He can devote effort to his government role, or he may instead support other activities that need not necessarily enhance government performance. At each moment in continuous time he chooses his performance , where the upper bound  is one aspect of his talent. Higher performance helps the government but is costly for the minister; this divergence of interests is the source of an agency problem. Specifically, the minister incurs a flow cost of ce.3 Rather than think of this as the cost of effort, we instead think of it as the opportunity cost to the minister of not pursuing his own personal agenda; when c is low the minister's interests are well aligned with the government's aims.            "
"3","Bringing the payoff components together, a minister enjoys a net flow payoff of  so long as he retains his job. He receives nothing if either he is fired or the government falls. If the minister's tenure in office were fixed and he faced no other incentives then he would choose e = 0.            "
"4","Failures and Scandals During her time in office, which ends only when her government falls, the Prime Minister enjoys a flow payoff . However, she suffers whenever her minister encounters a policy failure or becomes embroiled in some other controversial event. When a minister falls short in such ways he faces a resignation call, made by the opposition, by the media, or even by the wider membership of the governing party. We refer to such resignation calls as scandals. The arrival of a scandal imposes an average penalty of  on the Prime Minister.4"
"5","Scandals arrive at a (Poisson) rate of . The first component  reflects exogenous elements of the minister's portfolio which place him at particular risk. For example, the difficulty of the task facing him may increase his exposure or policies enacted by a predecessor may come back to haunt him.5 The second component λ(e) is endogenously decreasing in the minister's performance. By increasing his performance a minister reduces the likelihood of resignation calls.6"
"6","Summarizing, the Prime Minister enjoys a net expected flow payoff  when her minister devotes performance e to his tasks. Notice that a conflict of interest arises: other things equal, the minister wishes to choose e = 0 to minimize his cost of performance, whereas the Prime Minister would like him to choose  and so slow down the arrival of damaging scandals.            "
"7","Ministerial and Government Termination The minister and his boss enjoy their flow payoffs ( and  respectively) only while they hold office. However, both actors are exposed to a background risk of losing office. Following the early empirical literature, we specify a risk of critical events, such as a financial crisis or international conflict, that may topple a government (Browne, Frendreis, and Gleiber 1984, 1986; Diermeier and Stevenson 2000). Such events arrive at a (Poisson) rate γ > 0. Consistent with the later literature on government termination, there may be institutional features that enhance a government's durability when shocks arrive. For example, King et al. (1990) found that majority status and the existence of an investiture requirement are both positively related to government duration; these features correspond to lower values of γ.7γ can also be interpreted as a continuous‐time discount rate.            "
"8","A minister faces a further risk: a scandal prompts a call for his resignation. In response the Prime Minister can retain him or fire him. This risk is endogenous since it depends upon the attitude of the Prime Minister to resignation calls, and because the minister can influence the arrival rate of damaging scandals. Some risk is inescapable: the Prime Minister is unable to protect her minister in the face of extreme scandals; even if she protects her minister whenever possible a scandal results in his dismissal with some minimum probability q‡ > 0. For lesser scandals, however, the Prime Minister enjoys a hiring‐and‐firing prerogative, and so generally a scandal results in dismissal with some (possibly larger) probability q† chosen by the Prime Minister.8"
"9","The Talent Pool Our key assumptions are that (1) the availability of qualified replacements declines with the number of ministers who have served; and (2) the Prime Minister strictly prefers to work with talented ministers. One interpretation is that her government survives only so long as talent is available. Another interpretation is that once the pool of talented ministers is exhausted then the Prime Minister must draw upon a secondary source of lower‐quality ministerial candidates; under this interpretation the “end of government” corresponds not to removal from office but rather a switch to a regime in which the executive is staffed by less effective personnel. Formally, we suppose that the government begins with a talent pool comprising n potential ministerial appointees. Each time a minister is removed from office, the pool loses a member. (In a later extension, we allow the pool to become replenished by new arrivals.) This focus on the finiteness of the talent pool clearly differentiates our model from earlier models of ministerial turnover, which, although similar in some ways, do not consider this effect (Dewan and Myatt 2007).            "
"10","Here we study the response of a minister's performance to the hiring‐and‐firing stance of a Prime Minister. We relate the expected length of his career to factors including the value of office, the exogenous risk of government termination, and the exogenous risk of resignation calls."
"11","The Prime Minister's Firing Rule We assume that the performance of the minister cannot be directly observed: a classic moral‐hazard problem. However, there is an imperfect performance measure: the arrival of scandals and subsequent resignation calls. Although the Prime Minister is unable to observe directly the performance of her ministers, she can respond to a scandal.            "
"12","We consider this regime: the Prime Minister fires a scandal‐hit minister with probability q†≥q‡ > 0. This probability is strictly positive, since some resignation calls are irresistible; beyond this, q† may be chosen by the Prime Minister to provide incentives to her ministers. With this firing rule in place, the arrival rate of a minister's resignation is . Fixing his performance, this rate is increasing in q†. However, this hazard rate also reacts to the performance of the minister, which is endogenously chosen by him in response to the firing rule which he faces.            "
"13","The Choice of Performance Facing the risk of losing his job, a minister balances the direct flow cost of performance against the slowed arrival of scandals. Avoiding a scandal helps to save his career, and this factor is weighted by the value that he places on that career. This career value, which we label V, and his optimally chosen performance e jointly satisfy two equations:               "
"14","The Effect of the Firing Rule Although the Prime Minister cannot use monetary transfers to encourage performance, she can influence the tenure of her minister via the firing probability q†. As this probability increases it becomes more likely that a scandal terminates a career. This substitution effect encourages a minister to shift away from private concerns and toward the government's agenda. However, there is also an income effect: conditional on his performance, a minister is more likely to lose his job and this reduces the value of his career. He cares less about protecting his position and so is more willing to pursue his own private projects. This income effect weakens his performance. Whereas these two effects of an increasingly severe firing rule conflict, their net effect is indeed to enhance performance as we confirm in our first formal result.            "
"15","Proposition 1  Ministerial performance increases with the severity of the firing rule, the benefits of office, and the minister's talent; performance decreases with the opportunity cost of performance, the exogenous risk of government termination, and the exogenous risk of resignation calls.                "
"16","Our comparative‐static results indicate the importance of income effects. Any factor that increases the value of a ministerial career increases performance and vice versa. One example is office‐holding benefits, which increase whenever the minister receives a more stately home, a larger limousine, or an increase in his entourage; such benefits correspond to the payment of an efficiency wage (Akerlof 1982; Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984). In response, his career becomes more desirable (relative to languishing on the backbenches) and so the minister devotes more effort to his tasks. This enhances the performance of his department and reduces the risk of resignation calls.               "
"17","Similarly, as the exogenous hazard of scandals increases, it becomes more likely that, irrespective of performance, the minister's career will be curtailed. This lowers the value of his career; with less to lose his performance falls. One implication is that the minister may be haunted by the scandals of his predecessor: a failure may have more to do with a previous incumbent than anything a minister has done since being in post. The anticipation of such a scandal lowers the value of his career. Accordingly, since he has less to lose he devotes less effort to his ministerial tasks and the performance of his department declines, thus reinforcing the likelihood of a scandal."
"18","Finally, performance is harmed by the background risk of government termination. As the expected life span of the government shortens, the value of a minister's career drops, and so his performance declines. Risks are self‐reinforcing: whenever a minister or government is expected to fail, the income effect depresses the incentives to perform and so accelerates the onset of further scandals."
"19","All‐or‐Nothing Performance For some of our results it is useful to specify a functional form for the endogenous hazard rate. We say that scandal arrivals are “linearly decreasing in performance” if  where . This specification generates a “bang bang” solution in which a minister devotes either maximal or minimal performance to his tasks. The same results are obtained when he faces a binary choice of either following the government's agenda or not, where doing so involves an opportunity cost of .            "
"20","Proposition 2  When the arrival rate of ministerial scandals is linearly decreasing in performance, a minister chooses either the maximum feasible performance or devotes no effort to his tasks. He chooses high performance if and only if the firing probability exceeds a critical threshold q*. This threshold falls with the benefits of holding office but rises with the opportunity cost of performance, the exogenous risk of government termination, and the exogenous risk of resignation calls."
"21","To induce high performance the Prime Minister must adopt a sufficiently high firing probability. However, she can do no worse than sack every scandal‐hit minister, and so high performance is not always feasible; q*≤ 1 if and only if office benefits are large relative to the opportunity cost of performance. Others have argued that office benefits attract higher‐quality politicians (Caselli and Morelli 2004; Messner and Polborn 2004). Our focus on income effects suggests that the same factor influences action choice. Furthermore, high performance becomes harder to induce (q* rises) as exogenous risks grow: such risks erode the value of a career. Finally, changes in the various parameters that lower q* enable high performance via a lower firing probability, and so the factors that encourage performance may feed through via a more lenient response to scandals.               "
"22","Resignations Before concluding this section we consider the arrival of resignations, rather than scandals. This hazard rate is the product of two effects: the arrival rate  of scandals, and the proportion q† of scandals that result in the minister's resignation.            "
"23","The effect of an increase in the firing probability can go either way: its direct effect is to increase the hazard rate, while the consequent increase in performance (Proposition 1) reduces it. The conflicting effects are most easily seen when the arrival of scandals is linearly decreasing in performance. Raising the firing probability from just below the critical threshold q* to just above it only marginally increases the proportion of scandals that spark a resignation, but also prompts a discrete jump (by the minister) from low to high performance; hence the arrival rate of resignations falls. Further increases in the firing probability, however, raise resignations without influencing performance, and so ministerial careers are shortened. Figure 1 illustrates this effect.            "
"24","                 Firing Rules and the Arrival Rate of Resignations                         "
"25"," Notes. The relationship between the firing probability q† and the arrival of resignations can be nonmonotonic. Here the hazard rate of scandals is linear in performance. For q‡≤q† < q*, the resignation hazard is , which is increasing in q†. However, at q†=q* the minister's performance jumps up, and so the resignation hazard falls to , before continuing to increase with q† once again.                        "
"26","Fixing the firing rule, however, the effects of other parameters are clear. An increase in the exogenous scandal risk directly increases resignations whilst also hastening the arrival of scandals via reduced performance. All other parameters feed via the minister's performance choice. The tenure of a minister is then inversely related to the hazard of resignations and the exogenous risk of government termination. Assembling these observations, we obtain the following formal result."
"27","Proposition 3  Given a firing rule, a minister's expected tenure increases with the benefits of office and his talent but decreases with his opportunity cost of performance and the exogenous risks of government termination and resignation calls. When the arrival of scandals is linear in performance and the firing probability adjusts to q*then these statements also hold."
"28","Our analysis of the ex ante exogenous termination risk deserves further comment. Whilst the effect of ex ante shocks on government duration has been modeled (Lupia and Strøm 1995), ours is the first model that explores their impact on ministerial tenure. An increase in γ decreases the value of a career and so necessitates stronger incentives to perform. Of course γ may also account for institutional effects that enhance a government's durability. Huber and Martinez‐Gallardo (2008) show that these effects can have the opposite impact on tenure, but our result suggests that their findings may be due to the omission of variables accounting for individual ministerial performance.               "
"29","Having established the behavior of a minister, we turn our attention to the firing rule chosen by the Prime Minister. We assume for now that she commits fully to her desired firing rule; later in the article we revisit this assumption, and so ascertain the credibility of different firing rules."
"30","Firing Rules and the Size of the Talent Pool The Prime Minister might wish to change her firing rule to suit the size of her talent pool. Beginning with n potential ministerial appointees, she hires one of them, and so the initial size of her talent pool is n − 1. Whenever a sufficiently severe scandal arrives, she fires the incumbent and replaces him; the size of her talent pool declines. We write k for the current size of the talent pool. If a minister is fired when the talent pool has evaporated (that is, when k = 0) then the government falls. (Equivalently, the government is forced to exploit a lower‐quality talent pool.) We note that, absent any replenishment of the talent pool (we will allow for replenishment later in our article), k cannot grow. Furthermore, since the exogenous risk of scandals and the firing probability are both positive, there is always the risk of a scandal that results in a resignation, and so the talent pool will (in expectation) strictly shrink over time. The rate of decline depends, of course, on the firing rule and ministers' responses to it.            "
"31","As k declines the Prime Minister may become more concerned with talent retention and so may adjust her firing rule. Modifying our earlier notation,  is the resignation probability faced by a scandal‐hit minister when there are k potential replacements, and ek is his chosen performance. Of interest to us is the relationship between the size of the talent pool and the two endogenous variables: the firing probability and the minister's chosen performance. These variables then jointly determine the arrival of resignations and each minister's expected tenure.            "
"32","Optimal Firing Rules and Declining Performance A stricter firing rule enhances ministerial performance. If this were the only concern of the Prime Minister then she would be as strict as possible. However, firing ministers is costly: the talent pool dries up, and the end of the government draws nearer. Here we characterize the optimal response to these conflicting pressures.            "
"33","To do this we calculate the value of the Prime Minister's career (equivalent here to the value of her government). We write Wk for this value when there are k members of the talent pool. The flow payoffs accruing to the Prime Minister must balance the arrival of events which change the composition of the talent pool. This leads to the value equation:               "
"34","The Prime Minister chooses her firing probability  to maximize the value Wk when her talent pool contains k members. An increase in the firing probability induces higher performance and so lower penalties from scandals. It also influences the arrival of resignations: the heightened performance slows the arrival of scandals, while the higher firing probability increases the fraction of scandals which turn into resignations. As noted earlier in the article, the net effect on the tenure of a minister can take either sign. However, if the net effect were negative (an increase in the firing probability reduces the flow of resignations), then the Prime Minister would shift toward a stricter regime. This means that the firing probability will be raised until there is a genuine trade‐off between performance and resignations. An implication is that if different firing probabilities are employed for different talent‐pool sizes, then higher probabilities must be associated with an accelerated arrival of resignations. We record this observation as a lemma.            "
"35","Lemma 1  Looking across the possible talent‐pool sizes, greater severity of the firing rule (a higher firing probability) is associated with greater turnover (a higher arrival rate of resignations).                "
"36","There is a trade‐off between performance and talent‐pool retention. We now examine how this trade‐off changes with the size of the talent pool. To do this, consider a small increase in the firing probability when there are k members of the talent pool. The benefit is the reduced arrival of costly scandals, and the size of this effect does not depend on the talent‐pool size. The cost of such an increase is the increased likelihood that, via the resignation and replacement of a scandal‐hit minister, the talent pool will shrink. The size of the talent‐pool depletion effect is captured by the marginal value Wk −Wk−1 of the kth talent‐pool member. The Prime Minister is more willing to fire a member of her team whenever this marginal value is small. Intuitively (and confirmed formally in our appendix) this marginal value is small whenever the talent pool is large; this reduces the severity of the talent‐pool depletion effect; the Prime Minister is more willing to fire and does so; higher firing probabilities are associated with higher performance and more frequent resignations. This logic results in the next proposition, which is central to our article.               "
"37","Proposition 4  The optimal firing probability, ministerial performance, and the arrival rate of resignations all increase with the size of the talent pool, and so all are expected to fall over time.                "
"38","The talent pool evaporates over time (the arrival of scandals and the firing probability are both positive), which generates the final claim of the proposition: a minister's tenure is expected to be longer when there is a shorter history of resignations prior to his appointment."
"39","A Decline in Government Performance The optimal firing probability declines as the talent pool shrinks, so that ministers perform less well and yet last for longer. This has implications for the interpretation of statistics on ministerial hazard rates. Berlinski et al. (2007) argued that “length of tenure must be some indicator of performance” and used indicators of a minister's quality to explain variation in hazard rates. We provide a caveat: fixing his talent, a minister who enters the government later (when the talent pool is depleted) performs less well than one who served earlier (and was replaced) but survives for longer. Thus to understand the relationship between performance and tenure we consider the strategy deployed by the Prime Minister.            "
"40","As an illustration consider again the second U.K. government of Prime Minister John Major. By the middle of 1993 the government had been rocked by successive scandals involving first David Mellor (Secretary of State for Heritage) and Michael Mates (Minister of State for Northern Ireland). As more ministers were forced to resign, the performance of Major's government declined. Ministers became involved in feuds over policy, most notably over the Maastricht Treaty, and jockeyed for position in the leadership contest that would follow Major's eventual downfall. By the middle of 1993, Major had become so exasperated by the performance of three of his main cabinet colleagues that, in an astonishing outburst, he openly branded them as “bastards.” And yet Major could not fire his rebels: the reserve of talent had been so depleted as to make further turnover untenable. Tristan Garel‐Jones observed that"
"41","                              "
"42"," … things had got even worse. Not only had the overall number of Conservative MPs fallen, while the number of incompetents and has‐beens had grown, there was also a much larger group who had already served in government and been worn out or found wanting by the process. Small wonder that it was so hard for John Major to give his administration an aura of either coherence or competence. (Paxman 2003, 210)                  "
"43","As a further example, consider the Australian government under Prime Minister John Howard, which began in March 1996. His Conservative party had campaigned on a policy of “clean government” and had introduced a “Code of Ministerial Conduct” as a means of fulfilling this pledge. This new code required ministers to be truthful in their communications to Parliament and to divest themselves of any shareholdings in companies affected by their ministerial portfolios. Between October 1996 and October 1997, seven cabinet ministers resigned following breaches of this ministerial code involving undisclosed shareholdings and unauthorized expenses. Ministers implicated later in the government term were dealt with more leniently. John Moore and Warwick Parer survived revelations about their shareholdings, and this indicated a relaxation of ministerial standards. Indeed in early 1999, the government announced that ministers would no longer be required to divest themselves of shareholdings."
"44","An optimal firing rule yields declining performance. This might explain why governments push forward their programs, and raises questions: how long does a government remain effective? What determines the length of effective (rather than ineffective) governance?"
"45","The Duration of Effective Government As Figure 2 illustrates, performance suffers as the talent pool declines. In situations with “all or nothing” choices by ministers, there is a natural interpretation of effectiveness: the government is effective when ministers devote maximal performance to their tasks and ineffective when they do not. Throughout most of this section we maintain the linear specification (or equivalent specifications, such as a binary work‐or‐not choice) so that our notion of effectiveness is unambiguous. Toward the end of the section we explain how most of our results and insights also hold under more general specifications.            "
"46","                 The Declining Talent Pool of Government                         "
"47"," Notes. Starting with a talent pool of size k = 3, the figure illustrates the value Wk of the Prime Minister's career (or, equivalently, the value of her government) as her talent pool declines. The height of each step reflects the decrease in value (Wk −Wk−1) as she runs down her talent pool. This loss increases as k declines and so qk declines with k. The length  of each step illustrates the expected tenure of a minister: this is inversely related to the risk he is exposed to and in turn comprises the exogenous risk γ of government failure together with the endogenous risk  of his resignation. This tenure is increasing as the size of the talent pool declines: the expected tenure of a minister increases although his performance decreases. The expected rate of decline of the government's fortunes is determined by , which is the steepness of each step. When γ is sufficiently small, this expected rate of decline falls as the talent pool evaporates.                        "
"48","Whether government is effective depends on the standards operated by the Prime Minister: it is effective when the firing rule is strict (formally, this is when the firing probability equals the critical threshold, so that ) and ineffective when that rule is lax (when the firing probability is minimized, so that ). Since the Prime Minister uses a stricter firing rule earlier on and relaxes it when the talent pool shrinks, we can obtain a corollary to Proposition 4.            "
"49","Corollary to Proposition 4  There is a critical talent‐pool size k*such that the optimal firing rule generates effective performance if and only if the talent pool meets or exceeds this threshold; performance falls after n −k*resignations, and from then on the government is ineffective."
"50","We have established that a government remains effective so long as its talent pool is deep enough. The duration of effective government stems from two elements: the tenure of each minister in the high‐performance regime and the number of ministers involved in that regime.10 This second element is the primary endogenous control variable of the Prime Minister and so we use it as our measure of the length of effective government: the “length of effective government” is the number of ministers n −k* who resign before the Prime Minister abandons her high‐performance regime and switches to the weakest feasible firing rule. We summarize the determinants of this length in the following proposition. For the purposes of this result an endogenous variable is “U shaped” in a parameter if it is at first (at least weakly) decreasing and then (at least weakly) increasing, and so is maximized by the extreme (high and low) values of the parameter.11"
"51","Proposition 5  The length of effective government is decreasing in the Prime Minister's value from holding office but increasing in the severity of scandals. It is increasing in a minister's benefits from office and his ability but decreasing in his opportunity cost of performance. Over the range of parameters for which high performance is feasible, the length of effective government is a U‐shaped function of the exogenous risk of termination and of the minimum firing probability.                "
"52","The first pair of monotonic comparative‐static predictions is unsurprising. When the Prime Minister cares deeply about holding office (that is,  is high) and little about scandals ( is low) then she maximizes her tenure by keeping standards low and reducing the length of effective government.               "
"53","The remaining monotonic predictions are also natural. When a minister covets his job and performance is cheap then he is influenced by a relatively low firing probability. Furthermore, when his ability is high then a switch to the high‐performance regime substantially reduces the arrival of scandals. These things extend the era of effective government and also enhance the tenure of a high‐performing minister; the duration of effective government rises unambiguously. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that high office benefits help performance. As argued by Caselli and Morelli (2004), such benefits can attract talented politicians.12 We have already established that such benefits induce greater effort. We now see that the Prime Minister imposes higher standards for longer. Furthermore, when ministers are more talented (c is lower and  is higher), the Prime Minister is more willing to exploit the talent available to her.               "
"54","Stability and Effectiveness Although political scientists have long studied government durability, neither the theoretical nor the empirical literature says much about the relationship between government survival and performance. It is clear that the hazard rate of governments should be related to its performance; however, the performance of the government may be affected by beliefs about its survival. Here the relationship turns out to be subtle: Proposition 5 reveals a nonmonotonic relationship between the length of effective government and the arrival rate of exogenous failure. The “U shaped” feature ensures that the length of effective government is maximized when exogenous instability is largely absent (γ is low) or is very important (γ is large). The nonmonotonicity stems from a conflict between two conflicting forces.            "
"55","Firstly, as the exogenous risk of termination rises then it becomes harder to induce high performance. This is because the extra risk lowers the value of a minister's career, and so (via the income effect) he cares less about avoiding resignation calls. To induce high performance requires a higher firing probability, and from the Prime Minister's perspective this is costly; she reacts by contracting the length of effective government. Secondly, the heightened exogenous risk means that the government is less likely to survive long enough to run out of talent. Under these circumstances the Prime Minister cares more about the current performance of her ministers and avoiding costly scandals than about the longer‐term effect of talent‐pool depletion: adopting a “live for today” attitude, she endogenously increases the length of effective government."
"56","Bringing these two forces together, the first dominates for smaller γ, while the second can dominate for larger γ. Thus an increase in exogenous government instability and reduction in the overall duration of government can result in an increase in the length of effective government. A caveat is that it becomes impossible to induce high performance once the exogenous risk of termination becomes large enough; essentially, if that risk is very high then a minister values his career so little that even the highest penalty for being hit by a scandal is not enough to overcome the opportunity cost of performance.13 Hence, as the exogenous risk increases, we identify (Figure 3) four phases of response: (1) when γ is low enough, then even the minimum firing probability q‡ is enough to induce high performance and so the government is always effective; (2) for larger γ, the length of effective government falls as it becomes more costly to encourage performance; (3) due to high instability the Prime Minister “lives for today” and increases standards; and (4) finally γ is so large that ministers no longer value their careers and so always devote minimum effort to their tasks.            "
"57","                 The Duration of Effective Government                         "
"58"," Notes. For region (i), the lower bound q‡ on the firing probability is enough to induce high effort, whereas in region (iv) the value of a minister's career is so low that it is impossible to generate positive effort. The remaining two regions illustrate the “U shaped” response described in Proposition 5.                        "
"59","These results are significant for considering the effects of institutions designed to enhance stability, such as a requirement for an investiture vote for an incoming government. Our results suggest that such changes need not lead to more effective government. Any such constitutional engineering, to borrow Sartori's phrase, must be informed by an understanding of agency problems of governance, including the endogenous reaction to changes in institutional design by the executive's leader."
"60","Imposing Standards When faced with a scandal, the Prime Minister has only partial discretion: if the severity of a scandal is severe enough then the misdemeanor is so grave that the minister must go. What counts as a grave event may depend on the mood of the populace or on political circumstance; more generally a Prime Minister's discretion may be circumscribed by institutions. For example, in the United Kingdom, ministerial misdemeanors are referred to the Committee for Standards in Public Life. The committee's judgment need not determine the Prime Minister's action. However, in practice a rebuke from it terminates a career. For example, Home Secretary David Blunkett resigned in December 2004 after the committee found that he had broken rules of conduct by fast‐tracking a visa for the nanny of his then‐lover Kimberly Quinn.            "
"61","The imposition of standards in public life is seen as a means of enhancing accountability, leading to better performance. However, the length of effective government is a “U shaped” function of the minimum feasible firing probability (Proposition 5). This minimum probability grows with the exogenous imposition of stricter standards. Thus, starting from a position of low standards, the gradual imposition of higher ministerial standards contracts the length of effective government and it only extends this length when standards become sufficiently high."
"62","This nonmonotonic response stems from two conflicting forces. Firstly, an increase in exogenous standards lowers the net cost of inducing high performance. This net cost is determined by the increase q*−q‡ in the firing probability needed for a minister to devote himself to his tasks. Secondly, the increase in q‡ makes it difficult to maintain longevity in the low‐performance regime. The Prime Minister responds by requiring a larger buffer of low‐performing ministers.            "
"63","These effects are easiest to see by setting q‡= 0. In this case, the Prime Minister can insist on high performance from the first n − 1 ministers since she will never be forced to fire the last minister. Thus, when exogenous standards are eliminated, the length of effective government is at least n − 1. As q‡ increases, this safety net disappears and the Prime Minister responds with lower standards by inducing high performance from fewer ministers. This second force can dominate the first.            "
"64","Corollary to Proposition 5  The exogenous imposition of higher ministerial standards can lead to an endogenous contraction in the length of effective government.                "
"65","The U‐shaped response to the minimum firing probability means that a contraction in the length of effective government happens when standards are initially low. However, the clamor for stricter exogenous regulation of ministers is likely to be largest in this case. Under these circumstances it might pay to strengthen the discretion of the Prime Minister rather than to diminish it."
"66","Beyond All‐or‐Nothing Performance So far in this section we have considered situations in which ministers devote either maximal or minimal performance to their tasks, so enabling us to discuss cleanly the notion of effective government. Nevertheless, it is important to consider more general specifications. A natural measure of effectiveness becomes the ministerial performance which the Prime Minister chooses to induce for each possible talent‐pool size. If ek falls for every k following a change in a parameter, then we can say that government becomes less effective.            "
"67","Under a general specification for λ(e), our first observation is that our insights regarding the effect of both the exogenous risk of termination and the minimum firing probability are robust. Whereas performance is not necessarily U‐shaped in these parameters, the important insight is that performance (and hence effectiveness) is not always monotonic. The role of the Corollary to Proposition 5 (a statement which is generally true) is to demonstrate that higher exogenous standards do not necessarily increase effectiveness. This demonstration requires only a counterexample, and the all‐or‐nothing specification is a simple way of satisfying that requirement.            "
"68","Turning to our other results, the first claims of Proposition 5 concerning the Prime Minister's preferences do not rely on any particular form for the arrival rate of scandals. For instance, when the Prime Minister places greater value on holding office (so that  rises) then, other things equal, she wishes to extend her tenure by slowing the depletion of the talent pool; slackening her firing rule, along with the reduced performance which this entails, is an obvious way to do that.            "
"69","Proposition 6  Under a general specification for λ(e), an increase in the Prime Minister's value from holding office or a decrease in the severity of scandals both reduce the effectiveness of government: for every talent‐pool size, the firing probability and ministerial performance both fall."
"70","The remaining claims of Proposition 5 concern a minister's office benefits, his ability, and the opportunity cost of his performance. It is straightforward to confirm that the effectiveness of government is increasing in the minister's ability. To show that effectiveness is increasing with office benefits (or, equivalently, decreasing in the opportunity cost of performance) requires some structure on λ(e). Nevertheless, there are specifications of λ(e) for which the claim holds.14"
"71","The limited depth of the talent pool weakens the willingness to fire and so dulls the incentives of ministers. Here we allow the talent pool to be replenished. We consider the reactions of ministers to increased replenishment, the impact of replenishment on the reaction of ministers to a stricter firing rule, and the relationship between replenishment and the Prime Minister's credibility."
"72","Expanding the Talent Pool When the talent pool is finite, then so is the life span of effective government. This problem might be mitigated when a larger talent pool is available or when new talent can emerge. This suggests, in turn, that restrictive selection methods might damage performance. For example, in parliamentary systems, since the executive must maintain the confidence of the legislature (and in some cases faces a formal vote of investiture), selection is usually restricted to members of the legislative body.15 Lifting this restriction may raise the size of the ministerial talent pool. Of course, the value of the Prime Minister's career (and of her government) is increasing in the size of her talent pool. This suggests that more talent is always a good thing.16"
"73","Introducing New Talent Whereas the talent pool may be fixed at a particular time, and subject to an upper bound (perhaps the size of the legislature), we can envisage a world in which talent flows into the pool. For instance, a new backbencher might gain enough experience to become a candidate for office. We adapt our model so that as talent evaporates it might be replenished.            "
"74","Formally, new talent arrives with Poisson arrival rate β so long as k < n. We think of a situation where β is low as the adoption of restrictive selection methods: for example, the government might be selected from amongst the talents in the majority party; or from a strict minimal winning coalition of parties; or, even more restrictively, from certain factions within those parties. A higher β might correspond, on the other hand, with a situation where the Prime Minister can develop the candidacy of other citizens, whether elected or not. When β= 0 there is a risk that the government terminates prematurely due to endogenous talent‐pool depletion. Conversely, as  the talent pool is replenished as quickly as it is depleted, so that only the exogenous termination risk remains.            "
"75","The Effect of Replenishment We assume for now that the Prime Minister continues to employ a firing rule which depends on the size of the talent pool. In this situation, the problem faced by a minister in office changes: he recognizes that the talent pool may expand, which will change the firing probability he faces and hence the value of his career.            "
"76","To understand this argument, consider a minister who holds his post when the talent pool contains k members. He faces a firing probability . In the absence of replenishment, this single firing probability determines his performance via the substitution‐effect and income‐effect channels. Now consider a world in which replenishment is positive. This same minister anticipates that the talent pool may grow from k to k + 1 members. If this happens, then the firing probability he faces changes, since this firing probability depends on the talent‐pool size. If , then this change is unwelcome, since the expansion of the talent pool prompts a reduction in the Prime Minister's tolerance of scandals. The anticipation of such an event lowers the value of the minister's career even prior to the talent pool's replenishment.            "
"77","It might seem reasonable to suggest that increased replenishment will lead a minister to fear for his position. However, this influences the behavior of a minister only via the income effect on the value of his career. If it lowers the value of his career then his fear of resignation will also fall, leading to an (unwanted) reduction in performance. The value of his career does indeed decline with an increase in the replenishment rate β whenever the firing probability increases with the size of the talent pool; this claim stems directly from the argument given here and (following some formal analysis contained in our appendix) generates the following proposition."
"78","Proposition 7  If the firing probability is increasing in the size of the talent pool, then, fixing the firing strategy, an increase in the replenishment rate reduces ministerial performance.                "
"79","In particular, starting from zero replenishment the firing probability does increase with the size of the talent pool, and so the first step toward a world with replenishment harms performance."
"80","Summarizing: a higher firing probability reduces the value of a career; higher replenishment means that the minister faces the possibility that he will be exposed to a harsher regime in the future; this reduces the value of his career today; the income effect means that he reduces his performance. The message here is that the apparently welcome shift to a world with a greater inflow of new talent can, perhaps surprisingly, have some negative effects. The central reason is that ministers are not myopic: they react not only to the environment which they face today, but anticipate changes in their environment when the Prime Minister's circumstances (the size of her talent pool) change."
"81","A corollary of Proposition 7 is that any exogenous depletion of the talent pool can help to increase performance: the firing rule weakens as the pool dries up, and so a minister foresees an easier life in the future; by enhancing his performance today he increases the likelihood of being able to enjoy that future easy life. An open question here is this: what might cause the talent pool to become depleted, other than the minister's own resignation and replacement? One answer is that the Prime Minister may be using the talent pool as a supply for multiple ministerial posts; thus a minister may benefit from a weaker firing rule when another minister is fired."
"82","Beyond our comparative‐static analysis of replenishment, we also consider a marginal increase in the severity of the firing rule. When replenishment is absent, the firing probability  influences only the performance of a minister faced with a k‐strong talent pool. However, when the talent pool is replenished, the probability  also influences ministers faced with smaller talent pools.               "
"83","Consider, for instance, a situation where the talent pool is shallower; it contains k′ members where k′ < k. A minister recognizes that if k −k′ new members arrive then he will face a firing probability  rather than . An attempt to increase performance by strengthening a firing rule may have unintended consequences by dampening the behavior of those who are not directly faced by such a firing rule. The reason for this is that, once again, ministers look to the incentives they are likely to face in the future as well as the present when they calculate the value of their careers.               "
"84","Proposition 8  Fixing a replenishment rate β > 0, an increase in the firing probability for a k‐strong talent pool increases the performance of a minister facing such a talent pool but reduces the performance of ministers when the talent‐pool size is smaller."
"85","We have noted that an increase in the severity of the firing rule can have both income and substitution effects. Following a rise in , both effects influence ek; the substitution effect dominates and so performance rises. For larger talent‐pool sizes (a talent pool with k′ members where k′ > k) the probability  has no effect: after all, a minister recognizes that the talent pool can only grow while he is in post, and so he will never face the firing probability . For shallow pools, however, the income effect is present; it works against performance, since the increase in  lowers the value of a minister's future career and hence (since he is far‐sighted rather than myopic) his present career. In summary, talent‐pool replenishment can sometimes diminish performance, suggesting that the relaxation of restrictions on ministerial selection is not necessarily an unalloyed blessing.               "
"86","Replenishment and Reputation To provide incentives, the Prime Minister must implement her firing rule. But will she carry out her threats? Here we show how the presence of a replenishing talent pool can help to support the credibility of the Prime Minister's firing rule.            "
"87","The credibility issue arises due to the finite depth of the talent pool. When the pool is drained, the “last man standing” is pivotal and so the Prime Minister never willingly fires him; a firing rule which specifies a firing probability above the minimum when the talent pool is empty (formally, a rule satisfying ) lacks credibility. Insisting on dynamic consistency, the minimum firing probability is used when k = 0. Of course, we can now apply the same logic for a talent pool with only one member; even if the Prime Minister sacrifices her reputation by failing to implement a relatively strict firing rule, this will have no repercussions. Continuing this argument iteratively, we conclude that threats are empty; somewhat more formally,  for all k.            "
"88","Proposition 9  In the absence of talent‐pool replenishment (that is, when  β= 0), the Prime Minister will never willingly fire a scandal‐hit minister. Hence, if she enjoys no commitment power then the only credible firing rule involves the minimum feasible firing probability."
"89","It is generally true that when the talent pool is empty a Prime Minister will never willingly fire her minister; if she did so then her government would end. However, the argument that she will never carry out her threat to the penultimate minister (so that there is one replacement remaining in the talent pool) relies on the absence of replenishment; this absence means that there is no future in which the Prime Minister's reputation for fulfilling her promises matters. With positive replenishment, however, there is a future in which a reputation is valuable. The presence of reputation effects, therefore, opens the door to the credibility of a Prime Minister's firing strategy."
"90","To explore this issue more formally, we consider the simplest possible “2 × 2” setting: a world with all‐or‐nothing performance and where the talent pool contains either one member or nobody. Specifically, we suppose that full performance by a minister at a cost of  reduces the arrival rate of scandals from  to . We also set n = 1 so that the talent pool is either “full”(k = 1) or “empty”(k = 0). When the talent pool is empty, it is replenished (it switches to a full state) at the Poisson arrival rate β > 0. The last‐man‐standing argument continues to apply when the talent pool is empty, and so . When choosing the firing probability for the “full” talent pool, the Prime Minister chooses either  (low performance) or  (high performance).               "
"91","Suppose that the Prime Minister would strictly prefer to induce high performance when the talent pool is full. Using equation (2), modified to incorporate the replenishment effect (see the appendix), we can calculate W1 (the value when the talent pool is full) and W0 (the value when it is empty); of course, these values satisfy W1 > W0. The alternative firing strategy available to the Prime Minister is to minimize the firing probability when the talent pool is full and so remain content with low performance. Using similar calculations we can find values  and .               "
"92","If  then there are no credibility problems; the Prime Minister has no desire to induce high performance and so there are no threats to carry out. However, if , so that high performance from a full talent pool is desirable, the Prime Minister is tempted to renege on her promises. This leads us to ask: when is her firing rule credible?               "
"93","To answer, let us begin by supposing that the Prime Minister has convinced her ministers that she carries out her promises. If the talent pool is full and her minister encounters a scandal over which she has discretion, and the firing rule determines that she should sack him, then she faces a loss of W1−W0 if she backs her threat with action. However, if she reneges then her ministers might not believe her in the future. The worst that can happen is that her ministers never believe her again; that is, from then on they assume that she will never fire a minister. This means that the Prime Minister keeps her minister (thus k = 1) but moves into a permanent “low performance” regime with a value of . This entails a loss of . Assembling these observations, a Prime Minister is willing to carry out her threat if and only if ; this says that having a reputation for carrying out promises is worth more than having an extra talent‐pool member. The inequality  is a credibility constraint: if it is satisfied then there is an equilibrium (indeed, there may be many equilibria) in which the Prime Minister can credibly sustain her reputation; but if it fails then she cannot. Of course, W1 > W0 and so the credibility constraint is harder to satisfy than the desirability constraint. This means that there are parameters for which the Prime Minister wishes to impose high performance but is unable to maintain credibility. Whether these inequalities are satisfied depends on the replenishment rate. Within the context of this “2 × 2” world (the talent pool is full or empty; performance is high or low) we obtain the following proposition.               "
"94","Proposition 10  There are two critical replenishment rates satisfying βH > βL≥ 0such that if β≥βHthen the Prime Minister wishes to set and is able to do so credibly; but if βH > β > βLthen she wishes to set but is unable to do so credibly."
"95","As the replenishment rate rises, the Prime Minister is less concerned with talent depletion and so the desire for higher standards is natural. Furthermore, this also makes her more willing to sacrifice her minister, for precisely the same reasons. However, when βL < β < βH replenishment is not rapid enough for her to resist the temptation to renege on her threat.               "
"96","Our theory adds to a growing principal‐agent literature applicable to parliamentary democracies that focuses on cabinet accountability. In our model, ministers may undermine the government if they do not devote themselves to government policy. This aspect of our model is related to previous work that focuses on the implementation of policy in parliamentary democracies.17 In our model, a leader provides incentives by firing those seen to fail. This feature is common to other agency models (Gailmard and Patty 2007; Huber and Gordon 2002; Shotts and Wiseman 2008), but here our contribution is to shed light on a tension between the provision of incentives via turnover and the desire to preserve talent. Whilst, a priori, the effect of stricter standards is ambiguous, the optimal firing rule weakens over the life span of a government. An important implication is that variation in tenure can reflect differences in the way that ministers are managed; when the firing rule becomes more lenient, ministers who perform less well can survive for longer.         "
"97","An empirical contribution of our theory is that it helps us to understand the mechanisms that lie beneath observed relations in the data on ministerial careers. In particular, we challenge the view that longer tenure is associated with better performance. That view does not take into account how a firing rule may vary over time: we show that longer tenure may in fact be associated with lower endogenous standards (a lower firing probability) and thus lower performance."
"98","Our account is not the only one that may explain a decline in executive performance. Recall that we began our investigation with Key (1956), who stated that “the men we elect to office and the circumstances we create that affect their work determine the nature of popular government.” We have considered a world where the “circumstances that affect their work” are responsible for declining performance. Of course, such a decline may instead be attributed to “the men we elect to office.” We might, for example, think of a world where ministers are heterogenous in their ability, and where the leader first appoints to office the most talented of her ministrables. Absent the moral‐hazard problem, such ministers will devote maximal effort to their tasks, and the Prime Minister will adopt the most lenient firing rule. As the administration proceeds through the talent pool, performance falls and scandals arrive more quickly. There is no change in the firing rule, and so the accelerated arrival of scandals also accelerates the arrival of ministerial resignations.         "
"99","Whilst these alternatives both explain a decline in executive performance, they present very different predictions with regard to ministerial hazard rates. Whilst our moral‐hazard story shows that the firing rule weakens as more ministers are fired and so predicts that those entering government later will survive longer, the alternative hypothesis leads to the opposite prediction."
