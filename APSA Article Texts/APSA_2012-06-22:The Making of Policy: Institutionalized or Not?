"1","Typical models of institutional policymaking such as those summarized in Persson and Tabellini (2000) study policy determination specifying political institutions as the rules of the game in which policies are decided. Such models are quite explicit about those formal rules, but for their analysis to be valid there is also an implicit assumption that actors in the model can only play within those rules and institutions; this assumes that alternative actions are either technologically impossible or somehow forbidden by (enforced) decisions at some other level. That is not a bad approximation for studying policymaking in a number of modern polities (at least in normal times), but it seems to miss a very important part of the action in other cases.         "
"2","We suggest extending those models to include alternative political actions undertaken in additional arenas, as well as the interactions among players in different arenas. Borrowing the language of Acemoglu and Robinson (2006), we suggest calling de jure political power the one assigned by formal political institutions and de facto political power the one assigned by the technologies of alternative political action. For instance, if the alternative to institutionalized decision making was the threat of violence, such power would be conferred by the capacity to exercise violence.         "
"3","The capacity to function within formal institutions as well as the capacity to be effective through those alternative channels will be, in part, endogenous to ex ante decisions by each player. Actors will have to make an ex ante decision on whether to invest resources in the more institutionalized arenas, such as Congress or political parties, or to invest in alternative technologies (such as violence, or corrupting politicians). In the specific model below, the investment stage will be followed by a rather short game, which captures in expected value what is more properly a potentially long sequence of policymaking events given those initial investments."
"4","Classifying a set of various possible political actions (actions to influence collective decision‐making) into “institutionalized” and “alternative” is to some extent an arbitrary choice. Which way one wants to classify things in practice depends on the exact question at hand. Table 1 presents several examples of political actions. Some of them, towards the left of the diagram in white, are closer to the more institutionalized end of the spectrum (forming a political party, writing to your congressperson), while others, towards the right of the diagram in dark gray, are clearly within the realm of the alternative (road blockades, physical threats). A number of other political actions are harder to classify, including different forms of business and union influence,5 as well as demonstrations to elicit public support. Going into the darker side of Table 1 and of reality, we would have no difficulty in classifying as “alternative” strategies such as that exercised by Colombian drug lords when offering new judges the choice between plata (bribes) or plomo (bullets), as discussed in Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Di Tella (2006).         "
"5","In the rest of the article, we work at some level of abstraction, focusing on a “black or white” classification in which some actions take place within the institutional realm and others outside formal institutional channels. For concreteness, we will refer to the alternative political technology (APT) as “road blockades,” but the abstract formulation could also represent other things, such as collective action by some economic sectors to damage the economy."
"6","In the model it is assumed that taking the institutional road or the “street” road are indeed alternatives. This is a simplified way of capturing an important point of our argument, which emphasizes the investment component of institutions. Political actions such as voting, campaigning for your favorite candidate, writing letters to your congressperson, participating in peaceful protests, participating in violent protests, threatening to kill your opponents, and killing Supreme Court Justices need not be substitutes. Under some conditions they are used jointly, and under other conditions they are used separately by different actors in different political equilibria. Pending a more general understanding of the conditions under which different actions are taken jointly or separately, this article emphasizes mechanisms (such as investment under budget or time constraints) that make these actions alternatives.6 Figure 1 suggests that citizens in Latin America tend to view contacting their representatives in Congress and protesting in the streets as alternative political options.         "
"7","                Congress or the Street? (18 Latin American Countries, 2008)"
"8","The actors in our game, then, will have to make a prior decision on whether to enter the more formal or the less formal arenas of political action. These decisions at the level of individual actors are then aggregated in equilibrium. Political actors take different roads depending on what the environment has to offer them, and their aggregate choices have an effect on that environment. This bidirectional causality is at the heart of the issues of reinforcement and multiplicity of equilibria, which we elaborate upon after presenting the model."
"9","Our contribution is obviously not totally novel; it draws inspiration and insights from various extant literatures. Previous contributions considering the impact of alternative political technologies on some aspects of the workings of formal political institutions include Ellman and Wantchekon's (2000) study of electoral competition under the threat of political unrest, and studies by Dal Bó and Di Tella (2003) and Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Di Tella (2006) on political agency models in which interest groups can harm politicians.7 Humphreys (2001) analyzes allocations when the enforcement of bargains cannot be taken for granted; Humphreys defines such environments as “weakly institutionalized.”Levitsky and Murillo (2009) explore issues related to those explored here, attempting to conceptualize the notion of institutional weakness and also to emphasize the notion of investments in institutions. There are very rich literatures studying contentious political actions and political violence, but only recently have these types of political actions, such as voting, begun to be studied in an integrated manner with more institutionalized ones (Dunning 2011 and references there). Our discussion is also related to studies of economic agents’ choice of whether to produce or to fight, for instance Hirshleifer (2001) and Garfinkel and Skaperdas (1996). See also Lindvall (2008) for a recent model of protests.         "
"10","Przeworski (2009) is an insightful recent effort motivated by the same questions and Latin American observations as this article. Even though this article touches upon general discussions, our empirical referent is modern‐day Latin America: countries with intermediate levels of institutional development where electoral democracy is not in question, but where the issue is the degree to which places such as Congress are effective institutional knots in the flow of political power and policy. The literature on democratic consolidation is concerned with similar issues at a higher level, where the variable of concern is democracy itself. For instance, in the words of Adam Przeworski, “if democracy is to be consolidated, distributive conflict must be institutionalized: all major political forces must channel their economic demands through the democratic institutions and abjure other tactics” (1992, 127).         "
"11","In the conclusions, we speculate on ways in which similar models could be used to think about transitions from autocracy, which is not the focus of this article.         "
"12","Any model within the framework suggested will need to specify three components that will constitute sets of exogenous parameters for comparative statics purposes: (1) policy problem (mapping from feasible policy vectors to utilities of the players, which subsumes aspects of the socioeconomic structure and available policy technologies); (2) political institutions; and (3) alternative political technologies (APTs). Any assumption about (3) will embed considerations of mappings from alternative actions to utilities, as well as about collective action, commitment technologies, allocation protocols in informal arenas, and protocols of interaction among different political arenas. In the spirit of a first article of what we hope will be a longer line of models of institutions enriched with alternative political actions, we have chosen very simple “components” for the various parts of the model. We chose a particularly simple formulation for the institutionalized part of the game (a baby legislative‐bargaining model), an exceedingly stark alternative political technology, and a very streamlined logic of interaction among those two arenas. Modifying any of these assumptions constitutes the comparative statics agenda we want to promote. In the concluding section, we suggest a few such extensions."
"13","In the example here, the policy problem is a standard allocation problem of splitting a pie of size X among n risk‐neutral players, and political institutions are a simple variant of the well‐known legislative‐bargaining model set forth by Baron and Ferejohn (1989), which we explain below.8 For brevity and concreteness, the APT is described as a road blockade (“going to the street”). Participating in a road blockade has an individual cost c. If at least T players protest, they can (credibly) threaten to inflict a damage of size K, with  and . If fewer than T people engage in the blockade, they cannot cause any damage. This simplified damage technology is represented in Figure 2, where m stands for the number of people who choose this alternative. This formulation captures in a stark manner some properties of the framework; in particular, it embeds a scale economy / strategic complementarity that will be the seed of multiplicity of equilibria. (Parameters such as c or T will depend on various issues, including “repression technologies” in place.) It is also assumed that “The Street” acts as a unified actor, ignoring collective action issues among those blocking the streets (after the threshold T) (assumption A1), it splits whatever it receives equally among its members (assumption A2), and it is endowed with a commitment technology: it can commit ex ante to cause damage or not in response to specified actions by players in the formal arena (assumption A3).         "
"14","                Damage Technology"
"15","The latter assumption, common in the related literature (Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Di Tella 2006; Ellman and Wanchtekon 2000),9 is imposed to avoid a lengthy analysis of the conditions under which such a threat would be credible, which would require adding more structure to the extensive form or turning it into a repeated game to include considerations of reputation. In the context of nonrepeated games, the threat of damage would be credible when it constitutes a weakly dominant strategy in the final move, something that could be easily adjusted in our model. Furthermore, there is an important literature on fairness, altruistic punishment, and spitefulness, which argues that punishments are indeed inflicted even when they are costly for the punisher in narrow self‐interest terms.10 Those results, often obtained in rather aseptic experiments, are even more likely to obtain in the specific context of our focus: once the protesters are out in the street, it might be easier to enforce “damage in case of unfulfilled demands” than “no damage in case of fulfilled demands.”11 There are also some technologies, such as permanent squatting, where it is more costly to stop inflicting costs on others (leaving) than to continue doing so (staying).         "
"16","Let  be the set of players. The economy is subject to the aggregate constraint  Each player maximizes his or her piece , net of a possible cost c that he or she pays in some cases. Each agent is endowed with pi units of (ex ante) de jure political power, with pi < pi+1, and . The timing of the game, represented in Figure 3, is as follows.12"
"17","                Timing of the Game"
"18","Stage 1. Each player (simultaneously) chooses an action , where ai= 1 means going to Congress and ai= 0 going to the street, which carries a cost c > 0. This action represents an investment that enables the player to become effective in one of the two arenas.  will be the aggregate investment in formal institutions, capturing the degree of institutionalization, which we discuss after solving the model. Let m be the number of players who go to the street, and n−m the number of players who go to Congress. Let M denote the set of players in the street and  the set of players in Congress.            "
"19","Stage 2. Among those who went to Congress, nature chooses an agenda setter . Each player i in Congress has an ex post probability  of being recognized as the agenda setter.            "
"20","Stage 3. The players in the street announce levels of damage d they will inflict on the economy as a function of the amount Z they collectively receive from “the government.” By A3, that threat is credible. By A2, each of them receives a piece z=Z/m. Let  be a threshold of critical mass for action in the street. If  they can cause a damage of size K; otherwise they cannot cause any damage.13"
"21","Stage 4. After listening to the threat of The Street, the agenda setter in Congress () proposes an allocation of the pie . For brevity, we introduce the ex post distributional assumption A2 as an ex ante constraint on the agenda setter's proposal, by requiring at this stage that the share for each person in the street is the same, that is,  for all .            "
"22","Stage 5. The n−m  players in Congress vote on . Let  denote the choice of congressperson i, where 0 and 1 respectively represent voting against and for 's proposal.            "
"23","The outcome of the legislative process, the vector , will be:14"
"24","Stage 6. Those in the street implement the damage announced in 3.            "
"25","Stage 7. The allocation is implemented. If no damage was caused, each player receives xi=siX. If damage was caused, each player receives xi=si(X−K).            "
"26","The solution is proven formally in the online Supporting Information section. The model is solved by backward induction in two steps. First we find equilibrium play for any partition of the set of players and for any realization of the agenda setter consistent with that partition. Then we find the Nash equilibria to the venue choice of all players in stage 1, taking as continuation payoffs those deriving from the policymaking game. We provide here an intuitive explanation of that solution.15"
"27","Given the assumption of commitment by protesters, stages 6 and 7 are mechanically implemented after decisions 4–5 are made. The latter is a standard legislative‐bargaining game with a small twist. It is easy to show that the agenda setter will give her status quo reservation level (which is zero in our simplified model) to a minimum‐winning coalition of players in Congress, nothing to the other players in Congress, and (hence) allocate the whole pie, except anything given to the protesters, to herself. The novel question is how much to give to the protesters. Clearly, if m < T, the agenda setter will give nothing to protesters. If , then the amount she will allocate to the protesters will depend on the amount Z that they request. If they request Z > K, the agenda setter will give them nothing, since it is better to keep (X−K) than (X−Z). If they request , then the agenda setter will grant them Z. This response will lead the protesters (in stage 3) to request exactly Z=K, since they will get nothing if they go above K, and K is preferred to anything below it. Each protester will receive K/m.         "
"28","Given that stage 2 is a move by nature, this brings us to the key choice of arenas in stage 1. Each player has to decide between the two arenas, given his expectation of what he will receive if he goes to Congress and if he goes to the street, taking as given the choices of all the other (n− 1) players. Finding equilibria to the whole game, then, consists of finding the Nash equilibrium to these n individual decisions on ai. We present the results in the following proposition, which is presented more formally and proven in the Supporting Information.         "
"29","Proposition 1."
"30","            "
"31","There always exists a Full Institutionalization Equilibrium (FIE) in which everybody is in Congress and no alternative arenas are used."
"32","For some parameter values, there is also a Low Institutionalization Equilibrium (LIE) in which actors go to the street."
"33","The existence of the FIE is guaranteed by the fact that if only one player chooses to be in the street in order to set a blockade, he will be unable to credibly threaten to cause any damage, and hence will receive zero from the agenda setter, getting a final payoff of –, which is less than what he would expect to receive in Congress. No one would want to deviate unilaterally from a FIE.         "
"34","Figure 4 provides an intuitive representation of the LIE. The figure plots the value of being in Congress (the upward‐sloping curve) and the value of being in the street (the downward‐sloping curve) from the point of view of an individual player as a function of his or her type (i) and probability of being the agenda setter (pi), under the assumption (which is true in the type of LIE we select, see Supporting Information) that all players of lower pj will be in the street, and all players of higher pj will be in Congress. Let  be the highest integer to the left of the point where these two curves intersect. Players 1 to  (those with the lowest ex ante probabilities of being selected agenda setter in Congress) will go to the street, and players  to n will go to Congress. The result is fairly intuitive: players with weaker chances of getting what they want in formal political institutions are the ones more likely to utilize alternative political technologies.16"
"35","                Low Institutionalization Equilibrium"
"36","The low institutionalization equilibrium takes us back to the world of the models described in the introduction, where the institutionalized part of the game is the only relevant one—i.e., public policies are decided in formal arenas (and actors invest in institutional capabilities, as we argue in the next section). The low institutionalization equilibrium, on the other hand, will be characterized by the use of alternative political technologies and by the weakness of formal institutional arenas."
"37","The simple static model above provides glimpses into more general issues we want to raise regarding different degrees of institutionalization of policymaking across polities. In particular, the model captures in a very compressed way (through the initial investment, and through beliefs about other people's actions implicit in different equilibria) some richer dynamics characterizing institutions and institutionalization. Institutions reflect past investments; summarize information, beliefs, and expectations; and incorporate self‐reinforcement effects."
"38","Recognizing that there is no agreed‐upon terminology with respect to institutions and institutionalization, we would say “the U.S. Congress is more institutionalized than the Argentine Congress.” The U.S. Congress is a central institution in U.S. policymaking; its members exhibit remarkable longevity and specialize in committees; it engages in considerable oversight of the public bureaucracy, and it is the focus and main entry point of political action by any interest group attempting to influence American policymaking.17 The Argentine Congress does not share any of these features, in spite of the fact that Argentina has a constitutional structure similar to that of the United States (Jones et al. 2002). The comparison can also be made among countries of similar levels of development: the Chilean legislature plays a much more important role in the policymaking process of that country than does its Argentine counterpart (Stein and Tommasi 2008). These different roles in policymaking are associated with various measures of legislators’ and legislatures’ capabilities, which have a clear investment component or that reflect the beliefs of various actors: longevity of legislative careers, legislators’ education, specialization in policy committees, resources available for policy analysis, esteem in the eyes of the public, and appreciation of Congress as an important place in politicians’ careers—Saiegh (2010) builds measures of such characteristics.         "
"39","When Congress and the political party system are effective conduits of preference aggregation and political bargaining, various relevant actors place their bets on (make investments in) those institutions, most citizens believe that those are the spaces where relevant decisions are made, and this whole logic reinforces and becomes self‐fulfilling. On the contrary, if such institutional arenas are not taken too seriously and everybody knows that the way of getting something out of the political system is to blockade a road (or to bribe the president), those investments in the institutionalization of Congress or parties are not undertaken, and the weakness of formal institutions is reinforced. The logic of self‐reinforcement of institutions is central to the concerns of various strands of institutionalism in the social sciences."
"40","Scholars in the game theoretic tradition (as well as common usage) refer to institutions “as rules,” and also “as equilibria.” The standard “Northian” definition has become “the rules of the game in a society, the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction.” A number of scholars have turned to a conception of institutions as equilibrium phenomena. It is ultimately the behavior of others rather than the rules themselves that induces each person to behave (or not) in the way prescribed by the rules.18 The model above captures these two distinct usages of the notion of institutions in a simple manner. On the one hand, it has political institutions as rules in the allocation of de jure political power (the rules of the Baron‐Ferejohn game). On the other, it generates different degrees of institutionalization in equilibrium, as captured by , the aggregate investment in formal institutions (which is a fixed point in the beliefs of all actors with respect to the actions of everybody else).         "
"41","Even within the context of a simplified static model, the result of having multiple equilibria (with different equilibria characterized by its degree of institutionalization) captures an important aspect of institutions. It also opens the door for the very relevant considerations so important to historical institutionalists (Pierson and Skocpol 2002; Thelen 1999) on the way in which specific temporal sequences, critical junctures, and historically grounded events matter in explaining different trajectories.         "
"42","Multiplicity of equilibria arises in the model of this article due to a stark strategic complementarity introduced by the shape of the damage technology. Beyond the specificities of our formulation, an extreme simplification of threshold models of collective action (Granovetter 1978; Lohmann 1994; Oliver 1993), there are a number of reasons to expect strategic complementarities, reinforcement effects, and hence the possibility of multiple equilibria in institutionalization. Unconventional forms of political participation tend to be chosen where institutions are of lower quality, but those very decisions feed back into the weakness of formal institutions. Strategic complementarities are likely to be present in the action choices of players with regard to any given APT (as already present in the model),19 but also with regard to the actions and investment choices within any specific formal institution, such as Congress. Furthermore, there are reasons why alternative activities of one type are likely to induce alternative activities of other types. For instance, Trucco (2009) shows a complementarity between “bribes by the rich” and “street protests by the poor” as countervailing forces that tend to happen together in polities with weaker political institutions. Similarly, there tend to be important systemic effects across various institutionalized arenas. For instance, Stein and Tommasi (2007) and Scartascini, Stein, and Tommasi (2009) show a positive correlation among measures of institutional strength in various domains (Congress, party system, judiciary, the bureaucracy) across countries.         "
"43","Even though not quite modeled explicitly in this article, having different degrees of institutionalization of policymaking has important welfare consequences. In our simple model, the cost of incomplete institutionalization is just . There are various reasons (some of which could be incorporated in a richer dynamic formulation of this model) why more institutionalized collective decision‐making arenas tend to lead to better policies and better outcomes. Investing in technologies that increase strength and capabilities in the institutionalized game (such as hiring PhDs in Public Policy) or in technologies that increase strength and capabilities in alternative arenas (such as hiring goons) is likely to have a different impact on the strength and productivity of formal institutions, as well as on the quality of the output the polity generates. Scartascini and Tommasi (2012) show that more institutionalized policymaking environments are associated with better public policies, which in turn induce better economic outcomes. One of the reasons behind that result is likely to be that more institutionalized policymaking arenas provide a better structure for exchange of information and for the agreement and enforcement of intertemporal cooperation. According to Pierson, “political institutions can serve to coordinate the behavior and expectations of decentralized actors (Carey 2000) and to facilitate bargaining by creating monitoring bodies, issue linkages, and mechanisms for making credible commitments” (2004, 107).         "
"44","Multiplicity of equilibria has important implications in terms of theory, in terms of interpreting and analyzing empirical evidence, and in terms of thinking about possible practical recommendations. Before closing the section, we want to say a word regarding the implications of this analysis for cross‐country econometrics on the effects of formal political rules. The effects of constitutional rules on policymaking and performance might be conditional on the type of equilibrium achieved by each polity. The standard predictions in the literature might apply for countries at the full institutionalization equilibrium, but not necessarily for countries with low institutionalization. Caruso, Scartascini, and Tommasi (2010) explore this issue by clustering countries into those with high and those with low levels of institutionalization.20 Using those clusters, it reproduces within each cluster the empirical exercises of Persson and Tabellini (2003), who study the effects of political constitutions on fiscal outcomes. All of the results in Persson and Tabellini 2003 are replicated for the high‐institutionalization sample, but almost none of the results are significant for the low‐institutionalization sample of countries.         "
"45","One important question is what the implications of equilibrium multiplicity may be for attempting to map the predictions of the model onto empirical evidence. Fortunately, the simple structure of the model enables us to make some comparative static predictions in spite of having multiple equilibria. Under the assumptions of the model, the FIE always exists, while the LIE exists for some parameter values and not for others. This means that for some parameter values the FIE will be the only equilibrium possible (call that set of parameters F), while for other parameter values both types of equilibrium are possible (call that set of parameters B). If the real world were fully described by this model, then we would expect that in polities characterized by a vector of parameters belonging to F we should observe the characteristics associated with the FIE, while in polities characterized by a vector of parameters belonging to B we could observe either of the equilibria. Assigning in the latter case a nonzero probability to each of the equilibria will be sufficient to generate empirical predictions. If conducting comparative statics on any given parameter increases the set of other parameters for which LIE is an equilibrium, then we will say that increasing that parameter increases the possibility of observing the Low Institutionalization Equilibrium (and its associated properties).         "
"46","It turns out that in the model, almost any comparative statics exercise that increases the possibility of LIE also increases the number  of people going to the streets within the LIE (see the Supporting Information), so that the derivative of  with respect to any parameter is a sufficient statistic for the way in which that parameter affects the degree of institutionalization in either interpretation. (The only exception is the threshold T, which also has simple comparative statics). Using that logic, we derive in the Supporting Information the comparative static results summarized in Table 2, which we state as conditions under which noninstitutionalized politics are more likely to be sustained.         "
"47","Not surprisingly, the probability of being in the LIE increases as the use of APTs becomes less costly, as the potential damage APTs can cause increases, and as the wealth of the economy decreases. More interestingly, the probability of being in a Low Institutionalization Equilibrium increases as the distribution of de jure political power becomes more asymmetric. As the vector of pi's becomes more asymmetric, more actors at the lower end will find participation in formal political institutions less appealing, inducing more street action and lower institutionalization. The model predicts that, in general, those less favored by de jure political power are more likely to engage in noninstitutionalized actions,21 and furthermore, that the more asymmetric political power is, the greater the numbers taking the outside option and the lower the institutionalization in equilibrium.         "
"48","We have undertaken some preliminary steps towards the empirical study of some of the correlations predicted by the theory, using international measures of institutional quality which we believe serve as proxies for the strength of policymaking institutions as understood in this article. These measures, taken from Scartascini, Stein, and Tommasi (2009), include proxies for the strength and involvement of the legislature in policymaking, several aspects of party system institutionalization, and bureaucratic capabilities. These proxies for institutional strength have been combined with information on a number of political activities from the Cross‐National Time‐Series Data Archive (Banks 2011), combined under the heading of “Internal Conflict,” which we take as a rough measure of the APTs emphasized in this article. The logic presented above implies that in equilibrium there should be a negative correlation between the strength of political institutions and the use of alternative political technologies. Our measures of institutional strength tend to be negatively correlated with the measures of conflict, with the coefficients being statistically significant in univariate and multivariate regressions with standard controls such as GDP per capita, regional dummies, and level of democracy. Figure 5 shows one of these correlations between internal conflict and a combined measure of institutional strength.         "
"49","                Correlation (Institutional Strength; Use of One Particular Alternative Political Technology)"
"50","The argument presented in this study also has implications for correlations among institutional and conflict variables with some characteristics of policy outcomes: for instance, a positive correlation between weaker institutions, more use of alternative political technologies, and public policies that favor some actors disproportionately. Political institutions that generate more biased policy outcomes are likely to lead to increased use of alternative political technologies, and this induces weaker investments in the institutionalization of policymaking. We have also found a positive correlation between the use of APTs and a measure of biases in government policy compiled by World Economic Forum called favoritism, as well as a negative correlation between favoritism and institutionalization.22"
"51","The objective of this article is to suggest a framework (a modeling strategy) to articulate insights from the rich literature on the effects of political institutions on policy into a broader view of policymaking, and it does so by endowing political actors with a larger action space. Such an effort could prove particularly useful for the study of policymaking in developing democracies, as well as for integrating such analyses across countries of different levels of economic and institutional development."
"52","The model presented in this article has the following implications. First, different countries have different degrees of institutionalization in their policymaking. Second, there is multiplicity of equilibria, allowing similar countries to be stuck at different levels of institutionalization, self‐reinforcing dynamics, and the possibility of equilibrium switches. Third, the likelihood of institutionalized policymaking increases as the cost of alternative political actions increases, as the damage these alternatives can cause decreases, and as the economy becomes wealthier. Fourth, if the distribution of de jure political power is very asymmetric, the use of alternative political technologies and low degrees of institutionalization are likely to be observed.23"
"53","There are various pending tasks in the agenda described in the article, such as enriching various aspects of the model to permit comparative static exercises on economic structure, APTs, and formal political institutions. To begin with, one can give more structure to the economy and more specific characteristics to the actors in the policy game. Costs and potential effects of various forms of collective action are distributed in much more specific manners than the fairly “flat” topography represented by the APT in the model. The various ci's of different actors could be a function of who else is participating in that activity, facilitating collective action across particular sets of agents, such as workers in sectors with high “damage capacity.” More generally, there are various structural, historical, and perceptual factors that affect specific forms of collective action. ci's as well as potential rewards from such activities will be a function not only of who else protests, but also of the history of organization of such movements, and of the beliefs about the legitimacy of the protest by other actors who might matter for the degree of repression.         "
"54","We chose a particularly simple formulation of the institutionalized part of the game, a stark alternative political technology, and a very streamlined logic of interaction between those two arenas. Our assumptions about the proposal stage, the voting stage, and the (potential) damage stage could be fruitfully extended in ways that could lead to richer models that could generate further new takeaway messages. For instance, given our specific formulation of legislative bargaining and of the damage technology, legislators are indifferent with respect to both the outcome of the vote and whether there are riots. That is because we are assuming that protesters can only shrink the pie that the government has to allocate, but not cause damage or attempt to force redistribution of endowments. That is clearly an assumption that makes sense in some contexts and not in others (in the spirit of the comparative statics on economic and social structures we want to promote). In richer models, one could analyze more complex potential interactions with “the street,” which in turn would lead to a broader consideration of possible proposals and voting strategies. For instance, in many cases one would want to make the legislators’ voting strategy depend as well on how much the protesters are being offered."
"55","An interesting extension would consist of a richer set of alternative political technologies, with different socioeconomic actors having differential access to each of the technologies. Various technologies used extensively by the well‐off in some developing countries give them privileged access to policymaking. Trucco (2009) provides a start in that direction, and her results suggest the presence of a strategic complementarity between the uses of bribes and of road blockades. “Bribes by the rich” and “protests by the poor” can be seen as countervailing forces that tend to happen together in polities with weaker political institutions.24"
"56","Other extensions might allow actors to invest in both institutions and alternative technologies and to use the outside threats in their institutionalized negotiations. Additionally including a “third activity” or opportunity cost would allow studying the form of political participation by different actors across countries and relating that to institutionalization."
"57","Natural extensions might come from moving away from our simple legislative‐bargaining formulation and fishing in the abundant pond of formal models of political institutions for richer institutional comparative statics. For instance, what would be the effect of alternative electoral rules (proportional versus majoritarian) on the degree of institutionalization of policymaking? One might hypothesize that PR systems, allowing a better representation of minorities, might lead to more symmetric distributions of de jure political power and hence to more institutionalized behavior.25 What would be the effect of regime type (parliamentary or presidential) on the degree of institutionalization of policymaking? To deal with questions like these, one will need to move in the direction of representative democracy, with models that permit exploring the electoral connection and agency issues.         "
"58","Another line of useful extensions might come from moving to more dynamic specifications. The article couches some of its interpretation in terms of the “dynamics of institutionalization.” This is just a heuristic that captures the extent to which institutionalization is a function of shared expectations. (Almost all static game theoretic equilibria are simplified depictions of processes that indeed take place over time.) Another sense of dynamics would be the question of how a country arrives at (or switches towards) a particular equilibrium. Addressing such transitions is an important pending task. Also, the model has treated constitutional rules as exogenous, a natural first modeling step (Diermeier and Krehbiel 2003). This can be embedded in a richer game in which such rules are chosen at an earlier stage, including our model here as a continuation subgame. Such a modeling strategy would be quite complementary to the Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) logic, providing a bit more structure to their (unmodeled) threat of collective action due to temporary de facto power.26"
"59","There are various possible implications from the results here and from the eventual next steps. To highlight one of them (in light of the results in Caruso et al. 2010), the existence of different levels of institutionalization may imply that some influential research in political economics is not necessarily applicable to every type of country. Studies on the impact of political institutions on policies should incorporate the possibility that political rules might have different effects depending on the arenas in which policies are determined in each polity, as well as the possibility that the arena itself might depend on political rules. This should also raise a flag for those in the business of recommending institutional reforms for dealing with failing policies.         "
