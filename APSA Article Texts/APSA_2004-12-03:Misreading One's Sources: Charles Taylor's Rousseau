"1","Consider Taylor's surprising but illuminating misreading of Rousseau's sentiment of existence. Taylor makes his mistake in describing Rousseau as the first articulator of a new form of inwardness that develops into the modern ideal of authenticity. For Rousseau, according to Taylor, the self we experience when we feel our existence, though more fundamental than any particular moral view, causes us to adhere to the rules of morality. “Our moral salvation comes from recovering authentic moral contact with ourselves,” and this intimate contact with oneself is called “the sentiment of existence.”“Le sentiment de l'existence would make me a perfectly moral creature if I were but in full contact with it,” where morality is understood to coincide more or less with the rules regarding the right treatment of others imposed by most societies (Taylor 1991, 27, 63). For Rousseau, then, self‐definition and morality are held tightly together. But Taylor has conflated the sentiment of existence and conscience. In fact, for Rousseau, the sentiment of existence offers no moral guidance. Solitary, amoral, natural man enjoys “the sentiment of his present existence” (Second Discourse, SD hereafter, I, 21; III, 144).5 Man's “first sentiment was that of his existence” (SD, II, 2; III, 164). The passage Taylor cites from the Reveries nowhere mentions morality and even suggests that a man who indulges himself in the sentiment of existence may develop a distaste for his duties; such indulgence is appropriate only for a man who “can do nothing more in this world to benefit himself or others” (Reveries, 89; I, 1047).6"
"2","From the very beginning, then, of his history of authenticity, Taylor writes out of it a deep conflict between the individual and society and prepares the way for the reconciliation he hopes to effect. If the sentiment of existence is conscience, then it is at least plausible to claim that it depends on society, since conscience is manifestly something that develops and is needed only in society. But if the sentiment of existence is, as Rousseau says it is, a contentment whose source is “nothing external to us, nothing apart from ourselves and our own existence” (Reveries, 89; I, 1047), then it is an obstacle to the argument Taylor wants to make, that we cannot be ourselves if we do not participate in a common life and acknowledge our ties with others.         "
"3","It is especially useful to compare Rousseau to Taylor because he initiates the argument that Taylor carries forward, that what is most recognizably human is social. He criticizes his predecessors who went back to the state of nature for including in it not only vices but also faculties, like reason and language, that develop only in or with society (SD, Exordium, 5, I, 21–32; III, 132, 144–51). Human beings who appear to be atomic individuals in Hobbes and Locke already exist in fact in a social matrix. But Rousseau does not move from this premise to the conclusion that community makes us what we are, or that we cannot be ourselves outside of communities. Instead, in works like the Second Discourse and Reveries, he asserts the opposite. He digs beneath language and reason to a natural man who enjoys a sentiment of existence which, though hardly distinctly human, though prerational and prelinguistic, puts us in contact with our existence—i.e., what we are—and sweetens it. To be sure, Rousseau's understanding of the sentiment of existence is more complex than I have indicated. For example, there is little question that the developments human beings undergo in society, when they do not fatally undermine our capacity to enjoy the sentiment of existence, can enhance it. The uncivilized natural man enjoys the sentiment of his present existence; the civilized Rousseau is enraptured.7 Nonetheless, by conflating the sentiment of existence and conscience, Taylor understates the tension between individual and society.8"
"4","In the later stages of Taylor's history of authenticity, identity must be articulated in struggle with at least some social rules. But identity remains a product of self‐understanding, self‐definition and self‐expression, or reason and art (1991, 33, 65). This feature is built in to Taylor's definition of identity, as in Sources of the Self:         "
"5","                        "
"6","To know who I am is a species of knowing where I stand. My identity is defined by the commitments and identifications which provide the frame or horizon within which I can try to determine from case to case what is good, or valuable, or what is or ought to be done, or what I endorse or oppose. In other words, it is the horizon within which I am capable of taking a stand. (1989a, 27; cf. 1991, 34 and 1985c, 259)"
"7","To see that this definition of identity is not the only obvious one, compare Rousseau's fanciful description of a man who has at his birth the strength and stature of a man."
"8","                        "
"9","He would see nothing, hear nothing, know no one, would not be able to turn his eyes toward what he needed to see. Not only would he perceive no object outside of himself, he would not even relate any object to the sense organ which made him perceive it … . he would have only a single idea, that is of the I to which he would relate all his sensations. (Emile, E hereafter, 61; IV, 281)               "
"10","I bring up this odd passage for two reasons. First, it compels us to take note of the I that precedes our capacity to take any stand. Second, it ends by noting that this idea of the I is the only sentiment the man born full‐grown would have that an ordinary baby would lack (E, 61; IV, 281). That is, the sentiment of the I is connected with the body. If the definition of identity is what Taylor says it is, then Rousseau and he are not far apart, for Rousseau, to repeat, prepares the way for Taylor's claim that reason, language and most of the things that make us “full human agents” are social. But Rousseau, unlike Taylor, places great weight on one element, the body, that, to be sure, does not make us full human agents, but is no small part of “who we are,” to take identity in a nontechnical sense. Taylor's more or less disembodied identity has the effect of drawing the individual and society closer together because it sets aside what we have without community and what emphatically distinguishes our interests and goods from those of the others.9"
"11","It is true that Taylor, in other contexts, draws our attention to our “embodiment.” But he deploys our embodiment only to refute what he takes to be the Cartesian‐Lockean argument that the self or consciousness can be perfectly detached from its circumstances, the body being one circumstance among others, including traditions, habits, and temporality (1991, 105–06; 1989a, 172, 175). Taylor's embodiment works, then, to draw the individual, who may seem disengaged on account of his consciousness, into engagement with his particular circumstances, among which are his social circumstances; it points in a communitarian rather than a liberal direction."
"12","It is not that Taylor denies that the separateness of our bodies is likely to make us care more about ourselves than about others. Consider his amusing description of the way in which the sense of personhood, however much it may vary across times and cultures, is in at least one way the same all over:"
"13","                        "
"14","In those days, when a paleolithic hunting group was closing in on a mammoth, when the … beast was lunging toward hunter A, something similar to the thought “Now I'm for it” crossed A's mind. And when at the last moment, the terrifying animal lurched to the left and crushed B instead, a sense of relief mingled with grief for poor B was what A experienced. In other words, the members of the group must have had very much the same sense that we would in their place: here is one person, and there is another, and which one survives/flourishes depends on which person/body is run over by that mammoth."
"15","But Taylor makes nothing of this admission of the way in which our having bodies limits rather than expands our attachments to the community, or of its moral and political ramifications, choosing to concern himself almost entirely with what he calls the “moral and spiritual dimension” of personhood (1989a, 112–13)."
"16","To draw attention to the connection of identity to the body is, of course, not to deny Taylor's claim that we “become full human agents” only with the aid of a language we learn from others and learn to use for our own purposes in exchange with others. But as we take seriously Taylor's proposition that a “human being alone is an impossibility,” a proposition directed not only against extreme partisans of authenticity or even Rawlsian liberals but against the liberal tradition from Locke on, we should also bear in mind that the extent to which we do find ourselves alone is humanly and politically important. Taylor's very definition of identity lulls us into forgetfulness on this score and, incidentally, loads the dice in favor of his argument for strong commitment to community (1991, 33; 1985, 8)."
"17","Taylor observes that concern about authenticity and identity, on the one hand, and social recognition on the other, arose around the same time. But his understanding of the causes of this concern is not only debatable but also silently elevates the importance of community. According to Taylor, recognition and identity emerge as problems in modernity largely when social ranks and categories become questionable. I must quote Taylor's explanation at some length."
"18","                        "
"19","The point is not that dependence on others arose with the age of authenticity … . The socially derived identity was by its very nature dependent on society. But in the earlier age, recognition never arose as a problem. General recognition was built into the fact that it was based on social categories that everyone took for granted. Yet inwardly derived, personal, original identity doesn't enjoy this recognition a priori. It has to win it through exchange, and the attempt can fail … . In premodern times, people didn't speak of “identity” and “recognition”—not because people didn't have (what we call) identities, or because these didn't depend on recognition, but rather because these were then too unproblematic to be thematized as such. (1994, 34–35, my emphasis)               "
"20","I do not think that Taylor can be right about this. The claim Thrasymachus makes early in Plato's Republic, that justice is the advantage of the stronger is also, of course, a claim that conventional justice fails to recognize who is fit to rule. Conventional justice keeps the naturally best men down and fails to accord them due recognition, or honor. The problem of identity and recognition is here “thematized” as that of nature and convention. What we call failures of recognition are captured in countless stories in which the king, or the servant of God, or the true heir, or the best wife, goes unnoticed or is taken for someone else.10"
"21","Failures of recognition, cases of “mistaken identity” are certainly exacerbated by what Tocqueville (1969) called equality of conditions, which dissolves distinctions in rank and the more or less fixed understanding of one's place, possibilities, and deserts that went along with each rank (54, 452–53, 626). The democratic revolution Tocqueville described does, indeed, render social ranks and categories negligible. It universalizes ambition, makes people more sensitive to and anxious about inequalities, and dethrones every authority, aside from the whimsical and ever‐changing majority, to which one might once have appealed to determine one's identity and worth (629, 538, 429–30, 435–36). The problem of being properly recognized has certainly been democratized, then, but it was just as certainly recognizable to thoughtful premoderns who were perfectly capable of noticing a difference between the natural or divine order, which entailed one order of rank or distribution of honors, and the conventional order, which entailed quite another If the terms in which we speak about these problems have changed, it is surely, in large part, because many of us can no longer appeal with confidence to any authority above society, be it nature, or God's judgment, to define ourselves.11 Community is the only arbiter left standing in disputes over recognition.         "
"22","The problem is, again, well illustrated by a comparison. When he writes Emile, Rousseau understands that the ancien regime is deteriorating; he writes of the “unsettled and restless spirit of this age” and predicts that Europe “is approaching a state of crisis and the age of revolutions” (E, 42, 194; IV, 252, 468). The distinction between noble and commoner, which may once have provided a settled “script” for a young man's education, will not serve Emile. In other words, Rousseau understands that recognition and the establishment of identity can fail. For Rousseau, however, this failure of conventional scripts is a welcome opportunity to investigate what education best suits his fictional pupil's nature. Emile tells the story of a natural education, one that suits both what Emile has in common with other human beings and his particular talents and dispositions. Rousseau's response to the breakdown of those conventions that established identity is not to raise the question of how whatever new identities spring up, from whatever source, will get recognized but instead to raise the question of what identities best suit our natures. Taylor does not consider Rousseau's move a possible one in our time, and this reflects his implicit admission that there is no court of appeal beyond community.         "
"23","Now, in a way, the difference between Taylor and Rousseau on this point is one of emphasis. That is, Rousseau would be the last to deny that social recognition is important and that “identity can be formed or malformed through our contact with significant others; ” it is for this reason that Emile is for a long time shielded from social opinion and confined to a single significant other, his governor. And Rousseau, as Taylor points out, is attentive to the problem of honor in his own politics. But Rousseau, as Taylor also mentions “often sounds like the Stoics” (1994, 36, 46–51). He seems to encourage his readers to disdain social honor and instead to use their own powers of observation and discrimination, aided, to be sure, by Rousseau's own reflections, to make their own judgments about the nature of things and to distinguish between social opinions that are worthy of respect and social opinions that are not. Because Taylor dismisses this alternative, the difference between him and Rousseau proves, after all, more than one of emphasis. For Emile is an impressive human type, of whom Taylor can make little sense, one who gives “nothing to opinion,”“nothing to authority,”“who values nothing according to the price set by opinion” and cares “little about being esteemed” by others (E, 207, 338; IV, 486, 669). He will care about the opinions of some others, but         "
"24","                        "
"25","he will not precisely say to himself, “I rejoice because they approve of me,” but rather, “I rejoice because they approve of what I have done that is good. I rejoice that the people who honor me are doing themselves honor. So long as they judge so soundly, it will be a fine thing to obtain their esteem. (E, 339; IV, 671)               "
"26","Taylor emphasizes, in contrast, how the making of one's identity remains dependent on others throughout our whole lives, absent a “heroic effort to break out of ordinary existence” and that preventing our identity from being formed by the people we love “would take a great deal of effort, and probably many wrenching break‐ups” (1991, 34–35). Taylor is so alive to the extent to which the denial of recognition “can inflict damage on those who are denied it,” so emphatic about the dependence of individual identity on others, that he rejects as unrealistic the independence Rousseau grants to middling, though well‐educated, souls (1994, 36).12"
"27","Moreover, for all of Taylor's concern about the absence of recognition or misrecognition, either of which can “imprison someone in a false, distorted, and reduced mode of being,” it is hard to see how he can distinguish between true and false recognition (1994, 25). For Taylor, it would seem as if the standard is “my own original way of being”; this standard, which Taylor derives from Herder, is after all what distinguishes authentic from inauthentic being (1991, 47). Yet for Herder, our original way of being is an expression of “the impulse in us of nature;” further, Herder “held views about the natural order as harmonious and providentially created.” Now Herder's understanding is not ours. Taylor observes in a somewhat different context that even as we have maintained certain Romantic aspirations, the understanding of nature behind those aspirations has no currency."
"28","                        "
"29","The idea of nature as a source refers to a God or cosmic spirit in the world, but the demand remains very much alive that we be open or in tune with nature in ourselves. …  The loss of belief in a spirit of nature has, of course, been the occasion of crisis and doubt, but the understanding of nature as a source still survives, although what underlies it is very uncertain and problematic. (Taylor 1989a, 370, 384)               "
"30","Here is the problem. For Herder, nature is a standard that allows us in principle, if not from the outside, to distinguish between distorted and undistorted identities. For Taylor, nature is just one of a number of “horizons of significance,” like solidarity, or history, or society, or God, in terms of which I define my identity (1991, 40). Taylor is left without a standard by which to distinguish cases in which social horizons distort my identity and cases in which they leave it undistorted, or even support it."
"31","A similar problem emerges when we consider another illuminating error Taylor commits about Rousseau. According to Taylor, Rousseau criticized hierarchical honor and dreamed of a society in which all “would share equally in the light of public attention; ” Rousseau understood that when we begun to desire preferential esteem, society took a turn for the worse (1991, 48–49).13 Taylor implies that Rousseau sees the unequal granting of esteem as in itself a problem to be resolved. But Rousseau understood the problem of unequal recognition somewhat differently. Consider the passage that immediately follows the one Taylor cites to demonstrate Rousseau's worries about preferential esteem. In that passage, trouble arises when everyone claims a right to esteem.         "
"32","                        "
"33","As soon as men began to appreciate one another and the idea of regard had taken shape in their mind, everyone claimed a right to it, and one could not longer fail to show it to anyone. (SD, II, 17; III, 170)               "
"34","The problem is not that society oppresses or distorts when it judges that one person sings, dances, or looks better than another. Rather, it is that human beings, who desire preferential esteem will demand to be recognized, not for what they are, but for what they are not, or that they will wish to have an identity that is not in conformity to their natures14—i.e., they will wish to have a distorted, if not oppressive, identity. That is surely what it means, at least for Rousseau, to claim a right to esteem.         "
"35","Rousseau, in a way, anticipates a political trend that Taylor criticizes. For both argue that the demand for unconditional equal esteem is unfounded. Taylor, writing of the recognition of difference, claims that the fact that people choose to be different or find themselves in different races, sexes, cultures does not in itself mean that they are all entitled to esteem. “Mere difference itself can't be the ground of equal value” (1991, 51). But the basis of Taylor's objection is quite different from Rousseau's. Human beings on Rousseau's account, can be observed to have “a prodigious diversity of minds” by nature and to bring into the world with them “a particular temperament” and particular capacities which determine “genius and character” for each (Julie, 461–63; II, 562–65). For Rousseau, a man with no artistic ability who wishes to be and be recognized as a great artist closes his eyes to nature. For Taylor, a person who is “different,” good or bad, and demands unquestioned esteem, closes his eyes to the very communal standards in terms of which even he defines his identity:         "
"36","                        "
"37","To come together on a mutual recognition of difference—that is, of the equal value of different identities—requires that we share … some standards of value on which the identities concerned check out as equal. There must be some substantive agreement on value, or else the formal principle of equality will be empty and a sham. … Recognizing difference, like self‐choosing, requires a horizon of significance, in this case a shared one. (1991, 52)"
"38","Taylor's argument is laudable, for it requires that we not only promise to esteem those who are different from us but actually open ourselves to the possibility of having our “horizons” expanded. Nonetheless, there is something strange about appealing to a “shared horizon of significance,” which is not obviously more likely to provide the context in which people recognize us for what we are than any other horizon or to determine when an unwarranted claim to recognition is being made.15"
"39","Now, it is true that, inasmuch as Taylor claims only that selves are “partly” constituted by self‐interpretations, there may be a basis for distinguishing between recognition and misrecognition in that part of the self that is not constituted by self‐interpretation (1989a, 34). Abbey has argued that for Taylor, of course, “just thinking about myself in a particular way does not necessarily or automatically make me that: I can have a deluded or exaggerated intepretation of my own prowess or of my intellectual acumen, for example” (2000, 59). Taylor, then, like Rousseau, should be entitled to the appeal to nature. However, here Taylor's admission parallels his admission that we inhabit separate bodies; it may be made in passing but it plays no role in his argument. One reason it may play no role in his argument is that Taylor has not decided how far his “partly” goes. As Olafson has argued:"
"40","                        "
"41","Taylor never successfully explains just what this “partly” takes in and what it does not. It seems to me that this is because he is really quite uncertain about how radically historical he is prepared to make this self that supposedly constitutes itself by its interpretations of itself."
"42","For this reason, among others, it is “not at all easy to say what general concept of human being really serves as the cornerstone of Taylor's thinking” (1994, 192–93). Taylor (1994b), while he scores any number of points against Olafson in his response, concedes that he has not said enough about the “huge question” of “how radically historical [we should] be in understanding the different constructions of human identity in different cultures,” and insofar as he appeals to a transhistorical standard he appeals only to the idea that a an “agent” inescapably finds herself in a “space of moral issues” (207–08). This claim, while important for establishing that natural science is insufficient for the study of human things, is not the kind of claim that will help us distinguish between recognition and misrecognition in most cases. To make such a distinction Taylor appears to have no recourse other than the community.         "
"43","The difference between Taylor and Rousseau may be put in another way. For Rousseau, the question of whether or not my identity is distorting may be formulated like this: does my identity accurately reflect my nature? For Taylor, the question of whether or not my identity is distorting must be framed as follows: is my identity in accordance with the horizons of significance I share with my community? The trouble is not necessarily that the latter question admits only of a politically or culturally conservative answer, for it may be that a community's failure of recognition is based on a misunderstanding of its own values, or their consequences, or their range of possible interpretations. The trouble is instead that Taylor's approach appears to minimize, at the very least, the potential for distortion. For there is no reason to believe that a self‐image in accord with shared horizons is more accurate, even if it is more gratifying, than one that fails for the most part to be in accord with shared horizons. Members of a society or culture may come to value women because they think women conciliators and because their shared self‐understanding demands that they value conciliators. But none of this is to say that the image of women in question does not distort and limit them; one could draw that conclusion from the premises only if there is no “text” of women at all to which to compare an interpretation, however widely shared. But if that were so, and Taylor does not seem to wish to say that it is, it would be hard to make sense at all of the idea of “misrecognition.”"
"44","The account I have given of Taylor's thought is, of course oversimplified, since Taylor is eager to get beyond the notion that our understanding of the good is merely either an individual or communal creation. Although he insists that human beings are incapable of an interpretation‐free understanding of the good, he also opposes himself to projectivism, according to which understandings of the good are simply matters of human beings imposing meaning on a meaningless world. Taylor 1994b seeks an alternative that acknowledges both that human world is shaped “by one's form of life, or history, or bodily existence” and that human beings cannot avoid supposing that their moral lives are anchored in “the features of some reality—it can be God, or the universe, or human nature—which make sense of the goodness of the goals and norms we adopt, and the better understanding of which may inspire us to encompass these goals, or fulfill these norms, more fully and heartily” (1994b, 211–12). Taylor offers as one model of such an alternative the “interweaving of the subjective and transcendent” practiced by modernist poets, from whom a “metaphysics or theology” comes “indexed to a personal vision, or refracted through a particular sensibility.” What such poets express may be inseparable from their work—“we cannot just detach the nugget of transcendent truth”—but far from being purely subjective, it reflects a demand that “emanates from the world” (1989a, 491–93, 513). Taylor is consequently some kind of moral realist for whom a demand issues from a source that transcends the individual and the community.         "
"45","However, Taylor's appeal to a standard beyond individuals and communities is too uncertain and vague to function as a genuine check on the power of community. That it is too uncertain is demonstrated by Taylor's own language. We have already noted one instance, in which he concedes that whatever might replace the discredited Herderian understanding of nature is “very uncertain and problematic.” Here is another: in responding to Rorty's suggestion that he embrace a more thoroughgoing antifoundationalism than he does, Taylor does little more than gesture at his own commitments to theism and “deep ecology,” adding that “I am now far out on a limb and cannot hope to do justice to the penetrating questions which Richard Rorty has raised” (Rorty 1994, 200–01; Taylor 1994b, 213). Yet doing justice to the questions Richard Rorty has raised is the only way of preventing a slide into the view that “the social creative imagination” anchors our moral judgments (Rorty 1994, 199).         "
"46","As Rorty points out, Taylor, in a remarkable passage, describes Sources of the Self as in the ephiphanic tradition:         "
"47","                        "
"48","The only way we can explore the order in which we are set with an aim to defining moral sources is through this part of personal resonance. … This work … falls into the same category. I have throughout sought language to clarify the issues and I have found this in images of profound personal resonance. … They could, I believe, be the animating ideas of an epiphanic work. … The great epiphanic work actually can put us in contact with the sources it taps. It can realize the contact. The philosopher or critic tinkers around and shapes images through which he or another might one day do so. The artist is like a race‐car driver, and we are the mechanics in the pit; except in this case, the mechanics. … have a hazy grasp of the wiring, much less than the drivers have. … [W]e delude ourselves if we think that philosophical or critical language for these matters is somehow more hard‐edged or more free from personal index than that of poets and novelists. (1989a, 512)               "
"49","Elsewhere, Taylor describes as just “my hunch” his claim that our best self‐interpretation cannot be “purely immanent‐human” but requires a nature, cosmos, or God. When we seek to explain what it means for a demand to emanate from the world “it is hard to be clear … because we are deep into a language of personal resonance” (1989a, 342, 513). It may be for this reason that Taylor doesn't even attempt to argue that questions of recognition and misrecognition can be settled by appealing beyond the community."
"50","For Taylor, the ultimate source of appeal on the question of whether one's identity has been distorted or not is unavoidably the community itself. To argue that Rousseau endorses homogeneous and coercive communities is plausible enough, though debatable, but it is also important to point out that Taylor is in danger of endorsing, however unintentionally, virtually unlimited claims of the community on the individual. For Rousseau, there are always “private persons … whose life and freedom are naturally independent” of the public person” (Social Contract, SC hereafter, 61; III, 373). There is a sentiment of existence that is impervious, or almost impervious, to the claims of the community. One might add, drawing on Emile, that there is a natural “génie,” a “germ of … character”; “each mind has its own form” (E, 94, IV, 324; cf. 192, IV, 465; 201, IV, 478) which an education can develop or suppress.16 In Rousseau, then, there are points of resistance to society's claims that are unavailable for Taylor. To be sure, Taylor himself points this problem out when he admits that the idea of authenticity is related to an understanding of nature that is no longer ours. But he does not point out the extent to which the problem undermines his own hopes that the power of the community he wishes to release can be contained. My point, here, is not to endorse Rousseau's understanding of nature and condemn Taylor's but to expose a problem that Taylor does not face squarely; either his argument is parasitic on an understanding of nature he rejects, or it leaves community unrestrained.         "
"51","It is true that the practical threat that modern communities pose is mitigated by the disagreements that typically characterize them. Even if shared horizons are the last appeal in questions of recognition and misrecognition, the citizen of a modern liberal democracy, at least, has a variety of such shared horizons from which to choose. Indeed, modernity is characterized by the availability of a plurality of what Taylor calls moral sources, the ideas about the good that underlie our other moral judgments, and by the absence of “publicly available orders of meaning” (1991, 84; 1989a, 312–13, 512). In this sense, the specter of an unrestrained community seeking to form all of its citizens in the same way is not the specter most to be feared in this moment in the history of the West. But first, this pluralism, as Taylor acknowledges, is both historically contingent and fragile. It is historically contingent because, in Taylor's view, it may be possible to reconcile values that today seem irreconcilable. It is fragile because, among other reasons, pluralism is not easy to live with, and we can expect to be tempted by specious solutions, which “can wreak terrible destruction, as the sad story of Bolshevism shows beyond question” (1994a, 214). The end of history notwithstanding, it seems too early to let down one's guard about the homogenizing and coercive possibilities of modern communities."
"52","Second, however plural modern moral sources may be, modern societies are nonetheless characterized by “general agreement” about many of the specifics of morality, especially about “the demands of universal justice and beneficence,”“the claims of equality,”“the demands to freedom and self‐rule as axiomatically justified,” and the priority of avoiding death and suffering (Taylor 1989a, 495).17 I do not mean to argue that this general agreement is oppressive, though Tocqueville has argued that unobjectionable beliefs about equality, which on their surface seem to support individualism, can lead to a kind of tyranny (1969, 26–61, 429–36). I mean to argue only that we ought not to confuse pluralism with respect to the frameworks within which we make moral judgments, say that there are Christian and non‐Christian defenses of equality, and pluralism with respect to the more specific moral positions we feel compelled to defend. The pervasiveness and uniformity of these positions cannot fail to have some impact on what identities are possible for us. Communities, even when they are not directly coercive, suffocate, and Taylor's understanding of community tends to make them more suffocating.         "
"53","I now turn directly to Taylor's defense of community, which has been in the background of the preceding sections. That defense consists above all in the claim that without community, we have no identity. There “is no such thing as inward generation, monologically understood … . My own identity crucially depends on my dialogical relations with others” (Taylor 1991, 47–48). Our identities are generated and maintained not alone but through interaction and exchange with others. Taylor's argument is not merely that we need the resources of society to generate our own identities, as we need them to protect our life, liberty, and property, but that it is senseless to try to abstract individuals from their social circumstances.         "
"54","                        "
"55","A human being alone is an impossibility, not just de facto, but as it were de jure. Outside of the continuing conversation of a community … human agency … would be not just impossible but inconceivable. (1985, 8)"
"56","The self is constituted, not merely assisted, by community.18 Taylor grants that, for various reasons, “more needs to be filled in,” but         "
"57","                        "
"58","we can already see how the argument might go: how developing and nursing the commonalities of value between us become important, and one of the crucial ways we do this is sharing a participatory political life. (1991, 42)"
"59","That is to say, although Taylor's initial argument merely proposes that the self is constituted by community, without arguing that the political community, in particular, is crucial, Taylor plainly thinks his argument can be expanded to justify a certain kind of politics. He leaves open the precise political consequences of his argument, but there is no question that it is meant at least to supplement both Lockean and Rawlsian or procedural liberalism by putting greater weight on obligation, a sense of belonging, cultural survival, and collective ends.19 Broadly speaking, Taylor's argument about community and identity is designed to get individualists to combat a regrettable self‐centeredness connected to authenticity in particular and individualism in general and to compel even the individualist to admit the “demands of our ties with others” (1991, 4, 35).         "
"60","In noting that Taylor's argument has certain distinct political consequences, I do not mean to deny the distinction Taylor makes between the ontological issues in the debate between liberals and communitarians and the advocacy issues that arise in connection with that debate (1989b, 159–60). That is to say, I will not claim that there is an inevitable slide from the claim that identities are constructed in social matrices and the abandonment of liberalism in favor of collectivism.20 Far from it: I will be arguing that the moral and political conclusions Taylor does draw from his ontological argument are unwarranted.         "
"61","Taylor, then, finds our obligation to community above all in what it does to shape our identities or make us what we are. Rousseau may be credited with one of the most powerful formulations of this claim:"
"62","                        "
"63","This transition from the state of nature to the civil state produces a most remarkable change in man by substituting justice for instinct in his conduct and endowing his actions with the morality they previously lacked. … [O]ut of a stupid and bounded animal [it] made an intelligent being and a man. (SC, 53; III, 364–65)               "
"64","Natural man is devoid of self‐consciousness, let alone the capacity for self‐interpretation. Only the act of association that forms the civil state forces men to step outside of and impose order on himself. It is in this sense that “each Citizen is nothing … except with all the others” (SC, 68; III, 382).21 Rousseau, then, seems to agree, first, that community is the crucial precondition of identity and, second, that it is in large measure for this reason that we should be willing to cede our natural freedom, or to meet our obligations to society.         "
"65","However, this description of human beings entering into society is inaccurate. We know from the Second Discourse that such human beings are not animals governed by instinct but dependent and moral beings who prefer each other's company to peace. Political society cannot be credited for the formation of our intelligence or capacity for morality. True, as we will see when we turn to Emile, it may be possible to credit political community for the invention of law and of the notion of submitting to it, and thereby to credit it, even in its least attractive forms, for offering a model of virtue. While morality and even duty arise before political society does, one could argue, the idea of virtue could not arise as long as “the terror of vengeance had to take the place of the Laws' restraint” and submission to duty could not be distinguished from submission to the arbitrary will of another (SD, II, 17–18; III, 170) But we will also see how limited the obligations are, if any, that flow from this benefit political communities, usually in spite of themselves, offer.         "
"66","In any case, it is not so much the formation of identity as the formation of a particular kind of identity, that of the citizen, that justifies society in the passage in question, in which we are not merely turned into beings capable of nobility and ignobility but actually ennobled. The citizen is the man who acts justly or morally, who orders his appetites and faculties so that he acts in accordance with the general will of the community as expressed in its laws. To have an identity is to have a self‐interpretation. To be a citizen is to interpret oneself as a member of the polity. “A citizen of Rome was neither a Caius or Lucius; he was a Roman” (E, 40; IV, 249). This striking formulation goes to show that Rousseau argues in favor of obligation to the community not on the grounds that it confers an identity on us, for to be a Caius or Lucius is to have an identity, but on the grounds that entering into a certain kind of community makes us into moral beings. By moral beings, Rousseau means not beings capable of acting morally, or of thinking in moral terms, but beings who actually do act morally, men of virtue, citizens.22"
"67","In making this argument I do not mean to go back on my earlier claim that Rousseau's politics has a place for private persons who remain independent of the public person."
"68","Evidently, the sense in which a human being becomes nothing without the others in political society, or in which Caius and Lucius dissolve into Rome, does not do away with such private persons. Indeed, even, the Romans—especially the Romans—“distinguished themselves above all peoples on earth by the government's regard for private individuals” (Political Economy 18; III, 257). Rousseau's justification of the polity is multilayered, so that it is not just by educating men to be virtuous citizens but also by protecting them as private individuals that political life imposes obligations on them.         "
"69","One could and should mention a third layer. Melzer has argued that Rousseau's politics, like every aspect of his thought, is driven by the ends of “unity and happiness” (1990, 115). I suspect Melzer is right that “Rousseau still adheres to the traditional view that the good is prior to the right, or that the value (and content) of justice must ultimately be judged before the bar of happiness,” or, I would add, perfection (61–63). That the principles of political right are formulated in terms of freedom and consent rather than happiness does not mean that considerations of happiness are not at their foundation, not to speak of the foundation of the legislator's actions, which precede consent to the principles of political right. As Melzer observes, the principles of political right seem to abstract from virtually every important aspect of Rousseau's thought, from the doctrine of the natural goodness of man to his understanding of how human beings come to be corrupted, but it hardly seems likely that his political doctrine could really be unconnected to the core of his thought as a whole. Certainly, in his draft of the Social Contract, Rousseau does not hesitate to concede that “the independent man” will not be convinced to join civil society willingly unless he can be shown “the endearing harmony of justice and happiness” (Geneva Manuscript, 156, 159; III, 285, 288).23 In any case, one does not need to revisit the old question of whether Rousseau is a Kantian or a eudaemonist to see that neither understanding suggests that Rousseau justifies society in terms of identity.         "
"70","It almost goes without saying that, for Rousseau, who sets the bar for political legitimacy notoriously high, very few communities can be justified in this way. As the sad history narrated in the Second Discourse shows in detail, the abuses of the new human condition almost invariably degrade man beneath the condition he left. Few, if any polities fail to be, in effect, the rule of the few over an exploited and unfree many. For that reason, the “two words, fatherland and citizen should be effaced from modern languages” (E, 40; IV, 250). We may provisionally formulate at least one serious difference between Rousseau and Taylor as follows: whereas the latter justifies community in terms of identity, Rousseau justifies it in terms of moral identity or citizenship; and whereas Taylor's defense is therefore potentially quite broad with respect to the range of communities it could justify, Rousseau's seems quite narrow. But this provisional formulation is too simplistic. I now turn to some of the objections that can quite plausibly be raised to it.         "
"71","Here is a first objection. Taylor well understands his differences with Rousseau and celebrates them. As I noted at the outset, Taylor actively resists what he regards as the dangerous tendencies of Rousseau's political thought, which follow directly from Rousseau's too narrow conception of identity. Rousseau's model of the polity is characterized by “the absence of differentiated roles … and a very tight common purpose,” which “has been the formula for the most terrible forms of homogenizing tyranny” (1994, 51). Simply put, Taylor thinks that we are obliged to community for forming our identities but that a community is at fault when it discourages its citizens from forming differentiated identities. So it is true that Rousseau justifies fewer communities than Taylor does, but Rousseau justifies only bad communities while excluding many good ones."
"72","But if Rousseau's understanding of obligation to community is too exclusionary, it may point out one sense in which Taylor has too inclusive an understanding of such obligation. For if the community earns a citizen's loyalty by providing him with an identity rather than moral citizenship, with moral depth rather than morality, it is difficult to see how one avoids obligations to very bad communities.24 The assertion “I now know that I am a Karamazov” may point to a much thicker identity than liberalism offers. But it is hard to see why such an assertion should make one grateful or obliged to the communities in question. Similarly, the experience of being persecuted may provide one with a strong sense of identity that one would otherwise lack. Taylor recognizes defining oneself in opposition to a community as one way of forging an identity (1991, 33). But of course, the one persecuted may not even be a member of the community, let alone required to regard himself as indebted to it. To understand our obligation to community in terms of identity renders the legitimacy or goodness of polities a secondary consideration, at best, in determining whether or not we should regard ourselves as members in them.         "
"73","To put it another way, our dependence on a community establishes neither our membership in it nor our obligation to it (Holmes 1989, 232–33; Wrong 2000, 25). If the test for our obligation to a community is whether we need it to establish our identity, there is virtually no community that could fail to meet the test, since even very corrupt or oppressive communities are matrices in which language and reason are “available” to form character of one kind or another. Taylor does not distinguish adequately between legitimate communities and communities that are merely necessary or inescapable. This inadequacy is especially dangerous if one wishes to argue, as Taylor does, for even stronger attachments to community than Rawlsian or Lockean liberalism seem to foster.         "
"74","To be fair, Taylor does not, of course, think that the provision for just any identity generates obligations to communities. As we have already observed, the demand for “recognition,” for Taylor, takes off from the idea that “the projecting of an inferior or demeaning image on another can actually distort or oppress, to the extent that it is interiorized.” But this argument does more than soften the consequences of justifying community in terms of identity; it undermines the justification. Consider again, how one is supposed to distinguish between distorted and oppressive images and accurate and liberating ones, the Herderian idea that “there is a certain way of being human that is my way. I am called upon to live my life in this way, and not in imitation of anyone else's” (Taylor 1991, 28–29). A distorted image is one that does not reflect one's original way of being human. But this argument poses an obvious challenge to the assertion that community constitutes of the self, for if the community provides the space in and materials with which we pursue our original way of being, there is a sense in which our orientation or perfection is determined in spite of the community and may ultimately demand that we abandon it. Although part of the purpose of Taylor's Ethics of Authenticity is to demonstrate that authenticity and community are compatible, his argument does not warrant very strong ties to the community at all. Thus in response to the example of the hermit or the solitary artist, who appears to have overcome his initial dependence on community and to have established an identity quite apart from it, Taylor argues that each type aspires         "
"75","                        "
"76","to a certain kind of dialogicity. In the case of the hermit, the interlocutor is God. In the case of the solitary artist, the work is addressed to a future audience, perhaps still to be created by the work itself. (1991, 35; cf. 1989a, 37)"
"77","While this argument may silence a solipsist, it certainly fails to justify thicker or stronger ties to community than the atomism Taylor opposes. Taylor's argument for community then, proves either too much, because it justifies bonds to almost any community, or too little, because the bonds it justifies are extremely weak (and may not even be to any existing community)."
"78","Here is a second objection. In Emile, Rousseau's book about the education of a natural man fit to live in society, Rousseau himself seems to justify allegiance to a much wider range of polities than the demanding criteria of the Social Contract would seem to allow. After Emile has completed his political education, he decides that he does not want or need to attach himself to any political community, for such attachment, especially in a Europe devoid of legitimate polities, would decrease his freedom. But his governor convinces him otherwise. And among the arguments he uses is this:         "
"79","                        "
"80","O Emile, where is the good man who owes nothing to his country?Whatever country it is, he owes what is most precious to man—the morality of his actions and his love of virtue. … The public good, which serves others only as a pretext, is a real motive for him alone. He learns to. … sacrifice his interest to the common interest. (E, 473; IV, 858; my emphasis)               "
"81","While this argument is about moral being rather than identity simply it is much less restrictive than the argument of the Social Contract and much closer to Taylor's. Emile's governor seems to argue as follows. All polities have some semblance of law and justice. And even the pretense of justice points one toward real justice; the tyrant's false claim that he does what he does not for himself but for the common good points one toward the idea of genuine virtue, or sacrifice for the common good. The fraudulent proposal the rich make in the Second Discourse more or less captures the formal conditions of the legitimate social contract, even if the plan is to undermine that contract (SD, II, 31; III, 177). Therefore, the good man, who discerns true justice behind its semblance, is, however indirectly, indebted to the polity for what he is. So Rousseau has no real advantage over contemporary defenders of community; his defense justifies bad regimes, too.         "
"82","However, Rousseau's argument for duty even to bad political communities is very qualified. Emile is an outsider in his political community. He does not share his community's values. He despises his age‐mates in Paris who, corrupted by the scandalous morals of the age, are incapable of noble feelings. Emile could crush them like insects and become their master, but “he would despise these young men too much to deign to enslave them” (E, 335; IV, 665). As for his countrymen more generally, Emile does not share their opinions either. He hides his contempt for them only because “he pities them.”“Unable to give them the taste for things that are really good, he leaves them with the things that are good according to popular opinion.” To the others, Emile seems not a countryman but a “likeable foreigner” (E, 336, 339; IV, 666, 670). Even if Emile is obliged to the community, he is a member of it in only a very qualified sense. If his moral being is indirectly owed to France, being French has very little to do with his self‐understanding. It may be true, as the governor tries to persuade him, that Emile owes what he is to his country, but his identity is not distinctly French. The case of Emile, then, illuminates the distinction between owing one's identity to a community and identifyingwith a community; Emile's duty to France has nothing to do with being in any strong sense a member of the French community. Taylor does not take this difference seriously enough, for he does not observe that his argument in favor of obligation to community is perfectly consistent with the individual's estrangement from the community, or with weaker social bonds than one might expect in a Lockean or Rawlsian liberal society.         "
"83","However, the evidence cited so far concerns only Emile's visit to Paris. What about the provinces, where Emile makes his home? There, far from urban corruption, perhaps he really is a member of the community. Yet Emile is an outsider in the provinces, too. He cannot possibly share the tastes of the provincials because his taste has been cultivated in Paris. Indeed, Rousseau argues that good taste cannot be cultivated in the provinces because one learns about taste only in places where it is already corrupted."
"84","                        "
"85","Taste is corrupted by an excessive delicacy which creates a sensitivity to things that the bulk of men do not perceive. This delicacy leads to a spirit of discussion. … In the disputes about preference, philosophy and enlightenment are extended, and it is in this way that one learns to think. (E, 342; IV, 674)               "
"86","Provincials, unless they visit Paris, are insensitive in matters of taste. To be sure, Emile begins with only the taste that concerns trivial things, “things which are neutral or which are at most of interest as entertainment” But Rousseau soon reveals that there is a related “taste … in moral things as well.”“By means of taste, the mind is imperceptibly opened up to ideas of the beautiful of every sort and finally to the moral notions related to them (E, 340, 375; IV, 671, 718). What Emile does not share with the provincials, then, is of the highest importance. He is not one of them. We may tentatively characterize the difference this way: whereas provincials are not corrupted and consequently act less immorally than Parisians, Emile has a self‐conscious taste for morality; whereas the provincials are, on the whole, not immoral, Emile has “moral values.” If a community lives within certain horizons, Emile looks at the community within which he resides from outside of its horizons, and in this sense he is more a stranger than a member.         "
"87","All this presents a problem for Taylor, who appears to want members of a community to have a sense of belonging that Emile lacks even though he recognizes that he owes his identity to his country. Nonetheless, there remains the matter of obligation, where Emile seems to prove the case for Taylor. Does the governor, after all, not convince Emile that he must serve the community because he is constituted by it, even if not in the same way as the other members are? Even here, it is important to notice some qualifications. First, the governor makes Emile's service rather easy by telling him that his primary task is to lead a patriarchal and rustic life, a life, that is, that he would have led anyway. He will benefit his neighbors, but doing so in no way cuts against the grain of his compassion for humanity, which only incidentally knows any communal bounds. Second, although the governor does insist that Emile is obliged to leave his rustic life if the country calls him to serve, he also softens the blow by observing that such a call will probably never come: “you need have little fear of being burdened with such a responsibility. As long as there are men who belong to the present age, you are not the man who will be sought out to serve the state.” In the highly unlikely event that Emile is called upon, the governor advises him to fulfill his duty “with enough integrity so that it will not be left to [him] for long” (E, 474–75; IV, 860). Emile's duty to his political community is so qualified that certain questions are avoided. What if Emile is asked to serve in an unjust war? Does serving with integrity mean being true to humanity or true to his country? Does service to his country mean service to the principles to which its bad laws point or obedience to the bad laws themselves? Finally, while Emile may or may not be a good citizen when called, there is never any question of his volunteering his services, except in the neighborhood. Thus, while Rousseau does make an argument for obligation to political communities on the grounds that they confer (moral) identity, this obligation does not go very far at all, certainly not so far as contemporary defenders of community might hope, given that Emile recognizes precisely what Taylor wants citizens to recognize.25"
"88","One should note, too, that the governor's argument is not necessarily Rousseau's. Emile, after a long and careful education concludes initially that he should not be a member of any political community. He wants instead to minimize his dependence in order to maintain his freedom, although he has already learned about the benefits of freedom within a political community (E, 461, 471–73; IV, 841, 855–57). While the governor persuades Emile otherwise, the many qualifications we have been compelled to make to his argument, which we have drawn from Emile itself, suggest that there are problems with it. In particular, the governor goes to great lengths to disguise the tension between Emile as man of nature and Emile as potential citizen, a tension that is the point of departure of the whole Emile. That tension, which may be reformulated as the tension between the identity conferred on us by our communities and our natures may not admit to a full resolution, at least within a political community. For Rousseau, the importance of identity is qualified not only by the importance of moral being but also by the importance of nature.         "
"89","The apparent advantages of defending community in terms of identity are these. First, it satisfies a craving for depth that Rawlsian and Lockean liberalism fail to satisfy. But it does so without hemming us in with potentially restrictive and seemingly indefensible ideas of virtue or nature. Second, it renders our obligation to community ironclad, for it relies not on an instrumental argument, from which the individual may sometimes conclude that the cost of society outweighs its benefits but instead on an argument that seems to cover all contingencies, that human beings come to be and remain human beings in an atmosphere and especially in a language that they do not individually invent. But when the craving for depth becomes a matter of political concern, the power of the community is increased, while the bounds of that power become less well defined. When the grounds for the obligation to community become ironclad, there is no escape from it. Rousseau whose politics are justly understood as basically illiberal, whatever its liberal aspects, never offered so broad and extensive a justification for community as the more or less liberal Taylor does. Communitarians like Taylor, who wish to supplement liberalism with a sense of belonging cannot afford to dismiss as philosophically naïve the claim that seventeenth century “atomists” and Rousseau have in common, that “man is born free.”"
