"1","Survival models seek to explain how the risk, or hazard, of an event occurring at a given time is affected by covariates of theoretical interest. In a single‐event analysis, such as this article's, the hazard rate is the instantaneous risk of a unit experiencing the event at a given time given that it has survived (i.e., not experienced the event) up to that time.2 A critical distinction in survival analysis is how the baseline hazard (the hazard of the event in the absence of any covariate effects, i.e., the time dependency in the event process) is parameterized. In the semiparametric Cox model, no parametric distribution is specified for the baseline hazard. As a consequence, rather than employing a specific distribution for the intervals between event occurrences, the Cox model incorporates information only for the observed event times. In contrast, in parametric survival models such as the Weibull or Gompertz, a specific parametric form is assumed for the underlying baseline hazard.3"
"2","In choosing between the Cox model and its parametric alternatives, one faces a trade‐off between the Cox model's flexibility (to various shapes of the baseline hazard) versus the parametric models' more precise estimates of duration dependency (if the correct parametric distribution is chosen) and capacity for out‐of‐sample prediction. The semiparametric Cox model and its principal parametric alternatives, however, share the common assumption of proportional hazards: covariates are assumed to have proportional effects on the baseline hazard that do not change with time. If this assumption is true, then as Box‐Steffensmeier and Zorn note, “the effects of covariates are constant over time” (2001, 973).         "
"3","The proportional hazards assumption is consequential because assuming that hazards are proportional when, in fact, they are nonproportional, can produce biased parameter estimates and decreases in the power of significance tests (Box‐Steffensmeier and Zorn 2001, 972). It is thus critical to test for the proportionality of hazards (via, for example, Grambsch and Therneau's global test for nonproportional hazards and Harrell's rho test for covariate‐specific nonproportionality) and model nonproportionality when it occurs (typically by interacting covariates that violate the proportional hazards assumption with a logged measure of time; see Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones 2004).         "
"4","I examine both semiparametric and parametric spatial survival models. The parametric analysis examines the Weibull model, which is frequently employed by researchers interested in parametric survival analysis."
"5","As Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand (2004) and Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones (2004) show, the hazard rate in the Cox model takes the form:            "
"6","The Cox and Weibull models in (1) and (2) assume that factors affecting the hazard of event occurrence are included in the covariate vector, xi. What is the effect of omitting factors that affect the hazard? As Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones (2004, 147) note, omitting such factors reduces the effect of covariates in the model that increase the hazard and increases the effect of covariates that reduce the hazard. Thus, scholars will wish to have a way to account for covariates excluded from the model that affect the hazard rate.         "
"7","One strategy for accounting for such omitted covariates is the inclusion of random effect, or frailty terms. The frailty terms account for the fact that some units are at greater risk of experiencing the event of interest, that is, are more frail, due to factors not incorporated in the model. Either of two standard frailty approaches are adopted, depending upon the researcher's prior beliefs about the nature of the unobserved heterogeneity in risk propensity. If the researcher believes that units exhibit their own unique frailties, she will incorporate unit‐specific, or individual frailty terms for each unit in her data. Alternatively, if she believes that units are clustered such that units within the same cluster share the same frailty while frailties are independent across clusters, she will incorporate hierarchical, or shared frailty terms for each cluster in her data. The basic structure of the two standard frailty modeling approaches is similar, and I thus motivate my discussion with the individual frailty model, discussing afterward how this approach is modified for the case of shared frailties."
"8","The hazard rate in the Cox model with standard independent individual frailties takes the form:                "
"9","If unmodeled factors produce significant heterogeneity in risk propensity, the variance of the frailties will be distinguishable from zero. Thus, estimating whether random effects should be included in the model involves specifying a probability distribution for the frailties and estimating the variance, θ, of the frailties. The gamma and inverse Gaussian are often chosen for the random effects distribution (Therneau and Grambsch 2000, 232–34).            "
"10","The individual frailty modeling approach is appropriate only if the researcher believes that each unit has a unique unmodeled frailty. If, however, the researcher believes that units are clustered in a hierarchical structure, such that units within the same cluster share a common frailty, a hierarchical, shared frailty modeling approach is appropriate instead. Here the Cox and Weibull shared frailty models take the form:                "
"11","Both the individual and shared frailty approaches make a critical assumption. In both approaches, the random effects are assumed to be independent. In the individual frailty model, each unit has a unique frailty that is independent of other individual random effects. In the shared frailty model, units within the same cluster share a common frailty, but the frailties are assumed independent across these higher‐level units."
"12","I argue that this assumption of independent random effects will often be unrealistic in political science data. Theories of political event processes predict spatial dependence in event occurrence. If we are unable to model fully this spatial dependence via substantive covariates, this will produce spatially autocorrelated random effects. In the individual frailty approach, neighboring units will have spatially dependent frailties. In the shared frailty approach, neighboring strata will have spatially dependent frailties. Given evidence of spatial autocorrelation in many political science data (see, e.g., Beck, Gleditsch, and Beardsley 2006; Darmofal 2006; Gimpel and Cho 2004; O'Loughlin, Flint, and Anselin 1994; Shin and Ward 1999), I argue that scholars will often wish to model spatial dependence in random effects.            "
"13","The modeling approach I examine here also provides a more realistic and flexible approach to modeling dependent data than standard hierarchical models. The standard approach makes a knife‐edge assumption: units in the same strata are assumed to exhibit dependence, but the strata themselves, even neighboring strata, are assumed to be independent. Thus, for example, in a shared frailty model of legislative behavior with state‐level strata (a commonly employed choice for clustering political science data), Democratic Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York's 8th Congressional District and Robert Menendez of New Jersey's neighboring 13th Congressional District would be treated as spatially independent in the 103rd Congress. This is not consistent with our understanding of how spatial proximity promotes legislative interaction (see Caldeira and Patterson 1987). More generally, because political processes are inherently social and interdependent, spatial dependence often does not stop at the stratum's edge. Instead, neighboring strata often exhibit spatial dependence. As a consequence, scholars will often wish to incorporate spatial dependence between strata rather than making the knife‐edge assumption of spatial independence across strata.            "
"14","In short, political scientists often have reason to expect spatial dependence in the political event processes they seek to model. Standard approaches to modeling these event processes to date, however, have treated observations as spatially independent. The Bayesian spatial survival modeling approach I examine provides researchers with an approach for modeling the spatial autocorrelation that is predicted by our theories of event processes in political science. In the next section, I examine semiparametric and parametric Bayesian approaches for modeling spatially dependent survival data."
"15","Typically, spatial data in political science take the form of lattice data, in which a continuous spatial surface is divided into a grid of (typically irregular) lattice objects, or polygons, such as counties, states, congressional districts, or the like.4 The critical step that distinguishes spatial modeling of event processes from standard modeling approaches for event processes is the incorporation of adjacency information for the observations and the parameterization of spatial dependence across neighboring polygons. From a Bayesian perspective, this involves incorporating a prior to account for the spatial dependence in the hazards. Typically, a conditionally autoregressive (CAR) prior incorporating adjacency information is employed to model this spatial dependence.         "
"16","Before examining the CAR prior, it is critical to distinguish what we mean by “adjacency” and “neighboring locations.” Often, substantive theory suggests that spatial dependence operates geographically; in this case, the term “neighboring” can be taken literally, with spatial dependence modeled for adjacent polygons. As Beck, Gleditsch, and Beardsley (2006) demonstrate, however, dependence in other applications may take a nonspatial form (they model dependence as a function of trade flows between countries). Thus, “neighbors” need not imply contiguity and indeed, there need not be any inherent spatial component to the analysis at all. As a consequence, the modeling approach examined here is quite general and can be applied to the more general question of correlated hazards across observations.         "
"17","Neighbors are defined via a weights matrix, A. In an unnormalized weights matrix such as that employed in this article's NAFTA application, each neighbor of a unit is given a weight of 1, while each nonneighbor of a unit is given a weight of 0. (Thus, aii′= 1 if units i and i′ are neighbors, and aii′= 0 if units i and i′ are nonneighbors.) This spatial weights approach differs from the standard i.i.d. perspective on random effects, which, in a Bayesian framework, implies an exchangeable prior with a (nonspatial) weights matrix. In the exchangeable prior, all nondiagonal elements of the nonspatial weights matrix are given a common value, such as 1. In such an approach, the random effects are exchangeable under any geographic permutation of the data (Bernardinelli and Montomoli 1992, 988).         "
"18","In the spatial CAR modeling approach, the definition of neighbors via the weights matrix is a critical step in modeling spatially dependent event processes, since it delimits the possible spatial dependence that may be identified. The definition of neighbors should thus be guided by substantive theory. Because prior theory (e.g., Caldeira and Patterson 1987) argues that spatial proximity between legislators is likely to affect the timing of position announcements, I examine spatial dependence across geographically adjacent locations in my application.         "
"19","Once the researcher has defined neighbors via the weights matrix, this information is then incorporated in the CAR prior. In recent years, biostatisticians have employed the CAR prior for Bayesian spatial shared frailty modeling (see Banerjee and Carlin 2003; Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand 2004; Banerjee, Wall, and Carlin 2003). I extend these models for the first time to the case of Bayesian spatial individual frailty models. I first examine the CAR priors for the individual and shared spatial cases and then examine the full semiparametric and parametric specifications incorporating the CAR prior.         "
"20","The standard, nonspatial frailty models in equations 3–6 all assume that the random effects or frailty terms are independent. From a Bayesian perspective, this is consistent with a specification in which the random effects distribution is conditional on a hyperparameter, λ, with an exchangeable prior, where λ refers to the precision (the inverse variance, i.e., the inverse of θ) of the random effects distribution. As in the case of the CAR prior, the λ prior is a unidimensional precision prior for the joint distribution of the random effects vector. The single dimensional prior for the random effects distribution is employed in survival modeling research by, e.g., Banerjee, Wall, and Carlin (2003), Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand (2004), and Lawson (2008). As stated earlier, the exchangeable prior is induced by not distinguishing between neighboring and nonneighboring units in the weights matrix, but instead treating both neighbors and nonneighbors as exchangeable.            "
"21","The exchangeable prior, however, is likely to be problematic for many survival modeling applications. As the well‐known Galton's problem recognizes, neighboring units are likely to share similar risk propensities, due either to behavioral diffusion or to shared risk factors. If we are unable to model fully the sources of risk propensity, neighboring units will share spatially autocorrelated frailties. As a consequence, we will often wish to relax the assumption of exchangeability. This is accomplished by allowing the precision parameter, λ, to reflect a conditionally autoregressive prior that incorporates neighbor definitions via the spatial weights matrix."
"22","In the spatial individual frailty model, this CAR(λ) prior has a joint distribution proportional to:                "
"23","The conditional distribution of the spatial random effects that results from the CAR prior is then:                "
"24","The CAR prior for the spatial shared frailty model follows accordingly. In the spatial shared frailty model, the individual unit i is now nested in a higher‐level cluster or stratum j, and the random effect refers to this higher‐level stratum, Wj. The CAR(λ) prior for the spatial shared frailty model has a joint distribution proportional to:               "
"25","The resulting conditional distribution for the strata‐level spatial random effects is then:                "
"26","The CAR prior is an improper prior, with the mean of the distribution of the spatial random effects undefined. Any constant can be added to the random effects and the prior remains unchanged (Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand 2004, 80). As a consequence of its impropriety, the CAR model can only be used as a prior and not as a likelihood (Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand 2004, 80). Because the CAR prior, as a pairwise‐difference prior, is identified only up to an additive constant, a constraint must be imposed on the frailties to identify an intercept term (Banerjee, Wall, and Carlin 2003, 126; Besag et al. 1995). To identify an intercept in the Weibull models, I thus impose the constraint that the frailties sum to zero.            "
"27","For the Bayesian semiparametric Cox model, the joint posterior distribution is:                "
"28","The joint posterior distribution for the Bayesian parametric Weibull model is:                "
"29","The likelihood for the Weibull model with spatial individual frailties is proportional to:                "
"30","Researchers may also be interested in estimating survival models with both spatial and nonspatial frailties. Such an approach can be useful in examining the relative contributions of spatial and nonspatial effects. Care must be taken here, however, as the spatial and independent random effects are now identified only through their priors (Banerjee and Carlin 2003, 526). The likelihood for the Cox model with shared spatial and nonspatial frailties is:               "
"31","I apply Bayesian spatial frailty modeling to the timing of position announcements by members of the U.S. House of Representatives on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In their analysis of position timing on NAFTA, Box‐Steffensmeier, Arnold, and Zorn (1997) incorporated spatial influences via a dummy variable indicating whether the member's district shared a land border with Mexico. Spatial effects in position announcements, however, were unlikely to be limited to the border's edge. I posit, instead, that members from neighboring locations were likely to announce positions at similar times, and thus exhibit spatial dependence in position timing. Consistent with Galton's problem, two sets of factors were likely to produce this spatial autocorrelation.         "
"32","On the one hand, spatial dependence in position timing may have occurred as a result of behavioral diffusion. Caldeira and Patterson (1987) demonstrate that members from neighboring legislative districts are more likely to develop friendships with each other than are members from more spatially distant districts. Accordingly, I expect more frequent—and more effective—interpersonal interaction among members from neighboring districts than among members from more distant districts, and greater similarity in the timing of legislative position announcements as a result.         "
"33","Alternatively, spatially proximate members may announce positions at similar times despite little or no communication between each other. Members from neighboring locations are more likely to share similar constituencies, and similar constituent concerns, than more spatially distant members. Thus, similar factors that lead to cue taking and cue giving among same‐state senators (Matthews and Stimson 1975) may also produce spatial dependence in the timing of position announcements among neighboring House members. Members from neighboring locations may also share similar partisan, ideological, or demographic characteristics, producing similarity in both policy positions and in the timing of announcements of these positions. Thus, even if members from neighboring districts rarely talk, they may still exhibit spatially dependent position timing due to common district or personal attributes.         "
"34","My analysis thus contrasts with many previous analyses of legislative behavior that have focused on dependence within same‐state delegations in that I allow for dependence across state boundaries. In addition to potential spatial effects, I model three sets of factors likely to affect position timing. These three sets of factors are constituency, institutional, and individual (member) influences (see Box‐Steffensmeier, Arnold, and Zorn 1997).7"
"35","I model constituency factors with two covariates (full descriptions of all covariates in the models, from Box‐Steffensmeier, Arnold, and Zorn[1997, 336], are provided in the appendix, along with descriptive statistics). NAFTA carried different policy effects for constituents with different economic profiles. Specifically, NAFTA was expected to pose significant dislocation effects on union members and low‐income citizens, with the high‐paying jobs of the former and the low‐skill jobs of the latter particularly threatened by foreign competition. As a result, I include the covariates Union Membership, measuring the percentage of private‐sector workers in the member's district who were union members, and Household Income, measuring the district's median household income. As Box‐Steffensmeier, Arnold, and Zorn (1997, 327) note, these covariates as coded in their analysis and mine do not present clear expectations for effects on the timing of NAFTA announcements. In each case, members with high or low values on the variable are expected to announce earlier than members with intermediate levels due to clearer signals of policy preferences from constituents. I retain Box‐Steffensmeier, Arnold, and Zorn's operationalization of these covariates.         "
"36","Institutional influences in the House of Representatives are measured with three covariates. NAFTA Committee is a dichotomous measure indicating whether the member was on a committee that acted on NAFTA implementing legislation. Because committee membership provides an effective stage for cue giving to other members, NAFTA committee members are expected to announce positions earlier than noncommittee members. Republican Leadership and Democratic Leadership are dummy variables indicating whether the member held a position in his or her party's leadership in the House. Because Republican leaders were united in their support for NAFTA, a Republican leadership position is expected to be associated with earlier position taking. In contrast, Democratic leaders were divided on the trade agreement, cross‐pressured in some cases by opposition to the agreement among constituents and support for the agreement by the Clinton administration. As a consequence, this covariate does not present clear expectations for the timing of members' announcements.         "
"37","Finally, two interaction terms incorporating member ideology are included in the model to capture individual‐level influences. The two covariates are Ideology * Union Membership and Ideology * Household Income.8Box‐Steffensmeier, Arnold, and Zorn (1997) measure ideology with members' Chamber of Commerce voting scores (purged of the NAFTA vote) on economic issues. Members with voting scores > 50 (indicating more probusiness voting records) are scored 1 on the dichotomous measure, while members with scores at or below 50 are scored 0. Box‐Steffensmeier, Arnold, and Zorn posit that it is the interaction of member ideology and district ideology (as proxied by union membership and household income) that is most relevant for the timing of NAFTA position announcements. I follow their specification and incorporate these two interaction terms in the model. Due to potential cross‐pressures between member and district ideology, neither interaction term presents clear expectations regarding effects on position timing.         "
"38","I employ distinct neighbor definitions for the individual and hierarchical frailty models. For the individual frailty model, I created an adjacency matrix with a queen contiguity definition, in which each district contiguous to member i's district in the 103rd Congress is a neighbor of member i and each district that is not contiguous to member i's district is a nonneighbor. For the hierarchical model, I nest members of Congress within states and allow for spatial dependence across the state‐level random effects. Again I employ a queen contiguity neighbor definition, in which each state contiguous to state i is a neighbor of state i and each state not contiguous to state i is a nonneighbor of state i.9"
"39","Employing these two distinct conceptions of neighbors has particular utility for examining the validity of the standard approach to modeling dependence in legislative behavior in which neighbors are nested within states. The standard approach corresponds to the nonspatial shared frailty model with independent state‐level random effects. The shared spatial frailty model allows us to examine the validity of treating the state‐level random effects as independent. The individual spatial frailty model, in turn, allows us to examine whether spatial dependence should be modeled more locally via neighboring districts, including those in neighboring states, or less locally via spatially autocorrelated state‐level frailties."
"40","I complete the specifications by specifying appropriate priors for the parameters in the models. Given that spatial frailty models have not previously been employed in political science and prior substantive research provides little information regarding the values of the spatial random effects or the values of substantive covariates in the presence of these spatial frailties, I prefer vague prior distributions, relying on the data to overwhelm the priors. I employ a vague hyperprior for λ of Gamma(.01, .01), a prior of N(0, .001) for β0 in the Weibull model, and priors of N(0, .00001) for the remaining β in both the Cox and Weibull models.10 I set α= .01, producing a Gamma(.01, 100) prior for the shape parameter, ρ, in the Weibull model.11"
"41","I employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to characterize the posterior densities of the parameters and hyperparameters of interest.12 Specifically, I employed Gibbs sampling for two separate Markov chains with overdispersed starting values of 0 and 1 for the intercept, β0, in the Weibull models, ±3 standard errors from the frequentist Cox estimates in Box‐Steffensmeier, Arnold, and Zorn (1997, 331) for the remaining β, .01 and .1 for ρ, .001 and 1 for λ, and .01 and .1 for c and r. I employed 5,000 burn‐in iterations for each Markov chain. Convergence was diagnosed via Gelman and Rubin's diagnostic (Gill 2002, 399–402), with the diagnostic indicating convergence for each parameter in each model. I retained 10,000 post burn‐in iterations for each chain, providing a sample size of 20,000.            "
"42","I first examine how the risk of a U.S. House member announcing a position on NAFTA varied as a function of time.13 The empirical baseline hazard for the Cox model is nonmonotonic, but generally increasing over time. Member announcements on NAFTA were backloaded—more than 90% of announcements occurred more than 300 days after Rep. Peter Visclosky's (D‐IN) announcement of his opposition to NAFTA on August 12, 1992. The data are, moreover, heavily clustered. More than 80% of members announced their positions on September 9, 1993, or later; nearly half of members announced their positions in the month leading up to the House vote.         "
"43","Such heavily clustered data mitigate against finding spatial dependence. With so many members announcing their positions concurrently, it is clear that nonspatial effects played a significant role in the timing of position taking. Thus, my particular application serves as a conservative test of spatial dependence in time‐to‐event data. If we find evidence of significant spatial effects even in survival data marked by large spikes in event occurrence such as those in the timing of NAFTA position announcements, we will have reason to expect even stronger spatial effects in less temporally clustered data."
"44","Because the spatial CAR prior is an improper prior, Bayes factors cannot be used to choose among the alternative models (e.g., Gill 2002). Instead, I use the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC; Spiegelhalter et al. 2002) to assess model choice across the spatial and nonspatial Cox and Weibull survival models. The DIC, like the more familiar Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), combines measures both of model fit and of the effective number of parameters (the latter component penalizes models that overfit the data).            "
"45","The deviance statistic is central to the model fit component of the DIC. The deviance statistic takes the form:                "
"46","Because the estimation of unnecessary parameters in the parameter vector θ naturally improves model fit, it is important to penalize for overfitting the model. This is done by calculating the effective number of parameters, pD, for the model. The effective number of parameters reflects the relative role that the data play in estimating the parameters versus the priors, with larger estimates of the effective number of parameters indicating that the data play a larger role. As Gelman et al. (2004, 182) note, in calculating the effective number of parameters, a parameter receives a value of 1 if it is estimated from the data alone with no input from the prior, a value of 0 if it is estimated from the prior alone with no input from the data, and an intermediate value between 1 and 0 depending upon the relative contributions of the data and the prior. The effective number of parameters is calculated as:               "
"47"," Table 2 reports the effective number of parameters and DIC values for three Cox models and five Weibull models: standard Cox and Weibull models with no random effects, Cox and Weibulls with nonspatial shared (state‐level) random effects, Cox and Weibulls with spatial shared (state‐level) random effects, a Weibull model with nonspatial individual (district‐level) random effects, and a Weibull model with spatial, individual (district‐level) random effects. In each model, the specification included the covariates discussed in the fifth section.            "
"48","As Table 2 shows, in each of the three comparisons between the spatial and nonspatial frailty models, the spatial frailty models outperform their nonspatial counterparts, as indicated by the smaller DIC values. There is, in short, spatial dependence in the timing of NAFTA announcements that is not fully captured by the substantive covariates in the model. Treating the random effects as though they were spatially independent, as we typically do, reflects model misspecification.            "
"49","Importantly, the information criterion advantages are not produced by overfitting the models with additional parameters. In both the case of the Cox model and the shared frailty Weibull model, the spatial frailty model has a smaller effective number of parameters (pD) than does the nonspatial frailty model. These spatial frailty models thus enjoy a parsimony advantage over their nonspatial counterparts. In the third comparison, for the individual frailty Weibull models, the spatial model has only a very marginal increase in the effective number of parameters over its nonspatial counterpart (12.33 vs. 12.17).            "
"50","Examining the DICs for the various models, clear patterns emerge. The models that incorporate spatial dependence in state‐level frailties are the preferred model in both the semiparametric Cox and parametric Weibull cases. The Cox model with spatial shared frailties outperforms both the standard Cox model and the Cox model with nonspatial shared frailties. The Weibull with spatial shared frailties outperforms the standard Weibull, the Weibull with nonspatial shared frailties, and the two Weibull individual frailty specifications. Whether considering a semiparametric or parametric modeling approach, in this case scholars should fit a model that accounts for spatial dependence across state‐level effects rather than fitting either a standard model that doesn't account for unmodeled heterogeneity in risk propensity, or a frailty model that treats this heterogeneity as spatially independent."
"51","More broadly, scholars modeling legislative behavior have become accustomed to clustering legislators by state and treating members from different states as independent, conditional on the covariates. The DIC values in Table 2 question the validity of such an approach. Scholars, instead, should consider the possibility that members from neighboring states share common unmeasured characteristics that impact the behavior of interest. The results also argue that modeling heterogeneity via unit‐specific random effects is not ideal either. The DICs indicate that the argument that the uniqueness of each individual actor precludes conceptual generalization is not valid for this particular case of legislative behavior. House members are not independent actors; neighboring legislators share common risk factors, whether due to direct behavioral interaction or shared attributes.            "
"52","I examine spatial dependence in the timing of NAFTA position announcements as well as its effects on substantive covariates via summaries of the posterior densities from the Bayesian Cox and Weibull analyses.16Table 3 presents the summaries for the semiparametric Cox MCMC analysis, while Table 4 presents the summaries for the parametric Weibull MCMC analysis. In both tables, the first cell entry is the mean of the posterior density of the particular parameter of interest while the cell entry in parentheses below is the corresponding 95% Bayesian credible interval (formed by taking the 2.5 and 97.5 posterior percentiles). Descriptions of the models in each column are provided below the tables.            "
"53","Examining the Cox summaries in Table 3, we can see that employing a standard nonspatial frailty model understates the frailty variance estimate in comparison to the spatial frailty model favored by the DICs. The posterior mean of the variance of the random effects, θ, is more than twice as large in the spatial model as in the nonspatial model. Spatially proximate members share common unmodeled risk factors that distinguish them from their spatially distant colleagues. Modeling these risk factors as though they were spatially independent understates the unmodeled heterogeneity in risk propensity.            "
"54","By mapping the frailties from the nonspatial and spatial Cox models, we can further see the problems that are induced by modeling spatially dependent risk factors as though they were spatially independent. Figure 1 presents a map of the posterior means of the nonspatial state‐level frailties—means estimated under the assumption of spatial independence. Figure 1 suggests a checkerboard pattern, with little spatial clustering in the random effects.            "
"55","                 Nonspatial Cox State‐Level Frailties                         "
"56"," Figure 2 maps the posterior means from the spatial Cox model that takes into account the spatial dependence between the state‐level frailties. As can be seen from Figure 2, there is, in fact, a strong spatial clustering in the unobserved risk factors. There are distinct spatial bands in the random effects. Portions of the Northeast, upper Plains, and West were marked by particularly high risk propensity (and thus, all else equal, members from these states were more likely to be early announcers of NAFTA positions). Members from the Rocky Mountain states shared the next level of hazards. Next, members from a band of states extending from the industrial Midwest, southwest into Oklahoma shared similar risk factors. Next, we see a set of shared hazards extending from the border states to Pennsylvania. Finally, we see a clustering in the Carolinas of low risk factors for NAFTA announcements. In contrast to the false impression of independent random effects suggested by Figure 1, we can see from Figure 2 that the spatial location of members played a significant role in the timing of their position announcements on NAFTA.            "
"57","                 Spatial Cox State‐Level Frailties                         "
"58"," Table 3 demonstrates the importance of modeling spatial dependence in random effects if we wish to draw accurate inferences about substantive covariates of interest. The posterior means for the spatial frailty model differ from those in the standard, nonfrailty Cox model, and in all but one case, differ more from the latter than do the means from the nonspatial frailty model. Note, for example, the changes in the posterior means for Union Membership and the Ideology * Union Membership interaction in the spatial model versus the standard Cox model. Similarly, the means for the Democratic Leadership effects are noticeably different across the two models. Where the standard Cox model predicts that a position in the Democratic leadership increases the hazard of a NAFTA announcement by 9.5%, the spatial Cox model predicts an increase in the hazard of only 1.8%.            "
"59"," Table 4 reports the posterior summaries for the five Weibull models. Although the parametric assumption of the Weibull makes it more restrictive, the Weibull specifications also allow for the estimation of individual frailty models. As a result, the Weibulls allow us to compare how spatial frailty effects differ at the individual and shared levels.            "
"60","In both the individual and shared Weibulls, the frailty effects are larger in the spatial models favored by the DICs than in the nonspatial models. The mean of the variance parameter, θ, is also noticeably larger in the Weibull with spatial shared frailties than in the Weibull with spatial individual frailties. Thus, consistent with the DICs, it is particularly important in estimating position timing to account for spatial dependence across state‐level random effects. As we would expect given the smaller values of θ in the Weibull models, the differences in effects across models on substantive covariates are not as dramatic as in the Cox specifications."
"61","Examining the effects of substantive factors on NAFTA position timing, we can gauge the effect of constituency, institutional, and individual factors by examining the posterior summaries from the best‐performing model according to the DIC, the Cox spatial shared frailty model. As we can see from Table 3, the main effect of large union memberships in a member's district was to increase the hazard of a NAFTA position announcement. Economically conservative members from districts with large union memberships, however, had reduced hazards of NAFTA announcements, as indicated by the negative value for the mean on the Ideology * Union Membership interaction. This suggests, then, that cross‐pressures delayed announcements for some members. Also of note, members of the Republican leadership had increased hazards of NAFTA announcements; this is as we would expect given the Republican leadership's united support for the trade agreement. Overall, constituency, institutional, and individual characteristics all influenced the timing of NAFTA position announcements.            "
"62","In this article I have presented an approach to modeling spatial dependence in political event processes. The importance of modeling spatial autocorrelation in survival data is clear: many of our theories of event processes in political science predict spatial dependence among neighboring units. If we are unable to model fully this spatial dependence, the result will be spatially autocorrelated unmeasured risk factors among neighboring units. Political scientists examining event processes will, therefore, often not wish to assume that frailties among neighboring observations are spatially independent. Instead, scholars will often have strong theoretical justification for modeling spatial dependence in the random effects among neighboring observations. The conditionally autoregressive prior allows political scientists to incorporate this spatial dependence in their survival models."
"63","The article's results highlight the importance of modeling the spatial autocorrelation that is common to so many political science data. The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) values favored the spatial shared frailty models (in both semiparametric and parametric forms) over both standard nonfrailty models and nonspatial frailty models. The posterior mean of the random effects variance parameter in both the semiparametric and parametric models also differed from the mean for the nonspatial variance parameter. Incorporating the spatial CAR prior also produced distinct changes in the posterior means for substantive covariates."
"64","This initial analysis of spatial frailties in political time‐to‐event data examined single‐spell event processes. Future research can extend Bayesian spatial survival models to examine spatial dependence in more complex event processes. Often political events are repeated events; units are at risk of experiencing the same type of event multiple times. Substantive theory predicts significant spatial dependence in repeated event processes. For example, international conflicts occur among the same participants repeatedly, with particular regions such as the Middle East particularly prone to such repeated conflicts. A more complex model would examine spatial dependence in competing risks, in which units at any time are at risk of experiencing any of multiple types of events. We could easily, for example, imagine policymakers making choices among various health policy reforms where the choice of the particular policy is shaped by the decision processes in neighboring states or communities."
"65","At their base, political concerns are shared concerns. As a corollary, political events carry significance, in large part, because they are not isolated events. A conflict in one location may spill over and produce conflicts in neighboring locations. Democratization in one nation may produce a wave of democratization in neighboring countries. Political event processes, in short, take place in both space and time. To draw valid inferences about the factors shaping political event processes we must account for both these spatial and temporal dimensions. The Bayesian approach examined here presents an effective approach for political scientists wishing to account for space and time in their models of political event processes."
