"1","The microfoundations of U.S. economic performance are rooted in the behavior of millions of economic actors making billions of market transactions daily throughout the economy. As economic actors make choices about how to use their income, aggregate economic outcomes result. Fully two‐thirds of all economic activity in the United States is due to personal consumption. The remaining economic activity is heavily affected by these personal consumption expenditures. Thus, if consumers turn cautious, choosing not to spend, the result can be declining national income, unemployment, and generally poor business conditions (Cochrane 1994).         "
"2","In making decisions concerning how to use their income, economic actors evaluate their current and expected financial situations. Current finances are a constraint on current spending and may also affect the individual's future income stream. The importance of expectations in explaining economic behavior was recognized in the early work of two Nobel laureates. Modigliani and Brumberg's life cycle theory (1954) and Friedman's permanent income hypothesis (1957) emphasized the role of expectations in explaining current spending, borrowing, and saving decisions. The main thrust of both theories was the assumption that rational economic actors would attempt to maximize utility by allocating their lifetime stream of income into an optimal pattern of lifetime consumption.            "
"3","Later advances in economic theory emphasized the role that uncertainty plays in explaining current spending, borrowing, and saving decisions. The early work had emphasized the expected income stream, but uncertainty implied the importance of the expected variance of the income stream. Once uncertainty about future income was incorporated into theoretical models of economic behavior, this factor was consistently demonstrated to have an impact on current consumption, borrowing, and saving decisions (Caballero 1991; Carroll 1994, 1997; Carroll and Samwick 1997, 1998; Kimball 1990).            "
"4","Uncertainty about the economy factors into these decisions by altering the psychology of individual behavior. In particular, it is the psychology associated with an individual's willingness to assume risk that is important. This perspective was developed in the early work of Katona (1951, 1960, 1964, 1975), the originator of the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers.1 Changes in the national economy can have tangible impacts for individuals, including potential loss of income and employment. Uncertainty about future income and employment alters the risks that an individual is willing to take in current economic decisions. For example, the individual may at times be willing to assume more risk to finance current spending through borrowing or reduced saving. At other times the same individual may become risk averse, choosing not to spend, but rather to pay down debt or save for the future. Confidence in personal finances and the economy produces a greater propensity to consume and willingness to take on risk. Uncertainty about finances and the economy produces greater reluctance to spend and risk aversion.            "
"5","Individuals attempt to calculate their current and future economic status when making economic decisions. However, the processes used by most economic actors for deciding whether and how much to spend, borrow, and save are often more fragmented than coherent and may display internal inconsistencies (Simon 1947; Souleles 2001). Their ability to interpret economic events is limited by their beliefs, environment, education, intellect, exposure to information, and available time. These limitations mean that economic actors must use shortcuts when deciding how to allocate their income. They strive to achieve a coherent interpretation of the economic events that directly influence their lives. They do the best that they can, by relying on a wide range of cues and information from their environment.            "
"6","Economic actors take cues and information about current and prospective economic conditions from a variety of sources. They can derive from personal experience, the experiences of others, the news, economic reports, or elite economic and political actors (including the president). A core thesis of the theory developed here is that uncertainty surrounding potential hostilities with other nations is a major cue that should affect individual economic decisions. News of potential conflict generally creates an atmosphere of apprehension, especially when accompanied by reinforcing rhetoric from the president."
"7","Most Americans get most of their information about the nation and world from the news. The president features prominently into this scheme of information dissemination. The chief executive is the most visible and important political and economic actor in the United States. As such, virtually every television newscast has at least one brief segment on the president and/or the administration. Regardless of topic, whether it is the president's health, administration policy, scandal, the economy, or foreign policy, the media cover the presidency broadly and intensely."
"8","During normal times, the media filter attention to the presidency to provide time for other news. Not everything the president or administration says is newsworthy, and the media are usually cautious of allowing presidents to use the airwaves as a “bully pulpit.” However, there are certain periods during which coverage of the presidency intensifies far beyond the normal elevated level. During times of potential hostility with other nations the president and administration figure more prominently in news coverage."
"9","For example, the Iran hostage crisis, Grenada, Libyan bombing, Panama invasion, Persian Gulf War, Somalia, Haiti, Kosovo, September 11th, Afghanistan, and Iraqi invasions were all periods during which coverage of the presidency and the administration escalated dramatically. Most of these crises involved significant national security or domestic concerns. Under these conditions presidents speak more loudly to the media and public (Baum 2004). Similarly, the media and public were more interested in what the president and administration had to say.            "
"10","Crisis typically puts the media into a “round‐the‐clock” mode that bombards the public with continuous coverage. Often, the crowding‐out effect of the crisis and presidential saber rattling becomes so strong that media coverage spills over to displace other programming. For example, the late evening news show Nightline originated to provide the American public with a regular update on the progress of the Iran hostage crisis. In large numbers Americans glued themselves to Nightline and other special news programs to keep abreast of ongoing events involving the administration, the government of Iran, and the American hostages. Administration spokespersons frequently appeared on the program, and the president spoke frequently about the crisis in other public settings.            "
"11","This pattern of “hyper‐coverage” has been repeated consistently through the years for multiple crises. A major factor for all of these periods has been hostile presidential rhetoric prior to taking action. Presidents often threaten economic or political sanctions, and make implicit or explicit threats of military action. The presidency has been central to all of this coverage, since it is the administration that speaks with the official voice in interactions with other nations. Administration representatives were frequently interviewed through these periods and the president frequently spoke in a public setting."
"12","In addition, for many of these crises there was widespread elite consensus. Under such conditions, the president's message is transmitted more loudly by the media, perhaps even to the point of the media propagandizing presidential positions (Bennett 1990; Entman 1991). As a result of the saturated news environment, we should expect the public to be very attentive to presidential rhetoric.            "
"13","Presidential saber rattling intensifies the sense of crisis, making it more imminent and credible. As a result of more visible presidential involvement, people have a heightened understanding that the future may hold adverse economic and social consequences. American economic resources devoted to hostile actions imply money diverted to nonproductive endeavors. Such diversions may have consequences for macroeconomic outcomes, including higher taxes, increased government deficits and debt, or reduced government services. Furthermore, most major military actions since World War I have been followed by recession or other adverse economic conditions.2 Therefore, economic actors may have the expectation that the potential actions can adversely affect the economy. This expectation may hold implications for an individual's personal economic circumstances, and therefore produce risk‐averse behavior.            "
"14","Additionally, presidential saber rattling heightens the realization that American sons and daughters may soon be in harm's way. The specter of Vietnam‐like outcomes, with daily body counts and graphic images of blood and death, may temper American appetites for normal economic activities. With potential blood and death, it may seem inappropriate to visit local shopping malls and purchase major items. Thus, the prevailing economic mood is to wait until the crisis has passed before engaging in normal economic activities."
"15","Of course, the actual events associated with international crises can also drive attention by the president and economic actors. Such diversions as hostage taking, terrorist attacks, or military actions can cause anticipation and reluctance to commit to risky economic behaviors. While the events themselves should affect economic behavior, presidential rhetoric can either diminish or intensify the crisis environment. If the president does not direct significant rhetoric toward crisis events, then there will be much less attention by the media and public. As chief U.S. foreign policy leader the president can choose when to speak and how loudly. Through changing rhetoric directed toward international actors, the president can mute or amplify the significance of a crisis."
"16","In the other direction, presidents may also have incentives to drive attention toward a foreign policy crisis and away from domestic conditions. This should be especially true when the nation is experiencing poor economic conditions. Presidential approval suffers during periods of economic decline (e.g., see Clarke and Stewart 1994; Edwards, Mitchell, and Welch 1995; MacKuen 1983; MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson 1992; Monroe 1978; Mueller 1970, 1973; Ostrom and Smith 1993; Wood 2000). As a result, the president may choose to amplify a crisis through saber rattling in order to divert attention from domestic problems (e.g., see DeRouen 1995; Fordham 1998a, 1998b, 2002; Gowa 1998; Howell and Pevehouse 2005; James and Oneal 1991; Meernik 1994; Mueller 1970; Ostrom and Job 1986). So, it is also important to consider the possible two‐way relations among presidential saber rattling, perceptions of economic news, consumer confidence, personal consumption, interest rates, and actual economic performance.            "
"17","We can formalize the theory of presidential saber rattling and the economy graphically as shown in Figure 1. The two‐headed arrows indicate possible two‐way relationships between variables. The signs associated with each arrow indicate the expected direction of relationships. Where there are both positive and negative signs, the first sign is associated with the left‐to‐right hypothesis, while the second sign is associated with the right‐to‐left hypothesis. The absence of a sign for some arrows indicates that theory makes no prediction.            "
"18","                 Potential Paths of Influence of Presidential Saber Rattling on Economic Behavior and Performance                         "
"19","The primary theoretical argument is that variations in the intensity of presidential saber rattling can produce changes in the amount of apprehension that economic actors feel about current and future economic conditions. As a result, consumer confidence should decline to affect personal consumption, interest rates (i.e., demand for money), and economic performance. It is less clear whether presidential saber rattling increases or decreases perceptions of negative economic news, since presidents may also use rhetoric to divert attention from the economy. Regardless, economic actors should view periods of impending hostility as a poor time to spend and borrow. Confidence in current economic conditions declines with the result that individuals become more risk averse. The result may be a subsequent period of depressed economic activity tied directly to administration rhetoric."
"20","Of course, various scholars have suggested that elite political actors can affect public attitudes through media priming effects (Behr and Iyengar 1985; Brody 1991; Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder 1982; Krosnick and Kinder 1990; Zaller 1992). Past empirical research has also shown that presidential rhetoric can alter attention by the mass public to some issues. For example, Cohen (1995) showed that language in annual State of the Union messages on various policy issues increases subsequent public attention to these same issues (but see Hill 1998). Conversely, Wood and Peake (1998) and Edwards and Wood (1999) used time‐series analysis to show that presidential attention to various issues often follows, rather than leads, systemic attention. Edwards (2003) offered evidence that presidential efforts to alter public opinion using a “going public” strategy generally fall “on deaf ears.” More recently, Wood, Durham, and Owens (2005; see also Wood 2007) showed that presidential rhetoric about the economy can affect economic behavior. The question addressed here is whether the more indirect mechanism of presidential saber rattling can have similar effects.            "
"21","This section lays out a research design and measurement strategy for exploring the interaction of presidential saber rattling with economic behavior and performance. Again, the nature of the research problem can best be understood through the path diagram in Figure 1. Toward the center and right of Figure 1 is a set of mutually interactive economic variables. Perceptions of negative economic news, consumer confidence, personal consumption expenditures, interest rates, and economic performance should jointly affect one another and comprise the major components of an endogenous economic system.         "
"22","Impinging on this economic system from the left side of Figure 1 are two influences relating to foreign policy. First, there is a stream of exogenous events that should affect economic behavior and performance. These same events may also strongly affect the volume of presidential saber rattling. For example, the September 11th tragedy significantly altered consumer confidence, and most would argue depressed economic activity for some time. The president also became more vocal against terrorism and its sponsor nations as a result of September 11th. Similar arguments should also apply to the Iran hostage crisis and various other crises that occurred between 1978 and 2005. Thus, we must control for various foreign policy events if we are to statistically evaluate the impact of presidential saber rattling on U.S. economic behavior and performance.         "
"23","The second force impinging on the system of economic variables is presidential saber rattling. The primary question of this research concerns the linkages involving the president running from left to right. Does the president's foreign policy rhetoric affect citizen perceptions of the economic news, consumer confidence, personal consumption expenditures, interest rates, and ultimately U.S. economic performance? Note, however, that all of the arrows involving the president are also double headed. Thus, we must also address the ancillary question of whether, after controlling for events, presidents engage in hostile rhetoric in response to changing economic behavior and performance."
"24","In Figure 1, the node Heard Negative Economic News gauges the various negative cues citizens are hearing about the economy. As citizens report hearing more or less about such factors as unemployment, inflation, recession, a declining stock market, etc., they should adjust their economic behavior accordingly. Citizen perceptions of negative economic news were measured using monthly data from the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers running from January 1978 through January 2005. The Survey of Consumers asked, “During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions?” A follow‐up question was also asked: “What news have you heard?” Responses were grouped into categories including news about unemployment, consumer prices, consumer demand, credit conditions, the energy crisis, stock market, and trade deficit. The measure of citizen perceptions of negative economic news is the monthly percentage of respondents reporting unfavorable news across all categories.3"
"25","As was intended by the Survey of Consumers, this set of questions encompasses news about a wide range of economic indicators. This composite measure is therefore a better statistical control than including separate counts of media coverage as has been done in some past research (e.g., Edwards and Wood 1999; Wood and Peake 1998). It is also better than including actual economic indicators drawn from government reports. The Survey of Consumers measure gauges the cues that citizens actually perceive about the economy, rather than media or government reports that can be obscure to most citizens.4"
"26","Nevertheless, measures of actual economic performance are also included in the analysis. As shown in Figure 1 we are interested in how presidential saber rattling affects U.S. economic performance (and vice versa). Actual economic performance should affect all of the other economic variables in the system. The economic performance variable, therefore, complements the news variable as a control for the economic cues being received by citizens.            "
"27","Current U.S. economic performance was measured using the monthly percent change in the Conference Board's Composite Index of Coincident Indicators. This is an index of four time series chosen by the Conference Board because they are consistently in step with the current state of the economy. The four time series comprising the Coincident Index are employment, personal income, industrial production, and manufacturing/trade sales in 1996 dollars. Using the Coincident Index provides a better measure of economic performance than often used individual series such as Gross Domestic Product, which is released only quarterly and often revised, or unemployment and inflation, which are lagging indicators.5 According to the Conference Board, the Coincident Index is a “broad series that measures aggregate economic activity; thus they define the business cycle” (2001, 13). Again, where the negative economic news measure discussed above gauges what people perceive about various dimensions of the economy, the economic performance measure gauges actual macroeconomic outcomes.            "
"28","Consumer confidence in Figure 1 was measured using the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS). The ICS is constructed from five questions about current and expected personal finance and business conditions.6 It combines both retrospective and prospective evaluations of the economy into a single measure. It should be noted that economic forecasters are so convinced of the importance of consumer sentiment to economic behavior and performance that it is incorporated into virtually all macroeconomic forecasting models. Survey results on consumer sentiment are also routinely reported by the popular press and in the economic news. The success of this approach to forecasting the economy is confirmed by the many other organizations that monitor consumer confidence at the national, state, and local levels in the United States and across the 26 other countries that conduct analogous surveys (Curtin 2000).            "
"29","Personal consumption in Figure 1 was measured using monthly data on U.S. personal spending as reported by the Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. Note that personal consumption expenditures comprise roughly two‐thirds of U.S. gross domestic product. Consumer spending was taken as aggregate monthly real personal consumption expenditures. The data were in real dollars using the chain method.7 These data are publicly available through the FRED web site and database maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/).            "
"30","Interest rates in Figure 1 were measured as the monthly average of the prime interest rate as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Of course, interest rates are an integral part of the market for money in the United States. The supply of money is under the partial control of the Federal Reserve System as it manipulates the federal funds rate through open market operations. However, the prime rate is also determined by the demand for money through borrowing by consumers and businesses.8"
"31","Interest rates are both a determinant and reflection of the economic and political environment affecting the demand for money. A lack of confidence about the economic future should make consumers and businesses more reluctant to spend and borrow, resulting in weaker demand for money and downward pressure on interest rates. As consumers and businesses become more certain about the economic environment, they should be more prone toward spending and borrowing, resulting in stronger demand for money and upward pressure on interest rates. Thus, presidential saber rattling, uncertainty‐inducing events, and expectations of a weak economy should all depress interest rates. In the reverse direction, interest rates should also affect economic behavior and performance and may affect the intensity of presidential saber rattling as well."
"32","Per Figure 1, an events series is also required to take account of exogenous occurrences that might affect the endogenous economic system, as well as the intensity of presidential saber rattling. The criterion for inclusion in the events series was that a crisis or military intervention received intense media attention for a period of a month or more.9 The indicators for the events were constrained to include only the months containing the crisis or military action. The resulting events series included indicators for the start through the end of the following crises and military interventions: the Iran hostage crisis (1979.1–1981.1), Grenada (1983.11), Libyan bombing crisis (1986.3–1986.4), Panama invasion (1989.12), Persian Gulf War (1990.8–1991.2), Somalia (1992.12–1994.3), Haiti (1994.9), Kosovo (1999.3–1999.6), September 11th and the Afghanistan operation (2001.9–2001.12), and the Iraq invasion (2003.3–2003.5).10 These are the major exogenous events through this period which potentially shook consumer confidence, depressed economic activity, and increased presidential saber rattling. The question remains as to whether controlling for these events, presidential saber rattling also significantly affected economic behavior and performance.            "
"33","Of course, the key variable in the analysis is that measuring presidential saber rattling before, during, and after these events. Constructing the measure of presidential saber rattling involved extracting and coding all foreign policy statements from Public Papers of the Presidents from January 1978 through January 2005. First, an electronic file was created that contained the entire Public Papers of the Presidents.11 PERL (Practical Extraction and Report Language) was then used to extract from the Public Papers every sentence relating to foreign policy spoken by the president over this period.12 Keyword searches were used to identify the foreign policy statements. The entire list of 261 keywords and phrases included country names, organizational acronyms, international leaders, and words generally associated with U.S. foreign policy. The complete list of foreign policy keywords is available from the author.            "
"34","Having identified the president's foreign policy statements electronically, the task was then to identify those involving presidential saber rattling. This involved a combination of both machine and human coding. First, PERL was used again to tentatively identify the sentences involving hostile presidential rhetoric. Using PERL, every unique word in the foreign policy sentence file was listed. Human coders then identified keywords and phrases commonly used by the president when engaging in saber rattling. Around 120 words and phrases were identified and validated as saber rattling relevant through manual keyword searches in the foreign policy sentences file. PERL was then used again to extract a new sentence file containing potential instances of presidential saber rattling."
"35","However, in recognition that machine coding techniques are fallible, human coders were again used to validate the results. The machine‐coded file was a starting point that enabled more efficient human identification of presidential saber rattling sentences. Human coders were used to verify that all extracted sentences were relevant and actually constituted presidential saber rattling. They effectively identified all instances where the president talked aggressively toward other nations/actors and/or made specific threats of economic/political sanction or military action.13"
"36","The coded sentences were then aggregated into a monthly count of the president's saber rattling rhetoric. The resulting presidential saber rattling time series is shown in Figure 2. The figure also includes labels above the major crises and events which may have been at the root of some presidential saber rattling. Note that there is a correspondence between the events series and the volume of presidential rhetoric. This suggests that the presidential saber rattling measure has face validity. However, the correspondence is imperfect. There is significant presidential saber rattling during periods when there is no potential military intervention. Additionally, there are military interventions during which significant presidential saber rattling did not occur. For example, during the Grenada and Panama crises the volume of presidential saber rattling did not rise significantly above the noise of general presidential saber rattling. Note also that presidents typically engage in significant saber rattling during the periods prior to and after major foreign policy events. The question addressed here is whether, controlling for these events, presidential saber rattling makes a difference to U.S. economic behavior and performance.            "
"37","                 Presidential Saber Rattling                         "
"38","Having constructed measures of the research concepts in Figure 1, a statistical method was required that treated each relationship as potentially two‐way and also controlled for potential effects due to inertia. Presidential saber rattling may both respond to and cause the other variables, and there may be bidirectional relationships between most other combinations of variables in our system. Additionally, these variables are all subject to inertia.            "
"39","Vector autoregression (VAR) analysis (Freeman, Williams, and Lin 1989; Sims 1980) is ideally suited for modeling such a system. The VAR‐X variant was used to enable including the exogenous events series depicted in Figure 1. VAR modeling has important advantages over the usual regression approach, including the natural treatment of two‐way relations, strong controls for history, and the ability to track the temporal dynamics of relationships through time.            "
"40","Concerning two‐way relations and history, each dependent variable is regressed on multiple lagged values of itself, as well as multiple lagged values of the other variables in the system.14 Including multiple lags of the dependent variable ensures that history is not a confounding cause for found relationships. In interpreting results, the analyst initially evaluates whether variables belong in the VAR system by conducting block exogeneity tests under the null hypothesis that they do not affect any of the other variables in the system. If the null hypothesis of block exogeneity is rejected, then the direction of causal relations for each pair of variables is assessed through both Granger tests and moving average response (MAR) simulations.            "
"41","Granger tests are joint hypothesis tests that blocks of lags associated with particular variables do not improve forecasts of the dependent variable. A significant block of coefficients implies a Granger (1969) causal relationship from the independent variable to the corresponding dependent variable.15 However, as proven by Lutkepohl, “the lack of a Granger‐causal relationship from one group of variables to the remaining variables cannot necessarily be interpreted as a lack of a cause and effect relationship” (1993, 42). This is because Granger tests do not take into account feedback across equations in the system.            "
"42","Including multiple lags of all variables also enables tracking relationships dynamically through time using MAR simulations. Unlike Granger tests, the dynamic simulations take into account feedback across variables that can either suppress or accentuate relationships. Granger tests also contain no evidence about the magnitude or polarity of relationships (positive/negative sign). Using the MAR simulations one can observe the direction, magnitude, polarity, and time path of each relationship. Simulations are accomplished by shocking each variable mathematically to produce an implied response in the other variables in the system. The resulting innovations are orthogonalized using Choleski factorization, because such innovations have the convenient property that they are uncorrelated across both time and equations.16 In this study, confidence intervals for the MAR simulations are calculated using Monte Carlo integration and the fractile method recommended by Sims and Zha (1999). Results of the simulations are reported in matrices of graphs to enable viewing all relationships at the same time.            "
"43","Do the endogenous economic relationships depicted in Figure 1 act as should be expected for a well‐specified model of U.S. economic behavior and performance? Does the events series shown in Figure 1 impinge on these economic relationships? Does it also impinge on presidential saber rattling? Does presidential saber rattling impinge on the endogenous economic relationships? Does presidential saber rattling also respond to the various economic factors? Statistical results for answering these questions are contained in Table 1 and Figure 3.         "
"44","                 Impulse Responses for Saber Rattling‐Economy System                      "
"45","As a preliminary, consider first the block exogeneity tests reported in the first column of numbers in Table 1. These numbers are p‐values from likelihood ratio tests evaluating the null hypothesis that each variable and its lags have no effect on the entire system or its dynamics. These tests uniformly suggest that the variables in Figure 1 are jointly endogenous and belong in the VAR system. With respect to presidential saber rattling, the results (row 1, column 1) show an effect on the system generally. However, the specific nature of the presidential effect requires additional analysis.         "
"46","The next set of columns in Table 1 under the label “Granger Test Dependent Variables” contains p‐values from Granger F‐tests of the null hypothesis that the blocks of lags associated with each independent variable do not improve forecasts of the associated dependent variables. If we exclude the first row and first column under the label “Granger Test Dependent Variables,” then we have a picture of relations among the economic variables. Perceptions of economic news, consumer confidence, personal consumption expenditures, interest rates, and economic performance generally affect one another's forecasts. Relationships run in both directions for most variables. However, Granger tests tell us nothing of the polarity of these relationships or their relative magnitude. These tests can also be deceptive, since they do not account for feedback across variables, or the dynamics of individual responses. Thus, ascertaining the precise nature of these interdependencies requires examining the moving average responses shown in Figure 3.            "
"47","If we exclude the first row and first column of Figure 3, then the remaining graphs provide a summary of relationships in the endogenous economic system. The diagonal set of graphs in Figure 3 shows the variables being shocked in each simulation. The responses are read in the corresponding rows. For example, a simulated one standard error increase in citizens' perceptions of negative economic news (row 2, column 2) produces a sharp decline in consumer confidence (row 2, column 3), lower personal consumption expenditures (row 2, column 4), lower interest rates (row 2, column 5, i.e., less demand for money), and a decline in economic performance (row 2, column 6).            "
"48","Continuing down Figure 3, a one standard error increase in consumer confidence produces less perception of negative economic news, higher personal consumption expenditures, a very small one‐month rise in interest rates (i.e., more demand for money), and a brief increase in economic performance. A one standard error increase in personal consumption expenditures produces a decline in perceptions of negative economic news and higher consumer confidence. It also produces higher interest rates (i.e., more demand for money) and an increase in economic performance. A one standard error increase in interest rates produces more perceptions of negative economic news, lower consumer confidence, less personal consumption, and a decline in economic performance. Finally, a one standard error increase in economic performance produces less perception of negative economic news, greater consumer confidence, no change in personal consumption, and a large increase in interest rates.            "
"49","These results for the economic variables are fully consistent with what we should expect if the theory discussed above is correct. Cues and information from the economic environment affect changes in economic perceptions and behavior. Hearing negative economic news, people decline in their economic confidence. In turn, they are less willing to engage in risky economic behaviors (e.g., consuming and borrowing), but are more willing when the economic news is good. In turn, changes in economic perceptions and behavior consistently affect U.S. economic performance. Further, as suggested by the theory depicted in Figure 1, all of the economic variables are mutually interactive.            "
"50"," Table 1 also contains p‐values for the exogenous events variable included in each of the six VAR equations (row 7). Contrary to Figure 1, they suggest that foreign policy events impinge on the economic variables through only two of the five paths. Critical foreign policy events affect people's perceptions of negative economic news. They also directly affect interest rates (i.e., the demand for money). There is no systematic effect of the specified events on consumer confidence, personal consumption, or economic performance. However, Table 1 and Figure 3 also suggest that there might be indirect effects of events on these variables working through the news and interest rates.            "
"51","Of course, the strongest and most obvious result for events in Table 1 is that for presidential saber rattling. The presence of a foreign policy crisis sharply increases the volume of presidential saber rattling. This result is also obvious from observing the graph in Figure 2, which contains peaks in presidential saber rattling that correspond with the events series. The questions that remain are whether, after controlling for these events, presidential saber rattling either responds to or affects U.S. economic behavior and performance.            "
"52","Interpreting the results in Table 1 and Figure 3, the answer to both questions is yes. Consider first presidential responsiveness to the economic variables. The Granger tests for these relations are in Table 1 under the label “Granger Test Dependent Variables” in the first column. The Granger tests (rows 3 and 5) suggest that changing consumer confidence and interest rates improve forecasts of presidential saber rattling. However, the moving average responses for these variables in Figure 3 (rows 3 and 5, column 1) show that these effects are not very large. Presidents do appear to respond weakly in Figure 3 to perceptions of negative economic news (row 2, column 1), but again the response is not very large. These results dampen conclusions from earlier work suggesting that presidents use foreign policy strategically to divert attention from domestic problems (DeRouen 1995; Fordham 1998a, 1998b, 2002; Gowa 1998; Howell and Pevehouse 2005; James and Oneal 1991; Meernik 1994; Mueller 1970; Ostrom and Job 1986). This study finds only weak support for a “diversionary” theory of presidential saber rattling.            "
"53","In the other direction, the results in Table 1 and Figure 3 reveal significant effects of presidential saber rattling on the five economic variables. The first row of Table 1 under the label “Granger Test Dependent Variables” shows that presidential saber rattling directly affects people's economic confidence. The president's effect on the economic news is also near significant at p = 0.11. However, as noted above, Granger tests provide incomplete information since they do not account for dynamic feedback across variables (e.g., see Lutkepohl 1993, 41–42). Thus, Figure 3 provides a more accurate picture of how presidential saber rattling affects economic behavior and performance.            "
"54","The first row of Figure 3 shows that a one standard error increase in presidential saber rattling (row 1, column 1) produces statistically significant changes in perceptions of economic news, consumer confidence, personal consumption expenditures, interest rates, and economic performance. These direct effects are robust and fairly strong for some variables. The strongest and most enduring effects are for personal consumption expenditures and interest rates (i.e., demand for money). A one standard error shock in presidential saber rattling (about seven threatening remarks in a month) produces a decline in personal consumption expenditures starting about a month later and lasting for about 10 months (row 1, column 4). A one standard error shock in presidential saber rattling also produces less demand for money, resulting in a decline in the prime interest rate lasting about 20 months (row 1, column 5). Perceptions of negative economic news increase for about three months following the shock. Consumer confidence declines for about three months. There is also a decline in economic performance lasting for about four months.            "
"55","Some of these effects are brief and not very large. However, it should also be noted that the simulations in Figure 3understate the effect of presidential saber rattling on economic behavior and performance. This is because they rely on one standard error shocks (about seven hostile remarks) during a single month. Yet, the volume of presidential saber rattling is typically much higher during crisis periods and lasts much longer (see Figure 2). For example, the Persian Gulf War saw presidential saber rattling increase to about 70 hostile remarks per month and was above 30 remarks for four months. The Iran hostage crisis peaked at about 25, Grenada about 20, the Libyan bombing about 30, Somalia about 16, Haiti about 35, Kosovo about 25, September 11th about 30, the Afghanistan invasion about 30, and the Iraq invasion about 25 over an extended period.            "
"56","There are also indirect effects from these changes due to the endogenous nature of the system of economic variables. Direct presidential effects on the economic variables produce ripple effects through the other economic variables. Therefore, the actual effects on economic behavior and performance may have been substantially larger than suggested by the simulations in Figure 3.            "
"57","As the primary foreign policy spokesperson for the United States, the president is ultimately responsible for conducting relations with other nations. Presidential rhetoric and actions directed toward other nations are intended to secure U.S. interests internationally. However, this study shows that they can have unintended domestic consequences. Specifically, presidential saber rattling affects U.S. economic behavior and performance."
"58","In the theoretical section of this research report, an explanation was offered for why presidential saber rattling should affect U.S. economic behavior and performance. The theory posits that economic actors are not fully rational, but must rely on cues from their information environment to inform economic decision making. They make forecasts of the economic future and its relative certainty based on these cues. Economic cues are partially grounded in people's perceptions about the economy. However, elite economic and political actors should also figure into this scheme. Under normal conditions, presidents are a major source of economic cues. However, they are even more so during times of foreign policy crisis. This is due to the saturated news environment and acute attention to presidential activities during such times. Increased presidential saber rattling produces greater uncertainty for economic actors. In turn, they become apprehensive about the economic future and are reluctant to spend and borrow. Since the U.S. economy depends on a continuous flow of consumption and borrowing, such behavioral changes can ultimately affect U.S. economic performance."
"59","The theory was evaluated using time‐series analysis of monthly measures for these concepts from January 1978 through January 2005. A new measure of presidential saber rattling was constructed by coding all foreign policy statements from Public Papers of the Presidents. Saber rattling was hypothesized to impinge on people's perceptions of the economic news, consumer confidence, personal consumption expenditures, interest rates, and economic performance. The statistical results showed that, controlling for foreign policy events, presidential saber rattling affects all of the economic variables. Considering the true volume and duration of presidential rhetoric during a crisis and summing the direct and indirect effects implies a potentially large effect of presidential saber rattling on U.S. economic behavior and performance.         "
"60","More generally, this study advances understanding of how presidential rhetoric affects participants in a democratic system. Past research has shown that under certain conditions presidential rhetoric can alter attention by the media and mass public to various issues (Cohen 1995; Edwards and Wood 1999; Hill 1998; Wood 2007; Wood, Durham, and Owens 2005). This work demonstrates that presidential rhetoric can also alter public attitudes and behaviors. Of course the case examined here is arguably unique in that presidential rhetoric receives “hyper‐coverage” during times of foreign policy crisis, heightening public attention and perhaps magnifying public responses. Additionally, the period of analysis for this study encompasses crises that were important historically. Therefore, future research should map out the range of conditions in which presidential rhetoric can successfully alter public attitudes and behaviors.         "
"61","Future research might also consider whether presidential saber rattling is an effective strategy for securing U.S. interests internationally. Presidents are expected to exhibit leadership in both foreign and domestic policy arenas. As chief foreign policy leader, the president is expected to protect and promote American interests abroad. Rhetoric is a primary tool for accomplishing this end. Yet, there is no research exploring the impact of presidential saber rhetoric on relations with other nations."
"62","The foreign and economic policy dimensions of the president's rhetorical leadership do not function in isolation. The president's foreign policy pronouncements can be destructive as saber rattling results in apprehensive consumers and risk‐averse economic behavior. Therefore, prudent presidential leadership requires cautious foreign policy rhetoric, and careful consideration of the tradeoffs between foreign policy goals and future economic performance."
