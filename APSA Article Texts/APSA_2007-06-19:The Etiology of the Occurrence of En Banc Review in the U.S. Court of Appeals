"1","The decision to grant en banc rehearing is the end product of a complicated process that involves many actors, most critically the judges serving a particular circuit. A majority vote of active judges in a circuit is required to grant review. Our purpose in this article is to explain variation in the frequency of en banc rehearings across circuits and time. As a first step toward that goal we explicate the principal models of judicial behavior and derive their implications for the occurrence of en banc rehearing."
"2","The basis for the so‐called “attitudinal model” of judicial behavior lies in the notion that in making their rulings, judges are driven by their desire to implement their policy preferences into law, subject to the constraints in the case before them. Judicial decisions are thus seen as a result of the intersection of case context (party and issues) and the ideological preferences of the judges (Segal and Spaeth 2002). Myriad studies have supported this model by documenting the operation of policy preferences in the behavior of both Supreme Court justices and the judges of the U.S. Courts of Appeals.            "
"3","Viewed through the lens of the attitudinal model, the decision to grant en banc review reflects the desire of a majority of the judges on a circuit to move a panel outcome closer to its preferred policy position. While the attitudinal model predicts a causal linkage between the ideological makeup of a circuit and the occurrence of en banc review, the nature of that linkage admits at least two possible forms. First, the linkage could be relatively continuous. The attitudinal model predicts that judges whose preferences are in the minority on a circuit will nonetheless vote sincerely (that is, in favor of their most‐preferred outcome) and according to those preferences. When they constitute the majority of a three‐judge panel (that is, on “majority‐minority” panels), such sincere, policy‐based voting will yield an aggregate decision that conflicts with the preferences of the circuit majority—one that is ripe for en banc review. Thus the attitudinal model suggests that the more frequent the occurrence of majority‐minority panels on a circuit, the greater the expected use of en banc review by the circuit majority. By extension, the observed variation in the occurrence of en banc review across time and circuits from the attitudinal perspective may be explained in whole or in part by variation in the ideological heterogeneity of the circuits and the resulting variation in the occurrence of majority‐minority panels."
"4","Second, the linkage between ideological voting and the occurrence of en banc review might reflect shifts in the ideological regimes within circuits. For example, in the 1980s—after majority control of the D.C. Circuit shifted to judges appointed by Republican presidents—Judge Patricia Wald of that circuit complained that “traditionally in our Courts of Appeals, the en banc process has been utilized to test the correctness of new precedents, as soon as they are issued. What is novel in our circuit right now … is the increasing resort to en bancs to overrule venerable, heretofore respected circuit precedents. The shift is plainly a symptom of the rapidly changing makeup of the court” (Banks 1999, n. 91). In this view, then, en banc review is not simply a tool to monitor the current activities of panels, but also an instrument for altering long‐established doctrines and precedents in the circuit to reflect the preferences of the new majority. It is this purported use of en banc review that underlies the controversies surrounding the emergence of Republican‐appointed circuit majorities in the 1980s.            "
"5","The ideological regime change argument thus leads to the expectation of a surge in the occurrence of en banc review following a shift in the ideological control of a circuit. In particular, it suggests that a change in the partisan majority of the circuit (say, from liberal to conservative, or vice versa) should be followed by an increase in the use of en banc review, as the new circuit majority uses the en banc procedure to overturn previous (and now disfavored) circuit precedents. Finally, we should emphasize that the two attitudinal linkages between ideological voting and en banc review are not mutually exclusive. Under this model, variation in the occurrence of en bancs may reflect both variation in the ideological diversity of a circuit and shifts in its ideological regime."
"6","Like the attitudinal model, the strategic model begins with the premise that judges have as a central goal the furtherance of their preferred policy positions. It departs from the attitudinal model by emphasizing that judges pursue their policy preferences in a sophisticated manner—that is, while taking into account the policy preferences of other relevant actors and the institutional context in which the decision is made. While in general evidence for the operation of the strategic model in the Courts of Appeals is mixed (e.g., Blackstone and Navarro 2006; Cross and Tiller 1998; Giles, Walker, and Zorn 2006; but see Hettinger, Lindquist, and Martinek 2004; Klein 2002), the en banc rehearing, which allows the circuit majority to supervise the wayward tendencies of majority‐minority panels, is precisely the type of institutional context the strategic model envisions as eliciting sophisticated behavior to avoid review.9"
"7","This sophisticated behavior can take several forms. Majority‐minority panels may conceal their preferences and conform their decisions to the preferences of the circuit majority, thus avoiding en banc rehearing. Alternatively, minority judges may depart from their preferences to fashion an outcome close enough to the preferred position of the circuit majority that the policy gains to the circuit majority of conducting an en banc rehearing will not offset the associated costs. Finally, the majority‐minority panel may produce a result in which its preferred party wins, but the decision is deeply embedded in the factual context of the case, thus reducing the value of the case as precedent and reducing the likelihood of en banc review (Smith and Tiller 2002).            "
"8","As a result of the potential for sophisticated behavior on the part of judges in the circuit minority, the strategic perspective does not expect that variation in ideological heterogeneity across time, and circuits will translate straightforwardly into variation in the occurrence of en banc rehearings. In fact, given perfect information about the preferences of the judges on the circuit, a simple strategic model predicts that the minority judges controlling panels would always fashion their decisions in ways to avoid en banc review and reversal.10 Of course, information concerning the policy preferences of the judges on a circuit is not perfect. Through the practice of rotating panel memberships, Courts of Appeals judges interact with all other members of the circuit and are likely to have reasonably good but not perfect information about the preferences of their colleagues.11"
"9","The presence of imperfect information can contribute to an increase in the likelihood of an en banc rehearing in two ways. First, the minority judges controlling a panel may be more likely to vote sincerely and risk en banc rehearing because imperfect information results in uncertainty over the distribution of circuit preferences. With perfect information, minority judges know they will lose on en banc rehearing, but imperfect information makes that outcome less certain (and a sincere vote correspondingly more likely). Second, imperfect information may simply yield more errors in prediction by the minority judges. That is, minority judges controlling panels may vote sincerely because less than perfect information leads them wrongly to predict that they have the support of a majority of the circuit judges for their position."
"10","One factor that may affect the quality of information concerning circuit preferences is the stability of the membership of the circuit. In a circuit characterized by stable membership over several years, the judges will have interacted more frequently with their colleagues and thus will have better information about their policy preferences than will be the case in a circuit with high membership turnover and shorter tenures. Thus, whether through greater risk taking or simple prediction errors by minority judges, a strategic perspective leads us to expect that circuits with greater instability in membership will experience a higher frequency of en banc rehearing.12"
"11","Note that to this point our characterization of the strategic model has assumed the existence of a significant degree of ideological disagreement on the circuit in question. In fact, the strategic perspective predicts that membership stability and ideological heterogeneity will interact in their influence on the frequency of en bancs in a circuit. That is, while an attitudinal perspective predicts that en bancs will be more frequent in ideologically heterogeneous circuits than in ideologically homogenous ones, the strategic model suggests that this difference will diminish or even disappear with increases in circuit membership stability. This is because as judges on a circuit serve together longer, their information about the circuit's aggregate preferences improves in accuracy, thus allowing them to better avoid making decisions that might invite en banc review. The negative effect of increases in membership stability on the frequency of en bancs predicted by the strategic model will be exacerbated by greater circuit heterogeneity. The magnitude of that negative effect will be small on ideologically homogeneous circuits—where en bancs are less likely to occur in general—and larger on circuits that are ideologically heterogeneous."
"12","While there is extensive support for the operation of ideological preferences in the lower courts, there is also ample evidence that ideology alone does not control judicial behavior at this level. Judicial ideology, as noted previously, has been linked consistently to the voting of Courts of Appeals judges, but in most of these studies it explains a relatively small percentage of the variation in judicial behavior (cf. Songer and Haire 1992; Songer, Sheehan, and Haire 2000). Even when the traditional measure of judicial ideology, party of the appointing president, is replaced with more sophisticated measures, the percentage of variance explained under the most favorable circumstances does not exceed 20% (Giles, Hettinger, and Peppers 2001). The overwhelming majority of cases at the Courts of Appeals are disposed of without dissent, with judges of all ideological persuasions coming to the same decision. Even Segal and Spaeth (2002), the chief emissaries of the attitudinal school, allow that below the Supreme Court factors other than attitudes may influence the decision making of judges.            "
"13","One set of such factors captured in the operation of the legal model is law and legal reasoning. This view asserts that the high levels of unanimity observed in decisions of the Courts of Appeals arise despite ideological diversity because the application of relatively clear rules to relatively clear factual settings results in a single, clearly appropriate outcome (Edwards 1998). This view is bolstered by the reality that absent agenda controls, the caseload of the Courts of Appeals includes a large number of relatively pro forma cases.            "
"14","In the classic model of legal decision making, the only sources of disagreement between two judges confronted with the same set of case facts are either error in the identification of the appropriate rule or poor legal reasoning. While these sources of disagreement among judges persist in the more contemporary version of the model, its more realistic treatment of the ambiguity of language, the existence of multiple relevant but not controlling precedents, and the flexible nature of legal reasoning, admit to the possibility that competent judges, reasoning well and in good faith, can come to different conclusions regarding the same case (Cross 1997; Edwards 1998). Some of these differences may reflect differences in judicial ideology, but they may also reflect systematic differences in the weights that judges give to precedents from different circuits, approaches to treatment of language, and so forth. In short, judges may simply vary in their practice of the legal model.            "
"15","Quite different expectations regarding the occurrence of en banc review arise if judges of the Courts of Appeals are assumed to be employing the legal model than if they are employing either the attitudinal or the strategic models. First, if a legal model is operative, the likelihood of conflicting legal interpretations and perspectives can be expected to increase as the number of judges on a circuit increases. If there are systematic differences among judges in their application of the legal model, then the likelihood that such differences will arise and produce conflicts increases as the number of judges increases (Abramowicz 2000; Ginsburg and Falk 1991; Howard 1981). Even the Court of Appeals judges interviewed by Wasby (1979) assumed that an increase in the number of judges in a circuit would necessitate an increased need for en banc rehearings.13 Importantly, and in contrast to the models described above, this expectation occurs irrespective of the preferences of the judges on the circuit—that is, in this view it is sheer numbers, rather than ideological heterogeneity, that drive the en banc process.            "
"16","At the same time, organizational considerations suggest that the effect of the number of judges in a circuit on the occurrence of en banc may be nonlinear. As the number of judges on a circuit increases, the costs associated with holding an en banc also rise, and the corresponding benefits to each judge decrease. The more judges involved in an en banc rehearing, the more cumbersome the process (Wasby 1979). Similarly, in their description of en banc hearings in the years immediately preceding the division of the Fifth Circuit, Barrow and Walker (1988) provide a graphic illustration of the difficulties associated with en banc review in circuits with larger numbers of judges. Moreover, not only are en banc rehearings procedurally cumbersome with large numbers of participating judges, but the rewards to the individual judges are also diminished. The larger number of participants means less opportunity for any single judge to impact the outcome significantly. This suggests that while the number of panel‐circuit conflicts may increase geometrically with the number of judges, limited resources and decreasing returns to participation act as a constraint on granting en banc. Thus, the effect of the number of judges in a circuit is expected to be curvilinear, first increasing but subsequently decreasing as the number of judges on the circuit grows.            "
"17","Second, under the legal model we expect that the judges would take seriously the admittedly vague standard for granting review. This standard essentially is that en banc review will be granted to cases raising important or significant issues.14 In general, while the mix of cases varies across circuits, it seems reasonable to assume that the likelihood of important or significant cases will increase with circuit caseload.15 Thus we expect variation in the occurrence of en banc review across time and circuits to be driven by similar variation in circuit caseloads. A positive relationship between caseloads and the use of en banc may also reflect organizational realities. The stress of higher caseloads may simply yield more errors by three‐judge panels in need of correction through en banc (Abramowicz 2000).            "
"18","We analyze the expectations derived from the models described above using data on the incidence of en banc rehearings across all 12 circuits of the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the period from 1942—the year after the Supreme Court's validation of the use of en banc—through 1999, inclusive.16 Our central variable of interest is the incidence of en banc cases in each circuit in each year. To measure the number of en banc cases, we identified the judges sitting in a circuit in a given year and used Lexis‐Nexis to search for cases containing combinations of four of the judges' names. We then examined the cases generated by this search to see if each qualified as an en banc. In doing so, our threshold for inclusion was broad; essentially, any case decided by more than three judges was included in the list. We repeated this process for each circuit/year using different combinations of judges' names. Depending on the number of judges in the circuit, the number of combinations searched ranged from six to more than a dozen. Only in the circuit/years with a small number of judges did we examine all possible combinations of judges.17"
"19","The result of this process is, we believe, the first definitive, comprehensive list of cases decided en banc in the U.S. Courts of Appeals between 1942 and 1999, inclusive. Figure 1 plots the annual number of such cases for each of the 12 circuits. En bancs were comparatively rare in the 1940s and 1950s, averaging only one or two per circuit per year. They increase significantly throughout the 1960s and 1970s, attaining their highest number shortly after the division of the Fifth Circuit in 1981; since then, their numbers have remained more or less constant at six or seven per circuit per year on average.         "
"20","                 En Banc Rehearings by Circuit and Year, 1942–1999                      "
"21","Both the attitudinal model and the strategic model lead to the expectation that the ideological composition of a circuit will influence the frequency with which en banc rehearings occur. Assessing these expectations requires that we have measures of the ideological preferences of judges and that we know the composition of each circuit for each year in the study."
"22","The party of the appointing president has traditionally been the measure employed to estimate the ideological preferences of lower federal court judges. Judges appointed by Democratic presidents are assumed to be more liberal than those appointed by Republican presidents, an assumption well supported by empirical evidence.18 We accordingly employ the party of the appointing president, as obtained from the Courts of Appeals biographical database, as our measure of judicial ideology.19"
"23","The appointment and departure dates for each judge are also available in the biographical database. Thus for each year it is relatively easy to determine if a judge is sitting on a Court of Appeals. The only difficulty comes when judges are appointed and/or leave during the year. In these instances the seats may remain vacant throughout the year, may remain vacant most of the year, or may be filled almost immediately. Moreover, the vacancy may occur early in the year or at the very end of the year. To address these issues we adopted the rule that if any judges served less than six months in a calendar year they were treated as not serving in that year. So if judges retired, took senior status or died before June, or were appointed after July of a year, those judges were treated as not serving in that year.20"
"24","To measure ideological heterogeneity, we identified circuits in each year as having either a majority of judges appointed by a Democratic president, a majority appointed by a Republican president, or an equal partisan division.21 We used standard combinatorial formulae to determine the number of possible majority‐minority three‐judge panels (i.e., majority Democratic panels in Republican majority circuits and majority Republican panels in majority Democratic circuits) expected to occur in each circuit/year given the number of majority and minority judges actively serving.22 Dividing the number of majority‐minority panels by the total number of possible three‐judge panels in each circuit/year yields the expected proportion of all possible three‐judge panels in a circuit/year that are majority‐minority panels; an alternative interpretation of this measure is as the probability that a randomly constituted panel will be majority‐minority in that circuit/year. It ranges from 0—for a circuit that in a given year has either one or no minority judges, and hence no possibility of majority‐minority panels—to 0.5, indicating that a circuit is evenly divided between judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents.23"
"25","Partisan regime change was coded 1 in the year when the majority of the judges appointed to a circuit shifted from one party to the other and 0 in all other circuit/years. In the simplest case, regime change occurs when a circuit that in the previous year had consisted of a majority of judges appointed by Republican (Democratic) presidents, in the current year has a majority of judges appointed by Democratic (Republican) presidents. A somewhat more complex pattern occurs when a circuit moves from having a majority of judges appointed by presidents of one party one year to an even balance of partisan appointments. Since an evenly divided court cannot change circuit law, this condition is not treated as a regime change. From this “neutral” position, a regime change could only occur if in a subsequent year the majority of the judges on the circuit are appointed by presidents of the party opposite to that controlling before the court became equally balanced. Thus, a regime change is only recorded when a shift in the partisan majority on a circuit is completed."
"26","The strategic approach leads us to expect that increases in the stability of circuit membership will dampen the positive effects of ideological heterogeneity on the frequency of en banc rehearings. Drawing on Zuk, Barrow, and Gryski (1996), we computed the length of service for each judge in each circuit and include a variable which measures the years of service for the judge with the median tenure.         "
"27","Our measure of the number of judges on each circuit relies on Zuk, Barrow, and Gryski (1996); those data allow us to compute the actual number of judges sitting on a circuit in any given year. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts provides the authorized number of judgeships per circuit, but given vacancies, the actual number of judges sitting provides a better measure of the potential for simple disagreement and of the difficulties associated with conducting en banc rehearings. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts' data on the numbers of cases disposed of on hearing or submission provides our base measure of caseload. This figure is the number of cases actually resolved after significant investment of resources by the judges of the circuit. Following standard practice, we employ the natural log of caseload in the analysis (e.g., Maddala 1983).            "
"28","During this time period two relevant structural changes occurred in the Courts of Appeals. First, in 1978 Congress passed the Omnibus Judgeship Act, which included a provision allowing “mini” en bancs in circuits with more than 15 judges. Such mini en bancs consist of 10 randomly selected judges plus the Chief Judge of the circuit. As noted earlier, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit adopted this innovation in August 1980, but the first mini en banc rehearings did not occur until 1981 (Hellman 1990). To date, no other circuit has followed the lead of the Ninth Circuit in adopting this procedure. The expected effect of this change on the incidence of en banc under the various models is uncertain.24 Nonetheless, we create a dummy variable to capture the effects of the adoption of the mini en banc by the Ninth Circuit. This variable is equal to 0 for every year through 1980 and 1 for 1981 and each following year. Second, in 1981 Congress created the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit by dividing the previous Fifth Circuit. We include a dummy variable to test the effect of this dramatic shift on the Fifth Circuit. Our Fifth Circuit split variable is equal to 0 for all other circuits. For the Fifth, it is equal to 0 for each year up to and including 1981 and 1 for 1982 and each following year. Data for the Eleventh Circuit are treated as missing in the years prior to 1982.            "
"29","We provide descriptive statistics for all variables and summarize the expectations for the attitudinal, strategic, and legal/organizational models in Table 1. Note that the key test between the attitudinal and strategic models comes in our expectation vis‐à‐vis the interaction of Median Circuit Tenure and the probability of a Majority‐Minority Panel: under the strategic account, this interaction ought to be strongly negative, while attitudinal theory suggests that its effect be undifferentiated from 0.            "
"30","Our data are cross‐sectional time‐series data, representing 12 circuits over periods of 18 to 58 years. Our dependent variable is a count variable that ranges from 0 to 29, with the majority of observations falling in the range from 0 to 11. The nature of these data leads us to employ the method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) (Zorn 2001), assuming a conditional Poisson distribution for our measure of en banc counts; we adopt an AR(1) specification for the conditional within‐unit covariance matrix. We also include fixed effects for each of the 12 circuits, with the First Circuit omitted for identifiability; these serve as controls for circuit‐level factors (e.g., differences in case mix) not expressly incorporated in the model.25 For example, some circuits have a practice of informally circulating opinions among all the judges on the circuit for comments and suggestions. This could have the effect of reducing the need for en banc review.26 We report our model estimates in Table 2.         "
"31","We begin our discussion with the variables capturing organizational changes in the Courts of Appeals.1 With respect to those changes, it is interesting to note that the one most closely associated with circuit workload issues—the division of the Fifth Circuit—appears to exhibit no influence on the rate of en bancs. In the years prior to its division the Fifth Circuit averaged 5.5 en bancs per year. In the years since the division it has averaged 10.4 per year.28 This difference in frequency, however, declines and becomes statistically insignificant once the other variables in the model are taken into account. In contrast, the presence of the limited en banc procedure in the Ninth Circuit seems to have increased the frequency of en bancs. In the era without the mini en banc the Ninth Circuit averaged 3.2 en banc rehearings per year, compared to 9.9 after the procedure was adopted. The results in Table 2 indicate that this mean difference was largely attributable to changes in the other variables included in the model, but even with such factors as increases in caseload and the number of judges controlled, the mini en banc appears to have increased the frequency of en banc hearings in the Ninth Circuit.         "
"32","Our variables corresponding to the legal/organizational explanation (that is, caseload and number of judges) were expected to exert a positive influence on the number of en banc rehearings. These expectations are strongly supported by the empirical results. Not surprisingly, caseload is highly related to the occurrence of en bancs; within the ranges of our data, an increase of 1,000 cases in a circuit's annual caseload yields an expected increase of roughly two en banc rehearings. The magnitude of the effect for circuit size is similar, but is as expected, curvilinear; the predicted number of en bancs increases as the number of judges in a circuit goes from four to 15, then decreases. With the other variables in the model set at their means, this corresponds to an increase in the expected number from four to six, with a subsequent decrease back to four. Since the effect of a higher number of judges on the circuit is significant with both attitudinal and strategic variables controlled, this result provides support for the operation of nonideological, legal differences among the judges in their decisions regarding granting en banc review."
"33","We tested two variables for evidence of attitudinal influences on the number of en banc rehearings. The effect for the first indicator of ideological influence, regime change, fails to achieve statistical significance. Given the accounts in the literature of increased en banc usage to accomplish the policy goals of a new regime, we explored this relationship in considerable detail. First, we created two new indicators of regime change that capture changes in the frequency of en bancs occurring not only in the year of regime change, as does our original measure, but also changes occurring one and two years afterwards. These measures allow for the possibility that a new ideological majority may not immediately exploit its position.29 The effect of neither of these alternative measures was statistically significant when substituted for our original measure.         "
"34","Second, existing speculation on the effect of ideological regime changes focuses almost exclusively on the shift in partisan regimes in the Reagan/Bush era to provide evidence for its operation. To determine if regime change, while not operative across the full time range of the study, was nonetheless operative in the Reagan/Bush era, we estimated regime change effects separately for the Reagan/Bush era by creating a dummy variable for the appropriate years, multiplying it by the existing regime change variable and adding it to the equation in Table 2. We employed a variety of time periods to capture the Reagan/Bush era, but regardless of the specific operationalization, the coefficient for the interaction term was nonsignificant.30 These results suggest that our findings with regard to the lack of effect for regime change on the frequency of en bancs are generally robust.         "
"35","The second attitudinal variable, ideological heterogeneity, performed as anticipated. The expected number of en banc rehearings increases as the likelihood of a majority‐minority panel increase. Conditional on holding circuit tenure constant at 0, the expected number of en banc hearings in an evenly divided circuit is 2.1 times higher than in a circuit with zero or one minority judges. As explained below, however, this interpretation of the direct effect of ideological heterogeneity is misleading given the inclusion in the model of an interaction effect between median tenure and ideological heterogeneity. Similarly, the statistical insignificance of the strategic variable, median tenure, is also misleading in the presence of the interaction term."
"36","A more useful interpretation focuses on the joint effects of heterogeneity, median circuit tenure, and the interaction of the two. Figure 2 provides a graphical interpretation of the influences of these variables. The contour plot shows the expected number of en banc rehearings against these two variables over their ranges in the data, holding the other covariates constant at the means (for continuous variables) or medians (for discrete covariates). Lighter regions correspond to lower expected numbers of en bancs, while darker regions indicate higher numbers. Consistent with the strategic perspective, if the probability of a majority‐minority panel is 0, then the expected number of en banc rehearings stays nearly constant, regardless of how stable the membership of the circuit is. Conversely, if the probability of a majority‐minority panel is high (that is, if the circuit is almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans), the predicted count of en banc rehearings is highly responsive to circuit tenure, with increases in circuit stability yielding substantial decreases in the occurrence of en banc rehearings. Similarly, when median tenure is low, the predicted count of en bancs increases substantially with increases in the probability of a majority‐minority panel. As circuit tenure increases past about 12 years, however, the relationship grows less positive, and above that level of tenure the expected number of en banc rehearings actually begins to decrease as a function of circuit heterogeneity. This last result should be taken with some caution; only about 13% of the circuit/years included in the study have median tenure greater than 12 years, and of those 70% occur prior to 1960. Thus, the slight negative effect identified for ideological heterogeneity at high levels of tenure rests on a relatively small and temporally specific portion of the data examined.         "
"37","                 Predicted Counts of En Bancs, by Circuit Heterogeneity and Tenure                      "
"38","The findings for these variables are thus generally consistent with the strategic account of en banc occurrences. That is, while our results suggest that ideological heterogeneity plays an important part in determining the frequency of en banc rehearings in a circuit, they also indicate that its effects are tempered by a consciousness of the preferences and likely behaviors of the other members of the circuit. Importantly, these effects persist even in the face of controls for legal and organizational factors, lending support to the idea that en banc review occurs at least in part as a result of strategic calculi."
"39","The U.S. Courts of Appeals are increasingly significant policymakers within the American political system. While their use of three‐judge panels allows for tremendous efficiencies, it also raises the possibility of decisions and policy outcomes that do not reflect the views of a majority of the judges on a circuit. Rehearing of a panel decision by the members of the circuit sitting en banc is the one procedure by which the circuit majority may monitor panel decisions. In the face of steadily declining numbers of decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and the high levels of contentiousness over many Court of Appeals decisions, the importance of en banc review is arguably greater than it has ever been in history."
"40","Our work here is the first comprehensive, large‐scale study of the phenomenon of en banc review in the U.S. Courts of Appeals.31 In doing so, we have assembled the most comprehensive data to date on the incidence of en banc review, finding that the frequency with which en banc rehearings have occurred varies significantly across both time and circuits. Drawing from the attitudinal, strategic, and legal/organizational perspectives on individual judicial behavior, we developed a set of integrated expectations regarding the causes of this macrolevel variation. While the significance of fixed effects for the circuits indicates that we have not captured all the factors at work, the findings of our analysis are consistent with the operation of all three models.         "
"41","Our results are clearly consistent with the operation of legal and organizational considerations in the use of en banc review: en bancs are more likely to occur with increases in caseload and the corresponding increase in numbers of cases meeting the threshold of importance and the stresses of workload pressure likely to produce errors. The frequency of en bancs also increased with the number of judges assigned to a circuit and hence, the likelihood of conflicting legal approaches increased. At the same time, the nonlinearity of this effect suggests that the judges may be deterred somewhat from employing the en banc process as the size of the circuit grows and the process becomes more cumbersome and costly. Whether this finding of nonlinearity supports a decision to divide circuits and reduce their size depends in part on whether one believes that there are cases that should be granted en banc review that are currently denied because of the constraint of size."
"42","Our findings also provide evidence that variation in the use of en bancs across circuits and time is linked to variation in the ideological heterogeneity of the circuits. The influence of ideological considerations on the use of en banc has been a point of considerable controversy, but to date the evidence on this issue has been mixed. By contrast, our results leave little doubt that variation in the ideological heterogeneity of the circuits affects the frequency with which en bancs occur. In general, we find the greater the ideological heterogeneity on a circuit, the higher the frequency of en bancs. However, we also uncover clear evidence that the effects of ideological factors are conditioned by strategic considerations. As the median tenure in circuits increases and judges' information on majority preferences becomes clearer, the linkage between circuit ideological heterogeneity and the frequency of en bancs is diminished. This suggests that judges in the minority on a circuit—given good information about the preferences of the majority—modify their panel behavior in response to avoid en banc rehearing. Evidence on the operation of the strategic model in the Courts of Appeals is mixed, and the context of en banc rehearing may constitute a “most likely” test of the operation of the model, but our results indicate that the model passes the test."
"43","It has also been suggested that, particularly in the Reagan/Bush era, new partisan majorities on a circuit have employed en bancs to reshape the law of the circuit in accord with their policy preferences. In fact, our analysis finds no evidence of such a phenomenon, either across the full range of data considered or within the Reagan/Bush era alone. However, this result does not mean that Judge Wald's complaint about such a use of en bancs by the new partisan majority in her court was unfounded. First, such partisan ideological behavior could have resulted in an increased use of en bancs in some circuits and for some regime changes, including the one associated with her remarks; our results simply demonstrate that such behavior was not sufficiently systematic to be detected in a large‐scale aggregate analysis. Second, new majorities may have systematically used en bancs to adjust established circuit policy to reflect their preferences, but if such cases replaced other, perhaps less partisan cases on the agenda for en banc—that is, if the change was one of the substance and not the frequency of en banc cases—that change would not be detectable here."
"44","Our results thus place the controversy concerning the ideological use of en bancs by Republican circuit majorities in the Reagan/Bush era in a somewhat different light. While such usage may have been more blatant during this period or more openly discussed, our evidence suggests that the influence of ideology on the use of en banc during the 1980s was not unique, but instead is part of a long‐standing, general pattern that has typified the Courts of Appeals since the practice was adopted in 1942."
"45","Finally, our results provide a rare look at discretionary agenda setting in the Courts of Appeals. Studies of agenda setting at the Supreme Court have generally concluded that the decision to grant certiorari is a mixture of legal, strategic, and attitudinal factors (Caldeira, Wright, and Zorn 1999; Epstein and Knight 1998; Segal and Spaeth 2002). Our results suggest that the use of en banc review in the Courts of Appeals is conditioned by a similar mixture of considerations. At the same time, it is evident by the variation in the use of en banc left unexplained by those factors that additional work needs to be done. In particular, the importance of the circuit‐level effects suggests that circuit‐specific contextual norms and practices are also at work in determining the use of the en banc procedure.32"
