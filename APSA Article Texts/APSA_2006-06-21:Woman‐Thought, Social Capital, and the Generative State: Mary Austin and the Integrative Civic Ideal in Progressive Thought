"1","In the traditional narrative of American citizenship, work, gender, and suffrage are deeply connected themes. From colonial times forward, productive labor was considered a precondition for full citizenship because it was thought to confer independence, dignity, and moral worth (Banning 1978; Shklar 1991; Wilentz 1984). These qualities were absolutely essential for a self‐governing citizenry determined to protect individual rights and liberties against potential abuses by those in power. For much of the nineteenth century, this civic ideal was accompanied by the “ideology of separate spheres” that reserved the world of work and politics for men and the home for women. These narratives were built upon the underlying assumptions of a unitary domestic sovereign and a polity spatially ordered by clearly demarcated public and private realms (Baker 1984; Kerber 1998; VanBurkleo 2001; Welter 1966). However, by the end of the nineteenth century, economic, social, and political disruptions had destabilized these cornerstones of traditional American citizenship.         "
"2","One of the responses of American intellectuals to the rapid and widespread changes of the late nineteenth century was a fear of social and political fragmentation. Unprecedented industrialization combined with economic depression fueled conflicts between labor and capital, record immigration prompted nativism and fears of hyphenation, urbanization threatened the cultural norms and moral order that had been preserved by small communities. African Americans continued to press for full inclusion into the polity, cultural elites expressed alienation from a growing mass consumer society, and, for some, the suffrage movement threatened the home and family—the very foundation of the nation. Further, these macro‐level phenomena were paralleled by individual expressions of concern over the integrity of the self. Many upper‐ and middle‐class Americans wrote of the experience of fragmentation, detachment, liminality, double‐consciousness, and alienation (Conn 1983; Lasch 1965; Lears 1981; Stansell 2000; Wiebe 1967). As Adolph Reed, Jr. demonstrates, citing examples from W. E. B. Du Bois, Henry Adams, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Jane Addams, and others “the sense of fragmentation was widespread among the educated elite” (1997, 109).         "
"3","As nineteenth‐century systems of order shattered, early twentieth‐century progressives sought to create their world anew—both culturally and politically. Culturally, new sources of order were needed to replace the dwindling authority of community institutions and the norms of “genteel” Victorian society (Conn 1983; Lasch 1965; Lears 1981; Stansell 2000; Wiebe 1967). Politically, unprecedented state action was required to alleviate the social ills that accompanied industrialization (Eisenach 1994; Kloppenberg 1986; Smith 1997). Further, advocates of woman suffrage and cultural pluralists demanded the inclusion of new constituencies to full citizenship. Thus, turn‐of‐the‐century moderns, feminists, and progressives were all motivated to create a new, inclusive, and integrative conception of democratic citizenship.         "
"4","The entrance of the United States into World War I accelerated the movement towards suffrage and the concomitant effort to prepare women for the vote. Mary Austin's The Young Woman Citizen (1918) was one of the many works dedicated to this project. In 1913–14, the Civics Society of Chicago published a 12‐volume series edited by Shailer Mathews entitled The Woman Citizen's Library: A Systematic Course of Reading in Preparation for the Larger Citizenship. Also published in 1918 were Mary Sumner Boyd's The Woman Citizen and Helen Ring Robinson'sPreparing Women for Citizenship. A year later, Horace Hollister'sThe Woman Citizen: A Problem in Education entered the market.         "
"5","Reprinted only once in 1920, Austin's text failed to find an audience and was not reprinted again until 1976. Despite this later reprinting, Austin's book has largely been mischaracterized and underestimated in the contemporary secondary literature as well.1 Austin describes her text as a “working philosophy of citizenship”, distinguishing it from the host of other handbooks published in the postwar years (foreword, emphasis added).2 Two book reviews and evidence from Austin's correspondence suggest that this aspect of her text contributed to the difficulty in attracting an audience. In 1918, a reviewer for The Outlook wrote, “This book is not a manual for the new voter, as might be assumed from the title, but is an interesting and pertinent contribution to the sociological discussion of the time. Its thoughtful chapters can be read with profit by women of all ages and by men too.” After reprinting Austin's conception of the work as presented in the book's foreword, a review in The New York Times, 2 February 1919, warns its readers against confusing her text with more general “handbooks” and emphasizes both its philosophic character and its “call to service … to the young women of America.”         "
"6","Evidence from Austin's correspondence echoes this theme. In a 1923 response to Austin, in which it appears that she has requested the opportunity to revise the text, the editor‐in‐chief of The Womans Press, Rhoda E. McCulloch, argues that the remaining books in stock preclude a new edition. She writes, “It seems to me that your program is sound in thinking that the book ought to be made to carry a more final expression on the subject for the time in which we are living … I do feel that with citizenship for women in the earlier stages it will be difficult to get attention to books in which the subject is developed from a more or less philosophical point of view” (AU 5345).3 In the same year, Robert Ezra Park, the renowned sociologist of the University of Chicago, wrote,         "
"7","                        "
"8","I have finished reading the Young Woman Citizen. It is certainly an unusual book for the Y.W.C.A. to publish and has led a higher opinion of that organization than I have held up to this time. It is, with its wide implications, an unusual book for anyone to publish for the edification of young citizens. I can not believe that it is going to be fully understood and appreciated until a great deal more has been written for older and wiser people in regard to the questions that it raises. (AU 4275)4"
"9","As these examples indicate, Austin's text—with its title and publisher—challenges the traditional expectations regarding the substance appropriate for the presumed audience of young women citizens. In addition, the essay advances a unique argument for women's full inclusion in political life, one that departs from both of the standard scripts used in the women's movement of the period—the equal rights approach and the virtue‐based, gender‐difference argument. “Weary of being pulled into standardized arguments,”Austin walks her own way and reframes the traditional gender‐difference argument in terms of women's intellect (1932, 327). Thus, what Austin would undoubtedly see as one of her achievements—the profound difficulty of categorizing her commitments—actually may have proven to be a significant obstacle to the reception of her work. In its novelty and sophistication, Austin's text bridges two literatures that otherwise might be more distinct—the emerging scholarly literature on modern democratic citizenship and that on women's suffrage.         "
"10","In keeping with other progressives, such as John Dewey and Arthur Bentley, Austin aims to blur the strict and artificial separation between the public and private and to integrate the individual into the larger social fabric of groups that comprise the nation. The segregation of public and private life, upon which gender inequality was mapped, was problematic not only because it justified the exclusion of women, but also because it devalued the very concept of the citizen. Austin argues that the discursive and legal practices of cordoning off the public from the private result in norms that establish one set of characteristics as acceptable for private life and another for public service. Economics and politics become segregated such that the private individual need not act like a citizen. The virtues of the private life countenance the free roaming of private interest, so long as it does not break the letter of the law, and thereby cheapens public life (31). These divergent standards of virtue weaken the polity and divide the citizen."
"11","Austin sought to preserve difference, but in a manner that allowed for both unity and the flourishing of the individual. Taking nature as her model, Austin argues, “The whole tendency of nature is toward variety,” from which it follows that the goal of a politics dedicated towards progress must be openness to such diversity. The natural ideal demonstrates that “the tendency of natural growth is always toward form, but without fixity, the flowing shape of a fountain, of an elm tree, infinitely variable and airy and recognizable” (69). Further, she warns, “Any attempt to prevent differences from becoming acute by abolishing flags of difference is a denial of the whole idea of social evolution” (98). To attain this ideal, Austin looks to two overarching concepts: society and mind. Together these provide the basis for uniting individuals while still maintaining respect for difference."
"12","Austin defines politics as “the progressive practice of social relations” (11) or the “technique of living together” (30). In a teleological vision of social life, Austin depicts the development of society as a continually rising and broadening spiral staircase where the measure of progress is “in the degree of voluntary participation by the members of the group, in group affairs” (4). Thus, women's full inclusion into public life was necessary to national development. Austin's choice of an architectural metaphor is also instructive. During this period, many of the antisuffragists argued that the destruction of the state and the family would follow women's entrance into politics. In contrast, Austin's metaphor underscores the conventionality of politics.5"
"13","For Austin, politics is a practice, an art, a craft. While those in positions of power must draw upon scientific expertise whenever possible, there is no certainty in political life (49). Austin claims that “the search of today is not for a fixed frame of living, but for the principle of elasticity” (30). She asserts that there is no “absolute criterion of social welfare” because “the element which differentiates the human group from all others is the necessity for living with, for taking into account, the unknowable” (29, 30). The fluidity and contingencies of social life, as Austin conceives it, recommend a new civic ideal."
"14","A well‐functioning polity must be comprised of flexible citizens capable of adaptation and improvisation. And, in an ideal society, all individuals would participate in civic life. Much like Jane Addams and John Dewey, Austin advocates a graduated program of civic education in which the individual's social responsibilities increase at each stage of development and interaction with the wider world."
"15","Based upon a strict separation of the public and the private, the Founders had argued that vigilance was the foremost civic virtue. The oft repeated phrase “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty” pointed to the necessity of a citizenry educated such that they could identify and defend against ambitious leaders intent upon abusing the public trust of power. In contrast, Austin defines public‐spiritedness as “a state of continuous awareness of the extent to which other people are involved in everything we do, and of their right to be considered” (32). Watchfulness remains the key sense, but the citizen's eye must now pan the whole social spectrum rather than remaining focused on the state. Thus, one's social responsibility or public‐spiritedness develops proportionately with one's private interests."
"16","The purpose is to create an integrated standard of citizen behavior. Austin's program of education blurs the rigid boundaries that separate the public and private, mitigates the conflicts that emerge between the individual and the group, and fosters a sense of mutuality and interdependence. Paraphrasing John Dewey's treatment of this central component of progressive thinking, Taylor explains, “In a free society, where all are equally able to ‘find out what one is fitted to do and to secure an opportunity to do it,’ the dualism between our inner and outer lives, our social and private lives, dissolves; and this, Dewey assures us, is the ‘key to happiness’” (2004, 53).         "
"17","However, the turn of the century was not characterized by such opportunity. Race, gender, and class hierarchies ordered the polity as much as the spatial demarcation between the public and private. In response, cultural pluralists like Horace Kallen and Randolph Bourne and critical race theorists like W. E. B. Du Bois used race and ethnicity as key concepts in their theorizing of new models of citizenship. As a feminist and advocate of suffrage, Mary Austin employed gender in both her critique and in her reconstitution of the polity. In much the same way that Austin uses the concept of society to transcend the traditional spatial ordering of the polity, she turns to mind or intellect as a means of eclipsing the rigid, gendered boundaries of public and private."
"18","By the turn of the century, suffrage activists had launched a new phase in their continuing campaign for the vote. Whereas the antebellum movement had drawn upon the language of the Declaration of Independence and its mooring in natural rights, postbellum activists increasingly turned to a gender‐difference argument that sought to secure the vote on the basis of women's biological and cultural distinctiveness. In the first and second decades of the twentieth century, progressivism revitalized the suffrage movement and contributed to an increasingly rich milieu of ideas and activists (Cott 1987; Stansell 2000). This fertile plain nourished a wide variety of suffrage arguments, both principled and pragmatic, rights and difference based. Furthermore, it was quite common for authors in the popular press to appeal to several different justifications in the same essay (Brown 1995, 187).         "
"19","Despite this diversity, one of the most distinctive features of this stage of the suffrage movement was the rise of the gender‐difference argument. Suffragists of the period needed to normalize their image (Graham 1995) in order to mobilize large numbers of women in a fairly hostile ideological environment—the conservative frame of the traditional gender‐difference argument met this need. The maternalist rhetoric of this later generation of activists gained further support from contemporary sociology, anthropology, and evolutionary theory (Brush 1996; Ladd‐Taylor 1995; Matthews 2003; Menand 2001; Smith 1997; VanBurkleo 2001) while also hearkening back to the older ideologies of separate spheres and the Cult of True Womanhood (Kerber 1980; Kraditor 1965; Welter 1966). As Brush describes it, “Maternalism is feminism for hard times” (1996, 431). In the early twentieth century, the gender‐difference argument was feminism fit for progressivism, and thereby activists hoped, success.         "
"20","The backbone of the mainstream gender‐difference argument for suffrage was comprised of a two‐pronged challenge to the traditional public/private split in American politics: it obliquely questioned orthodox gender roles while it attacked head‐on the conventional sphere of state action. More specifically, it drew upon women's moral authority as mothers and homemakers in order to expand their public role, gain access to the political sphere, and secure the right to vote (usually for reform) and other governmental protections (Baker 1984; Kraditor 1965; Mink 1995; Nackenoff 1999; Skocpol 1992). In the most general of formulations, the conventional role of women authorized the expansion of their responsibility. But, suffragists also grounded their arguments for the vote on essentialist qualities such as women's maternal instincts and nurturing traits (Kraditor 1965; Matthews 2003; VanBurkleo 2001). In either case, the dominant message conveyed by those deploying the gender‐difference argument was that women's virtue qualified them for a larger public role.         "
"21","As scholars have noted, where the discourse of difference initially universalized the experience of motherhood as a means of uniting women, it also drove a wedge between middle‐class and working‐class women. The emphasis on virtue was used by middle‐class white women to distinguish their own (superior) claims to citizenship from those of working women, immigrants, and women of color.6Nackenoff writes, “Egalitarianism was supplanted by the politics of virtue … Women argued their claim to citizenship by contrasting their virtue with the corruption and greed of a male‐dominated economy and polity. They argued their virtue by contrast with that of the foreign‐born immigrant, and with the level of civilization enfranchised African‐American males had attained” (1999, 166). In addition, the assumption of leisure essentially stripped working‐class women of a powerful source of authority in public debate, institutionalized relationships of dependency, and reified hierarchies of citizenship as middle‐class white women became the administrators of programs for the working poor (Brush 1996; Muncy 1991; Nackenoff 1999, 2001). But, the gender‐difference argument also provided the foundation for labor protections that shielded working women from some of the worst consequences of fierce economic competition (Cott 1987; Sarvasy 1997; VanBurkleo 2001).         "
"22","Among middle‐class white women, the emphasis on virtue had drawbacks for the most ambitious. In its strongest forms, the gender‐difference argument essentialized women on the basis of their biology. The prominence of women's bodies in maternalist rhetoric intensified the traditional dualism that relegated women to the emotional realm while reserving the intellectual for men. Thus, one of the implications of maternalist rhetoric was that it overburdened middle‐class white women with the expectation of superior virtue, where virtue was generally understood not as expertise, but as a sentimental and moral trait. This, in turn, diminished women's claims to intellectual equality and thereby created a significant obstacle for professional women. Not surprisingly, an equal rights approach remained appealing among many of these women."
"23","If the traditional gender‐difference argument did value women's historic cultural role, acknowledge women's biological difference and sexuality, and support state policies to protect women; it did not affirm an equal place for women in public life. Several contemporary scholars have argued that the short‐term success of the vote was significantly diminished by the long‐term costs that resulted from the emphasis on difference in maternalist rhetoric (McDonagh 1999; Skocpol 1992). Coursing through this secondary literature is a hint of longing for what might have been had an equal rights justification for inclusion prevailed among turn‐of‐the‐century suffragists. As McDonagh states, “The significant aspect of this model of legitimation was to preserve women's informal, rather than formal, political status in the form of privileging women's private maternal roles as benefiting political society rather than women's formal political roles” (1999, 167).7 What makes the “sameness” argument so attractive is its power in equalizing the terms of citizenship. Yet, it was motherhood that proved to be the real monkey wrench.         "
"24","By the turn of the century, access to higher education and voluntary organizations had opened up new opportunities for middle‐class white women, but productive, professional labor was largely reserved for single women. Women advanced into the public sphere, but the conflict between work and womanhood, mind and body, still ruled out the possibility of both a career and a family for most of these women.8 One potential result of this conflict was a fragmentation of the self. One could pursue the satisfactions of productive work only by sacrificing the intimacies that grew out of reproductive labor. When framed in terms of virtue, the gender‐difference argument accentuated these dualities and intensified women's identification with the home.         "
"25","Against this background, Mary Austin's approach is striking because it reframes the traditional gender‐difference argument to focus upon women's intellect rather than their virtue or feelings. Mary Austin's advice to young women is that if they are going to be effective in politics, they must begin with an honest assessment of themselves and what they offer to the nation. To do this, women need a boost of courage because the long‐entrenched custom of measuring women by a male standard has taken a toll on women's confidence in their own traits and methods. She writes, “Unconsciously this age‐long habit so colors all our thinking, that the first thing that the woman citizen must ask herself is whether she is coming to her new obligation as another, less experienced man, or whether she has anything to contribute as a woman” (16). Austin's own reply is unequivocal—she argues that women's unique intellect, or the character of “woman thought,” justifies their full inclusion."
"26","For Austin, the primary problem is that women's traits have been mischaracterized—as sentimental rather than intellectual—and their value to the polity diminished by the strict separation of the public and private. She argues that this spatial conception of society is misguided and disparages the household: “It was part of our two‐mindedness about public and private life, that we thought of this at first as base, whereas it is merely true. There is no such separation between living and the means of living as our political philosophies implied. Bread and land, work and the tools of work are the body and sinew of liberty, without which it and justice are but poor houseless ghosts” (139). Once society is reconceptualized as an integrated whole, it becomes easier to disassociate women's traditional activities and capacities from the private sphere and to assert their social and political value. Austin writes,"
"27","                        "
"28","We think of these two as divided by a great gap. We think of one of them as being base, but necessary, and the other as lovely, but unattainable … Things that are called practical become spiritual, not through a process of emotion, but through a process of administration. Every day of their lives women are taking such common and material things as bread and meat and sex, wounds and old clothes, and rendering them spiritual by administering them in the interests of religion, family affection, humanity. (20)               "
"29","In this instance, Austin positions women within the realm of the material, but their skills in administrating the goods of this realm elevate their activities to a higher art. Thus, Austin problematizes the strict separation of the public and private in order to illuminate the unique position of women in an integrated polity.         "
"30","Austin sees the potential for like‐mindedness between women and men in directing the ends of politics, but takes an essentialist view of the differences between the ways that men and women think. This distinction is an important one for what follows in Austin's remapping of the polity. Austin identifies two primary characteristics that form the foundation of women's contribution to political life: a “habit of centering the administration of her affairs around the production and nourishment of life” and a capacity for intuitive judgment (19, 22). In discussing women's tendency to nurture, Austin is adamant in her assertion that this is a matter of value prioritization, not of feeling. It is a matter of the intellect, not the emotions. She writes, “The difference between man‐thinking and woman‐thinking on these points … is a difference in the appreciation of values from which the thinking starts … Left to herself, woman would not think of milk as a means of making a living; she would think of it as a means of giving a living” (22). By locating women's difference in the mind rather than in the body, it is theoretically possible for men to make the value shift that would resolve the social problems Austin seeks to address. This potential agreement is critical for Austin's larger project, which would redirect the whole of the polity away from the distributive model of domestic politics that characterized the nineteenth century and towards a generative one that would both integrate and empower women while also ensuring the success of the state in world politics.         "
"31","Austin defines women's second characteristic, that of intuitive judgment, as a way of seeing the world rather than a maternal instinct or feeling: “At any rate, it is the woman habit to think the next thing which enables women to keep their opinions in a continuous state of mobilization without any suspicion of inconsistency” (19). In contrast to the rather rigid approach of men, Austin argues that women's way of thinking about social problems allows for constant adjustments that smooth and straighten society's path towards a particular goal. In both cases, these habits of mind are second nature, they are thought patterns structured by experience and cultural practice, but they are enduring. They have been engrained and honed through years of evolutionary history and social progress.         "
"32","The distinctiveness of Austin's position in The Young Woman Citizen is more apparent when compared with one of the most prominent arguments of the period— that of women as the nation's “house‐cleaners.”Jane Addams's (1915) rendering of this argument is most often cited but is also evident in Austin's earlier text with Anne Martin, Suffrage and Government (1914). There the authors write, “The chief business of women is mothering … The woman of today who wishes to do her business well, finds herself in a serious predicament. For today the greater part of all the activities upon which the successful bringing up of a family depends are carried on outside the home” (1914, 5–6). In this more conservative argument, it is the maintenance of woman's orthodox role that expands her political opportunities. In contrast, in The Young Woman Citizen, a monograph influenced by the experience of war, Austin's emphasis on intellect, rather than sentiment or role, makes it possible for her to assert women into positions of political power on the basis of their unique traits and abilities. Thus, Austin walks a fine line. On the one hand, she deploys essentialist arguments regarding woman's unique way of thinking in order to ensure that women are admitted into positions of power. On the other, she emphasizes the extent to which all can affirm the values of nurturance and prioritize these as the ends of government such that a shift from a distributive to a generative politics is possible.9"
"33","Where Austin turned to the concepts of society and mind as a means of integrating the polity, she employs woman‐thought, social capital, and the generative state in order to emphasize women's unique contribution and to create a model in which women share sovereignty with men socially, culturally, and institutionally."
"34","Austin uses the experience of WWI to prompt a reevaluation of the problems America faces and the best ways of resolving them (161). Austin argues that the war, and America's greater international involvement, intensified the need to justify democratic commitments and to specify America's position in the international arena. However, “We have bound ourselves to produce a world politics and we have not even the habit of world thinking out of which to conceive it” (6). She argues that Americans do not yet have a common, popular language for articulating their democratic understandings and commitments to themselves, much less to the rest of the world. This threatens the legitimacy of the regime because “some kind of community of thinking is necessary to valid social consent” (37)."
"35","In the early twentieth century, a national cultural elite was created and consolidated largely through the participation of upper‐ and middle‐class intellectuals in the print media and in the clubs, salons, and cafes dedicated to the refinement of speech through conversation. Mary Austin struggled to participate within these circles, as she argued for the necessity of women's full inclusion in social life. Among both progressives and suffrage activists, the topics of freedom of speech and the nature and parameters of appropriate political expression received significant attention. For example, this theme is critical to The Sturdy Oak (1917), the progressive novel organized by Austin and edited by Elizabeth Jordan for the New York suffrage movement. There, the suffragists confront the leading candidate for district attorney by displaying a tablet of probing questions on an easel in a store window. A woman, with her back to the onlookers, turns the pages that reveal the attacks. This political strategy is referred to as “a Voiceless Speech” (Jordan 1917, 75). Suffrage promised to reintegrate the disembodied voice of women and incorporate them into the polity. But, Austin was unsatisfied with suffrage as a form of political expression. She argued that women must not only register their preferences, but also participate in the construction of political choices by joining men as cosovereigns in the emerging class of national intellectuals.            "
"36","In a set of passages that reflect Austin's ambitions, she positions herself as a model of this kind of work. She argues that “the work of producing a precise, flexible language in America will have to be done very largely by the young women of America” (27). This duty falls to women for two principal reasons: first, it is fitting to women's intellect; and second, the men are engaged in fighting the war. Nonetheless, it is an enormous grant of power, for Austin argues that “woman‐thought” should write the language and construct the discursive boundaries that will shape thinking on politics and citizenship in the twentieth century—not just for Americans, but also for the world."
"37","The second problem revealed by the war is a misunderstanding over the true nature of the “nation” as a political concept. Austin argues that contemporary conceptions are incomplete; the nation is neither strictly territory nor race, but the dynamic interaction between the two. Austin defines “nationality” as “the expression in political form, of the temperament of a people made homogeneous by living in one place” (92–93). For Austin, the nation is both natural and gendered. It is composed of two parts—male and female— race and land, respectively. The principle of nationality is not race, “one might say that race is the product of nationality or that race becomes nationality by the process of living long enough in one environment;” but rather, “the self‐determined expression of the genius of the people” (92). Thus, nationality refers to the character of a people, which is created through the interaction of race and land and expressed in political association.            "
"38","Austin maintains that nations are natural, not conventional, because they are driven by two impulses—one towards sameness, the other towards difference. Austin describes the first impulse as “the generation of national power from within, through the sub‐conscious urge of type to perpetuate itself,” and the second as “the continuous and subtle readjustment between a people and their environment, which differentiates the people of one environment from the people of another” (96). The key to a successful nation is to maintain the balance between these male and female impulses: “There can be no true and progressive nationality in which the land does not speak equally with the race … [When the land speaks] it makes nations well‐balanced between the father and mother principles of their origin, the male element of race and the mothering element of land, cradling and nourishing” (106). By tying men to race and sameness and women to land and difference, Austin is able to assert women's cultural cosovereignty and to critique the dangers of masculine universalism."
"39","In reference to the war, Austin argues that Germans have denied “the mother‐right of the land” and therefore are doggedly pursuing racial dominance (106). In this instance, failure to attend to the land deprives the German people of both the restraint and differentiation that the female aspect provides and leaves them open to the more aggressively universal tendencies of masculinity. Using the natural foundations of her concept of the nation, Austin argued that the fact of diversity demanded a freedom for different nations to develop the spiritual principles growing out of their evolving nationalisms. Still, she also recognized that such a freedom was largely incompatible with the increasing interdependence of the nations of the world. Thus, at once, Austin sees the value of diversity and its vulnerability in the newly emerging global community."
"40","Austin's conception of the nation is consistent with the thinking of many of her contemporaries in the newly emerging field of social science such as Lester Ward, G. Stanley Hall, Robert Ezra Park, and Edward A. Ross. Drawing heavily on evolutionary science, these social theorists embraced essentialist conceptions of gender and a Lamarckian view of inheritance that posited that “common environments produce collective, heritable temperaments” (Reed 1997, 119–20). Austin's identification of diversity with femininity is largely at odds with her peers, but is consistent with the whole of her theory and her aim to insert women into the mainstreams of political power.            "
"41","Austin's understanding of the nation essentializes gender and contributes to the gendering of the land—problems well considered in a number of different literatures (see Kolodny 1975, for example).10 But, what is more troubling, is her treatment of race. In Austin's reconstruction of the polity, gender is the master narrative. By conceiving of race as the vehicle for the reproduction of sameness, Austin negates the possibility of recognizing race as a factor of discrimination, oppression, and exclusion within the United States. Further, her spatial remapping of the polity can only stand as long as she denies the political significance of differences within gendered categories. The lengths to which Austin goes in order to maintain this view are revealing.            "
"42","In her autobiography, Earth Horizon, Austin describes the process through which she became “colorblind.” The process involves an internal dialogue between Austin and what she refers to as “the Voice,”—a sort of prescient, impertinent, internal voice. These dialogues occur over the course of several interactions between Austin and African Americans in New York. She begins by describing her first trip into a poor, black neighborhood: “And suddenly I saw three black men crossing the street toward me, black, and walking with the jungle stride. They were so black and so freely walking that I was frightened” (Austin 1932, 346). Her next interaction occurs at a friend's dinner party, where she proudly exclaims to herself, “Why I'm eating dinner with a black man!” Here, the Voice responds, “Well, I don't see it.” Next, in a trip to Harlem, Austin identifies blackness and again the Voice refuses to acknowledge it. Austin then writes of a banquet she attended honoring W. E. B. Du Bois where the audience was comprised equally of blacks and whites. She writes, “They [the reporters] reported the dinner, and said not a word about there being black and white sitting down together. If you had read the report, you wouldn't have known. Evidently I wasn't the only one who couldn't see blackness” (Austin 1932, 348). Finally, Austin concludes the section with an explanation for why she never returned to Harlem (despite the artistic renaissance). “I did not wish to see them black, and I feared that with much looking, it might come upon me. I did not mean to go against the Voice” (Austin 1932, 348).            "
"43","What is most obvious in the above sequence is Austin's hardening commitment to erase racial difference—a commitment that, in its conclusion, seems to verge upon irrationality. However, messages of class and social evolution commingle with race in these dense passages. In the first interaction Austin describes, blackness is associated with both poverty and barbarity. It is only in the civilized context of a refined banquet for W. E. B. Du Bois that Austin claims she is unaware of race. In The Young Woman Citizen, Austin offers another revealing example of her understanding of race when she discusses the “problem” of Africa in the new world order: “But Africa is interesting for two reasons. It offers the only large tracts of unsettled country not actually preempted by civilized powers. It offers also the only supply of a cheap cannon fodder. Africa has a vast native population of a very low order of mentality, but a high order of physique. Africans make good soldiers” (114). While isolated examples such as these are insufficient to pinpoint Austin's racial attitudes, examples like the latter expose the intensity of her racism and illuminate the extent to which her arguments for the advancement of women (primarily white, educated, and middle class) are predicated upon and reinforce hierarchies of race and class.            "
"44","A final set of problems uncovered by the condition of war points to the mismanagement of American politics at the institutional level. Austin explains, “All of them relate to the problem of stored energy expressed in terms of money” (149). One of the first necessities of the war was centralized control over industry by an expanded American state. Austin does not take issue with the growth of the state, but with the “business” mind‐set and norms that informed its realization. This kind of thinking is both characteristically masculine and old‐fashioned in that it reflects the distributive politics appropriate to a nineteenth‐century understanding of political life."
"45","Distributive politics is interest based and rooted in the egalitarianism and patronage of the mass political parties. Austin argues that the political parties are the expression of the “masculine temperament” and are “as fundamental a social unit and practically as inescapable, as the family” (74). As in her conception of the nation, Austin's understanding of political life is fundamentally gendered. The party's social antecedent is the “gang” and as such it is an expression of equality, of togetherness, and of democracy: “The root of democracy is a joyous, objectiveless sense of allness” (24). Party politics is a “substitute for adventure, a mimicry of the chase, a temporary recurrent release from social isolation” (78). To some extent, the party is at risk due to both the impending extension of suffrage to women and the modernization of American politics. But, as an expression of egalitarianism, the party plays an indispensable role in American democracy and its roots in human nature ensure that it will continue to perform important functions (78)."
"46","The primary problem is that a distributive politics no longer fits the demands of the modern American nation. Instead, expansion of the state must reflect the priorities of a generative politics. As in the case of the nation, an overreliance on masculine modes at the expense of the feminine threatens the state. Austin argues that the distributive politics of the nineteenth century excelled in the accumulation and distribution of goods; what is needed in the twentieth is a generative politics directed towards the administration of the common life of the people and capable of unleashing the potential energy of social groups (162). In particular, distributive politics ignored the category of “social capital” resulting in the “waste of woman‐power” (157).            "
"47","Founded in the deeper “Social Stream,” Austin defines social capital as “the measure of group potentiality. It grows out of the capacity of men to combine … But its value depends on the vitality of the spiritual organization of the group. Men are said to be spiritually organized when they are held together by some alikeness of aim or spirit” (155). The Social Stream is essentially the great fluid undercurrent of organizations and groups upon which “all our industries and institutions float” (155). If Americans are both to win the war and successfully address domestic problems such as poverty, they must more effectively gather and direct the social energy that lies in potential within the Social Stream. The problem is that “our great industrial managers have never learned the art of generating and using Social Capital” (155)."
"48","It is women who have the necessary skills, values, intellectual capacities, and experience to release America's social capital. Through administration of the family “for the family's sake” and the direction of voluntary organizations, women have gained the traits that qualify them to step into the administrative apparatus of the state and direct, as Austin claims, the “new art of the administration of social forces” (164). Austin maintains that women are also qualified by temperament. “Every good woman is at heart a matriarch. Naturally the organizing center of the family group, she has not so much experienced democracy as seized upon it as a means of making everybody more comfortable. It is for this chiefly that men fear her, not for the things she may by the ballot do with society, but for her ancient maternal instinct to do something to it” (23).            "
"49","Austin is clear to distinguish the “use” of women in the war effort from the use of women's experience. Such a distinction is critical because it requires the admittance of women to positions of power, such as food conservation or the commissary of the army and navy, on the grounds of their unique experience. She argues that the “immediate work of the woman voter” must be to “somehow plan and bring to pass the recognition of her gift for social administration as part of the work of winning the war” if she is to be taken seriously as a cosovereign in the creation of a new world order (166)."
"50","The advantages of a regendering of the polity redound to men as well. In her 1918 essay, “Sex Emancipation Through War,” Austin argues that under the current system, men have become unsexed, “a kind of social hermaphrodite, a male‐mother,” their ambitions limited to mere “ribbon selling or bookkeeping” (Austin 1996, 53). The “adventure of war” promises to release a more robust masculinity such that men will not desire a return to their previous positions of power. This, in turn, will “make it possible for many of them to accept the idea of their wives in their old jobs” (53). The expansion of politics, and imperialist ambition, makes possible new opportunities. As Austin states in The Young Woman Citizen, “the returning soldiery [must] be released into the larger fields of creative engineering and world politics” (79). For, she claims, this war is “more than any war that was ever fought, a war of social expansion, a war for extending the frontiers of democracy. It is a war for the reinvestment of the Social Capital of the world” (159).11 For Austin, the future of democracy requires the expansion of the political horizons of both men and women.            "
"51","Austin's argument for women's inclusion into the apparatus of the state completes her remapping of the spatial ordering of the polity. The counterpart and institutional partner of the masculine party is feminine administration.12 I have taken some care in outlining Austin's thoughts because they also contribute to the conceptual history of the term “social capital.”Farr (2004) identifies two conceptual strains to this term in the American context. The first discursive strain draws more heavily from political economists such as Edward Bellamy who sought to socialize capital, while the second is grounded in the works of John Dewey on civic education and emphasizes the democratic values of sympathy and cooperation. Austin's formal definition can easily fall within either camp, but her emphasis on the generative power of the state in releasing social capital is more in keeping with the socialist strain of the political economists, for it is situated within a larger critique of individualism, laissez‐faire, and limited government.13"
"52","In her relation of social capital to the war and the necessity of energizing and coordinating the population, Austin shares in the concerns of L. J. Hanifan (1920). Hanifan uses the term to emphasize the necessity of strengthening rural communities such that greater public goods can be achieved. Austin's view of the problem is quite different. Where Hanifan sees the need to create cooperative opportunities, Austin sees the need to recognize and nationalize the existing efforts of women. While Austin goes to great lengths to protect herself from being charged with blaming men for the “waste of woman‐power,” she uses the term “social capital” to carve out a unique position of power for professional women within the administrative apparatus of the state.            "
"53","In doing so, Austin emphasizes the life‐affirming possibilities of the state in a manner that is consistent with Foucault's discussion of the redirection of the modern state towards the administration of life (1978). However, in contrast to the emerging technocrats of public administration, Austin's focus on the ends of nurturing and the spirituality of voluntary associations defines this new biopolitics in gendered terms that empower women (Stivers 2000). Austin seems to have conveyed these commitments to her longtime friend Herbert Hoover, who in 1918 was serving as U.S. Food Administrator. On April 11, 1918, Hoover responded, rather defensively, “Generally, I think you have never grasped the basis of conservation. Any spiritual aspect of this matter is secondary to the very material aspect of accomplishing directly the object which we have in view … In my capacity as Food Administrator, I have no general reforms, no spiritual movements to undertake, but simply a purely practical end to attain. If I succeed in the practical end, that is what I shall be judged by, not by any outside attitude towards citizenship which I may hold” (AU 2887). In these passages, Hoover seems to illustrate what Austin views as the characteristic linearity of man‐thought and the prevalence of the distributive model. Still, Austin also recognizes that in its reliance on matriarchal tendencies, feminized administration would require democratization in order to be just. And, it is here that we see the influences of Dewey with his emphasis on cooperation and sympathy.            "
"54","Austin notes that while the isolation of the home cultivated some of women's greatest gifts, it also left them unschooled in the democratic spirit. The most obvious source for this lesson is in the political party. But, Austin argues that for a number of reasons, including the overly masculine character of the parties and their imminent decline, that this may not be the best resource for women. In order to appreciate the interdependent nature of social living and to practice social awareness, Austin argues that women must experience a diversity of living conditions. Towards that end she provides a plan of civic education that entails the reading of history and novels, lessons in the appreciation of art in order to enlarge the citizen's “social horizon,” and a strong encouragement to participate in voluntary associations for causes outside of the individual's interests (64). Thus, Austin recommends the voluntary association to women, not only because it provides an opportunity to practice women's unique traits, but because it democratizes them in the process. While Austin draws from both lineages identified by Farr, her main goal in using the term “social capital” is to advance the prospects of women and thereby extend the possibilities of politics. Recognizing the gendered usages of this term contributes to our knowledge of its history and provides insight into the intersections of the progressive and suffrage movements."
"55","Full entry into politics was essential for women to both protect their own interests and to be recognized as full members of the polity. In The Young Woman Citizen, Austin employs a gender‐difference argument that justifies women's full inclusion on the basis of their distinctive capacities. Indicative of Austin's ability to negotiate binary poles, she constructs an argument that demands equal respect for womanhood and intellect. She is unwilling to lose her body in an abstract argument for equality, and she is unwilling to abandon her intellect for a sham virtue. For Austin, dignity requires both attention to difference and an equal opportunity to cultivate and express it.14 In a passage that brilliantly articulates these commitments, she writes: “Great women must be more than wondered at, more than admired. But first of all they must be understood as women, higher‐powered, deeper‐breathing, neither mimics nor angels. The Amazons were not born breastless” (42).         "
"56","Austin's unique construction of the gender‐difference argument is worthy of our attention. By emphasizing intellect and experience rather than virtue, Austin creates a narrative that opens up new avenues to power for women—particularly, well‐educated, middle‐class, white women. Her effort to secure an equal place for women in twentieth‐century public life through the concepts of woman‐thought, social capital, and the generative state is also noteworthy. This contribution is especially significant when contrasted with the gendered theorizing of state and citizen by nineteenth‐century, anti‐suffrage, political scientists such as Francis Lieber and Westel Woodbury Willoughby (Dietz and Farr 1998; Gunnell 1993).         "
"57","Austin's theory also deserves attention for its contribution to the progressive goals of eroding the traditional spatial ordering of the polity—one that justified the notion of a unitary sovereign and the exclusion of women from public life—and positing a new, integrative civic ideal. Austin's theory contributes to our understanding of the emergent conception of social democratic citizenship at the turn of the twentieth century and urges us to read her in the company of thinkers such as John Dewey, Horace Kallen, Arthur Bentley, Randolph Bourne, Jane Addams, and W. E. B. Du Bois, who sought to create a modern conception of citizenship fit for the new realities of the twentieth century."
"58","Still, Austin's contribution comes with profound limitations. Like many progressives, Austin's theory weaves together arguments for democratic inclusion and justifications of racial and class discrimination. Ultimately, Austin's theory privileges gender such that other kinds of difference are ignored, or erased. Her essentialism concentrates upon the differences between men and women, thereby ignoring the heterogeneity of these categories. Further, her conception of the nation, with its identification of race with sameness, intensifies these problems. Thus, in remapping the spatial ordering of the polity to advance the claims of women, Austin's theory both builds upon and reinforces existing racial and class hierarchies. Yet, as Karell writes of Austin's literature, “dismissing Austin because she can be essentialistic and even contradictory is a self‐defeating gesture of academic protectionism that ignores the contributions Austin's writing makes to contemporary feminist debate” (1995, 155). In both its achievements and its limitations, Austin's theory of citizenship illuminates the intersections of feminism and progressivism in the first decades of the twentieth century.         "
