"1","Transitions from single‐party dominance to multiparty competition are typically characterized by two‐dimensional competition. Traditional partisan conflicts may be over the role of the state and market forces in economic development, as in Mexico, over ethnic divisions, as in Malaysia, or over national identity, as in Taiwan. In addition, opposition parties have incentives to exploit or actively mobilize a regime cleavage that may include issues of the distribution of political power, the openness of the electoral arena, and questions of good governance (see Niou and Ordeshook [1992] on Taiwan; Magaloni [2006] and Greene [2007] on Mexico; Moreno [1999] on Latin American and East European cases).         "
"2","This cross‐cutting cleavage could be thought of either as a valence dimension or as a second dimension of partisan conflict. Some recent work takes the former approach (Adams, Merrill, and Grofman 2005; Groseclose 2001). I opted for the latter since in at least Mexico—a dominant party system for which good public opinion data were available—voters were close to normally distributed over the cross‐cutting regime cleavage rather than uniformly in favor of democracy.3 (These surprising preferences may result from voters' concern that political chaos could obtain if change is too swift or too encompassing.) To the extent that more voters favor democracy, the dominant party is at a disadvantage, much as it would be if it suffered a valence disadvantage; however, as I show below, the two‐dimensional structure yields unexpected opportunities to win some of these prodemocracy voters back. Existing research supplies two ways that an authoritarian dominant party might strategize in the context of democratization.         "
"3","Work by Downs (1957) and Riker (1976) agree that parties should locate centrally with respect to the voters' preferences in unidimensional competition, but extending their work to two dimensions yields divergent predictions. Downsian extensions to two‐dimensional spaces generally suggest that two‐party competition in majority rule elections should still produce center‐seeking strategies. Although earlier research found that equilibria are rare (Plott 1967) or that competition could result in chaos (McKelvey 1976), subsequent work argues that parties are attracted to a centrist subset of the competition space. Under the assumption of deterministic spatial voting, analysts have described the “uncovered set” (McKelvey 1986; Miller 1980). These findings do not generate a Nash equilibrium, but they do formalize the notion that the most popular policy positions—typically centrist—attract the parties. Cox further argues that the uncovered set remains centrally located and shrinks as the configuration of voters' preferences gets closer to having a core. Such a core would induce a Nash equilibrium “for a fairly wide class of [voters'] preferences” that need not have circular (Euclidean) indifference curves (Cox 1987, 420). Lin, Enelow, and Dorussen (1999) develop an alternative solution concept called the minimum‐sum point (MSP) that may attract the parties to a specific centrist location under the assumption of probabilistic voting.4"
"4","The second major strategy prescription comes from Riker (1976), who argued that undercutting anti‐incumbent strategic voting sustains single‐party dominance (also see Laver and Schofield 1990). Undercutting strategic voting when competition is unidimensional requires a centrist strategy since opposition voters on the left and right would rank the dominant party as their second most preferred option and have little incentive to coordinate behind a single challenger (Cox 1997, 239–40; Laver and Schofield 1990, 80). But undercutting strategic voting when competition is two‐dimensional is unlikely to mimic Downsian extensions since locating centrally still permits opposition coordination on the cross‐cutting regime dimension based on the challengers' common support for democracy. Thus, blocking strategic coordination would require a different strategy, and the literature is silent on what this strategy might be.            "
"5","Threatened by the entry of new parties, a dominant party that cannot credibly offer more democracy to the voters must strategize with its position on the traditional partisan cleavage in one of two ways. First, it can play Downsian Defense by sticking close to the center in the attempt to consolidate a slimmed‐down version of its previously broad electoral coalition. Defending the center involves some risk since it does nothing to inhibit opposition voters from coordinating behind a single challenger based on their common taste for democracy; however, as I show below, playing Downsian Defense can be the best option under some conditions."
"6","Alternatively, it can play Rikerian Offense by moving away from the position of the stronger challenger in the attempt to undercut opposition coordination on the democracy issue. To see how this complicated strategy would work, consider a district where the left‐wing challenger is weak or nonexistent and the right‐wing challenger is strong in part because it benefits from strategic voting by voters who like democracy but whose economic policy preferences range across the left‐right dimension. In playing Rikerian Offense, the dominant party—unable to offer more democracy—would offer more statism to win back left‐wing democrats by giving them an economic policy they like better. If successful, this strategy would undermine opposition coordination."
"7","Clearly, there are some contests where the incumbent should attack by playing Rikerian Offense and others where the risks make it wiser to defend by playing Downsian Defense. The decision depends on the reasons for opposition party strength and the challengers' mobility in the competition space. I first derive predictions from a nonformal presentation and then flesh out the logic in greater detail with a formal decision‐theoretic model."
"8","The first question confronting a centrist dominant incumbent faced with rising competition is why opposition parties enter and grow. There are two main possibilities. Opposition parties may grow around voters who like the challengers' left‐ or right‐wing appeals on the traditional partisan cleavage. Using Magaloni's (1997, chap. 8) terminology, these “ideological” voters rank their preferences Cs>D>Cw or Cw>D>Cs where D is an interior (i.e., comparatively centrist) dominant party, Cs and Cw are peripheral challenger parties, and Cw is the weaker of the two challenger parties. (In two‐party competition, Cw has a zero or near‐zero vote share; in three‐party competition, Cw and Cs are about evenly matched.) Ideological opposition voters' preferences are such that they will not coordinate strategically on a single opposition party. Since they prioritize the traditional cleavage over their regime preferences, voters who abandon Cw would choose D instead of choosing Cs. Alternatively, opposition parties may grow around voters who want democracy. These “radical opposition” voters rank the incumbent third such that Cs> Cw>D or Cw> Cs>D and may vote strategically for Cs in order to defeat D, even if they like Cw more on economic policy.5"
"9","If opposition party strength is due to ideological voting, then there is virtually no strategic voting and the incumbent should play Downsian Defense. If opposition parties instead grow around appeals for democracy on the cross‐cutting cleavage, then the incumbent has incentives to undercut strategic voting by playing Rikerian Offense. Whether it should depends on the opposition's strategic mobility on the traditional cleavage. Following the attack strategy by vacating the center to recuperate radical opposition voters potentially leaves constituencies available to Cs. If Cs were mobile in the strategy space, it would move toward D and pick up the voters that the incumbent abandons. Thus, even where a salient regime cleavage creates a significant amount of coordination on a single opposition party, the attack strategy is rational only if Cs is strategically constrained on the traditional cleavage when D adopts its position.            "
"10","This condition is less restrictive than it appears for two reasons. First, opposition party constraint is not only general, but also it is necessary for single‐party dominance. If opposition parties were able to locate centrally on the traditional cleavage, all else equal, they would win elections with the same probability as the dominant party and dominance would not exist. Riker (1976) evidently intuited this because his theory implicitly assumes that challenger parties cede the center to the incumbent. Case studies provide confirming evidence. Laver and Schofield (1990) argued that the Italian DC was dominant because it captured the pivot and spread challengers to the right and left. Arian and Barnes write that opposition parties in Israel and Italy were “likely to behave like sectarian, group‐specific parties” (1974, 610). The same occurred in Senegal (Coulon 1990, 424–25). Chua writes that Malaysia's opposition did not “contest [the dominant] UMNO for the moderate political discursive space” (2001, 142–43). Even the JSP, the main challenger to Japan's right‐wing LDP, “remained a fundamentalist opposition party with respect to program” and “failed to make major policy adjustments, even though the electorate continually showed itself more and more hostile to JSP proposals” (Otake 1990, 129, 131). In Botswana, the opposition BNF used “populist Marxist appeals” that attracted “a constituency that is not sufficient to win control of the parliament” (Lipset 1998, 48). In Taiwan, the opposition DPP experienced “sluggish growth in partisan support” due to “ideological rigidity and organizational weakness” (Chu 2001, 277). Thus, challengers to dominant parties tend to make noncentrist policy appeals that give dominant parties expanded opportunities for effective strategizing. Why this occurs is beyond the scope of this article; however, elsewhere I argue that opposition parties make noncentrist policy offers because they are built by regime outsiders who create parties that are deeply imbued with an anti‐incumbent identity (see Greene 2007).            "
"11","Second, Cs's actual location is less important than the fact that it is fixed when D makes its policy announcement. As long as D knows Cs's location, D still has incentives to play Rikerian Offense. Thus, even ignoring the empirical reality discussed above, we could simply assume sequential position taking where the opposition declares first and the incumbent second. Since we know that voters have less information about challenger parties than incumbents in dominant party systems and we also know that voters may discount party locations by the uncertainty they ascribe to their positions (Magaloni 2006), we might well expect challengers to announce early in the attempt to diminish this uncertainty.            "
"12","In sum, the dominant party should play Rikerian Offense the more it is disadvantaged by a salient cross‐cutting regime cleavage that encourages opposition voters to coordinate on a single challenger and the more that challenger sticks to a known noncentrist position on the traditional partisan cleavage."
"13","A formal presentation of the key elements of the model can help show the conditions under which the dominant party should attack or defend. Begin with a two‐dimensional competition space as shown in Figure 1, defined, in this particular case, by economic issues (the horizontal axis) and regime issues (the vertical axis), both ranging from −1 to 1. Voters choose between D and Cs. Notice that this two‐party model implies that Cs is the only viable opposition party while Cw is nonexistent. Below I also consider the three‐party case where both Cs and Cw challenge D.6 Voters choose between the two viable parties by comparing overall expected utility, given both the quadratic distance between their ideal points and the parties' locations as well as the salience α they ascribe to each policy dimension. This deterministic voter utility function can be represented as               "
"14","                 The Competition Space and the Dominant Party's Locational Strategy                         "
"15","This function states that the expected utility for voter i of choosing party j is given by 1) the distance between her regime preference and party j's announced position on regime issues (− (vri−prj)2) weighted by how much she cares about regime issues (αi), and by 2) the distance between her economic policy preference and party j's announced economic policy position (− (vei−pej)2) weighted by how much she cares about economic policy (1 −αi).7"
"16","Following the logic outlined above, and as depicted in Figure 1, make Cs a right‐wing democratic party with a fixed location at  and  (although we can choose any fixed location) and make D a comparatively authoritarian party located at some prd≤ 0, although this location may also vary with the extremely mild constraint that the dominant party is always perceived as less democratic than its challengers. Assuming that D is a pure vote maximizer, the question is whether D wants to choose a centrist economic policy ped≈ 0 and play Downsian Defense or choose a noncentrist economic policy ped < 0 and play Rikerian Offense, given its location on the regime cleavage.            "
"17","To figure this out, note that voter i's decision in (1) is based on both the distance from her policy preference to each party's position and the salience she ascribes to each dimension of competition. For instance, if voter i cares only about economic policy (i.e., she is a pure ideological voter), then α= 0 and the parties' announced positions on regime issues do not affect her vote choice. If α= 1 then she votes only according to regime issues. α may range between 0 and 1, indicating that voters may balance the importance of economic and regime issues in any combination. Allowing salience to vary is important when considering two‐dimensional competition since changing salience is tantamount to rearranging voters' ideal points in the competition space and should therefore affect party strategy.            "
"18","We can find the level of salience (call it α*) that would make a voter just indifferent between D and Cs by setting the two utility functions equal and solving for α, yielding               "
"19","This expression tells us which voters with a given ideal point choose D and which choose Cs. It implies that a voter whose policy preference is closer to Cs than D in terms of distance may still vote for D if the salience she ascribes to each dimension produces a higher overall utility for D than for Cs. Specifically, (2) tells us that D wins voters in Area A in Figure 1 with salience less than α* while Cs wins the remainder. In other words, voters with ideal points in Area A will vote for D if they care about regime issues less than α* and otherwise will vote for Cs. For voters in Area B, the meaning of α* is reversed: D wins voters with salience less than α* while Cs wins the remainder. But clearly there are some voters for whom α* will not be big enough to compel them to choose Cs (call it Area D) and another area where α* will not be small enough to compel them to choose D (call it Area C). Area D contains assured votes for D while Area C contains assured votes for Cs. D's chosen location clearly affects the size of the four areas. As D moves left toward D', the vertical dashed line (call it the ve line) moves to the left, increasing the size of Areas C and B at the expense of Areas A and D.8"
"20","To find the proportion of voters who choose D, we can integrate over α for Area A and over 1 −α for Area B, and then add all the voters in Area D. Table 1 shows the results of computations that yield the economic policy location ped that maximizes the dominant party's vote share under different conditions. The least threatening situation for the incumbent occurs when it has succeeded in decreasing its authoritarian reputation, where voters' policy preferences are bivariate uniform, and where voters care as much about economic policy as they do about democracy (α= 1 −α= .5). Under these conditions, shown in the first row in Table 1, the dominant party maximizes its            "
"21","vote share in two‐party competition by playing Downsian Defense and moving close to Cs. But as conditions create greater disadvantages, the incumbent should move left, away from Cs and toward D'. When it is stuck in a more authoritarian position, voters' preferences are skewed substantially but not entirely toward democracy,9 and voters care more about the regime than about economic policy; as shown in the last row in Table 1, the dominant party should play Rikerian Offense and locate at −.23 on economic policy.            "
"22","In general, the more political conditions conspire against the incumbent on the cross‐cutting cleavage, the more it should play Rikerian Offense by attacking the location of the weaker challenger on the traditional dimension of competition. Table 1 shows a summary measure of dominant party disadvantage that ranges from weakest (1) to strongest (9). As voters care more about democracy, the incumbent should move further from Cs. By giving voters away from Cs on the economic policy dimension an economic policy offer that is closer to their ideal point, D discourages them from choosing Cs based on its democratic credentials and thus undercuts opposition coordination. If Cs's fixed location were more centrist on economic policy, the incumbent would maximize its vote share even further to the left.            "
"23","If a second opposition party Cw were to enter competition and become as viable as Cs (i.e., if we had three‐party competition), then strategic coordination among opposition voters would disappear. As Cox (1997) argues, when a voter's first and second choices are about equally viable, she cannot decide which party has a better chance of beating her least preferred option, and she therefore votes for her first choice. Since there is (close to) no strategic voting in three‐party competition, the incumbent cannot gain from strategizing to undercut opposition coordination and instead should play Downsian Defense. Model calculations indicate that no matter where it locates on the regime cleavage, D maximizes its vote share in the center at zero on the economic policy cleavage.10"
"24","The results of this formal presentation support the theory outlined nonformally above. When facing a single strategically constrained challenger, the more that challenger benefits from the strategic coordination of voters across the economic policy dimension, the more the dominant party should move away from it and play Rikerian Offense. When strategic voting is small to nil, as in three‐party competition, the incumbent should play Downsian Defense."
"25","The theory developed above could be tested cross‐nationally or intranationally in federal systems where the number of competitive parties varies by state and state party organizations can make different policy announcements to the voters.11 I opted for the latter approach because it controls for variation in electoral rules and because I have appropriate and difficult‐to‐find data that tap state party positions in Mexico (described below). Mexico also provides a good case for testing the predictions generated from Downsian extensions and my alternative theory based on Rikerian logic for three reasons. First, it is a key case of single‐party dominance in which the PRI ruled for 67 years—the longest lasting dominant party to date—but lost control of Congress in 1997 and lost the presidency in 2000. Second, opposition parties successfully mobilized a regime cleavage that became increasingly salient beginning in the late 1980s and cut across the PRI's electoral coalition.         "
"26","Finally, in response to rising competition, the PRI had a limited set of strategy options. Like other dominant parties in competitive authoritarian regimes, it had trouble convincing voters that it was a credible force for democracy. Although it instituted primaries for candidacies in some states and to select its presidential nominee for the 2000 election, voters continued to identify it as more authoritarian than its competitors.12 The PRI was also decreasingly able to win support by bribing voters with patronage goods. Economic crises in 1982 and 1994 and the shift to free market economic policies by the PRI‐led federal government dramatically reduced the size of the federal public bureaucracy and the government's role in business. Although the PRI was able to use one‐shot privatization revenues to buy some support (Kessler 1999), by the mid‐1990s it had essentially run out of money for large‐scale patronage politics (see Greene 2007). Thus, making policy appeals to voters became particularly important for competing with opposition parties better able to claim the mantle of democracy.13"
"27","Mexico's 31 states and the Federal District have become important arenas of partisan conflict during the past two decades. Opposition parties had early incentives to develop local capacity to amass votes for proportional representation seats in Congress, to win local office and gain legitimacy with voters (Lujambio 2001), and to mount post‐electoral protests that would put democratizing pressure on the PRI (Eisenstadt 2004). As opposition parties built themselves up, the PRI responded by transferring resources to the state level and increasingly relying on state governors or, where it was out of power, state party organizations to run campaigns. Indeed, by the late 1990s, PRI state party leaders were largely in charge of campaigns, and this created cross‐state variation in position taking (Langston 2003).         "
"28","By 1997, the dynamics of dominant party erosion created 19 states with two‐party competition between the PRI and one opposition party with weak to very weak presence of the other opposition party14 and 12 states where all three parties competed or the second opposition party was within striking distance of becoming a serious challenger.15"
"29","Unable to move much on the regime dimension, the PRI experimented with its position on the economic policy dimension. Examining these experiences helps bring the strategies described above to life and links strategy decisions to their electoral effects. In several states, the party did nothing to reform itself and acted as a lazy monopolist. This “strategy” failed to unite competing factions and led to chaos within the party and unintelligible appeals in the electorate (Langston 2003).         "
"30","In a second failed experiment, the PRI moved toward the position of the stronger challenger in three‐party competition when it should have played Downsian Defense. Months before the 1997 election for mayor of the Federal District in Mexico City, the PAN appeared the stronger challenger (Lawson 1999, 152). The PRI responded by raiding the PAN's position and running a campaign more focused on middle‐class voters than on the poorer voters closer to the left‐wing PRD. According to local PRI leaders, this strategy inadvertently helped the PRD win by giving it expanded space (author interviews 1999). The PRD was able to pick up moderate ideological voters toward the center as well as a potentially large group of radical opposition voters who chose it over the besieged right‐wing PAN.16"
"31","In the face of these failures, and in order to further explore strategy options, then‐PRI President Mariano Palacios commissioned an extensive analysis of partisan dynamics. The report coined what came to be known as the “polarization strategy” because it encouraged the PRI to design campaigns that make the opposition parties appear radical on key issues while the PRI should stake out clear contrasting positions. This implied that in two‐party competition it should move toward the weaker challenger to draw out its differences with the stronger challenger (i.e., it should attack by playing Rikerian Offense). When three parties compete, the PRI should defend its centrist position against the more extreme policies of its competitors."
"32","Attacking the position of the weaker challenger, as prescribed by the PRI's internal report, was used most clearly in the 1998 state elections in Chihuahua. All three parties viewed this as one of two key tests in the run‐up to the 2000 presidential elections. Since the PAN held the governorship, it was clearly the stronger challenger in this two‐party state. The PRI identified education as a key issue and “polarized” the PAN by advertising that it wanted to privatize public schools in service of its middle‐ and upper‐class constituents. The PRI instead placed itself with the working class and in favor of public education. By attacking the position of the weaker challenger—in this case the PRD on the left—the PRI gave poorer voters who liked democracy reasons to choose it over the right‐wing PAN. The strategy was successful, and the PRI won the governorship back from a very popular PAN administration (see Mizrahi 2003). In 1998, as yet undeclared PAN presidential candidate Vicente Fox credited the polarization strategy with his party's loss in Chihuahua (author interview, October 1998). Even though Rikerian Offense worked in this case, when should the PRI attack and when should it defend?         "
"33","Testing the alternative hypotheses developed in the prior section requires information on voters' preferences and the parties' positions in the competition space. Public opinion data come from Latinobarometer's 1998 national sample for Mexico.17 Data for the three parties come from the Mexico Party Personnel Surveys conducted by the author and a team of researchers in 1999.18 The nearly 1,500 respondents were National Council members who hold sway over their party's budget and certain strategy decisions, and convention delegates who influence candidate selection and statutory changes. Since state party leaders have substantial influence over the selection of delegates to the national conventions, these delegates' preferences are particularly good tracers of what each state party stood for.         "
"34","To examine voters' preferences, I conducted a factor analysis of issue items. This procedure recovered two salient dimensions related to economic development policy and regime issues, as expected by the relevant literature (Domínguez and McCann 1996; Moreno 1999).19 On economic policy, voters' preferences were normally distributed and the median voter was middle‐of‐the‐road, neither endorsing completely state‐led economic development nor the fully market‐oriented path. On regime issues, voters' preferences were somewhat skewed toward the democratic side, but much less than one might expect. These data may capture voters' concern, strongly primed by PRI advertising, that the transition could cause political instability. More important for our purposes is that the bidimensional distribution of preferences does not exhibit a median in all directions, implying that there is no Nash equilibrium or core point. Nevertheless, as discussed above, the center should attract the parties. To measure alternative versions of “the center,” I calculated the maximum possible size of the uncovered set using CyberSenate20 software and found that it extends to −0.09 on the left and to .12 on the right.21 Lin, Enelow, and Dorussen's (1997) minimum‐sum point is similarly located at 0.05.22 Thus, all relevant versions of the “center” are quite close to zero on the economic policy dimension.         "
"35","The programmatic positions of PRI state‐level delegations were generated using an analogous factor analysis technique on data from the Mexico Party Personnel Surveys and are shown in Figure 2.23 The theoretical range of the outcome variable is −1 to 1, where negative values are associated with statist positions and positive values are associated with a free market orientation. The Mexico Party Personnel Surveys randomly selected enough respondents from 26 of the 31 states and the Federal District to make valid generalizations to the subnational level.         "
"36","                 PRI Economic Development Policy Preferences by State                      "
"37"," Figure 2 shows much more variation in party location than Downsian extensions would predict. In some states, the PRI sticks close to the center, while in others it moves away from the center. There is also structure in the distribution. A closer inspection shows that in states where the market‐oriented PAN is strong (represented by white bars), the PRI tends to locate on the statist side, and where the statist PRD is strong (represented by black bars), it instead locates on the market side. Furthermore, in two‐party states (represented with an asterisk), the PRI tends to locate away from the center, while in three‐party states it is significantly more centrist.24 If we use the maximum bounds given by the uncovered set above and define the center in the region ±.12, then 12 of the 16 states where the PRI adopts noncentrist positions are two‐party states and eight of 10 where it takes centrist positions are three‐party states. In sum, the PRI tends to attack in two‐party states and defend in three‐party states, and these initial findings are consistent with my model's predictions presented in the first section. The remainder of this section provides a more rigorous test of the argument.         "
"38","According to the model developed here, the PRI should play Downsian Defense where ideological voting is extensive and consider playing Rikerian Offense where radical opposition voting is significant and the opposition parties are relatively immobile. In general, these conditions were present in Mexico in the 1990s. First, radical opposition voting was extensive. Poiré (2000) found that 10% of all voters were likely to vote strategically. Even though this is the lowest available estimate, it indicates more strategic voting than in any of the 14 studies of established democracies reviewed by Alvarez and Nagler (1997). Other data suggest that much of this strategic voting came from opposition voters who pool on the PRI's strongest challenger. Using a national sample, Wilson (1999) showed that a voter's likelihood of choosing her second most preferred opposition party increases by about 25% as her interest in democracy rises. Using a Mexico City sample, Magaloni (1997, chap. 8) found that 33% of voters ranked the PRI third and were thus likely to emit a strategic vote. Lawson (1999) also found significant defection from the weaker to the stronger challenger in his 1997 panel survey of Mexico City voters.            "
"39","Second, the opposition parties were generally strategically stuck and did not squeeze toward the center of the space. The Mexico Party Personnel Surveys show that PAN and PRD elites adopted less centrist programmatic positions in two‐party situations. This evidence comes from the same pooled factor analysis of issue items used to generate the PRI's state‐level locations presented above in Figure 2. The economic policy dimension again ranges from –1 to 1. Where the PAN was the PRI's primary challenger, the PAN located significantly toward the market side at .21, as compared to its more centrist position in three‐party competition at .13. The PRD behaved similarly. When it faced the PRI alone it located toward the statist side at −.42, and when it competed as one of three it is closer to the center at −.34. Differences for both parties are statistically significant at the .05 level. For a further explanation for the opposition parties' surprising strategic behavior, see Greene (2007).            "
"40","How do the explanatory variables described above combine to cause variation in the location of the PRI's state‐level delegations on economic policy appeals?25 Two OLS regression models were estimated, one using 1997 federal election returns and the other using state‐level returns from the latest pre‐2000 election whether this was gubernatorial or federal. I used both elections since it is not entirely clear whether the parties based their strategies in the run‐up to the 2000 presidential election primarily on the prior midterm elections in 1997 or whether they updated their predictions based on their performance in gubernatorial elections if these occurred between 1997 and 2000.            "
"41","The main explanatory variable of interest is the strength of each opposition party relative to its overall vote as given by .26 This variable captures the extent to which the dominant party faces two‐ or three‐party competition and whether its main challenger in two‐party competition is on the left or the right. The expression ranges from −1 to 1. When it is −1, the PRD accounts for all of the opposition vote and indicates pure two‐party PRI‐PRD competition. When it is 1, the PAN takes the entire opposition vote and indicates pure two‐party PRI‐PAN competition. When it is 0, the two opposition parties are evenly matched, and we have three‐party competition.27 This variable taps the relevant concept well because the PAN and PRD accounted for virtually all of the opposition vote during this period and because the PRI was the largest or second largest party in every state such that no state had PAN‐PRD competition without the PRI. This variable also taps the relevant concept better than the alternatives since the standard measures for the effective number of parties do not capture whether the stronger challenger is on the left or right. The models also include the economic policy locations of PAN and PRD state‐level delegations, using the same factor score technique that was used to recover PRI positions.            "
"42","As shown in Table 2, coefficients for the opposition party vote variable in both models have the predicted sign and are significant at the .05 level.28 Both models show that an increase in PAN (the right‐wing party) vote share is associated with more statist positions among PRI state‐level delegations while an increase in PRD (the left‐wing party) vote share is instead associated with more market‐oriented positions.29 In the latest pre‐2000 elections, the PRD led the PAN by the widest margin in the state of Guerrero, where it won 47.9% of the vote to the PAN's 1.7%. In this two‐party state, the PRI clearly faced stiff competition from the PRD and a negligible challenge from the PAN. Using the pre‐2000 model above and holding the other variables at their mean, the PRI is predicted to locate on the free market side at .20. Where the PAN outpaced the PRD the most in Nuevo León by taking 48.9% of the vote to the PRD's 3.1%, the pre‐2000 model predicts that, ceteris paribus, the PRI locates on the statist side at −.19. This represents a 20% shift over the theoretical range and a 39% shift over the empirical range of economic policy locations when the PRI faces a strong left‐ or right‐wing challenger in two‐party competition. If instead we allow the PAN and PRD to be evenly matched, as they are in three‐party competition, then the model predicts that the PRI should locate at 0, exactly in the center on economic policy. Using the 1997 model produces similar results.            "
"43","I also expected that the economic policy location of the opposition parties would affect the position of PRI state‐level delegations. Where the PRD was further to the left, the PRI theoretically had a better chance of succeeding if it attacked to the right. Similarly, where the PAN was significantly on the right, the PRI could attack to the left with limited costs. An inspection of the bivariate correlations (not shown) indicates support for this hypothesis, but the effects wash out in the multivariate models. Nevertheless, the failure to find causal leverage in the variation of PAN and PRD positions does not say anything about the effects of their relative immobility on PRI positioning.            "
"44","The results of the quantitative analysis supply evidence in favor of the hypotheses developed in the first section of the article. In two‐party competition the PRI plays Rikerian Offense to undercut opposition voter coordination. In three‐party competition the PRI instead plays Downsian Defense by sticking close to the center. Despite this evidence, there are three types of alternative explanations that should be taken into account. First, the median voter could vary across states. Unfortunately, sample survey data with appropriate issue questions that are representative at the state level are not available. However, we would naturally expect that the median voter would be closer to the location of the stronger challenger in two‐party states (i.e., closer to the PAN in the North and closer to the PRD in the South). But in playing Rikerian Offense, the PRI actually moves away from the stronger challenger. Thus, variation in the location of the median voter only makes the PRI's counterintuitive strategy more surprising from the perspective of standard Downsian extensions. Second, the statistical results cannot tell us whether the PRI moved as a result of the number of competitive parties or the reverse. In other words, we would obtain the same statistical results if the PRI's use of Rikerian Offense simply crowded out the would‐be third, party challenger and allowed the stronger challenger on its opposite flank to grow. The qualitative description of the PRI's strategies, including its own internal strategy documents discussed in the prior section, favors the original interpretation rather than this alternative; however, since over‐time data on PRI state‐level strategies are unavailable, I cannot supply a quantitative test."
"45","The final set of alternative explanations for the observed data questions whether the personal preferences of PRI personnel represent strategic preferences. In this analysis, I assume that the distribution of policy preferences among party personnel represents electoral strategies. There are four ways to argue for the validity of this measurement assumption. First, game theoretic research often locates parties in the competition space by the mean or the median position of its members (Aldrich 1983; Osborne and Slivinski 1996). Second, the preferences of party personnel are more valid measures of strategy than party platforms. In Mexico, state‐level platforms tend to be anemic, they are typically not publicized by the media or the candidates, and it is not clear that party personnel use them to guide their campaigns. Third, voting behavior research typically locates parties according to the mean or median location of their voters. This initially seems like a relevant measure since party strategies are substantially oriented toward vote getting; however, it confuses ends with means since voters may misperceive the parties' offers. To measure strategies, we want to know what the parties try to do. Finally, I show that the observed pattern in Figure 2 did not result from the differential defection or recruitment of party personnel.            "
"46","The policy preferences of PRI personnel could result from a process of differential defection where promarket PRI personnel exited to the PAN in its strongholds, leaving the PRI with statist personnel. The inverse process could have occurred where the statist PRD is strong. Yet despite some anecdotal evidence from a handful of high‐profile defectors, the political biographies collected as part of the Mexico Party Personnel Surveys show that just 3.6% of PRD and 1.5% of PAN personnel were ex‐PRI members, implying that defections played a negligible role in the PRI's policy positions.30"
"47","Alternatively, the pattern of PRI positioning could be an artifact of recruitment if new promarket activists were recruited into the PAN and new statist activists joined the PRD in their respective strongholds. This would progressively make the PRI into a market‐oriented party when it faces the PAN and a statist‐oriented party when it faces the PRD. According to experts on political recruitment in Mexico, promarket technocrats should come disproportionately from the public bureaucracy and they should be younger and hold university degrees while their statist (aka “dinosaur”) counterparts should come from the PRI's sectoral organizations, should have electoral careers in the states, and should be older and less educated (Centeno 1994; Camp 1995). Yet none of these variables are correlated with programmatic positions in the Mexico Party Personnel data. Thus, variations in the programmatic preferences of PRI state‐level delegations do not appear to arise from the most plausible nonstrategic processes, and these findings help establish the validity of my measurement assumption.            "
"48","On July 2, 2000, the PAN's Vicente Fox won the presidency, ending 71 years of PRI rule. Nevertheless, the formerly dominant party captured 36.9% of the vote in concurrent congressional elections while the PAN‐led coalition took 38.2%. In the 2003 midterm elections, the PRI‐led coalition regained the plurality with 36.8% of the vote nationally and won the largest or second largest plurality in every state except the Federal District. Unlike its counterparts in other competitive authoritarian regimes that broke down, Mexico's incumbent party was not voted out of office decisively."
"49","This article argues that the PRI's strategic positioning contributed to its staying power. If playing Rikerian Offense worked, then it should have done better in two‐party states where it was further from the center on economic policy. In three‐party cases, the PRI's Downsian Defense strategy yields so little variation in positioning that we should see no statistically significant effect of positioning on vote share in this subset of cases.         "
"50","To test these hypotheses, I regressed the change in the PRI's state‐level vote share for the lower house of Congress from 1997 to 2000 on the distance between the PRI's economic policy location and the substantive center of the economic policy dimension where the center was recovered through the method discussed above. I further parsed this policy distance variable between two‐ and three‐party states."
"51","The results in Table 3 show that the PRI's distance from the center on economic policy issues in two‐party states had a statistically significant effect on the change in its vote share between 1997 and 2000. This effect was large enough to offset the deficit the PRI experienced in two‐party states, as shown by the negative sign on the two‐party state dummy variable. The model predicts that the PRI would have lost 10.4% of the vote in two‐party competition had it played Downsian Defense by sticking at the median on economic policy. If instead we move the PRI to its empirical maximum distance from the center at 0.62 so that it plays Rikerian Offense, then it would have staunched the hemorrhage of votes and lost just 0.4%. In three‐party states, as predicted, there was no significant effect of party positioning on change in vote share.         "
"52","By playing Rikerian Offense in two‐party states, the PRI undercut voters' strategic coordination on a single challenger party and thus diminished the advantage of the opposition's democratic credentials. Having done so, the PRI found itself in a surprisingly strong position following the end of its electoral dominance. Its loss of the presidency signaled the virtual disappearance of the regime dimension from partisan conflict. Barring the mobilization of a new cleavage, voters may now assess the parties on the left‐right dimension. By attacking the position of the weaker challenger during the transition, the PRI reinforced two‐party competition between it and one competitor in many states. If it had not done so, it might now confront three‐party competition on a single dimension with parties to its left and right. Such a configuration can be disastrous for the center party (Sartori 1976). Thus, the PRI's strategies before the 2000 elections put it in a good position to compete in the radically changed post‐2000 environment. The PRI has numerous obstacles to overcome in its quest to remain viable. It must live down its authoritarian reputation, generate new resources, solidify candidate‐selection rules in the absence of presidential interference, overcome organizational rigidities, and coordinate dissimilar intraparty programmatic positions across states. These obstacles may be insurmountable. However, if the party can clear these hurdles, the personnel that make up its state party delegations have staked out surprisingly effective locations and could be relied upon to transform the PRI into a competitive democratic party. The dominant party is dead, but the PRI lives on.         "
"53","Challenger parties have constant incentives to change competitive dynamics by mobilizing new cleavages that cut across the incumbent's electoral coalition, a move that Riker (1983) referred to as “heresthetics.” When successful, opposition parties cleave the incumbent's winning coalition and establish a foothold in partisan competition.         "
"54","Naturally, incumbents will have incentives to strategize against challenger heresthetics. They will likely try to reframe the partisan debate to their advantage, but to the extent that they are unable to do so, they must respond with spatial strategies. This article has shown that noncentrist policy positioning may be optimal, even in situations where there are only two major parties. Specifically, when the incumbent is unavoidably disadvantaged on a cross‐cutting cleavage and the challenger party is committed to its policy preferences, it may be electorally rational for the incumbent to move away from the center on the primary dimension of competition. In fact, the more salient the cross‐cutting cleavage and/or the more voters are stacked on the challenger's side of this cleavage, the greater the incentives to move out of the center and play Rikerian Offense. This strategy can undercut anti‐incumbent strategic voting in two‐dimensional circumstances and help incumbents staunch the process of electoral dealignment when voting behavior is strongly influenced by a new cleavage.         "
"55","My finding that parties may benefit from center‐fleeing strategies is not entirely new; however, it differs from prior approaches that examine the case of unidimensional competition and require that parties are motivated in part by policy considerations (e.g., Adams, Merrill, and Grofman 2005; Groseclose 2001). In contrast, I examine the case of two‐dimensional competition and generate a noncentrist result even when the center‐fleeing party is a pure vote maximizer. At the same time, my approach is limited by the requirement that the incumbent knows the challenger's location when the former announces its policy offer. This situation would obtain where position taking is sequential or where the challenger party's location is constrained. Such constraint may be more general than it initially appears. Challenger party position taking is not only constrained in dominant party systems as I have argued, but also in fully competitive systems where opposition parties emerge around single issues, such as the radical right and green parties in Western Europe (Kitschelt 1989, 1995; Meguid 2005). Even more generally, prior research suggests that activists tend to be more policy radical than party leaders in competitive party systems (May 1973). Thus, if internal party democracy allows such activists to constrain their party's policy announcement, and the other elements of the model obtain, then incumbents will have incentives to announce a noncentrist policy by playing Rikerian Offense.
