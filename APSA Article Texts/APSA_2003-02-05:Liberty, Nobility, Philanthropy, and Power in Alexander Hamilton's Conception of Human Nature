"1","Hamilton's opening argument for the Constitution characterizes his thought. He also raises rhetorical points that seem uncharacteristic but reveal his assumptions. It is thus a point of departure for uncovering the relation between liberty, nobility, philanthropy, and power that is developed in the context of his overall writings."
"2","Hamilton begins by reminding Americans that they are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution. Writing as Publius, he invokes a founder of the Roman Republic and thereby defends the Constitution in the spirit of classical republicanism. The Constitution establishes a free republic. But Hamilton does not mention republican government in his opening statement. Rather, he raises the self‐evidently important consideration that the Union, the safety and welfare of its parts, and the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting in the world, all require that Americans adopt this constitution (1961, 33). The republican states that form the parts of the Union are not depicted in classical terms but in liberal terms: the republic does not make manifest political participation, civic virtue, and noble action as common goods and human ends; but it is an artificial means of organizing power to secure the natural rights to life, liberty, and property of individuals throughout the land.1 Indeed, Hamilton's claim that the Republic must be an empire flagrantly contradicts the classical maxim that free republics must be small and thereby heralds his revolutionary plan to secure liberty by constructing a republican government unprecedented in its great size, population, and complexity. It thus goes without saying that it is first and foremost its revolutionary conception of liberty as announced in the Declaration of Independence and then secondarily its republican constitution that will distinguish the American empire from all others.1"
"3","On this basis, Hamilton, as Publius, invokes the frequently made remark “that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country … to decide … whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or …destined to depend … on accident and force.” He adds: “If there be any truth in the remark … a wrong election … may, in this view, deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.”“This idea,” he stresses, “will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good men must feel for the event.”"
"4","Publius does not offer that remark in his own name, but suggests its appeal to many “considerate and good men.” Associating “all considerate and good men” with “good government” harmonizes the classical, Christian, and liberal sentiments of the day. The appeal to “good government” culminates in an appeal to patriotism, implies concern with republican government as well as liberty, and thereby heightens Publius's evocation of classical republicanism. Associating the destiny of America with the misfortune or benefit of mankind, in turn, depends on the philanthropy of “good men,” evokes providence—an appeal made explicit by Jay in Federalist 2—as that which reserved their opportunity to establish a model of good government, and thus evokes the Christian representation of America as “a city upon a hill.” Publius clearly echoes the Declaration's final appeal to a “firm reliance on … divine Providence” and all its authority as based on the “harmonizing sentiments of the day” while also firmly resting on the self‐evident natural rights that legitimate consent. Hamilton thus avoids identifying good government and good men with either classical republicanism or Christianity; but identifying them with “reflection and choice” harmonizes those sentiments with the principle that government rests on the consent of the governed.1 Liberal republican government may be the best or the only reliable means of perpetuating the consent of the governed, who must now be relied on to know and defend their rights, and can now decide that issue in America. All other governments, including those based on classical republican or Christian virtue, fail that decisive test because, by depending on accident and force, they either fail to grasp, cannot secure, or violate the right to liberty. Hamilton evokes the classical and Providential auras that seem to many “good men” to surround the founding, but he enlists their patriotism and philanthropy in the service of a novus ordo seclorum. The Constitution is perhaps a singular opportunity to establish a viable liberal republic in America, and thereby to vindicate Paine's proclamation in Common Sense that, as the American People: “We have it in our power to begin the world over again” (1953, 51).1"
"5","Hamilton accentuates the patriotic and philanthropic spirit of the founding. But he also suggests its conditional quality and stresses not simply its truth but its usefulness. The conditions for an American Republic were and would remain influenced by accident and force. Among other things, national circumstances as well as shared principles dictate that government in America must be republican, and the people's “republican genius,” like their “commercial genius,” presents obstacles to as well as opportunities for a federal government. In the near term, both of them tend to fortify local interests and state powers. Patriotism or philanthropy cannot solve those problems insofar as the people's republican principles and local interests divide them and they deliberate and choose on the basis of their security and welfare. Patriotism and philanthropy can, however, be effective if paradoxically brought to support a new kind of republican government that is based on self‐interest."
"6","In this vein, Hamilton advances an idea that is characteristic of his thought: “Happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected.” The distinction between wishful thinking and serious expectation clarifies the problem of relying on “true interests” and Hamilton's expectations for the founding."
"7","At first sight, “true interests” combine philanthropy with patriotism and dedicate individuals to a “public good” greater than the sum of its parts. But the parts form a tension‐filled descending order leading back to self‐interest. A philanthropist, Hamilton suggests, wishes well for America because America's success benefits mankind. But he stresses the happiness that Americans will gain if they can realize their own true interests. Philanthropy thus serves patriotism, and true citizens are interested in serving the public good; citizens ask not what their country can do for them but what they can do for their country. Patriotism is far from universal because patriots advance the interests of their country even at the expense of others. In the special case of America, philanthropy may be added to patriotism. True patriots, Hamilton implies, may be wished for but not seriously expected because most Americans cannot realize their true interests. At first sight, circumstances are to blame insofar as the narrow interests of the people in the states obstruct the public good. Thus, given the limitations of patriotism, Hamilton seems to fall back on the hope that most Americans will act prudently in their self‐interest or, as Tocqueville put it, on “self‐interest rightly understood.” But Hamilton expects no such luck."
"8","Hamilton sees America's circumstances as consequences of basic causes that are rooted in human nature and require a radical lowering of political expectations:"
"9","                        "
"10","So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first magnitude to society. (34)"
"11","Hamilton indicates that “wise and good men” are leaders who decide the most basic and far‐reaching political issues. They are the excellent expression of “considerate and good men” and may exemplify patriotism or philanthropy. But he does not mean simply that “wise and good men” make mistakes. Falsely biased judgment makes even them believe that their intentions are good and policies are just even if they are serving such unworthy motivations as “ambition, avarice, personal animosity, and party opposition.” The causes of false bias are so numerous and so powerful that even “wise and good men” often cannot be trusted no matter what side of a dispute they are on. Indeed, such “wise and good men” can be most dangerous because they prosecute their ambitions in the name of the public good. Hamilton thus duly attends to these circumstances to “furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so thoroughly persuaded of their being on the right side in any controversy” (34)."
"12","Hamilton's rhetoric adds philanthropy to patriotism while soberly warning against basing political expectations on such dubious motivations. In effect, he brings philanthropy and patriotism to the support of lower but more secure motivations and expectations. Hamilton is not hoping for the best but expecting the worst; he is viewing and dealing with the high in the light of the low.1 He opposes the classical republican and Christian attempts to reform human beings in the light of the “best regime” or divine command, that is, in terms of how they “ought” to act, because that does more harm than good. Serious politicians must know and accept human beings for what they are and establish government on those terms for the public good.         "
"13","Hamilton prepares Americans to deliberate in terms of his new sober political science, and thus to adopt the Constitution on the basis of their predictable interests. But he does not reduce the high to the low. He concludes by stressing to Americans that adopting the Constitution “is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness” (36). Liberty, as Locke shows, can be a means to one's own life and property, but dignity entails a sense of one's worth in relation to some greater good and the good opinion of others. How is dignity related to liberty and happiness? Is Hamilton implying that the Constitution is a condition of dignity, which, in turn, is a condition of liberty and happiness? Is republican government an end after all?"
"14","Hamilton appeals to and defines first principles sparingly in the Federalist. His reticence and circumspection accentuate the general agreement with such basic principles as liberty, dignity, security and welfare, and republican government, and focus attention on his practical resolution of the paradoxical relation between those principles and a powerful federal government or republican empire:         "
"15","                        "
"16","An enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty. An over‐scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people … will be represented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten … that jealousy is the usual concomitant of violent love, and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is too apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust. (35)"
"17","Hamilton's point entails the liberal paradox that the tension between liberty and power requires powerful government to defend liberty. His assumptions are telling. He makes his first mention of republican government by warning that history teaches that “those men who have overturned the liberties of republics” begin as demagogues and end up as tyrants. The misfortunes of classical republics directly result from the conception that liberty entails the exercising of political power. Properly understood, the “noble enthusiasm of liberty” tends to limit not liberate political power, and it promotes a “narrow and illiberal distrust” of government because it entails a jealous claim of rights against government. Anti‐Federalists share this conception of liberty, but their zeal, jealousy, or narrow‐mindedness blinds them to the necessity and the possibility of a republican empire. Their “illiberal distrust” is deepened by the outmoded and dangerous conviction that only a small homogeneous community united by religion and civic virtue can ensure republican government, and only a participatory republic can secure liberty. Anti‐Federalists may blur the distinction between liberty and civil rights and classical or Christian misconceptions about republican liberty and the common good.1 Hamilton consistently advances the Constitution as the “safest course” or a most effective means to secure the private liberty, dignity, and happiness of Americans throughout the land.         "
"18","Yet in a specific sense, Hamilton also may fuse liberalism with classicism by depicting the love of liberty as “noble.” Nobility is a political standard that is in itself good and just, warrants devotion and sacrifice to one's polity or cause, and decides one's dignity. The noble love of the principle of liberty draws Americans away from private interests and devotes them to the republic that stands for liberty and justice for all. Liberty, ordinarily a means to life and happiness, is paradoxically transformed into a noble principle, a just cause, and a country worth dying for. But this transformation implies that noble deeds should be loved for their own sake, and thus that devotion to liberty is a mark of nobility. The dignity of being American is a great common good. Hamilton avoids that paradox because, as an American patriot, he takes it for granted that the love of liberty is noble. The Declaration's concluding “pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor,” and Patrick Henry's legendary cry “give me liberty or give me death” attest to that noble sentiment."
"19","It may be that Hamilton regards the love of liberty as noble and not republican government. But republican government reflects the torch of liberty insofar as it is a most effective means or even a necessary condition of securing liberty and the public good. The Constitution embodies and perpetuates the deliberation and choice of the people. Political deliberation and choice secures and expresses liberty. Participation in republican government is an ordinary condition of acting nobly in the service of liberty. The love of liberty thus points toward Aristotle's axiom that the polity exists not for the sake of mere life but the good life and noble actions distinguish citizens (Politics 3:9). But Hamilton's conception of liberty as a private right precludes the conclusion that political participation in the common good is a great human good, and with good reason. His observation that the ruinous politics of classical republics reflects problematic political principles is partly supported by Aristotle himself. The apex of civic virtue—a greatness of soul and pride in one's excellence exhibited by magnanimous and noble deeds toward one's polity—anticipates monarchy or tyranny and points toward imperialism and civil war (Ethics1122a–1125b; Politics1277a:23, 1283b–1284a). But Hamilton's paradoxical love of liberty, as the following analysis of fame shows, may alleviate while radicalizing that problem by hitching the noble and republican government to the rising star of private rights or liberated individualism.1"
"20","Hamilton's appeal to philanthropy in support of his appeal to patriotism, in turn, suggests a deep if highly specific and problematic affinity between Christian charity and his love of liberty. The love of liberty in America is noble because liberty is a great good that unites Americans in a common cause that defines justice and the public good. Paradoxically, noble deeds are loved for their own sake because they serve the country; that is, it is somehow good to sacrifice nobly for the greater good. But American patriotism is based on the principle that liberty is a great good for all human beings; the cause of liberty in America ultimately aims at the benefit of mankind. The noble love of liberty thus entails a universal philanthropy that is a root cause of American patriotism. Hamilton may not speak in terms of philanthropy in his own name here, but the issue is whether his love of liberty depends on philanthropy even as his political science uses lower motivations to secure liberty. Consider his proclamation, in “Publius Letter” III of 1778, that he regards a member of congress as the founder of an empire who should rejoice because “fortune had … placed him in circumstances so favourable for promoting human happiness … . [and] to do good to mankind” (I:580). And his concluding rebuttal of detractors of the Constitution in Federalist36: “Happy will it be for ourselves, and most honorable for human nature, if we have wisdom and virtue enough to set so glorious an example to mankind!”1 That spirit of liberal republicanism is exemplified by Paine's call to arms in Common Sense: “O ye that love mankind!…Freedom has been hunted round the globe. O! receive the fugitive, and prepare in time an asylum for mankind” (34). This is the inducement “to form the noblest, purest constitution on the face of the earth” (51).         "
"21","The Declaration's harmonizing appeals to the “Laws of Nature and of Nature's God” and that “all men are created equal,” and “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” that patriots pledge their “sacred Honor” to defend stresses the issue of whether that boldly secular philanthropy can be anything other than a vestige of Christian charity. After all, the spirit of sacrificial devotion to the benefit of others is not obviously based on the Declaration's “self‐evident” truths or liberal assumptions. Locke himself may speak of the public good and the good of mankind, but he makes it clear that they are a means to one's own equal rights and that equality rests on the equal need and rational capacity to secure one's rights (Second Treatise; Chapter 2). But that philanthropy clearly reflects the sacrificial devotion to universal equality, justice, peace, and charity that is a hallmark of biblical teaching (Isaiah 11, 42, 49; Matthew 5; 2 Corinthians 3, 8). To be sure, the Declaration's “Laws” herald its revolutionary liberalism as opposed to a homogenized Christianity, and the letter of the “Laws” is deeply incompatible with biblical teaching. But the love of liberty and mankind that infuses the “Laws” may be even more deeply rooted in the legacy and spirit of Christian charity.1"
"22","Finally, despite his sober view of human nature, Hamilton cannot but identify with and rely on patriotic and philanthropic Americans. In this perspective, self‐interest, patriotism, and philanthropy form a tension‐filled, increasingly tenuous and restricted while also vital ascending order that constitutes the spirit of his liberal republicanism.1 That spirit may be the first wave in the attack and last line of defense in Hamilton's plan to establish a liberal republican empire. It must reconcile the tensions between liberty, nobility, philanthropy, and power, and act as the overarching inducement for Americans to rise above themselves in order to show that “societies of men can establish good government from reflection and choice.”         "
"23","It is now necessary to articulate Hamilton's radically liberal conception of human nature and show its predominate relation to his overall political thought in order to clarify his attempt to harness the conflicting forces of self‐interest, nobility, philanthropy, and power in the service of liberty and republican government."
"24","Hamilton maintains that political science rests on knowledge of human nature, and thus “the most useful of all sciences is the science of human nature” (“Vindication” 1, XI:463). The basic features of human nature define the ends, possibilities, and limitations of government. Thus, in the “Defence of the Funding System,” he avers:"
"25","                        "
"26","… the difference between the true politician and the political‐empyric is this: the latter will … attempt to travel out of human nature and introduce institutions and projects for which man is not fitted… . The true politician … takes human nature (and human society its aggregate) as he finds it, a compound of good and ill qualities… . With this view of human nature he will not attempt to warp or distort it from its natural direction… . (XIX:59)"
"27","The distinction between a “true politician” and a “political‐empiric” parallels the one between “serious expectations” and “wishful thinking” in Federalist 1. A political‐empiric is a “wise and good” politician who, lacking knowledge of human nature, is ignorant of the ends, possibilities, and limits of politics. Whatever their intentions, falsely biased politicians, misled by their imaginations, create conflict, oppression, and misery. Hamilton's “true politician,” in the vein if not the spirit of Machiavelli, avoids the classical and Christian politics of “imaginary republics” by using political science as an “effectual truth” (The Prince, chapter 15; FP 6:59). That sobriety also distinguishes “true politicians” from the utopian revolutionaries of the French Revolution (V: 425).         "
"28","Hamilton's early polemics, the “Full Vindication” and the “Farmer Refuted,” are a good place to begin clarifying his conception of human nature and its relation to his political thought. First and foremost, he adheres to the principles of natural right as advanced by Locke and Hobbes. In the “Full Vindication” he regards “natural rights” as the basis of legitimate government and the crux of the dispute between Great Britain and the American colonies. Thus he intones, “…whence arises that violent antipathy they seem to entertain, not only to the natural rights of mankind; but to common sense… .” And adds: “That they are enemies to the natural rights of mankind is manifest, because they wish to see one part of their species enslaved to another.” And affirms that “…the whole world knows it [the dispute] is built upon this interesting question, whether the inhabitants of Great Britain have a right to dispose of the lives and property of the inhabitants of America or not” (I:46)."
"29","Hamilton's query as to whether or not Americans should stop trading with other British colonists even if it does harm, goes right to liberalism's bottom line:"
"30","                        "
"31","Humanity does not require us to sacrifice our security and welfare to the convenience, or advantage of others. Self preservation is the first principle of our nature. When our lives and properties are at stake, it would be foolish and unnatural to refrain from such measures as might preserve them, because they would be detrimental to others. (I:51)"
"32","Human nature's “first principle” is self‐preservation and this entails property. Reason confirms that individuals are entitled to secure themselves even at the expense of others; indeed, not to do so is “foolish and unnatural.” Freedom secures life and property, and “that Americans are entitled to freedom is incontestable upon every rational principle.” In sum, “all men have one common original: they participate in one common nature, and consequently have one common right. No reason can be assigned why one man should exercise any power, or pre‐eminence over his fellow creatures more than another unless they have voluntary vested him with it” (I:47, 51). Hamilton virtually recites verses 4–20 of chapter 2, “Of the State of Nature,” of Locke's Second Treatise."
"33","Hamilton complicates his position by speaking in terms of humanity, duty, the public good, and Christian morality. For example, he states that “it is indeed a dictate of humanity to contribute to the support of our fellow creatures,” but he carefully adds, “and more especially those who are allied to us by ties of blood, interest, and mutual protection” (I:51). That dictate strengthens in relation to one's own good. Humanity, duty, and charity are weighed against comfortable preservation."
"34","The Reverend Samuel Seabury, a Tory writing as the “Farmer,” denounces Hamilton before the pious farmers of New York: “I wish you had explicitly declared to the public your ideas of the natural rights of mankind”; Seabury avers: “Man in a State of Nature may be considered perfectly free from all restraints of law and government” (1930, 109). He accuses Hamilton of following Hobbes. But Hamilton, in “Farmer Refuted,” defends himself by making Seabury appear as a closet Hobbesian. “There is so strange a similitude between your political principles and those maintained by Mr. Hobbes,” states Hamilton, “that, in judging from them, a person might easily mistake you for a disciple of his. His opinion was exactly coincident with yours, relative to man in the state of nature.” Hamilton then rejects Hobbes by affirming that “the sacred rights of mankind … are written, as with a sun beam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of divinity itself,” and are available, even in the state of nature, to every reasonable individual (I:56).         "
"35","Hamilton, in both tracts, may be earnestly fusing his Christian upbringing with his liberalism or softening his liberalism with religious rhetoric. But, in the light of his explicit Lockean principles and carefully drawn political conclusions, it is telling that, in the “Full Vindication,” he strips away Locke's religious rhetoric and overlooks the tension with his own religious rhetoric. The Farmer taught Hamilton a lesson in prudent speech. He thus infuses his liberal principles in the “Farmer Refuted” with religious rhetoric. Nonetheless, these polemics display the deep tensions in Federalist 1. Hamilton rejects Hobbes in favor of Locke's higher‐toned depiction of the state of nature and confidence in limited popular government as against absolute monarchy, but he follows Locke on points that imply that Hobbes's doctrine is correct over and against classical and Christian dogma. Hamilton's liberal republican position that life, liberty, and property are insecure “while we have no part in making laws” shows that securing natural rights, not civic virtue or charity, “is the primary end of society.” But his devotion to the “sacred rights of mankind” implies nobility and philanthropy. “There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty,” he insists, “that makes human nature rise above itself, in acts of bravery and heroism” (I:156–157). Those traits, instilled by his Christian and classic education, reflect his character as well as his assumptions.1"
"36","Reason vindicates rights, but the way in which human beings tend to secure them displays the requirements of good government. Hamilton believes that the best policy expects the worst. He applies the maxim, advanced by Hume but established by other “political writers,” that “in constructing any system of government … every man ought to be supposed a knave: and have no other end in all his actions but private interest.” Hume regards that as a “just”“political maxim,” but he admits it is strange that a maxim should be true in politics which is false in fact. Yet Hume does not say to what extent that maxim in fact is false. He does say that private men are “generally more honest” than public men, but again, he does not say by how much, and honesty is a policy, not a virtue (I:236). How does Hamilton regard that maxim?“A vast majority of mankind is intensely biased by motives of self interest,” he avers: “Most men are glad to remove burthens off themselves, and place them upon the necks of their neighbours” (I:53). Human nature is “a compound of good and ill qualities,” but even most “honest” private men would harm their neighbors to help themselves, and behave as knaves when left to their own devices. “Everyman” must be supposed a knave because the few may be unrecognizable and government reflects the many. That maxim is more than a practical rule—it is a view of human nature on which Hamilton builds his political thought.1 Thus, he announces to the Convention:         "
"37","                        "
"38","Take mankind in general, they are vicious … Take mankind as they are, and what are they governed by? Their passions. There may be in every government a few choice spirits, who may act from more worthy motives. One great error is that we suppose mankind more honest than they are. Our prevailing passions are ambition and interest; it will ever be the duty of a wise government to avail itself of these passions, in order to make them subservient to the public good… . (IV:216)"
"39","This statement highlights features of Hamilton's conception of human nature. Following Hobbes, Locke, and Hume, he sees passion as the governing characteristic of human nature taken as a whole. Passion thus governs reason as the instrument of particular passions. Passions, by and large, are intensely self‐centered and prompt the narrow, dishonest, or vicious pursuit of interest and ambition.1 Thus, Hamilton queries in Federalist 15: “Why has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint” (110; Leviathan VI, XIII; Second Treatise, III; A Treatise of Human Nature, bk., II, sect. V). By speaking of prevailing passions, he implies Hobbes's view that there is no natural rational order among the passions. The psyche is a compound of conflicting passions and some commonly or precipitously overpower others. In “The Report on Public Credit,” Hamilton thus depicts humans as “subject to particular impulses, passions, prejudices, vices; and of course to inconstancy of views and mutability of conduct” (XVII:94). Political conflict reflects the conflicted soul (Leviathan, VI, VIII, XI, XIII).         "
"40","Hamilton refers to a wide range of typical passions, but the one most often associated with ambition and interest is the “love of power.”“Men love power,” he declares to the Convention (IV:189). What does he mean by the love of power? A helpful passage is found in Federalist 6, where he discusses the “innumerable” causes of hostility. Some causes of hostility generally and almost constantly affect societies: “Of this description are the love of power or the desire of pre‐eminence and dominion—the jealousy of power, or the desire of equality and safety” (54). The love of power is ubiquitous, but it is not a unitary passion; it is composed of two more basic and concrete passions: preeminence and dominion. Dominion is the desire to acquire things and control human beings on a vast scale, and preeminence is the desire to be recognized by many as exceptional. These passions cause general and almost constant hostility because they are gained only at the expense of others.         "
"41","Hamilton's concept of power reflects that of Hobbes. The causes of hostility are as innumerable and constant as the desires. Without any natural order, the passions have no end or limitations aside from the particular force of discrete desires in specific circumstances. Desire, in principle, is unlimited and insatiable. The desire to acquire requires power because, as Hobbes shows, power is the “present means, to acquire some future apparent good.” Because power is needed to secure whatever one desires, “the perpetual and restless desire of power after power” appears “in the first place” as a “general inclination of all mankind.”“A fondness for power is implanted in most men, and it is natural to abuse it, when acquired,” Hamilton avers, “perpetual strides are made after more as long as there is any part withheld” (I:126). He might have added, “that ceases only in death” (Leviathan, X, XI).         "
"42","The love of power and the jealousy of power cause conflict concomitantly. Jealousy of power entails “the desire of equality and safety.” Hamilton, however, neither elaborates the tension between the love and jealousy of power nor explains how jealousy entails desire for equality and safety. Yet his statement in Federalist 1 that “jealousy is the usual concomitant of violent love” suggests that the jealousy of power is an expression of the love of power. The perpetual pursuit of power, in principle, pits one against all. Unequal talents and drives ensure the victory of some over others; still, most will continually strive for some advantage, even if only in a defensive posture. “Power controlled or abridged,” Hamilton adds in Federalist 15, “is almost always the rival and enemy of that power by which it is controlled or abridged.”“Jealousy of power” is a frustrated “love of power,” and the desire for security and equality is a defensive posture of dominion and preeminence.         "
"43","Human beings, in sum, are passionately self‐interested, and society, as the aggregate of human nature, in effect, divides into those avidly pursuing preeminence and dominion and those jealously guarding equality and security. Hamilton's position entails the liberal paradox that unfettered liberty leads to war, but government is a Leviathan composed of powerful human beings who must control themselves as well as the governed to secure the equal rights of all. But that implies the deeper paradox that the defense of equal rights “is a contest for power, not for liberty” (n. 4). The Constitution is a liberal republican solution to both of those problems. But can it channel and check interests and ambition while fostering the noble love of liberty and justice on which it also depends (cf. Madison, FP 10, 51)?         "
"44","True politicians must know the range of ambition and interest. The people's jealous love of liberty and equality and the love of power of politicians can obstruct the public good. Many republican politicians compete to placate the people. The people would often empower only politicians who promise to satisfy their demands. But “the people commonly intend the PUBLIC GOOD” (FP 71:432). Hamilton seeks to pave the road to the public good with private goods that combine their interests with their good intentions. In short, true politicians can beat petty politicians at their own game by raising the stakes as well as the civic awareness and spirit of the people.         "
"45","Hamilton believes that grand politics are beyond most people's interests and abilities. Most confine themselves to their locality where, especially in republican America, the equality of conditions fosters the pursuit of private property and dignity. As long as they feel secure, they gladly place public burdens in the hands of others. Good government gives the people a vested interest in good governors. But at the time of the founding, vested local interests and entrenched state powers, fortified by the people's “republican genius,” ensured that the several states will conflict with each other and militate against a federal government. The Constitution can blunt that spur to war, poverty, and humiliation, but the people must consent (“The Continentalist” no. 1, II: 651, no. 2, II: 656, no. 3, II: 660; FP 32:197).         "
"46","Hamilton warns Americans against faction while assuring them that their natural attachments guard against encroachments on local interests and institutions by a distant federal government.1 In Federalist 17, he observes:         "
"47","                        "
"48","It is a known fact of human nature that its affections are commonly weak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the object. Upon the same principle, a man is more attached to his family than to his neighborhood, and to his neighborhood than to his community at large, the people of each state would be more apt to feel a stronger bias towards their local governments than towards the government of the union; unless the force of that principle should be destroyed by a much better administration of the latter."
"49","But he refrains from concluding that this tendency leads back to self‐interest and strives to realize that administration.1“The government of the Union, like that of each state, must be able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals; and to attract to its support those passions which have the strongest influence upon the human heart” (FP 16:116). Americans of all sections and classes are “absorbed in the pursuit of gain and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and commerce” (FP 8), and heeding Locke's call to founders in book five, paragraph 42, of the Second Treatise, Hamilton employs the political utility of their “commercial genius” (FP 6:106). “Money is, with propriety, considered as the vital principle of the body politic” (FP 30:18). “All orders of men look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their toils” (FP 12:91). The federal government must operate as the nation's economic heart and pump the vital means of prosperity through all its channels. The people will support the Union in return.         "
"50","Hamilton knows that an American republic rests on its principles of patriotism and philanthropy as well as private interests, and that eviscerated local government and avid commerce, especially when rooted in unlimited acquisition of the “precious metals, those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise” (FP 12:91), or the love of money, contradict classical and Christian civic virtue.1 He also knows that unregulated commercial competition, even in commercial republics, breeds war (FP 6). But before the New York Ratification Convention, he announces that it is proper as well as necessary to make new liberal virtues out of old‐fashioned vices:         "
"51","                        "
"52","It is a harsh doctrine, that men grow wicked in proportion as they improve and enlighten their minds. Experience has by no means justified us in the supposition, that there is more virtue in one class of men than another. Look through the rich and the poor of the community; the learned and the ignorant. Where does virtue predominate? The difference indeed consists not in the quantity but in the kind of vices, which are incident to the various classes; and hence the advantage of character belongs to the wealthy, their vices are probably more favorable to the prosperity of the state than those of the indigent; and partake less of moral depravity. (V:43)"
"53","Liberty entails the pursuit of property and dignity, and thus it can foster and dignify rational economic industry and competition. Love of money is boundless, but the extended republic can “multiply the means of gratification” and transform the root of evil in materially strained unstable societies that require the reign of “virtue” into an engine of immense prosperity. “Good men” can now, with propriety, consider money as the vital principle of the body politic and the regulation of property as the principal task of legislation. But not only because property is a natural right—that right is conditional on overcoming scarcity, altered in society, regulated by government, and requires the consent of the people—but because it secures liberty and the public good (Second Treatise, bk. 5, par. 45–50).         "
"54","Hamilton knows that consent is the vital principle behind the body politic. His promotion of commerce as a basic attachment to a federal government that extends representation and diminishes local representative institutions is a civic education as well as a policy. That education directs people away from politics by reinforcing the sense that justice entails minding one's own business. But it also channels and checks politicians by indicating that the business of politics is business. The people's love of liberty mitigates their jealousy of power when politicians represent their interests to stay in power. But is Hamilton's design to liberate America's “commercial genius” deeply compatible with either the “republican genius” or the noble love of liberty that ultimately guide deliberation and choice to the public good?1"
"55","True politicians must know the full range of ambition, and they must know themselves. Hamilton's hopes rest on resolving the paradox of the “true politician.”"
"56","Politicians seek political power and cause the most dangerous conflicts. Constitutional restraints may control the effects but cannot extinguish the causes of conflict because they are rooted in human nature (cf. Madison, FP 51). The love of political power intensifies and expands conflict because the means of gratification cannot be multiplied to satisfy demand. In principle, political ambition anticipates dominion and preeminence. Distrusting professions of philanthropy and patriotism, Hamilton thus unmasks the imperialism of the French Republic in “The Warning” 1:         "
"57","                        "
"58","… the specious pretense of enlightening mankind and reforming their civil institutions, is the varnish on the real design of subjugating them… ."
"59","Men, well informed and unprejudiced, early discovered … this spirit. Reasoning from human nature they foresaw its growth with success. That from the love of dominion inherent in the heart of man, the rulers of the most powerful nation in the world, whether a monarch, a committee of safety, or a directory, will forever aim at undue empire over other nations. (XX:490)"
"60","Hamilton sees the resistance of many leaders of state and local governments to the Constitution as “a contest for power, not for liberty” (n. 4). This contest, above and beyond sectional interests and debatable republican principles, ensures that the disunited states will, sooner or later, reap the same misfortunes as war‐torn Europe. Safety as well as liberty requires a government that can keep the peace against contending powers within and without the gates, and safety is the first principle of human nature. “Even the ardent love of liberty will give way to its dictates,” and the people may “resort to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe, they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free” (FP 8:67).1 Liberty thus rests on the ability to persuade the people to put their liberties in the hands of a relatively few politicians invested with power in an untested republican empire. But why trust the leaders of an American empire?         "
"61","The Constitution's executive office brings this problem to a head. After all, a powerful executive is clearly necessary to ruling an empire and thus, as Hamilton argues, to running a republican empire. But for those same reasons, as Hamilton admits, it seems clearly incompatible with liberty and republican government (FP 70–72). The danger of concentrating executive powers in the hands of one person for a long time is stressed as well as addressed by the Constitution's structure. The executive is removed from the people by the electoral college, designed to attract ambitious as well as capable politicians, and to check and balance them by inciting their ambition (cf. FP 51).1 Why would great politicians serve the people?         "
"62","Hamilton speaks of the few choice spirits who have more worthy motivations than ambition or interest. What are they? While defining presidential powers, he states: “The best security for the fidelity of mankind is to make their interest coincide with their duty” (FP 72). Ordinarily, honor prompts public service by requiring politicians to court the good opinion of others. But honor can be won in service to a faction and it anticipates preeminence or the “love of fame.” Can fame prompt public spirit?“The love of fame,” Hamilton avers, “is the ruling passion of the noblest minds,” and “would prompt a man to undertake extensive and arduous enterprises for the public benefit” (437). Even the noblest minds are ruled by a desire for their own good and govern to win fame. But fame prompts public service because it rests on public opinion on a grand scale. The love of fame impels politicians to rise above fad and faction and to labor farsightedly for the public good in the hope of being celebrated or even venerated by generations yet unborn. The love of fame thus channels and checks true politicians by forming a coincidence of interests between them and the public good. Fame is won by founding glorious empires. Thus, young Hamilton rejoices because “fortune had … placed him in circumstances so favourable for promoting human happiness … [and] to do good to mankind” by becoming “most illustrious” as “the founder of an [American] empire.” When he links the Constitution to the fate of an American empire and mankind he anticipates the fame of its founders. But is fame, patriotism, or the benefit of mankind Hamilton's defining goal?1"
"63","Hamilton's love of fame clarifies his concept of the relative natures and ends of “true” and “false” politicians. A key lies in the love of power. Some politicians live for preeminence, and others for dominion. “Institutions that would serve his own purpose,” Hamilton says of Aaron Burr in a letter to James Ross, “not such as would promise lasting prosperity or glory to the Country would be his choice because he cares only for himself and nothing for his Country or glory”; “he has but one principle, to get power” (XXV:280). Yet Hamilton does not identify patriotism with fame inasmuch as he blames Burr for lacking principles as well. “Let it be remembered,” he warns James Bayard, “that Mr. Burr has never appeared solicitous for fame, & that great ambition unchecked by principle, or the love of glory, is an unruly Tyrant” (XXV:323). Hamilton's love of fame reflects the principles that vindicate patriotism and philanthropy in America. Fame, as the ruling passion of the noblest minds, entails “the noble enthusiasm of liberty” and the benefit of mankind. The “noblest minds,” then, love liberty the most and seek fame as founders in the service of mankind.         "
"64","Hamilton maintains that “in all struggles for liberty” there are two principal types of politicians. The first are “those who, to a conviction of the real usefulness of civil liberty, join in a sincere attachment to the public good.” Paralleling his appeal to Publius, he depicts the guardian of liberty as “Cato” (V:269). And the second “are turbulent spirits, impatient of all power and superiority which they do not themselves enjoy.” Lacking a love of fame, conviction of the real usefulness of civil liberty, and sincere attachment to the public good, such turbulent spirits turn from demagogues to tyrants. Hamilton, in “The Vindication” no. 1, declares that “Every republic at all times has its Catalines and Caesars” (XI:463), and Burr is “as true a Cataline as ever met in a midnight conclave”(XXV:58). The truly critical political contest, then, is not between politicians and the people, but between “Cato” and “Caesar.”“It has been aptly observed that Cato was the tory—Caesar the whig of his day,” warns Hamilton in “The Objection” no. XIV: “The former frequently resisted—the latter always flattered the follies of the people. Yet the former perished with the republic, the latter destroyed it” (XII:252). In republics, liberty depends on the capacity of the people to choose their leaders well. True politicians know well that demagogues who would be tyrants lurk in every republic and guard against that danger to the public good.         "
"65","Hamilton implies that the mutually reinforcing inducements of love of fame, liberty, and the public good keep great politicians on track. But his claim that fame is the ruling passion of the noblest minds both compounds and brings the tensions in his thought to a head. First of all, “true politicians”“join in a sincere attachment to the public good”from“a conviction of the real usefulness of civil liberty.” Civil liberty and republicanism remain the useful means to secure natural rights; and yet “sincere attachment” implies that the public good and liberty are noble and good. But if the love of fame defines the noblest minds, would not clear‐sighted politicians sacrifice all else to winning fame? Can they really believe that sacrificing for the liberty or benefit of others is noble, especially if equal rights boil down to power and self‐interest? Can fame and dominion remain morally distinguishable in these terms? Machiavelli's first principle of founders in chapter 15 of The Prince—dominion and preeminence are necessary and good for oneself—lurks behind Hamilton's love of fame and blurs the line between “Cato” and “Caesar.” Cato chastened the people and fell honorably serving the republic; Caesar flattered them, but Caesar loved fame, and his rise reduced a republic whose agony was the birth pang of a grand and glorious empire.1 Who today remembers Cato?         "
"66","Hamilton does not draw Machiavelli's conclusion. But that indicates that his love of fame is subordinate to his love of liberty, and his love of liberty, in turn, is a manifestation of his nobility and philanthropy."
"67","America shows that “societies of men can establish good government from reflection and choice.” But Americans are also fortunate: the founders are celebrated because they had the chance to prove their virtue; they were virtuous because they loved liberty and the public good as well as fame. The Constitution is a republican solution to complex moral and political problems rooted in human nature and displayed throughout the history of government. Hamilton rejects classical republican and Christian principles in favor of Machiavelli's effectual truth, Hobbes's concept of power, Lockean liberty, and his own science of politics. Hamilton's liberal conception of human nature as passionately self‐interested grounds his political science. But Hamilton's synthesis of alternatives in modern political thought displays its limits by depending on nobility and philanthropy. Classical and Christian virtues thus infuse his conception of human nature and bolster the Republic. Whether the spirits of liberty, nobility, philanthropy, and power can continue to harmonize as a chorus of the better angels of our nature is an open question. Americans have the right to alter their government according to the principles that seem likely to secure their happiness. But safeguarding the rights of individuals marching to the beat of their own drum requires more than vigilance. Civic deliberation about the best principles for today in the light of the principles that made government by the deliberation and choice of the people possible remains a condition of liberty. Who remembers Caesar?"
