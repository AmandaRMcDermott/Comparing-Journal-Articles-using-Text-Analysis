"1","We analyze what Cox (1987, chap. 8) calls “threats of dissolution,” where the legislative defeat of the executive leads to a new election, rather than “threats of resignation,” where the legislative defeat of the executive leads to a new round of government formation without an election. Both procedures are different facets of the power of chief executives in many parliamentary democracies to fuse the passage of legislation with the survival of the government through a vote of confidence. The model focuses on the common situation in which no single party has a majority in parliament.         "
"2","Consider a parliamentary democracy with two pivotal partisan actors, the prime minister (P) and a veto player (V), who bargain over policy. In line with the veto player framework (e.g., Tsebelis 2002), V can be a coalition partner or, in the context of a minority government, an opposition party whose support is needed to enact policy. P has the constitutional power to dissolve the parliament and call a new election, but P's vote alone is not sufficient to enact legislation. Importantly, V has veto power over policy, reflecting that policymaking is by majority vote (rather than executive decree), but not over parliamentary dissolution, reflecting the constitutional prerogative of P.5 We assume that policy conflict is over the allocation of a fixed set of resources whose value is normalized to 1. The divide‐the‐dollar structure builds on the well‐known legislative model of Baron and Ferejohn (1989) and its various extensions (e.g., Diermeier and Feddersen 1998). It captures the prevalence of distributive conflicts in policymaking and the central problem in multiparty parliamentary democracies that parties with divergent interests need to find common ground to make laws (Martin and Vanberg 2005). Following well‐known models of coalition governance and termination (Lupia and Strøm 1995), the game starts after a government has been formed and in the wake of a potentially critical change in public opinion but before the constitution requires a new election.6 At the beginning of the game, there exists an initial compromise policy . Accordingly, P obtains a share of x and V a share of  of the resource. The initial compromise provides a summary statistic for the bargaining strength of P's party before a public opinion shock takes place. It can be interpreted to capture P's influence over the initial coalition agreement (Müller and Strøm 2008), P's control of the relevant ministry drafting the proposal (Laver and Shepsle 1996), the ability to monitor coalition partners (Thies 2001), and the ability to control committees, amendments (Heller 2001), or floor votes.7 The subsequent sequence of interactions is as follows:               "
"3","The partisan actors are motivated by the policy outcome of the legislative process and the expected electoral benefits of a new election.9 Naturally, in this framework, players' initial policy benefits are their share of resources obtained under the adopted policy. In case there is no agreement, the exogenous status quo allocation, q, is implemented. We assume that electoral performance matters for future coalition negotiations. In case of an early election, a party that wins seats has better chances (but no guarantee) to get desirable outcomes (i.e., cabinet positions and policy) than a party that loses seats. Recent studies provide a solid empirical foundation for this view.10 These electoral considerations are captured by a parameter, ϕ, for the relative public support for P compared to V. A positive (negative) value of ϕ indicates a good (bad) electoral outlook, as measured by a credible opinion poll, for P and a bad (good) outlook for V at a given time. If there is an election, this is translated into a parliamentary seat distribution. Public opinion is thought of as an unbiased but noisy predictor of parliamentary seats. The outcome of the subsequent negotiations is also subject to uncertainty. Hence, we interpret ϕ as the expected value of the benefits derived from a shift in electoral support in future negotiations.11 This matters most when an election occurs. If there is no dissolution, ϕ is discounted by the time, , remaining until the constitutional end of the term. Looking forward from the current distribution of public support to a long term without an early dissolution, the expected balance of public support at the regularly scheduled election converges to 0, which reflects the underlying structure of partisan support in the absence of short‐term popularity shocks. This formulation captures that popular prime ministers cannot take for granted that their public support will remain as high in the future. Many government decisions entail the risk of generating electoral liabilities, and scandals or external events may also undermine their popularity, especially among swing voters. Altogether, the utility of P is as follows:               "
"4","The model captures that P, when deciding whether to make a dissolution threat, does not have perfect information about the preferences of V. Realistically, the veto player has private information about how much it values a new election relative to accepting P's proposal and maintaining the government. Substantively, the uncertainty implies that any dissolution threat is a gamble that may lead to a new election. Thus, prime ministers may overplay their hand and lose the legislative gamble.12 Formally, this logic is incorporated into V's utility as in standard probabilistic voting models:               "
"5","Hence, V accepts a proposal b if  and rejects it otherwise, where ε measures the unobserved (by P) component of the benefit V derives from rejecting the proposal. While P does not observe ε when making the proposal, P has beliefs that are captured by a distribution function. For simplicity, we suppose that ε is uniformly distributed on the interval  with  (e.g., see Persson, Roland, and Tabellini 2000).            "
"6","If P decides to make a dissolution threat, V accepts any proposal b that makes it at least weakly better off than the expected outcome from a dissolution. This is the case if V's share, , is sufficiently large. Otherwise, V rejects the proposal. Thus, V is more willing to accept unfavorable policy proposals when public opinion is in favor of P. Similarly, an undesirable status quo policy increases the willingness of V to accept policies that favor P. Responding to V's optimal acceptance strategy, P formulates its bargaining strategy. This requires considering what would be the utility‐maximizing proposal based on the dissolution threat and whether this makes P better off than accepting the initial compromise x. As P is uncertain about how V will evaluate the costs and benefits of a dissolution over accepting, there always is a positive probability that a dissolution threat triggers a new election. The ex ante probability of a rejection declines as the proposal becomes more accommodating to V (smaller b). In the unique subgame perfect equilibrium, public opinion, the ex ante bargaining position of P, and the status quo determine the use of dissolution threats in legislative bargaining. Proposition 1 summarizes the equilibrium strategies for all possible values of the public opinion shock ϕ. A formal proof is in the supporting information. The intuition can be illustrated with the help of Figure 1.               "
"7","Proposition 1.The equilibrium strategy profile is as follows:                     "
"8","Veto Player (V): Accept b if . Else, reject b.                           "
"9","Recall that P's ex ante bargaining position is captured by x, which measures the share of the resource P obtains without invoking a dissolution threat. Suppose there are T periods remaining before the constitution requires a new election. The shaded area in Figure 1 indicates the combinations of public opinion and initial bargaining position for which P will make a dissolution threat to achieve a better policy outcome.13 When P's ex ante bargaining position is strong (e.g.,  in Figure 1), there are few incentives to make a threat regardless of public opinion. Even if public opinion is highly favorable to P (e.g., ), accepting the initial policy compromise is better than the gamble of a dissolution threat, which entails the risk of foregoing an attractive policy outcome and of losing office. When P's ex ante bargaining position is relatively weak (e.g., ), there are stronger incentives to make a threat. This is only credible, however, when public opinion indicates sufficiently good electoral prospects for P. When public support for P is relatively low (e.g., ), V will not fear an election and will be unwilling to make significant policy concessions. But when P's electoral prospects are good (e.g., ), it can credibly threaten with a dissolution to extract policy concessions from V.            "
"10","Importantly, the time left until a mandatory election conditions the bargaining value of public opinion. The main intuition is that when there is less time left, dissolution threats have less bite. If an election has to be held today, V has no incentives to make policy concessions to a popular prime minister because it can buy no extra time. In this case, faced with a threat, the best response for V is to wait and see how the election and subsequent negotiations play out. While P may be able to translate good electoral performance into policy gains, V does not benefit from making preemptive concessions. If there is more time remaining and the polls currently favor P, then it may pay for V to accept some redistribution toward P. Doing so entails the outlook that a currently popular government leader may decline in popularity as the term progresses. Hence, the immediate policy value of an opinion shift favoring the prime minister is higher when there is more time remaining. To see the role of time graphically, Figure 1 also depicts dissolution threats when there is less time remaining than in the case discussed above (). It illustrates that positive electoral outlook for P () is most valuable for legislative bargaining with more (T) rather than less () time remaining. With less time remaining, even relatively weak (e.g., ) and popular (e.g., ) prime ministers may not find it beneficial to make a threat. Given an election must be held soon, the difference between current opinion polls and the final election outcome is likely to be small. Hence, V will not be willing to deviate much from the initial agreement in exchange for postponing the election just a little more. Holding other things constant, a dissolution threat is more likely when P faces favorable rather than unfavorable polls. When there is a negative electoral outlook for P (), a dissolution threat becomes more likely if there is less time remaining. When P's initial bargaining position is bad and there is little time remaining in the term, P has little to lose from making a risky threat.            "
"11","The literature points out that there may be electoral costs for prime ministers who use a heavy‐handed approach in legislative bargaining. For example, this may signal to voters that the government is weak or disrespectful of elected representatives (Huber 1996b, 275). Calling an early election may also indicate that worse times lie ahead (Smith 1996). To capture these considerations, the models of Huber (1996b) and Strøm and Swindle (2002) assume that prime ministers have to pay an exogenous electoral cost for making a proposal or dissolving parliament. It is straightforward to analyze how adding exogenous costs influences dissolution threats. Intuitively, they make it less attractive for prime ministers to invoke a threat. In Figure 1, this corresponds to a downward shift of the threshold below which threats occur. If the costs are very high, prime ministers' formal power has no practical value and threats never occur. For less extreme values, costs do not change the nature of the trade‐off. Note also that exogenous costs are not needed to explain why dissolution threats often do not occur. In many situations, they are simply not desirable for the executive or not credible.            "
"12","In sum, the analysis highlights that the policy value of dissolution power crucially depends on parties' expected electoral performance and that this relationship varies by context. In contrast to models of legislative bargaining that treat each vote over policy as a vote over the survival of the government (e.g., Diermeier and Feddersen 1998), our model suggests that prime ministers have incentives to invoke their dissolution power to influence bargaining in some situations but not in others. Their strategic calculus is shaped by public opinion, prior legislative strength, and the time left until an election has to be called. Given a positive electoral context, prime ministers who are in a weak legislative position can use their dissolution power to influence policy in their favor. In this case, the outcome may be a policy compromise rather than an early election. The importance of changes in public opinion across parties differs from theories that emphasize the importance of electoral position‐taking in explaining the use of termination threats in lawmaking (Huber 1996b). Moreover, dissolution threats do not generally become more likely when a mandatory election approaches. In contrast to the common notion that coalition and minority governments are prone to stalemate and slow to respond to exogenous shocks, the existence of dissolution power means that they may implement policy change despite significant distributional conflicts among parties and without actually triggering an early election. Their ability to do so, however, depends on electoral context.            "
"13","The empirical analysis examines whether public opinion, the legislative strength of the government, and time left in the term interact to shape threats of dissolution, as implied by the theoretical model. To conduct such a test, we have constructed an original measure of dissolution threats in Denmark between 1974 and 2011 and merged it with public opinion and legislative data."
"14","For the purpose of testing the theoretical logic, focusing on a single parliamentary democracy over time has the advantage of holding the institutional environment constant while examining how variation in the legislative strength and popular support of prime ministers shapes their use of dissolution threats. This research design controls for differences in political institutions, history, and culture and follows studies that examine the impact of public opinion on election timing (e.g., Smith 2003).            "
"15","Given its constitutional structure, party system, and available public opinion data, the parliamentary democracy of Denmark provides an especially good context to study dissolution threats. According to its 1953 constitution, prime ministers have power to dissolve the unicameral parliament (Folketinget) practically at any time and elections have to be held at least every four years (Damgaard 2000). Parliament is the only institutional veto player in the legislative process. The proportional electoral system with a low threshold of 2% has fostered and maintained a system where no single party alone has won a majority of seats. The high level of legislative fragmentation means that prime ministers, who are the leaders of their parties, always have to compromise with other parties to make laws. This is a context where prime ministers have the power and may have the incentives to use dissolution threats to influence policy.14 Moreover, the frequent occurrence of minority governments provides a good opportunity to observe public threats because important legislative conflicts tend to take place outside the cabinet. With the exception of a brief interlude (1993–94), governments did not have a majority of legislative seats. While the logic of the theoretical model is not restricted to minority governments, they provide a useful testing ground.15 In contrast to majority coalitions, most minority governments do not have comprehensive legislative agreements but need to seek support for policies with nongovernment parties on a more variable basis (Strøm 1990, 95). These negotiations differ from intracabinet bargaining in that they pit the cabinet, which is collectively responsible to parliament and has incentives to maintain discipline,16 against a party (or a group of parties) that is not, thus making the process more openly adversarial.            "
"16","We focus on the period between 1974 and 2011. The 1973 election, where the number of parties in parliament doubled from five to ten, is considered an important breakpoint for the party system that increased the problem of achieving policy consensus (Pedersen 1987, 16). Importantly, the period covers substantial variation in the partisan composition and legislative strength of governments. There were prime ministers from three different parties: Conservatives (1982–93), Liberals (1974, 2002–11), and Social Democrats (1975–82, 1993–2001).            "
"17","We identify public dissolution threats by prime ministers based on news reports in major Danish newspapers, complemented with leading international newspapers. This approach is best suited to measure dissolution threats because media reports cover but are not restricted to newsworthy statements made by prime ministers on the floor of parliament. It is important to cast a wide net because in Denmark, the procedure for declaring a policy issue a question of government survival exists by convention but is not formalized in a parliamentary procedure. This is similar to several older parliamentary democracies, often with monarchs as the head of state. The prime minister can declare any legislative issue important enough to merit a new election, and such a threat may even be voiced outside parliament. Indeed, we have found that prime ministers have used different extraparliamentary venues, such as trade union or party conferences and interviews with journalists, to make dissolution threats."
"18","The main difficulty with this approach is that dissolution threats may not be crystal clear. In his landmark study of the emergence of cabinet government in Britain, Cox (1987, 84) writes that dissolution threats throughout most of the 20th century were implicit. But as the quote at the beginning of this article illustrates and we show more systematically, in Denmark prime ministers have explicitly and publicly made dissolution threats in legislative bargaining. Danish prime ministers, like politicians elsewhere, can be reluctant to appear too eager to use their dissolution power for opportunistic purposes (for a discussion of Britain, see Smith 2004, 22). They often accompany a threat with an eloquent explanation that it is not made lightheartedly. Whatever the rhetorical justification, prime ministers have made it clear on numerous occasions that the consequence of insufficient legislative support of their policy will be an early election. As the possibility of a new election is front‐page news and we have used inclusive search terms and covered multiple sources, we are confident that the methodology does not systematically underreport public threats. The careful content analysis of the thus identified news reports guards against false positives.17"
"19","Altogether, we have identified 21 dissolution threats over a period of 38 years. Figure 2 gives a sense of their distribution over time. Dissolution threats are not everyday events and tend to be used in major policy conflicts. They were more frequent during the politically more turbulent 1970s and 1980s (Elklit 1999), but they have occurred in all decades and have been employed by all six prime ministers who were in power during the period of study.18 The dependent variable in the analysis is an indicator for whether the prime minister issues a dissolution threat in a given quarter of a particular year (Dissolution Threat). Using quarter as the unit of analysis captures variation over the life of a government.19"
"20","To capture the expected electoral consequences of an early election, we draw on nationally representative public opinion surveys that measure the political support of political parties and were conducted by the same institute (Gallup) during frequent but uneven intervals throughout the period of study. The results from these surveys have been published in the Danish media as the Gallup political index. They were common knowledge to party leaders at the time. Using these data, we have constructed the variable Government Public Support. It measures the expected vote share of the incumbent government party or coalition. The underlying survey question has remained constant and is as follows (our translation): “Which party would you vote for if there was a general election tomorrow?” In the case of coalition governments, government public support is the sum of expected vote shares of all government parties.20"
"21","Similarly, the incumbent government's legislative bargaining position is proxied by its seat share in parliament (Government Seat Share)— what Strøm (1990) calls the parliamentary basis of the government and Cheibub (2007) calls the government's legislative support. It indicates how many additional legislative votes the government needs to pass policy. The third explanatory variable suggested by the theoretical model is Time Until Term Ends. It measures the number of quarters left until the constitution requires a new election.            "
"22","To account for possible confounders not made explicit in the theoretical model, the statistical analysis controls for several additional variables. Throughout, we control for the ideological distance between the party of the prime minister and the closest marginal party needed for a legislative majority. Ideological Distance was calculated using the left‐right summary variable from the widely used party manifesto data coded by the Comparative Manifesto Project (Klingemann et al. 2006) and rescaled to vary between 0 and 1. In the veto player framework, ideological polarization is a proxy for the difficulty of changing the status quo, and the literature has found that it predicts the number of laws (Tsebelis 2002), delays, and amendments in the lawmaking process (Martin and Vanberg 2004, 2005), as well as parliamentary dissolutions (Diermeier and Stevenson 1999). To rule out that the impact of public opinion or government seat share is driven by party differences, we also add indicator variables for the party of the prime minister (Social Democratic, Liberal, or Conservative). To control for the possibility that the more frequent use of dissolution threats earlier in the period of observation was driven by an unmeasured time trend rather than the variables emphasized by the theoretical model, we control for a linear year trend. Some specifications also include a lagged dependent variable to allow the possibility that the use of dissolution threats reflects a relatively persistent condition not otherwise captured.            "
"23","Given the binary nature of the dependent variable, the theoretical model suggests the estimation of a binary choice model that regresses the probability of a Dissolution Threat in a given quarter on Government Public Support, Government Seat Share, Time Until Term Ends, and a vector of control variables. Importantly, the argument implies an interactive specification that includes the three‐way multiplicative interaction between Government Public Support, Government Seat Share, and Time Until Term Ends, as well as all constituent terms.            "
"24","Table 1 reports the basic estimation results from a series of logit regressions. Model 1 reports the coefficient estimates for the additive benchmark specification where the three main variables are not interacted. Models 2‐6 include the full set of interaction terms and sequentially add control variables. The results of Model 1 are precisely estimated and appear consistent with the notion that more popular governments are more likely to make dissolution threats. Better capturing the theoretical logic, the interactive Models 2–6 are clearly in line with the hypothesis that the impact of public opinion is dependent on government seat share and parliamentary time. Adding the interaction terms improves the model fit, as measured by Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), in all specifications (recall that AIC imposes a penalty for additional variables). The sign of the theoretically relevant variables is the same across models and statistically significant for each model.21"
"25","To provide a substantive interpretation of the results from the interactive specification, Table 2 reports the predicted probabilities of a dissolution threat for four theoretically relevant combinations of the legislative strength (weak, strong) and public support (popular, unpopular) of the government. A weak (strong) government is defined as a government that has a relatively low (high) seat share at the 25th (75th) percentile of all governments. Similarly, a popular (unpopular) government has high (low) public support at the 75th (25th) percentile (descriptive statistics are in the supporting information). As suggested by the theoretical model, Table 2 shows that the predicted probability of a dissolution threat is highest, about 0.65, when the prime minister's government is weak but is popular in the polls. It is considerably lower (by about two‐thirds) for governments that are weak and unpopular. Governments that are strong have practically a zero threat probability. A naive model suggests that popular governments should always try to convert their good electoral prospects into favorable policy outcomes using dissolution threats. In line with the strategic bargaining model, the results suggest that this is not the case.            "
"26","The theoretical model also suggests that the time to the next mandatory election matters. In particular, for weak governments, favorable public opinion will be more valuable earlier rather than later in the term, and this should translate into a higher probability of a threat when there is more time left. In line with the theoretical prediction, Panel (a) in Figure 3 shows that the estimation results imply that prime ministers of weak but popular governments are more likely to use dissolution threats early rather than late in the term.22 This finding underscores the theoretical point that the value of dissolution power lies in its discretionary nature. Early in the term, popular prime ministers can extract greater policy concessions from unpopular parties, which are better off making concessions than facing a new election. Later in the term, as elections become inevitable, the value of dissolution power is lower. Panel (b) shows that while prime ministers of weak and unpopular governments are less likely to use dissolution threats, they are more likely to do so later in the term. The theoretical model suggests that these cases are driven by prime ministers gambling to make the best out of a gloomy situation. Note that these findings are not at odds with the result in the literature that the risk of dissolution tends to increase as the next mandatory election approaches (Diermeier and Stevenson 1999, 2000). As we focus on a different dependent variable than studies of cabinet termination, we exclude snap elections that were called without prior notice. Moreover, our finding is that the use of dissolution threats early in the term is contingent on popular support and current legislative strength, not that they generally occur early in the term. As suggested by the theoretical model, many dissolution threats do not lead to an early election (only 29% do). Interestingly, the nonparametric estimation of the dissolution risk by Diermeier and Stevenson (2000, 637) reveals a nonmonotonicity, with an increase early and late in the life of cabinets. This seems consistent with the context‐sensitive use of dissolution threats uncovered here.23"
"27","In 1974, the prime minister and leader of the Liberal party, Poul Hartling, took a gamble. He threatened to dissolve the parliament and call a new election unless it accepted an economic reform package that included significant cuts in income taxes (recall the citation at the beginning of the article). Hartling promoted the policies as part of the solution to the macroeconomic crisis marked by high inflation, unemployment, and fiscal imbalances. In numerical terms, Hartling's government was remarkably weak. He came to office a year after the “earthquake election” that doubled the number of parties in parliament from five to ten, and his single‐party minority cabinet was based on only 22 out of 179 seats (Damgaard 2000, 234). Hartling managed to form a single‐party government in a situation when most other party leaders were reluctant to do so. Given the Danish constitutional principle of negative parliamentarism, forming a government only required that there was no majority willing to topple it. But to pass policy, the minority government needed the support of at least two other parties, and the prime minister found it difficult to achieve consensus on the response to the economic crisis. In this situation, public opinion provided a silver lining. It showed an increase in the popularity of the prime minister's party, suggesting that in an election it would gain several seats and become the second largest party. It was uncertain, however, whether this would be enough to allow the formation of a centrist coalition government under the leadership of Hartling or whether the Social Democrats, the largest parliamentary party, would be able to take the lead. Taking a gamble, the prime minister pushed for the tax reform. After three weeks of intense negotiations, the government had not managed to secure a clear majority. During the early stages of the negotiations, Hartling hinted at the possibility of an early election if there was no agreement but emphasized that the government preferred a negotiated result. In the end, however, he made it unmistakably clear that failure to reach an agreement would lead to an early election, and the government put its proposal up for a final vote in parliament.24 The government won the vote with a razor‐thin majority.            "
"28","Three months later, the government presented a follow‐up economic policy package that included a contested wage freeze to combat double‐digit inflation. Again, Prime Minister Hartling threatened to call a new election in the absence of legislative support for his policy: “This [plan] has not been presented to get an election. The plan is presented to have it passed but if we do not get the necessary support, naturally, we are ready to draw the consequence” (Berlingske Tidende 1974b, 1). The plan was rejected by the Social Democrats and received a chilly reception from some of the smaller parties. In response, the prime minister called an election, this time before scheduling a final vote in parliament, announcing that it was necessary to give voters the chance to elect a parliament that would approve the needed policies. In the election, the Liberals gained 20 seats but narrowly lost (by one vote) the control of government. As a result, the policy was not passed. The sources agree that Hartling was willing to make a tough take‐it‐or‐leave‐it proposal because he expected that his party would perform well in an early election. These two examples illustrate that prime ministers without a clear majority but with good standing in the opinion polls may use an early election as a bargaining chip. They also highlight the political uncertainty politicians face and that the outcome may be an early election rather than a policy compromise.            "
"29","The next case illustrates that dissolution threats are not restricted to economic policy. Being short of a legislative majority less than half a year after the previous election, Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen made a dissolution threat in 2008 to advance the immigration agenda proposed by his coalition government. The minority Liberal‐Conservative government and the right‐wing populist Danish People's Party had agreed upon a modest liberalization of asylum policies, but they were short of a legislative majority at this point and the center‐left opposition parties wanted more far‐reaching reforms. In particular, the small centrist New Alliance party had campaigned on a platform to improve the living conditions of asylum seekers. Among other things, it no longer wanted children and their parents to live in asylum camps while their case was being considered. Public opinion showed that in the case of an early election, New Alliance would fall below the 2% electoral threshold and that the government could achieve a majority together with its support party. In this situation, the prime minister announced that he would have to dissolve parliament unless a solution close to the government proposal was found. Subsequently, members of the government introduced a confidence motion into parliament, leaving a choice between supporting its policy position or triggering an early election. Facing electoral extinction, the New Alliance supported the government. Making concessions to avoid an early election paid off electorally for the New Alliance. At the next election three years later, it nearly doubled its number of seats (from five to nine)."
"30","The power of chief executives to call an early election is a core feature of many parliamentary democracies. However, its consequences for legislative bargaining are little understood. This article takes a theoretical and an empirical step to address this shortcoming. We have developed a model to show analytically under which electoral and legislative conditions chief executives will invoke their dissolution power to influence policy. The theoretical analysis implies that chief executives' ability to make credible dissolution threats to extract policy concessions from other parties is shaped to an important degree by their current legislative support, public opinion, and the time before a mandatory election. The model highlights, among other things, that the impact of public opinion on threats varies by context. The analysis of the first data set of dissolution threats in a parliamentary democracy has found evidence in line with key implications of the theoretical model. The positive findings stand in contrast to the relatively poor record of institutional theories in predicting the use of the confidence procedures (Huber 1996a, 107–8). They provide fairly direct evidence of the usefulness of a strategic bargaining approach to the study of parliamentary governance in the shadow of dissolution power, complementing existing evidence based on dissolutions (Diermeier and Stevenson 1999, 2000). More generally, they confirm the importance of public opinion for executive‐legislative relations in the parliamentary system. This is an area where systematic empirical studies are scarce despite the clear sense that fluctuations in public support should affect bargaining power (Laver 2006).         "
"31","The empirical analysis has focused on a particular country, Denmark, that provides a good research design for evaluating implications of the theoretical model. This approach puts a premium on internal validity. Testing these implications requires comparable data on dissolution threats that had not been previously collected. While the theoretical argument is not specific to Denmark, one question is whether the empirical results will travel beyond its borders. Denmark's political system certainly has idiosyncratic features, but the theoretically relevant constitutional and political context variables are similar to those of several other parliamentary democracies, where prime ministers have dissolution power and policymaking frequently requires compromise between parties. For examples, consider Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand (since 1996), or Spain."
"32","Our analysis has implications for recent changes in constitutional design that tend toward limiting prime ministers' power to call early elections. One prominent example is the United Kingdom, where the Fixed‐Term Parliaments Act of 2011 no longer allows the prime minister to call snap elections. Parliament may still be dissolved if it passes a vote of no confidence in the government and there is no majority for an alternative government, though the reform considerably curtails the discretion of the prime minister to make threats. In Canada, there were less far‐reaching reforms at the federal and provincial level. These fixed‐term election laws do not curtail dissolutions in the wake of legislative defeat, and, under the new law, governments have successfully dissolved the legislature accordingly. Our results suggest that reforms that do not limit dissolution threats connected to confidence votes are unlikely to fundamentally change who gets what in legislative bargaining."
