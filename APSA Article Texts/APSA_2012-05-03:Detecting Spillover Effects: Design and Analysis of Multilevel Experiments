"1","The Rubin Causal Model (Rubin 1974, 1978, 1980) defines the effect of a treatment on individual i as the difference between two potential outcomes: the outcome Y1i that manifests when this individual receives the treatment (t= 1) and the corresponding outcome Y0i when the treatment is withheld (t= 0). Randomized experiments are often motivated and interpreted using this framework. When individuals are randomly assigned to experimental groups and when the potential outcomes for a given individual are unaffected by the experimental assignments of other individuals, the difference in average outcomes between the treatment and control groups provides an unbiased estimate of the true average treatment effect.2"
"2","The unbiasedness of simple difference‐in‐means estimation breaks down when potential outcomes for experimental subjects are influenced by the treatments assigned to others. Rather than characterize an individual’s potential outcome (Y0i or Y1i) solely in terms of the experimental treatment that he or she receives, one must consider all of the potential outcomes that could occur when different combinations of subjects are treated. A more complete notation would allow for the consequences for subject i of treatments t1, t2, …, ti−1, ti+1, …, tn, where subscripts index subjects 1 to n and where ti refers to the treatment administered directly to the subject i. For any reasonably large experiment, the number of potential outcomes for each subject becomes extremely large.         "
"3","In order to appreciate the potential for bias when SUTVA violations occur, consider the case of an experimental vaccination campaign (cf. Haber 1999; Halloran and Struchiner 1991, 1995; Hudgens and Halloran 2006; Miguel and Kremer 2004). Subject 1, a person who receives no vaccination but who is surrounded by other subjects who are vaccinated, is likely to have a different outcome than Subject 2, someone who is unvaccinated and is surrounded by other unvaccinated subjects. Both subjects are nominally part of the same experimental group, but the allocation of other subjects affects their potential outcomes. In an extreme case in which virtually everyone in the experiment receives the vaccine, the few stray unvaccinated subjects may avoid exposure to disease, causing the researcher who compares average outcomes in the treatment and control groups to underestimate the effectiveness of the treatment.         "
"4","The challenge is to develop experimental designs that enable the researcher to measure spillover effects and gauge the effect of the treatment net of spillover effects. The objective is not solely to find significant spillover effects; so long as an experimental design has the capacity to detect spillovers, estimates of the treatment’s direct effect are protected from bias regardless of whether spillover effects materialize.3 If the experiment should reveal no evidence of spillovers, the result suggests that researchers in this domain have less need to employ complex experimental designs in the future. Moreover, a null result sheds light on the absence of social dynamics that might otherwise be thought to generate spillovers.         "
"5","Building on the recent literature discussing the identification of causal effects in the presence of interference between units (Hudgens and Halloran 2008), our approach is to gauge spillover effects using a multilevel experimental design. Multilevel experiments randomly vary whether a given subject receives the treatment and whether the treatment is administered to other subjects who are in some way connected to the subject. For example, in the study presented below, individual voters may receive a treatment; their housemates may receive a treatment; and others in their nine‐digit zip code may receive a treatment. Persons, households, and zip codes therefore comprise the three “levels” in our experiment.         "
"6","It should be stressed at the outset that multilevel designs do not “solve” the problem of satisfying the stable unit treatment value assumption. Given the vast number of ways in which treatments may be passed indirectly between subjects, multilevel design addresses certain facets of the SUTVA issue but cannot rule out all potential SUTVA violations. In the above example, two subjects in different households and different zip codes may nevertheless influence each other because they work for the same firm or attend the same church. Researchers confront an inherent identification problem when studying social influence. In order to make the empirical requirements manageable, researchers must impose some assumptions about the networks through which social influence is transmitted. One empirical strategy is to use multilevel designs to study what are thought to be the likely networks; if spillover effects are shown to be weak within these networks, the implication is that other channels that are not easily studied also have weak spillover effects. Of course, this is an inference, not a result, and more than one experiment may be necessary to determine which social networks, if any, transmit spillover effects."
"7","To date, relatively few experimental studies have been designed with the explicit purpose of identifying spillover effects. One of the rare exceptions is the voter‐mobilization experiment conducted by Nickerson (2008), which shows that the effects of door‐to‐door canvassing are transmitted within two‐voter households. Nickerson finds that when one voter opens the door to a canvasser, 60% of the effect from the get‐out‐the‐vote appeal is transmitted to the other household member.4 Apart from Nickerson (2008), the study of social influence is dominated by observational studies. Huckfeldt (1979) and Knoke (1990) use survey data to argue that individuals with politicized social networks are more likely to engage politically. McClurg (2003) suggests a mechanism, namely, information provided by others in the social network (see also Bolton 1972; Briet, Klandermans, and Kroon 1987; Gerlach and Hine 1970; McAdam and Paulsen 1993; McAdam 1986).         "
"8","Researchers using hierarchical models and contextual data (Cho, Gimpel, and Dyck 2006; Cohen and Dawson 1993; Gimpel, Dyck, and Shaw 2004) have repeatedly demonstrated that political action is strongly predicted by neighborhood context and the behavior of others nearby. Although the claims generated by observational studies are plausible, this mode of analysis is potentially biased by what Manski (1993) calls the reflection problem: one’s behavior may resemble that of one’s social network because of shared unobserved influences that have nothing to do with social communication or any form of interpersonal influence. Studies such as Nickerson (2008) signal a movement away from observational approaches toward research designs that use randomization in order to identify causal parameters. Our modeling approach and empirical application elaborates Nickerson’s work by gauging voter‐mobilization spillovers both within and across households.         "
"9","As noted in the previous section, SUTVA violations are empirically intractable unless one imposes some theoretical structure on the network under study (Sobel 2006). This section presents a model that simplifies the identification problem and highlights certain problems of estimation. Anticipating the empirical application that follows, the model is developed in relation to a voter‐mobilization effort in which mailings are sent to registered voters shortly before an election.         "
"10","Individuals in this model are part of a social network. We focus on two specific network relationships that may be relevant for a voter‐mobilization effort: the relationship between household members and the relationship between neighborhood residents. Each individual i belongs to a household h and a neighborhood z. For simplicity, we assume that individuals have the potential to interact with every member of their household and every member of their neighborhood but not with people outside their neighborhood. When one person receives a message from a mobilization campaign, the message may indirectly affect the voting probability among others in the household or neighborhood.         "
"11","This indirect influence may be transmitted in a number of ways. People may discuss the campaign message. Or the message may cause some individuals to vote, and their behavior may signal the importance of the election to others in their network (Grosser and Schram 2006). Another possibility is that as people become more likely to vote, they publicize the election and lower the information costs incurred by others in their network. We remain agnostic about which of these mechanisms is at work and focus on their combined influence. We do, however, allow for the possibility that influence from household members has a different impact than influence from neighbors.         "
"12","In our model, the potential outcomes for each voter are a function of whether they are themselves treated, whether a member of their household is treated, and whether others in their neighborhood are treated. Anticipating the empirical application in the next section, we define direct treatment as 1 if a person is sent a mailing and 0 otherwise. We define household treatment as 1 if another person in the household is sent a mailing and 0 otherwise. And we define neighborhood‐level treatment as 1 if all other households in the nine‐digit zip code are sent a mailing, 0.5 if half of the nine‐digit zip code’s households are sent a mailing, and 0 if none of the nine‐digit zip code’s other households are sent a mailing.5 We denote potential outcomes using the notation yz,h,i, where z refers to the (nine‐digit) zip code, h refers to the household, and i refers to the individual. Thus, y000 refers to a person whose zip code neighbors are untreated, whose housemates are untreated, and who receives no direct treatment.            "
"13","In principle, for households with more than one voter, this notation allows for a total of 3 × 2 × 2 = 12 potential outcomes for each person. In our empirical application, however, we send mail to at most one randomly selected member of each household. This restriction means that we never observe yz11 outcomes, which leaves us with nine relevant potential outcomes. Another restriction is that in zip codes where all of the households receive mailings, there are no instances of y100. Additionally, we vary the intensity of the neighborhood mailing to include a “low” intensity option, where just one other household in the zip code receives the treatment. This provides us with nine potential outcomes. These nine potential outcomes can be used to define several interesting estimands. If zip codes were to be untreated, the average direct effect of the mailings is , while in half‐treated zip codes it is . If zip codes were to be untreated, the average household‐spillover effect of the mailings on untreated individuals is , while in half‐treated zip codes it is . Finally, the average zip‐code‐level effects can be defined as  or  or  or  or , depending on whether one is interested in the zip‐code‐level effects on the untreated, on the directly treated, or on those affected only by household spillovers, and depending on whether one wishes to estimate the effect of an increase in neighborhood saturation from 0 to 0.5 or from 0.5 to 1. Our particular multilevel experiment was designed to maximize the flexibility with which zip‐code‐level effects could be defined and estimated.            "
"14","As noted earlier, we only observe one potential outcome for each individual; the other potential outcomes remain counterfactual. Random assignment of individuals to one of the experimental conditions, however, enables us to obtain unbiased estimates of the average treatment effects. For example,  for the samples that are randomly assigned to these two conditions provides an unbiased estimate of the household‐spillover effect on untreated individuals in untreated zip codes. A straightforward statistical test may be used to assess whether this average effect is distinguishable from zero, as well as whether the average household‐spillover effect in untreated zip codes is distinguishable from the average household‐spillover effect in partially treated zip codes. Multilevel assignment, in other words, enables us to identify direct treatment effects, household spillovers, neighborhood spillovers, and interactions among them. Moreover, this kind of experiment can be conducted using zip codes and households with varying numbers of voters, enabling the researcher to assess whether patterns of spillover differ systematically from one setting to the next.            "
"15","This empirical strategy is more nuanced in what it can estimate and less prone to bias than experimental analyses that simply compare those who directly receive treatment (y001, y101) with those who do not (y000, y010, y100, y110). Suppose, hypothetically, that each of these six groups were equal in size. The average voting rate in the treatment group minus the average voting rate in the control group would, in expectation, yield               "
"16","Although multilevel experimental design provides important insights into possible spillover effects, there are limitations in what an experiment of this kind can reveal about communication within social networks. Because we do not measure the communication flows within social networks, we cannot scale our estimated causal effects in terms of the influence per communication (Imbens, Angrist, and Rubin 1996). Even if we could measure communication, there remains the possibility that untreated individuals may read their housemate’s mail, violating the identifying assumptions of statistical models designed to estimate the effect of communications among compliers (i.e., those who communicate only when encouraged by the experimental intervention). Nevertheless, a multilevel design does enable us to speak to important causal questions indirectly. If messages delivered to neighbors affect a subject’s voting rates, we have strong circumstantial evidence for interpersonal transmission of information.            "
"17","Although multilevel designs broaden the range of hypotheses that can be tested, there is a downside: multilevel randomization reduces the statistical power with which the direct treatment effect is estimated. Thus, researchers face two competing considerations: they seek to efficiently estimate the direct effect of the treatment while minimizing bias due to spillover effects. Ex ante, we do not know whether spillovers occur; multilevel designs are essentially insurance against the risk of bias."
"18","In order to illustrate this trade‐off, we consider two research designs and explore the trade‐offs inherent in each. In the first case, we randomly assign our experimental population into two equal‐size groups, a treatment group (T) and a control group (C). The second case corresponds to the potential outcomes from a multilevel design. For ease of exposition, we assume that the outcomes are continuous, as opposed to binary, and characterize each outcome in terms of its mean and variance. We calculate three test statistics and compare their statistical power. Without a multilevel design, we have randomly assigned the population into two groups, treatment and control. Suppose we have mean, variance, and sample size , and nT for the treatment group, and , and nC for the control group. Assume that  and nT=nC=N/2 where N represents the total sample. This assumes sampling from a superpopulation, or constant effects. This gives us a confidence interval of "
"19","With a multilevel design, we have nine groups which have mean, variance, and sample size , and nGi. We assume again that all groups have the same variance  and are of the same size, . The test statistic for both the direct effects of treatment and spillover effects involve comparisons between two groups. For any given comparison of means μD=μGi−μGj, we will therefore have a confidence interval of . In other words, the confidence intervals for our design may be substantially larger than they would be if we were to compare only two groups. This is a simple approximation, however, as multilevel designs induce dependencies between units that are not captured by this approximation. Modeling assumptions can yield efficiency improvements.            "
"20","Researchers who endeavor to study spillover effects experimentally must begin with a treatment that exerts an effect on those who receive it.6 As noted in the previous section, the larger the direct effect, the greater the statistical power to detect spillovers. The same is true for sample size: an intervention that can be deployed on a grand scale is more likely to generate informative estimates of spillover effects. For these reasons, we used the social‐pressure mailings developed by Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008), which disclose whether a member of the household has voted in prior elections. Several large‐scale follow‐up experiments have demonstrated the robust turnout effects of this intervention (Gerber, Green, and Larimer 2010; Mann 2010) in low‐salience elections. In addition to generating strong effects with minimal failure‐to‐treat problems (which would arise in the context of a phone or canvassing study), this type of mailing has a further advantage: its unusual message is plausibly the subject of conversation between housemates or neighbors.         "
"21","It is also important to select an empirical context that seems conducive to the transmission of effects. As we indicated in our review of the large literature on political participation, interpersonal communication is widely thought to influence voter turnout in light of the predictive power of contextual factors such as friends’ and neighbors’ voting rates. In the dataset described below, spatial correlation in voting rates is quite powerful. Among households with two registered voters, turnout is just 12% when one’s housemate abstains and 67% when one’s housemate votes. Similarly, regressions that predict one’s voter turnout based on the voter‐turnout rate among others living in one’s nine‐digit zip code generate powerful and highly significant effects, even after controlling for a host of background factors including voter turnout in each previous election.7 The purpose of our experiment is to assess whether the inferences suggested by nonexperimental evidence hold up when the voting rates of housemates and neighbors are manipulated exogenously.         "
"22","In the final week prior to the April 2009 special election, approximately 60,000 individual residents of the Illinois 5th Congressional District8 received a postcard in the mail reminding them to do their civic duty and vote in spring elections.9 This postcard included a reminder about whether or not each individual had participated in the previous spring 2006 and spring 2008 elections and was patterned after the “self” mailings used by Green and Gerber (2008). An example of the postcard is shown in Figure 1. The postcard explicitly names a recipient and prints his or her voting history for the spring 2006 and spring 2008 elections, while leaving a line for the April 2009 election blank. We mailed postcards only to those residents who had been eligible to participate in both the 2006 and 2008 spring elections.         "
"23","                Sample Mailer"
"24","The April 7, 2009, election in the 5th Congressional District was unusual in that there was only a single electoral contest on the ballot. Rahm Emanuel had previously held the seat but resigned to become the White House Chief of Staff. Twenty‐four candidates competed in the March 3 special election primary, and three candidates emerged to compete in the April 7 special election: Mike Quigley (Democrat), Rosanna Pulido (Republican), and Matt Reichel (Green). Quigley defeated both candidates, winning 69.2% of the 44,138 votes. The contest received very little media coverage, and the Republican Party did very little campaigning for Pulido, who is a founder of the Illinois branch of the anti‐illegal‐immigration group known as Minutemen (Isenstadt 2009). The lack of competition is typical of elections for U.S. House of Representatives in districts where one party enjoys a lopsided advantage in terms of registered voters. The dearth of campaign communications is a plus from the standpoint of our experiment, as it means that our intervention and any interpersonal influence it generates are less likely to be obscured by competing communications.         "
"25","Our experimental universe is a subset of all households in the 5th Congressional District. Individuals eligible to be part of the study were active voters with a permanent address who had registered before 2006. We consider eligible households to be households with between one and three registered voters. We then restricted the study to nine‐digit zip codes containing at least two households with two eligible individuals and somewhere between 3 and 15 total households.10 In our study we have 71,127 eligible individuals, 47,851 eligible households, and 4,897 eligible zip codes.            "
"26","In order to allocate voters to experimental groups, the following procedure was used. We first conducted a randomization based upon each zip code. From the eligible zip codes, we selected a two‐voter household at random, which we will call the core household. We then chose 25% of core households to be assigned to control, and 75% were assigned to treatment. For zip codes where core households were assigned to control, all other households in their zip code were also assigned to control. For zip codes where core households were assigned to treatment, zip codes were assigned with equal probability into the following three conditions: First, with one‐third probability, treatment core households were assigned to be the only household in their zip code receiving treatment. Second, with one‐third probability, half of the other households in the zip code of the core treatment household were assigned to treatment. When there was an odd number of noncore households in the zip code, the number assigned to treatment was rounded down. (For example, with seven total households in the zip code, four would have been designated treatment households.) Finally, with one‐third probability, all households in the zip code of the treatment core household were also assigned to treatment. Within households assigned to treatment, we randomly chose exactly one individual to receive treatment. Therefore, in one‐person households, the full household was treated. In two‐person and three‐person households, each person had a one‐half and one‐third probability of receiving the treatment, respectively."
"27","After the election, we gathered official turnout records for each subject. Because some people moved or registered at a different address, 6,682 individuals were not found on the post‐election voter rolls. Attrition, as expected, is not predicted by experimental assignment.11 The analysis below focuses on the 64,445 individuals for whom we have valid outcome data (90% of our original sample).            "
"28","In order to verify that the randomization procedure worked as planned, we conducted a series of multinomial logistic regressions in which the nine assignment categories depicted in Table 1 were predicted using the list of covariates described in Table 2. This regression was performed on the postattrition sample within each of the four strata (one‐person, two‐person core, two‐person noncore, and three‐person households), resulting in four randomization checks. The joint significance of each chi‐square test was assessed by calculating the sum of the chi‐squares across the strata. Randomization inference was used to obtain p‐values. In order to form the empirical sampling distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, we simulated 10,000 randomizations. The results presented in Table 3 show the expected degree of balance. In each stratum and over all strata taken together, as expected, the likelihood‐ratio test is nonsignificant (p >.05). Because the experimental groups are balanced with respect to past voting patterns, the regression estimates presented below are scarcely affected by whether votes cast in previous elections are introduced as covariates.            "
"29","For ease of exposition, we use a linear probability model to estimate treatment and spillover effects. (The results are substantively unchanged when we use logistic regression.) As noted above, it is important to control for the strata within which individuals were randomized so that conditional on strata, each individual has an identical probability of receiving each treatment. For one‐person households, for example, the model is                "
"30","In the case of three‐person households, the regression model also includes a variable indicating whether another person within one’s household is treated:                "
"31","Finally, among two‐person households, the model is augmented with an indicator variable to distinguish between core households and noncore households, as these two types of two‐person households were assigned to treatment with different probabilities.                "
"32","The cluster‐randomized design complicates hypothesis testing and the estimation of confidence intervals. When a zip code, for example, is assigned to the control group, all of the individual voters are assigned to the control condition as a cluster. Clustered assignment also occurs when a multivoter household is assigned to the control group. When subjects are assigned to experimental conditions as clusters rather than individuals, conventional hypothesis tests tend to exaggerate the degree of statistical significance and conventional estimators tend to underestimate the standard errors. Hypothesis tests are restored to proper size by estimating the sampling distribution using randomization inference. Under the sharp null hypothesis of no effect for any observation, all potential outcomes are observed empirically. The sampling distribution under the sharp null may be closely approximated by repeatedly reassigning the subjects to experimental groups and calculating the regression estimate."
"33","Table 4 presents the statistical results within each of the experimental strata with confidence intervals reported based on randomization inference. The confidence intervals are estimated assuming constant effects equal to the estimated effect. In order to form the empirical sampling distribution of the test statistic, we simulated 10,000 randomizations using our randomization design. As noted above, each of the regression models includes individual treatment, whether another person in the household was treated,14 and the extent of the zip‐code‐level treatment. The table also presents each regression with and without covariates, indicator variables indicating whether each individual voted in the previous nine elections. The inclusion of these covariates is optional; the estimator is consistent with or without them. The reason to include covariates is that by reducing disturbance variance, they may decrease the sampling variability of the estimated treatment effects. Both expectations are borne out in our data: including covariates has little effect on the estimates but slightly reduces their standard errors.15"
"34","Our attempt to measure spillover effects is predicated on the assumption that the postcard significantly increases the probability of turnout among those who receive it. Consistent with past experiments using a similar “self” mailer (Gerber, Green, and Larimer 2008, 2010; Mann 2010), the postcard increases turnout by approximately 5.3 percentage points among one‐voter households, 3.6 percentage points among two‐voter households, and 5.1 percentage points among three‐voter households. Each of these estimates is significantly different from zero using confidence intervals based on randomization inference.16 When we calculate a precision‐weighted average of these estimates, we obtain a pooled estimate of 4.4 percentage points with a standard error of 0.6.17 This pooled estimate is almost identical to the estimates reported in previous experiments, which also took place in low‐salience elections. To put these effects in substantive perspective, note that the voting rates in the control group (those who received no mail and resided in zip codes where no mail was sent) vary from 16.4% to 22.2%. Thus, a 4.4 percentage‐point effect represents between a 20% and 27% increase in turnout, which in the context of the voter‐mobilization literature ranks as an unusually strong effect (Green and Gerber 2008).            "
"35","Although the mailer had a clear effect on recipients, we find somewhat equivocal evidence of within‐household spillovers. Nickerson (2008) finds that approximately 60% of the effect of voter‐mobilization messages is transmitted to those living in the same household. Considering only two‐ and three‐person households, we estimate a precision‐weighted average of the treatment effect to individuals of 3.8 with a standard error of 0.8. As applied to our data, Nickerson’s finding implies that voters who reside in the same household as treated voters should vote at a 3.8 x 0.60 = 2.3 percentage point higher rate than the pure control group (which neither receives treatment nor resides in a household where others are treated). In fact, we find a pooled estimate of 1.3 percentage points with a 0.9 percentage‐point standard error. Our best guess is that 34% of the direct effect of receiving a mailer is transmitted to housemates.18 Sampling variability may explain why our estimates are somewhat lower than Nickerson’s, but another possibility is that a conversation at the doorstep with a canvasser is more likely to prompt within‐household conversation than our postcard.            "
"36","We find little evidence of spillover effects across households within zip code. None of the estimated effects of high, medium, or low saturation of the zip code is significantly positive; instead, the estimates hover near zero. A precision‐weighted average of the three high‐saturation estimates is 0.0 percentage points with a standard error of 0.8 percentage points. The corresponding estimate for medium saturation is 0.0 with a standard error of 0.7 percentage points. The estimate for low saturation is also 0.0 with a standard error of 0.7. With a fair degree of precision, we find no indication that voters are affected indirectly by either the mobilization messages that their neighbors receive or the exogenous increase in their neighbors’ propensity to vote that results from these mailers."
"37","Experimentation in political science is motivated in large part by the desire to relax the strong assumptions that accompany observational research (Druckman et al. 2006). Nowhere is the contrast between experimental and observational approaches more stark than in the study of social influence. For decades, observational researchers have argued that the influence of social networks is demonstrated by the correlation between friends’, neighbors’, or coworkers’ attitudes and behaviors. Concerned that unobserved factors other than social influence might account for these correlations, experimental researchers endeavor to introduce exogenous messages in an effort to study the extent to which they ramify through existing networks.         "
"38","Multilevel experiments are a logical extension of this push to relax assumptions. Rather than assume that experimental subjects respond only to the messages directed at them, researchers employing multilevel designs allow for the possibility that messages are transmitted indirectly from person to person. Given the vast number of social pathways through which messages could be transmitted, multilevel designs inevitably rely on a simplified representation of social transmission. In our empirical application, for example, we considered only two pathways: within household and within zip code. Yet even this relatively circumscribed multilevel design generates useful insights. Although the direct effect of the treatment is strong,19 and roughly half of this influence is transmitted to housemates, we find no support for the hypothesis that effects are transmitted between neighboring households. Despite the strong correlation among neighbors’ probabilities of voting, voter‐mobilization messages do not appear to exert secondhand effects on neighbors.         "
"39","Although it is tempting to judge the experimental literature on social influence according to whether researchers find evidence of “interesting” spillovers, the importance of null findings should not be discounted. Given the vast number of conceivable pathways through which treatment effects could be transmitted, it is extremely helpful to have empirical grounds for ruling out certain kinds of SUTVA violations. The point of using a multilevel design is to estimate additional parameters; if those parameters are estimated with precision and discovered to be close to zero, multilevel design has done its job, and researchers can direct their attention to other, more pressing threats to internal validity."
"40","The next frontier for multilevel experiments designed to assess interpersonal communication is to apply experimental designs to well‐documented social networks. Unlike the current study, which uses place of residence as a proxy for network proximity and frequency of interaction, future experiments may build on detailed information about the nature and frequency of interpersonal contact, whether gathered via surveys, ethnographies, or social networking websites. The community defined by the social networking database comprises the experimental sample, and the researcher directs experimental treatments to randomly selected individuals and groups. By allowing the researcher to assess whether treatments diffuse at different rates according to centrality of the receiver within the social network, this type of design allows for a more nuanced investigation of social influence and SUTVA more generally."
"41","Multilevel designs are potentially useful in a wide array of substantive domains outside the field of political behavior. One especially fruitful set of applications involves monitoring and deterrence. For example, in an effort to deter electoral fraud, international election observers visit randomly selected polling stations (Hyde 2010). These visits are intended to generate spillover effects; the monitors seek to signal their surveillance of the polling stations they visit as well as polling stations in the surrounding area. It would be relatively easy to craft a multilevel design in which monitors vary the proportion of polling places that are monitored in each town and vary the proportion of towns that are monitored in each region. The same general approach could be applied in a variety of other experimental monitoring efforts that seek to deter embezzlement by local government officials (Silva 2010) or to promote tax compliance by citizens (Felner, Sausgruber, and Traxler 2009). Another set of promising applications concerns what might be called “policy diffusion.” Spillovers from research and development (Audretsch and Feldman 1996), the institution of new environmental policies (Sheely 2010), and the elevation of women to local leadership positions (Beaman et al. 2009) are instances in which interventions occurring at one location may have repercussions for policy outcomes in nearby areas. The implementation of multilevel designs may be feasible in situations where experimental interventions are to be rolled out in a variety of locations, as in Sheely’s study of environmental policies that were randomly introduced in 36 Kenyan villages. By varying the spatial arrangement of experimental interventions, multilevel design fosters the systematic investigation of whether an intervention in one location influences policy adoption nearby. In sum, the range of phenomena that are potentially affected by spillovers, displacement, signaling, and social comparison is quite broad. Multilevel experiments represent a useful design‐based strategy for investigating these phenomena.         "
