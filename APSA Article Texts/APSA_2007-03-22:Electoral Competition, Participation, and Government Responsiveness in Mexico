"1","These theoretical questions are particularly relevant to Mexico, where increasing competition over the past 25 years has renewed scholars' interest in the potential for competitive elections to cure a variety of social and political ills. This is not surprising, since elections have been at the center of politics in Mexico for more than a century. The Mexican Revolution of 1910 was triggered (in part) by an electoral conflict between reformer Francisco Madero and the long‐ruling dictator, Porfirio Díaz. After the revolutionary period, the electoral ritual helped to perpetuate the hegemony of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI) for some seven decades. During the long transition to democracy, electoral competition—culminating in alternancia (party alternation)—was the benchmark by which observers measured democratic progress. And elections remain the focal point of scholarship in the post‐transition period, as they are thought to be responsible for democratic advances in party behavior, fiscal transparency, legislative and judicial independence, and government responsiveness.2 The specific claim that preoccupies my investigation here is nicely stated by Rodríguez, who writes that municipal elections “have already begun to deliver on their promise to have a more lasting effect by forcing all parties in government to perform better if they aspire to win the next election” (1998, 164).         "
"2","In looking to electoral competition as the primary source of responsiveness, the recent Mexican scholarship is tapping into one of the most prominent literatures in political science: electoral democratic theory. This theoretical tradition, developed largely in studies of U.S. politics, argues that elections offer citizens the opportunity to influence how their representatives behave, either by threatening to remove them for poor performance (sanctioning), or by empowering representatives who are competent and honest, and who share the public's preferences (selection).3 This is an influential literature, and for good reason: it is beyond dispute that elections condition the behavior of citizens and politicians, and in many situations offer the best hope for government responsiveness and accountability.         "
"3","However, we should not overlook the fact that the conditions necessary for electoral mechanisms to function smoothly are often not met in practice. Voters might lack the information they need to form accurate judgments about candidates; representatives may have difficulty discerning their mandate, given the large number of issue dimensions; and poor institutional design may impair or damage the “electoral connection.” In addition, we know that politicians often respond to competition in ways that do not enhance responsiveness. For example, they may resort to clientelism and patronage to solidify a base of support without improving public policies; they might buy votes; they can pander at election time; or they can engage in what Mexicans call plazismo, spending money on high‐profile projects (like beautification of the town's central plaza) that do not really contribute to development or improved services. Given these potential difficulties, it is unwise to assume that electoral mechanisms function smoothly in any given case. Rather, we should work to establish empirically whether they function well or not.         "
"4","In the Mexican case, there are several institutional features that merit special attention as potential obstacles to mechanisms of electoral accountability. The largest institutional obstacle is the strict prohibition against consecutive reelection, which prevents the electorate from directly rewarding incumbents for good performance (or punishing them for bad). Furthermore, most elected officials (including mayors, whose performance is the subject of this article's empirical analysis) serve three‐year terms of office, giving them little time to gain policy expertise or familiarity with the bureaucracies and institutions on which they depend. At the municipal level, the main administrative units are typically headed by town councilors (regidores), who are elected with the mayor on a fused ticket. Thus, day‐to‐day governance in municipalities is in the hands of short‐lived political representatives rather than a professional civil service (Grindle 2006; Guillén López 1996).         "
"5","There are many ways to reconcile these institutional obstacles with mechanisms of electoral accountability. For example, politicians may have “progressive ambition,” or the desire to run for increasingly powerful positions. So even if they will not face reelection for the same office, they may behave responsively as a means of establishing a good reputation, which is an asset for any politician who anticipates running for a different elective office in the future (Taylor 1992). They might also be kept in check by their own parties, which have an interest in reelection even when their individual candidates do not. Parties typically have the means to induce responsive behavior from their own officeholders, by controlling bureaucratic appointments, nominations for other elective offices, and (in some cases) government largesse (Carey 1996; Taylor 1992). Thus, while the theoretical difficulties specific to Mexico should cause us to question how well electoral mechanisms function, they certainly do not prove such mechanisms to be ineffectual. Rather, they suggest that the electoral connection should be evaluated empirically, by testing the hypothesis that government will be more responsive where elections are more competitive.         "
"6","A second reason to treat electoral theory with caution, both in general and with respect to Mexico, is the possibility that other forms of political participation cause democratic governments to be responsive, either on their own (Putnam 1993; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995) or in conjunction with elections (Hirschman 1970). My own research in Mexico suggests that participatory strategies such as protest, public meetings, and individual contact with representatives are significant determinants of government responsiveness. For example, several mayors whom I have interviewed highlighted the importance of town‐hall meetings and citizen assemblies, and some had begun a practice of holding open office hours during which any citizen could come to speak with them and the members of their municipal cabinet.4 Furthermore, it is well known that participatory politics underwent a quantitative increase and a qualitative shift in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, Foweraker writes that “it is not simply the accumulation of movements, nor even a changing balance of social force, that is changing the character of popular mobilization [in Mexico]; rather, it is the political and cultural shift from making petitions and asking for benefits to making demands and insisting on rights” (1993, 3). Thus, it seems reasonable to wonder whether heightened levels of participation are responsible for improved responsiveness in Mexico. But what mechanism could explain why politicians would be responsive to participation in a country like Mexico in the 1990s?         "
"7","One intuitive possibility, which I refer to as the interactive hypothesis, is that government responds to participatory pressures when they are backed up by an electoral threat (Hirschman 1970). In this view, participation may inform the government about citizen grievances and demands, but government only responds to such demands when the citizens can credibly threaten to vote officials out of office. The interactive view of participation suggests that we will find a relationship between government performance and participation only in municipalities that have competitive elections or that the relationship will be noticeably stronger in competitive municipalities.         "
"8","But there are also several mechanisms that might explain how participation engenders responsiveness even in the absence of a credible electoral threat. Participation may stimulate a response from government officials if those officials are tied to their constituency via social networks, because networks can help enforce social norms (Putnam 1993). In this case, the norm would involve the belief that government officials should act as faithful public servants, and the network would make it easier for constituents to apply social pressure to the official. Second, participation (as well as social networks) may increase the amount of information that government officials have concerning the public's concerns and demands. Given two governments with similar inclinations to respond to the public interest, the government with better information is likely to be more responsive. Finally, participation may function through a psychological mechanism, according to which government officials respond in order to avoid the stress or embarrassment that interpersonal interactions with aggrieved citizens can cause them (Brehm and Gates 1997). Each of these mechanisms suggests that government will be more responsive where participation is more frequent.         "
"9","In a sense, the literature on government responsiveness in Mexico reflects trends in the broader U.S. and comparative literatures. Electoral competition is the default explanation for any apparent advances in responsiveness, even though the theoretical objections and institutional obstacles to electoral accountability are well known. Participatory mechanisms tend to be treated separately, when they are treated at all. In contrast, this article treats both electoral and participatory explanations as plausible, and simultaneously tests both hypotheses, as well as the conjecture that the two factors have a positive interactive effect on responsiveness. My aim is to illustrate the intellectual benefit of expanding the study of responsiveness to include a wider range of political strategies that may influence the behavior of political representatives and the quality of government."
"10","The importance of the Mexican case lies not only with the critical theoretical debate I have outlined above. In addition, Mexico offers an ideal opportunity to study government responsiveness because its protracted transition to democracy has produced useful variation on several key dimensions. Between 1980 and 2000, many municipalities in Mexico became increasingly democratic. Multiparty elections replaced single‐party dominance, ordinary citizens began to participate in politics more often (and with greater autonomy from the corporatist hierarchy), and local governments became more responsive and efficient. But these changes occurred haltingly, unevenly, and in some places not at all, such that by the late 1990s, municipalities varied widely in terms of the levels of electoral competition, political participation, and government responsiveness. I exploit this variation to test several hypotheses regarding the sources of responsiveness in Mexico, using a subnational comparative research design (Snyder 2001). Here, the cases are municipalities, which are at the lowest level of Mexico's three‐tiered federal system. Municipalities are useful for this analysis because there are many of them, good data exist on relevant municipal characteristics, and the nature of Mexico's federal arrangement makes government performance relatively easy to measure at the municipal level.5 For each municipality‐year, I compiled electoral, socioeconomic, public‐financial, and demographic data from various public sources, for the years 1989 through 2000.6 And I use these data to evaluate the following specific empirical implications:         "
"11","                        "
"12","Municipalities with competitive electoral environments exhibit better government performance than municipalities lacking electoral competition."
"13","Municipalities with high levels of political participation exhibit better government performance than municipalities with low levels of participation."
"14","Municipalities with high levels of political participation exhibit better government performance, but only when participation coincides with a competitive electoral environment."
"15","In the context of Mexican municipalities, I conceive of responsiveness in terms of the local government's performance on basic issues of service delivery. The best way to measure performance is to use census data on the public provision of potable water and sanitary sewerage (see INEGI 2005). Public utility coverage is a good measure of municipal performance for several reasons. The Mexican Constitution (Article 115) explicitly assigns to municipal governments the exclusive responsibility for the provision of water and sanitation. We also know that the provision of public utility services is an important political issue across the country and that survey respondents specifically identify public utilities when asked to name the “most important” issue in their municipality (see Fagen and Touhy 1972; Mizrahi 1999, 2000). Even in municipalities that already have relatively good coverage, public utilities are a priority for local governments, as is routinely noted in interviews with municipal officials and in innumerable case studies on municipal public policy (Cabrero Mendoza and Nava Campos 1999; Ziccardi 1995).            "
"16","Public utility data provide excellent indicators of municipal government performance, but they do have limitations. One problem is that although water and sewer provision are central political issues in most municipalities, they do not comprise a comprehensive measure of performance—municipalities have other responsibilities too. Another complication is the potential for influence from state and federal governments (although I account for this by introducing the appropriate statistical controls below). Municipal governments are formally responsible for public utility provision, but they remain dependent on federal transfer funds for the construction and maintenance of infrastructure, and (more rarely) for the coordination of supramunicipal public works projects.7 Finally, one practical limitation is that public utility data are only collected every 10 years in the national census, precluding an annual time‐series analysis.            "
"17","I therefore supplement the analysis of public utility provision with a second type of performance measure taken from public financial statistics (INEGI 2005). In the 1990s, many municipalities responded to pressure for better performance by tapping local revenue sources that had been neglected in the past, primarily by regularizing the tax rolls and developing the bureaucratic capacity to collect the property tax (Campbell 2003; Grindle 2006; Rodríguez 1997). The fact that this was done in some municipalities, but not others, suggests that local revenue generation should be higher among municipalities that are more innovative and determined to modernize—in other words, among municipalities that intended to improve their performance. It is important to note that virtually all municipalities remain dependent on federal transfer payments, even where local revenue generation has increased. A typical municipality receives only 10–20% of its revenue from local sources. So local revenue does not always reflect a municipality's raw financial capacity. Rather, it provides an indirect measure of performance, in that we can view higher local revenue to be symptomatic of a municipal government that aims to increase responsiveness.8"
"18","One of the key explanatory variables of interest in this article is electoral competition. All of the measures of competition I use in this article are based on official electoral returns, which are reported in de Remes (2000) and Banamex (2001).9 These data can be used to generate any number of specific indicators of competitiveness. In some cases, it is useful to see the trend in support for the formerly hegemonic PRI; in others, I am interested simply to divide municipalities into two groups, according to whether or not they have had competitive elections or party alternation in the mayor's office. My measures for multivariate analysis are based on the margin of victory (M), calculated as the percentage of votes for the winning party less the percentage won by the second‐place party. This statistic offers a clear, intuitive, and monotonic indicator of how closely contested a given election is. For example, an election that is won 55% to 45% is clearly more competitive than a result of 60–40, or 70–30. I use M to construct lagged indicators and averages over a number of electoral cycles, but as a robustness check I also use several alternate measures of competition.10"
"19","It is difficult to directly measure participation across some 2,400 Mexican municipalities. The ideal measure would capture the quantity and quality of the myriad participatory strategies that are used on a daily basis in local politics. For example, we would be interested to know the number of people who visited a municipal office each month or year to lodge a complaint, the frequency and size of peaceful protests that typically take place in the public square outside of municipal government offices, and the number of civic organizations per municipality, as well as their membership size, political goals, and level of engagement in political affairs. Most of these direct indicators are unavailable across a large number of cases and would be extremely difficult to collect. The only widely available direct measure of participation is the electoral turnout rate, which is a useful indicator of participation because we know that those who vote are more likely to participate in other ways as well (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995).11 Therefore I calculate turnout as a percentage of each municipality's adult population and include this as one indicator of participation.            "
"20","In addition, the literature on political participation in the United States has shown that most forms of participation are closely associated with socioeconomic status or resources. For example, Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995, 206) find that educated and wealthy individuals participate far more frequently than their less educated and poorer counterparts. They also find that these differences are more important predictors of participation than are occupation, political attitudes, and party affiliation (see also Brehm and Gates 1997, 179–80). Mexico displays the same pattern. Table 1 shows the frequency of political activity according to the economic class and education level of respondents in two national‐sample surveys (see Camp 2001; Inglehart et al. 2004). In both surveys, respondents were asked a series of questions that probed their level of political activity, including whether they had ever signed a protest letter or gone to a demonstration. In each case, wealthier and better‐educated respondents were much more likely to report that they had done these things. According to these surveys, upper‐class Mexicans are more than twice as likely as lower‐class Mexicans to sign a protest letter. College‐educated Mexicans are three to four times more likely to sign a letter than are their uneducated counterparts, and two to three times as likely to go to a demonstration. The data consistently show a strong relationship between the socioeconomic status and the self‐reported political activity of the respondent. Data from these surveys also show that wealthier and better‐educated Mexicans are more likely to say they “would consider” signing a letter or joining a demonstration, suggesting that their potential for participation would be even higher, if they were motivated by circumstances (analysis not shown; see also Fagen and Touhy 1972, 89). Therefore I include municipal literacy and poverty rates, which come from census data, as proxy measures of each municipality's level of participation. But since the link between these variables and participation is not direct, I treat the results cautiously, and below I discuss alternative interpretations of the findings related to these indicators.            "
"21","The level of competition in Mexican municipal elections has increased dramatically over the past 25 years. Figure 1 shows the time trend in two measures of competition: the margin of victory and the PRI's vote share. Each point plotted on the graph represents the average score for all municipalities that held an election that year. Looking at the numbers for 1980, one can see that the average margin of victory and the average vote share for the PRI were both close to one.12 From 1980 forward, both measures indicate a steady increase in competition, with significant jumps in 1988 and 1993. By 1999 competitiveness had progressed to the point at which the average margin of victory was just 17% and the average vote share for the PRI was 54%. But there is still wide variation, and many municipalities remain dominated by a single party, usually the PRI.         "

"24"," Note: Average margin of victory and PRI vote share across all municipal elections by year, total N = 1,953.                     "
"25","Did the rise of electoral competition cause an improvement in municipal government performance? Anecdotal evidence strongly supports such a causal hypothesis, and many scholars have endorsed it (see footnote 2). But even a cursory look at the data reveals that the correlation between competition and performance may not signify a causal relationship. Table 2 divides Mexican municipalities into two groups, depending on whether they had ever experienced party alternation in the mayor's office prior to 2000. The first and third columns of the table list the rate of service coverage for water and sewerage in these two groups of municipalities. As the table shows, municipalities with competitive elections do a better job of service provision, covering 16% more homes with sewerage, and 6% more with potable water. This is exactly the sort of pattern that has led many scholars to posit a causal link between electoral competition and improved performance. But the second and fourth columns of Table 2 illustrate the fallacy. The differences between these two groups already existed in 1990, before most municipal elections became competitive. In fact, this pattern extends back in time at least to 1980. Since the differences in service provision precede the rise of electoral competition, one is forced to question whether competition is truly a cause of improved performance.         "
"26","To gain a clearer understanding of the determinants of government responsiveness in Mexico I turn to multivariate analysis of municipal government performance, beginning with the public utility measures.13 I estimate the percentage of households per municipality with access to sanitary sewers and potable water in the year 2000, based on the coverage rate in 1990, the level of electoral competition in the 1990s, turnout rates, literacy and poverty rates, and several other control variables. This cross‐sectional analysis with a 10‐year lag is not ideal, since it is not possible to tie the performance measure to individual municipal administrations. Still, I can test the general expectation that performance should improve over time in municipalities with higher levels of competition and/or participation.            "
"27","Because the two dependent variables are proportions, bound by 0 and 1, the standard ordinary least‐squares model (OLS) is inappropriate. Using OLS on proportional dependent variables can lead to nonsensical predicted values outside of the 0–1 range, and it also forces one to assume that the effect of independent variables is uniform across the unit interval.14 This is an inaccurate notion of how I expect rates of coverage to be influenced. A better way to think about changes in a proportional variable such as rates of provision is as a curvilinear process, in which the effect (in percentage terms) of any given causal factor tapers off as the rate approaches 100%. The reason is that there is less room for improvement when the initial rate of provision is already high, and no improvement is possible once the rate of provision reaches 100%. In a linear OLS model, a strong relationship may be obscured by the apparent lack of a relationship among cases at the high end of the dependent variable's range. The best solution to this estimation problem is to use a logistic transformation of the dependent variable (see Greene 1997, 895).15 This transformation “linearizes” a proportional variable, such that the variable ranges freely between positive and negative infinity, making OLS an appropriate estimation tool. The coefficients of the log‐odds OLS model are harder to interpret on their face, but I generate simulations to illustrate the effects in terms of percentages. All of the public utility models presented below use log‐odds‐transformed dependent variables.            "
"28","The independent variables of greatest theoretical interest include lagged values of the dependent variables, the average margin of victory over the course of the 1990s, the average turnout rate in municipal elections throughout the 1990s, each municipality's literacy rate in 1990, and the percentage of economically active residents who earn less than the official minimum wage (a measure of poverty).16 I also include a dummy variable indicating whether 50% or more of the municipal population speaks an indigenous language, to test the commonly stated hypothesis that indigenous communities in Mexico are marginalized by the state and unlikely to engage it in participatory terms. My own theoretical priors are mixed: while indigenous communities are often among the most marginalized, many also have a high capacity for collective action (see, for example, Hindley 1999).            "
"29","The models include several additional control variables. To account for each municipality's financial capacity, I include the per capita budget, in 1995 pesos, averaged over the 1990s. I also control for (off‐budget) federal transfers under the Programa Nacional de Solidaridad (PRONASOL, a.k.a. Solidarity). These funds were a significant source of federal money in the municipalities and were often used for improvements in public utilities. Accordingly, I include the total amount of PRONASOL spending per capita in the municipality, for the duration of the program (1989 to 1994). To measure party‐specific effects, I include three dummy variables indicating whether the municipality was controlled by one of the three main parties (the PRI, the Partido Acción Nacional[PAN], and the Partido de la Revolución Democrática[PRD]) for six or more years in the 1990s. Another dummy variable, indicating whether the municipal and state governments were controlled by different parties for a majority of the decade, tests the conjecture that governors may attempt to disrupt the efforts of opposition mayors (de Remes 1999). I include the log of the total municipal population, and the percentage change in population from 1990 to 2000. My theoretical priors on these factors are mixed. Urban areas are often thought to be in the vanguard of public‐service provision, due to their concentrated populations, larger tax bases, and visibility. Yet many large cities have also experienced rapid population growth in recent years, which could adversely affect the rates of service provision. A less ambiguous demographic variable is population density (logged population per square kilometer), which I expect to positively correlate with performance, since it should be easier to extend service to concentrated populations than to dispersed ones. Finally, I include dummy variables indicating each municipality's state (with one dummy omitted).            "
"30"," Sewerage. Model 1 in Table 3 shows the results of a log‐odds OLS estimation on the rate of sanitary sewer coverage. The model shows no relationship between electoral competition and service coverage. But utility coverage is significantly higher in municipalities that are better educated, that have higher turnout in local elections, and that are less poor. Indigenous municipalities have lower rates of coverage, though the estimated effect is relatively small. Other independent variables have a moderate effect at best: all else equal, populous municipalities have poorer coverage, but densely populated municipalities have better coverage. PRI‐dominated municipalities fare slightly worse, as do those controlled by a party other than the governor's.            "
"31","The most surprising finding in Table 3 is the lack of a relationship between government performance and electoral competition, and this might lead some to wonder whether I have used the most appropriate measure of competitiveness. For example, suppose that performance would be better in any minimally competitive municipality, whether margins of victory were extremely tight, or just moderately so. The measure of competition most consistent with this hypothesis would be a dummy variable indicating whether the average margin of victory in the 1990s was lower than a given threshold of competitiveness, say 20%. Substituting such a dummy variable yields similar results. In fact, substituting any of the following alternative measures produces comparable results (analysis not shown): (1) the margin of victory from 1990, (2) the average margin of victory from 1985 to 1989, (3) the average PRI vote share across the 1990s, (4) a dummy variable indicating whether the PRI vote share had ever dropped below 55% in the 1990s, and (5) a dummy variable indicating whether an opposition party had ever won the municipal presidency. The nonfinding is robust to any reasonable measure of competition.            "
"32","At the same time, electoral turnout, literacy, and poverty are all strong and significant predictors of government performance. To interpret the impact of these coefficients, I used Clarify to generate expected values of the dependent variable while manipulating the values on the independent variables of interest, and then I converted the expected values from the log‐odds transformation back into percentage terms (see Tomz, Wittenberg, and King 2003). The results show that turnout, literacy, and poverty have a large impact on coverage rates, even while controlling for the municipal financial capacity (see Figure 2). For example, a shift from the first to the third quartile score for literacy predicts a 7‐point difference in sewer coverage, holding all other variables at their median values. Of course, predicted effects are even larger toward the more extreme cases: as literacy moves from the 10th to the 90th percentile, the predicted increase in sewer coverage is 14 percentage points.            "
"33"," Sewer Coverage and Correlates of Participation                         "
"34"," Note: Simulations based on Model 1, Table 3.                        "
"35","How does the predicted effect change as turnout, literacy, and poverty vary together? Since the three variables covary, we should be interested to know their combined effect on government performance. The steeper curve in Figure 2 simulates expected coverage rates as all three of the variables of interest move from their lowest to highest percentile within the sample (holding all other variables at their median value).17 In this example, a shift from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile in each of the three variables of interest would translate into a 14‐point increase in the predicted rate of coverage, from 52% to 66%. All else equal, the difference between municipalities at the 10th and 90th percentiles of all three variables is 26 percentage points. Given that rates of coverage in this sample tend slightly toward the high end of the range and are unimodal, these predicted differences are large.            "
"36","To this point the evidence has lent no support to the electoral hypothesis. But it remains possible that electoral competition has an indirect effect on government performance by conditioning the impact of other causes. For example, nonelectoral participation might be more effective when elections are competitive, because it is riskier for representatives to ignore participatory pressures when they face a credible electoral threat. Depending on how we interpret Hirschman (1970) and others who hypothesize interactive effects, we would expect either that the relationship between participation and government performance would only exist among competitive municipalities, or that the relationship would be markedly stronger within this subset of municipalities. To find out, I split the sample according to whether or not each municipality had competitive elections.18 As one can see by comparing the coefficients in Models 2 and 3, the variables of interest have the same effect in both subsets.19 For example, the coefficient on literacy is 1.90 in the noncompetitive sample and 1.73 in the competitive sample. The difference between the two coefficients for turnout is slightly larger, but a Chow test confirms that the difference is not statistically significant (see Greene 1997, 349).20 Thus the evidence does not even support the assertion that electoral competition affects government performance indirectly, by conditioning or magnifying the effect of other causes. Literacy, turnout, and poverty exert significant independent influence on performance, whether or not elections are competitive.            "
"37"," Potable Water. Models 4–6 in Table 3 replicate the analysis of the first three models, while changing the dependent variable from sewer coverage to water coverage. The results are generally consistent with the first three models. In Model 4, electoral competition is not a significant predictor of coverage rates, but literacy and turnout are. The poverty rate has a moderately sized negative effect, though it is not statistically significant by conventional standards. The three demographic controls are the only other variables with significant effects: Municipalities with large and growing populations tend to have lower coverage rates, while those with dense populations have higher coverage rates.            "
"38"," Figure 3 illustrates the magnitude of the effects of turnout, literacy, and poverty, drawing on two simulations of the expected values of the dependent variable. In the first, all independent variables are held constant at their medians, while literacy is varied from its lowest to highest percentile. In the second, turnout and poverty rates are varied as well. The results are similar in that the predicted coverage rate for potable water rises concomitantly with the variables of interest, but the magnitude of the effect appears much smaller. Except at the extreme low end of the scale, these variables predict only moderate increases in coverage rates. This is explainable at least in part by the fact that water coverage was already high in 1990 (the median score in 1990 is 72% coverage).            "
"39"," Water Coverage and Correlates of Participation                         "
"40"," Note: Simulations based on Model 4, Table 3.                        "
"41","The results of the split‐sample models (5 and 6) are also consistent with the analysis of sewer coverage, since the coefficients on the indicators of interest tend to be about the same size in both models. The only apparent difference here is in the predicted effect of poverty. Among municipalities that lack electoral competition, higher poverty rates predict lower rates of water provision. But among competitive municipalities, no such relationship exists. This could be interpreted to mean that poorer municipalities are not at a disadvantage in water provision, provided that they have a modicum of electoral competition. However, we should not read too much into this interpretation, because a Chow test suggests that the apparent difference in the two poverty coefficients is only weakly significant (p = 0.06). An additional Chow test shows that there is no systematic difference between Models 5 and 6 in the joint effect of turnout, literacy, and poverty. Overall, the analysis of sewer and water provision generates a consistent set of findings, revealing that electoral competition is not a significant predictor of coverage rates, while turnout, literacy, and poverty are."
"42","Another way to test electoral and participatory hypotheses of government performance is to analyze locally raised revenue. If, for whatever reason, a municipal government becomes more active in pursuit of the public interest, I should be able to find evidence of its efforts in its financial record. As I discussed above, studies of municipal financial activity in the 1990s suggest that local revenue generation is most likely to increase in municipalities that are attempting to modernize capacity, increase efficiency, or decrease their dependence on federal transfer payments. I use municipal budget data to construct two measures of local revenue generation, which are indirect measures of government performance."
"43","The best way to construct an indicator of revenue generation from the available budget data is simply to calculate the total pesos per capita that were collected locally. Adjusted for inflation, this indicator reflects a level of local income that is comparable over time and across cases. Revenue may also be affected by local economic conditions, but I can control for such effects in multivariate analysis. And by including a lagged value of the indicator in multivariate analysis, I can estimate the change in pesos per capita from one year to the next. The change over time is just as important as the overall amount of local revenue, since we are interested to know how municipalities reacted to heightened electoral and participatory pressures, rather than their baseline level of local income."
"44","For comparative purposes, I also calculate locally raised revenue as a percentage of total municipal income. We would expect municipalities that are improving their performance to have a higher percentage of their revenue raised locally. However, one disadvantage of this measure is that concomitant changes in state or federal transfers might conceal increases in local revenue. For example, if politicians are responding to electoral pressures, we might expect competition to have two effects: prompting local governments to increase their tax collections, and spurring federal and state governments to increase transfers to the municipality in order to shore up their political support. If both of these changes were to occur, the relative proportion of local income to total income might remain unchanged (or even decrease), obscuring the fact that the municipality improved its ability to collect local taxes."
"45","To generate an analysis comparable to the analysis of sewer and water provision, I constructed a dataset that contains local revenue indicators for each municipality, for each year from 1989 to 1999.21 The independent variables are similar to those presented in the previous analysis, but are adjusted to be appropriate for a panel analysis with annual observations. For example, where I had previously used the 10‐year average margin of victory for the analysis of public utilities, I now use a lagged 5‐year running average. Other adjustments are listed in Table 4, which reports the results of generalized least‐squares (GLS) random‐effects regression on the two indicators of local revenue. With few exceptions, the results of the two models are consistent with each other, and with the analysis of public utilities presented in Table 3. In Model 1, turnout, literacy, and poverty all return large and strongly significant coefficients with the expected signs. The model also supports the assertion of Rodríguez (1997) and others, that local revenue enhancement is more feasible in large municipalities and is more likely under PAN administrations. Indigenous municipalities generate more local revenue as well. The margin of victory coefficient is not statistically distinguishable from zero, though it does have the expected negative sign. Model 2 supports the findings from the first model, with minor exceptions. Electoral competition returns a weakly significant coefficient, indicating that less competitive municipalities generate slightly less local revenue (as a percent of their total budgets). Electoral turnout has a small negative effect. And the negative coefficient for PRONASOL spending supports a fiscal substitution hypothesis suggested by Moreno (2003): As (off‐budget) PRONASOL transfers increase, municipalities are less likely to pursue local revenue generation. But overall, the results in both of these models match the public utility findings presented in Table 3.            "
"46"," Figure 4 presents the results of a simulation based on Model 1 in Table 4. The simulation holds all variables at their median value, except for the independent variable(s) of interest. As in the previous figures, I first manipulate the value of the literacy variable, and then I simulate the joint effect of turnout, literacy, and poverty. As the figure shows, these variables predict large changes in the amount of locally raised revenue. For example, a shift from the first to the third quartile in literacy would predict a 12‐peso per capita increase in local revenue. Given that most municipalities generate between 10 and 60 pesos per capita locally, this is a substantial effect. The combined effect of turnout, literacy, and poverty is even larger: a shift from the first to the third quartile in all three of these variables predicts a 16‐peso per capita increase. A shift from the 10th to the 90th percentile score on all three indicators would correspond to a 30‐peso per capita increase in local revenue collection. This effect is far larger than that of any other variables in the model.            "

"49","I have presented multiple statistical tests of the electoral and participatory hypotheses of government responsiveness, using a variety of measures and model specifications. The two approaches to measuring the performance of Mexican municipal governments merit special attention in this regard. Public utility coverage is a good measure of performance because coverage rates depend primarily on local initiative and efficiency. Local revenue generation is a good measure of performance, not because it measures a municipality's financial capacity for utility provision, but because it signals whether the municipality has undertaken efforts to modernize its bureaucratic capacity and increase its efficiency. Utility provision and local revenue generation offer two very different strategies for conceptualizing and measuring the same construct, municipal government performance. Thus, the fact that the analysis in Tables 3 and 4 produces such strikingly similar results increases our confidence in the findings. Indeed, additional model specifications, diagnostic checks, and alternate measures generate results consistent with the findings presented in this article. The effect of electoral competition on government performance is either insignificant (as in most of the models in this article), or weakly significant and substantively small (as in Table 4, Model 2). Turnout, literacy, and poverty consistently show a close relationship to government performance and are more influential predictors than financial and demographic control variables.         "
"50","Clearly, the most striking finding of the empirical analysis is the lack of any significant relationship between electoral competition and government performance. This is an empirically robust finding, which holds no matter how one chooses to calculate the competition indicator or specify the statistical model. This finding contradicts much of the literature on electoral competition in Mexico (see, among others, Hiskey 1999; Rodríguez 1998) and calls into question the tendency of many scholars to focus exclusively on elections as mechanisms of popular control and government responsiveness. I do not interpret this finding to mean that Mexican politicians are somehow unaware of the electoral cycle or the importance of electoral victories for their parties. However, the data clearly suggest that there is a break somewhere along the causal chain leading from electoral competition to responsive government. I see two possibilities for where this break might be located. The first possibility is that the institutional hurdles I discussed above prove too severe, in the sense that they lead politicians to be more concerned with personal gain and pleasing their parties than with producing responsive political outcomes. The second possibility is that even when representatives are well intentioned, the nature of Mexico's electoral system stymies their efforts. For example, Grindle argues that the electoral cycle induces local politicians to focus on government reform and improving municipal capacity. But “possibilities for capacity development were built upon an institutional base that rewarded change initiatives but worked against their institutionalization”; and when reform initiatives were introduced, “it was difficult to hold officials accountable for their correct functioning, a culture of service was limited by personnel changes every 3 years, and citizens did not have sufficient information to be able to insist on their rights to appropriate service” (2006, 67). Thus, even when politicians are motivated to be responsive, the prohibition against reelection and the three‐year term make sustained responsiveness quite difficult.         "
"51","At the same time, the evidence is consistent with the prediction that government is more responsive where levels of nonelectoral participation are higher. This effect is not conditional on the existence of competitive elections, as is evident in the split‐sample models in Table 3. However, the interpretation of these findings is not so straightforward, since I am forced to rely on indirect indicators of participation. I have argued that turnout, literacy, and poverty rates are best interpreted as indicators of each municipality's level of political participation, based on the assumption that civic participation is correlated with electoral participation, and with levels of education and material resources. The evidence I report in Table 1 supports this assumption, as does an extensive literature on the determinants of political participation across a number of countries (see, among others, Verba, Nie, and Kim 1978; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). But some alternative interpretations cannot be ruled out. It remains possible, for example, that the empirical relationship exists because literacy and (especially) poverty rates indicate development, rather than participation, and are thus related to service provision in a more direct sense. I find this interpretation lacking because it does not offer a political mechanism that ties these socioeconomic characteristics to the behavior of governing officials, who are crucial to the process of utility construction and provision. But the data are not sufficiently precise to favor any single interpretation over all others, and thus my explanation of the relationship cannot be the final word on the subject.         "
"52","At a minimum, these findings reinforce Levy and Székely's (1983) observation that even during the period of PRI hegemony the Mexican government was relatively responsive to higher‐status constituencies. In this sense, the findings I present here might suggest a high degree of continuity in the Mexican system. But such an interpretation would miss two important points. The first is that Levy and Székely's observation is not a sufficient explanation of responsiveness, since it does not tell us how higher‐status constituencies manage to extract better performance from the government. I submit, and the available evidence indicates, that the relationship exists because wealthier and better‐educated communities are better able to articulate their demands to political representatives and press for a response.         "
"53","The second shortcoming of this interpretation is that it ignores a fundamental shift in the quantity and quality of civic participation in Mexico over the past 25 years (Foweraker 1993). Levy and Székely (1983) and Fagen and Touhy (1972) describe a system in which direct participation is only an option for citizens of considerable means, and happens away from the public eye. In contrast, more recent studies of participation in Mexico show it to be an effective strategy even among middle‐ and lower‐class citizens. And while there is no shortage of confrontational participation, like labor strikes and public protests, it has also become far more common for local governments to encourage participation and solicit citizen input through the use of public assemblies, neighborhood meetings, and open‐door policies (Ackerman 2004; see also footnote 4). These qualitative studies, combined with the statistical findings presented here, suggest that increased participation is the most reasonable explanation for improved government performance in Mexican municipalities.         "
"54","Regardless of how one interprets the evidence regarding the participatory hypothesis, it seems clear that the uncritical acceptance of U.S. electoral theory in the Mexican context is imprudent. The electoral connection in Mexico labors under the strain of institutions and practices that impede mechanisms of accountability. These problems include extreme centralization within the municipal government, a constitutional prohibition against reelection, and a three‐year term of office (Guillén López 1996). The latter two problems, in combination, make it exceedingly difficult for municipal presidents to gain experience or expertise in their jobs. And the “last term problem” created by the no‐reelection rule makes it difficult (though not impossible) to explain how Mexican politicians could ever be induced to perform well, even in theory. Of course, anecdotal and case study evidence suggests that many politicians in Mexico are hard working, competent, and effective. But electoral competition does not make them more so.         "
"55","Had the problems introduced by Mexican institutions been properly theorized, scholars would not have generated such strong predictions about the effect of electoral competition on the quality of government in Mexico. Nor would they have neglected competing explanations for government responsiveness. In this sense, the recent literature on Mexican elections may be a conspicuous case of theoretical overreaching in a country whose institutional design seems to make it an unlikely candidate for electoral accountability. But the fact is that all electoral systems are burdened, to different degrees, by institutional and informational constraints on electoral mechanisms of control. And perverse effects like increased fraud, vote buying, or pandering are obvious problems in many electoral regimes, even those who do not share Mexico's peculiar institutional features. Thus, the analysis presented here should serve as a cautionary tale for electoral studies in other countries, where claims of electoral effects are often assumed rather than tested, and where the effect of civic participation is studied separately, or not at all. By simultaneously assessing the impact of electoral competition, participation, and their interaction, I have broadened the scope of inquiry into the types of political activity that may influence the behavior of political representatives and the quality of government."
"56","This approach should travel. For example, it might help to explain why responsiveness lags in electoral authoritarian regimes, where elections are competitive but civil society is weak and citizens are quiescent. It may also explain why authoritarian regimes are occasionally (though less reliably) responsive to public pressure, even in the complete absence of political contestation. At the same time, this integrated approach could improve the reliability of research that finds electoral effects, by helping to rule out the competing explanation that other forms of political engagement are responsible for observed outcomes (see, for example, Beer and Mitchell 2004). Thus, although this article's empirical analysis is narrowly focused on the quality of local government in a single country, the conceptual approach could be used to generate a more complete understanding of the sources of responsiveness in any country where people use participatory strategies to influence the quality of their governments.
