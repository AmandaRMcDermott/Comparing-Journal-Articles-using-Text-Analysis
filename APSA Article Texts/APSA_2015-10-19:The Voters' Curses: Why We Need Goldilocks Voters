"1","Our approach to electoral communication emphasizes the idea that voters' knowledge is endogenous to both their attention level and candidates' behavior. In that respect, our model shares substantive similarities with the literature on deliberation in groups (Dickson, Hafer, and Landa 2008; Hafer and Landa 2007; Landa and Meirowitz 2009), where the quality of information transmission is determined by group members' time allocation between speaking and listening. This literature investigates whether deliberation can aggregate information. The focus of this article, instead, is on how electoral communication can address the problem of screening and disciplining elected representatives.         "
"2","On a more technical level, we build on Dewatripont and Tirole's (2005) model of imperfect learning. In Dewatripont and Tirole's article, however, the sender does not face a moral hazard problem, nor is the receiver concerned about screening competent senders. Those aspects are critical for our substantive results, which cannot be foreseen from Dewatripont and Tirole's analysis.3"
"3","Our article also contributes to the formal literature on political accountability, and more specifically signaling in elections. A large vein of this literature studies conditions under which voters can learn, via the electoral process, about politicians' attributes. These studies yield important insights into two broad themes: (a) the extent to which elections can effectively screen competent politicians (Caselli et al. 2014; Gordon and Landa 2009) and (b) the extent to which politicians' incentives to credibly reveal information to voters can result in socially undesirable policies (Fu and Li 2014; Rogo 1990).4 As our theory shows, introducing voters' cognitive constraints can have a strong effect on candidates' incentives to reveal information and consequently on voters' ability to learn from elections.5"
"4","By treating voters' attention to politics as endogenous, we find a critical link between voters' interest in politics and candidates' behavior. This interdependence is absent from most of the formal literature on signaling in elections where candidates' actions depend only on their benefit from holding office. Our focus on the determinants of voters' attention allows us to recover a critical insight from signaling games. Since Spence's (1973) model of education as signaling, it is well known that a firm can screen high‐productivity applicants through education only if the wage premium is not too low and not too high. As a result of voters' endogenous attention, a similar feature arises in our setup despite the fixed nature of the electoral reward (i.e., the value of holding office). But unlike a firm that can design an optimal wage schedule, voters have no way to commit to a certain level of attention. Compared to economics, signaling in electoral politics is less effective due to the curses of the uninterested and interested voters.         "
"5","We analyze a formal model of elections featuring a one‐period, three‐player game with two candidates (1 and 2) and a representative voter. Candidates compete for an elected office, which they value. Before the campaign, each candidate  privately observes his type , where c denotes a competent and n denotes a noncompetent candidate. Candidate j then chooses a platform: either a status quo policy () or a new policy (), which is costly to implement. It is common knowledge that the proportion of competent candidates is .         "
"6","The voter's main electoral concern is candidates' ability to successfully implement policy change. Compared to the status quo policy, the new policy is beneficial to the voter only when implemented by a competent politician. The new policy can be thought of as a change in economic paradigms (e.g., Latin American countries' transition from import substitution industrialization to free markets in the 1980s), an institutional reform (e.g., Bolivia's decentralization in 1994; see Grindle 2000), or an overhaul of an important policy domain (e.g., the Affordable Care Act in 2010, or New Zealand's labor market reforms in the 1990s).         "
"7","Competent politicians can more successfully set the scope and pacing of this type of reform, can ensure the adequate compensation of winners and losers, and can avoid the large costs that badly engineered policy change can impose on society (as in Latin America in the 1980s; see Krueger 1993). Using Carmines and Stimson's (1980) terminology, the new policy corresponds to a hard issue, a technical issue for which a candidate's personal ability is of paramount importance. In contrast, our definition of a new policy is less suitable for the study of soft issues, purely redistributive issues or social issues (e.g., abortion or religion), for which competence arguably matters less.         "
"8","In line with the literature on voters' behavior, we consider an imperfectly informed voter. The voter cannot directly observe candidates' competence and can only learn candidates' platforms if she pays attention to the electoral campaign (e.g., watching TV news reports, and debates). During the campaign, the voter chooses a level of attention , each candidate j exerts communication effort  (unobserved by the voter), and the probability that the voter observes candidate j's platform is  (see Figure 1).6 Fixing the voter's attention, greater communication effort by a candidate (e.g., higher number of ads) increases the probability that the voter becomes informed. In turn, fixing a candidate's effort, greater voter attention increases the probability that she learns this candidate's platform. Voter learning thus satisfies Zaller's (1992, 42) reception axiom, which states that “the greater a person's level of cognitive engagement with an issue, the more likely he or she is to be exposed to and comprehend—in a word, receive—political messages concerning that issue.” After the campaign, the voter elects one of the two candidates, denoted by .         "
"9","For the voter, attention to politics entails costly cognitive efforts (e.g., effort required to decipher a candidate's message) and/or an opportunity cost (e.g., reading about the election rather than learning through more entertaining alternatives). This cost is parameterized by the thrice continuously differentiable function  satisfying , , , and strict convexity on (0, 1]. To simplify the exposition, we also assume that  is weakly convex.7"
"10","The voter's policy payoff is (normalized to) 0 if the elected politician implements the status quo policy. Her payoff depends on the politician's competence when he implements the new policy. When the elected politician is competent, the voter gets a utility gain of . When he is noncompetent, she experiences a utility loss of . G corresponds to the voter's gain from change and captures her interest in politics in the context of our theory. The voter's utility function is thus:            "
"11","Candidates are office motivated. We normalize their payoff from being outside of office to 0. If elected, a politician gets a payoff of 1 if he implements the status quo policy and  if he implements the new policy (). The policy cost of implementing the new policy depends on the candidate's competence: . As noted by Hall and Deardoff (2006), any policy change entails a cost for politicians promoting it: the cost of collecting information, striking a bargain with veto players, and so on. A competent politician is more able to undertake these tasks.8"
"12","We also suppose that communicating with the voter is costly for candidates. This cost captures the difficulty of defining and disseminating (e.g., airing ads, organizing meetings) a clear and effective message to the voter in a noisy environment. We parameterize a politician's cost of communication by the function  with the same properties as the voter's cost function . Candidate j ()'s utility function is            "
"13","To summarize, the timing of the game is as follows:            "
"14","The model described above is the simplest setup to convey the intuition for our results. Candidates are symmetric and can only communicate their platform; they cannot credibly reveal their type to the voter directly.9 Furthermore, for analytic tractability, we assume that candidates credibly commit to their platform.10"
"15","To ensure that electoral communication plays an important role, we assume that . This assumption captures the idea that voters are unwilling to simply act as a rubber stamp to an ambitious reformist agenda (Rodrik 1996), but rather need to be convinced of a candidate's ability to successfully carry out policy changes.         "
"16","The equilibrium concept is perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in pure strategies (with the caveat that the voter tosses a fair coin to decide which candidate to elect when indifferent), and excluding weakly dominated strategies. A formal definition of the equilibrium can be found in online Appendix A (see Definition 1). Henceforth, the term equilibrium refers to this class of equilibria.         "
"17","We now present some general properties of the voter's and the candidates' equilibrium strategies. First, there always exists an equilibrium in which no candidate proposes the new policy. In this “status quo” equilibrium, the voter chooses to rationally ignore the campaign: She expects both candidates to propose the status quo policy regardless of their competence. Candidates, in turn, rationally anticipating that a commitment to the new policy is never observed by the voter, choose the status quo policy (whose implementation cost is lower). This status quo equilibrium is the benchmark to which we compare other equilibria.               "
"18","Proposition 1.For all parameter values, there exists an equilibrium in which both candidates (independently of their type) commit to the status quo policy without exerting communication effort, and the voter does not pay attention to the campaign.                  "
"19","More generally, since the status quo policy entails no policy cost, commitment to this policy can be understood as a default option. A politician has no incentive to pay a cost to reveal that he commits to his default option. Consequently, the voter places high probability on a candidate promising no change when communication is unsuccessful. As a result, a candidate must exert strictly positive communication effort when committing to the new policy.               "
"20","Lemma 1.In any equilibrium, a candidate exerts strictly positive communication effort if and only if he commits to the new policy ().                  "
"21","Lemma 1 implies that a candidate effectively faces a double cost of committing to the new policy: a policy cost  (borne only if he is elected) and a communication cost  (borne regardless of the electoral outcome).            "
"22","We now study whether the electoral process can lead to a better outcome for the voter than the benchmark status quo equilibrium. As long as the screening problem faced by the voter is severe enough ( is not too large), the electoral process performs best for the voter (i.e., the voter's ex ante expected utility is higher than in any other equilibrium) when candidates commit to the new policy only if they are competent.11 In this case, the voter always benefits from the new policy, and the campaign is highly informative: Learning a candidate's commitment to the new policy is a perfect signal of competence. In this section, we study under which conditions this “separating equilibrium” exists.         "
"23","By Lemma 1, a separating equilibrium exists only if, for a competent candidate, the electoral reward for committing to the new policy is greater than the policy cost and the communication cost; this is a competent candidate's incentive compatibility constraint. A noncompetent candidate's incentive compatibility constraint is the reverse inequality: His communication and policy costs must be larger than the electoral reward for committing to the new policy.         "
"24","As communication affects both the reward for and cost of committing to the new policy, we first study the players' communication choices when candidates play a separating strategy. The next lemma shows that candidates' and the voter's optimal communication choices are unique.            "
"25","Lemma 2.Suppose a separating equilibrium exists. The voter's equilibrium level of attention and candidates' equilibrium communication efforts are unique and satisfy the following:                  "
"26","A noncompetent candidate does not invest in communication since he commits to the status quo policy (Lemma 1). A competent candidate chooses his communication effort and the voter chooses her level of attention such that the marginal benefit of an additional unit of communication effort is equal to its marginal cost.         "
"27","For a competent candidate, the marginal benefit of effort is equal to the increased probability of being elected times the payoff from being in office. For the voter, the marginal benefit of attention is the reduced probability of an electoral mistake times the payoff gain from avoiding such a mistake: Electing a noncompetent candidate when his opponent is competent, commits to the new policy, but goes undetected. Therefore, as the policy gain G from selecting a competent politician increases, the voter pays higher attention to the electoral campaign. Due to the complementarity in the campaigning technology (), greater attention to the campaign increases the effectiveness of a competent candidate's communication effort. As a result, a competent candidate's communication effort also increases with G.            "
"28","Lemma 3.When candidates play a separating strategy, the voter's level of attention () and competent candidates' communication efforts () increase with the gain from change (G).               "
"29","Our next result shows how attention by the voter and communication effort by a competent candidate  affect the opposing candidate's incentives to commit to the new policy.            "
"30","Lemma 4.When candidates play a separating strategy, an increase in attention by the voter or communication effort by competent candidate "
"31","When the voter pays more attention to the campaign, the return on committing to the new policy increases for both competent and noncompetent candidates. This is a consequence of two effects. The first and main effect is that greater attention implies that the voter is more likely to learn candidates' platforms (in particular, candidates' commitment to the new policy). Greater probability of the voter's learning increases a competent candidate's electoral chances. However, better electoral prospects for a competent candidate j implies a lower probability of winning the election for the opposing noncompetent candidate, who commits to the status quo policy. In addition, if a noncompetent candidate campaigns on the new policy, his electoral chances improve since the voter is more likely to learn his platform. As a consequence, greater attention by the voter also implies that a noncompetent candidate has a stronger incentive to commit to harmful policy change.12"
"32","Greater voter attention also increases the effectiveness of candidates' communication efforts. Consequently, it is less costly for both competent and noncompetent candidates to commit to the new policy. A candidate's incentive to propose the new policy thus increases. This additional effect follows from the complementarity assumed in our model of communication, but it is not necessary for Lemma 4.         "
"33","Using Lemmas 3 and 4, we can determine under which conditions a separating equilibrium exists. The next proposition shows that a separating equilibrium exists if and only if the voter's gain from change is in an intermediate range.            "
"34","Proposition 2.There exists an open non‐empty set of policy costs () such that there exist a unique  and  (functions of q, , , , and ) such that a separating equilibrium exists if and only if the voter's gain from change is in an intermediate range: .               "
"35","Suppose the voter anticipates that a candidate commits to the new policy only if competent. As the gain from change G increases, the benefit of detecting a competent politician increases and the voter pays more attention to the campaign (Lemma 3). The probability that the voter learns a candidate's platform thus increases, and so does the electoral reward for committing to the new policy. Consequently, as illustrated in Figure 2, the expected payoff from committing to the new policy increases with G for both competent (Figure 2a, solid line) and noncompetent (Figure 2b, solid line) candidates. In contrast, as the voter detects commitment to the new policy with greater probability, a candidate's electoral prospects from committing to the status quo policy decrease with G. As a consequence, the expected payoff from committing to the status quo policy decreases with G for both competent (Figure 2a, dashed line) and noncompetent (Figure 2b, dashed line) candidates.         "

"37","Note: The dark line is the expected payoff from committing to the new policy; the blue dashed line is the expected payoff from committing to the status quo policy. Parameter values: ,  with . Equilibrium values: , .                     "
"38","For a separating equilibrium to exist, it is necessary that a competent candidate prefers to commit to the new policy. However, when G is low, by the reasoning above, the voter pays little attention, and a competent candidate's expected payoff from committing to the new policy is lower (relatively low electoral reward, high communication and policy costs) than the expected payoff from committing to the status quo policy. Therefore, a competent candidate prefers to propose the status quo policy, and a separating strategy profile cannot be an equilibrium. When the voter's gain from change is low, the voter would pay too little attention for a separating equilibrium to exist. This is the curse of the uninterested voter.         "
"39","When G is relatively high (above ; see Figure 2a), a competent candidate has enough incentive to commit to the new policy. But this is not sufficient to guarantee the existence of a separating equilibrium. In fact, it is also necessary that a noncompetent candidate prefers to commit to the status quo policy. However, when G is high, by the reasoning above, the voter's level of attention is high, so a noncompetent candidate's expected payoff from committing to the status quo policy is lower than the expected payoff from committing to the new policy (despite the large policy cost). Therefore, a noncompetent candidate prefers to propose the new policy and a separating equilibrium cannot exist. When the voter's gain from change is large, the voter would pay too much attention for a separating equilibrium to exist. This is the curse of the interested voter.         "
"40","The previous section establishes that a separating equilibrium (when a candidate commits to the new policy only if competent) exists only if the gain from change (G) is intermediary. As G captures how much the voter cares about politics, a separating equilibrium exists if and only if the voter's interest in politics is not too low and not too high. In this section, we discuss the normative and policy implications of this result.         "
"41","As mentioned above, when the adverse selection problem faced by the voter is severe enough ( is not too large), a separating strategy profile (i.e., candidates commit to the new policy only when competent) maximizes the voter's welfare. As such, a direct consequence of Proposition 2 is that an increase in the voter's interest in politics (G) can be welfare‐reducing (see Figure 3a below for an illustration).               "
"42","Proposition 3.Let  denote the voter's ex ante equilibrium welfare as a function of her interest. There exists a non‐empty open set of policy costs such that there exists  such that .                  "

"45","Proposition 3 has important implications for the voters' role in democracy. Scholars have long debated voters' capacity to fulfill their democratic duties, under the common presumption that a more engaged electorate would improve the quality of democratic government. Our article shows that this claim needs to be qualified. The curse of the interested voter implies that when the voter's interest is high, the electoral process loses its effectiveness as a screening and disciplining device. For a very high gain from change, the voter faces either candidates who always propose the status quo policy (Proposition 1) or candidates who propose the new policy despite being noncompetent. As such, greater interest in politics can lead to a decrease, rather than an increase, in the quality of democratic governance.            "
"46","The over‐responsiveness of the electoral process has a second important implication in terms of voters' attention. For , either no candidate commits to the new policy or candidates start to propose the policy preferred by voters regardless of their ability to adequately implement changes. The latter case occurs when (a) candidate  proposes the new policy independently of his type, whereas his opponent always proposes the status quo policy;13 (b) candidate j proposes the new policy independently of his type, whereas his opponent campaigns on the new policy only if competent; or (c) both candidates propose the new policy independently of their level of competence. In each of these three cases, learning that a candidate commits to the new policy is still informative because a competent candidate exerts more effort than a noncompetent candidate due to his lower policy cost. However, learning a candidate's platform is only an imperfect signal of a candidate's competence. The voter risks electing the wrong type of candidate after learning his platform, so her return on attention decreases. While her interest increases, the voter's level of attention decreases compared to the separating equilibrium level, .               "
"47","Proposition 4.Denote  the voter's highest equilibrium level of attention as a function of her interest. There exists a non‐empty open set of policy costs such that                     "
"48","The empirical literature on political engagement generally conflates voters' interest in politics with voters' attention to politics. Proposition 4 shows the importance of distinguishing between these two notions. For a given set of policy options, an increase in the voter's interest always increases the voter's attention to politics (see Figure 3b). However, an increase in the voter's interest can change candidates' equilibrium behaviors. As noncompetent candidates switch to proposing the new policy, the voter becomes skeptical about how informative the electoral campaign truly is, and her attention decreases. Proposition 4 shows that the voter's attention to electoral campaigns does not necessarily determine how much she learns from it, but rather what the voter can learn from the campaign determines how much attention she pays to it.            "
"49","Figure 3a shows the voter's equilibrium welfare as a function of her gain from change. As indicated above, the voter's welfare is highest when candidates play a separating strategy. When no candidate proposes the new policy (), the voter gets a payoff of 0. When Candidate 1 commits to the new policy independently of his competence and Candidate 2 commits to the status quo regardless of his competence (), the voter gets a strictly positive expected payoff since electoral communication acts as an imperfect screening device.            "
"50","Regarding the voter's attention (Figure 3b), the voter pays no attention to the campaign when both candidates propose the status quo policy (), since she has nothing to learn from the campaign. In a separating equilibrium (), learning that a candidate proposes the new policy is a perfect signal of competence, so the electoral campaign is highly informative and the voter pays a high level of attention to it. When her interest in politics is very high () due to the over‐responsiveness of the electoral process, Candidate 1 proposes the new policy even when noncompetent. Consequently, the voter becomes skeptical about the benefit of learning a candidate's platform and pays less attention to the electoral campaign despite an increase in Candidate 1's effort.            "
"51","So far, our focus has been on the voter's interest in politics (G), which depends on her evaluation of the importance of a policy change—a factor that can hardly be affected by policy interventions.14 Policy interventions, however, can affect the cost of paying attention to politics and consequently the value of the bounds determining the existence of the welfare‐maximizing equilibrium ( and ). Our theory predicts that such policy interventions can have unintended consequences.            "
"52","Consider the recommendation to provide voters with “access to better information about public policy” (Page and Shapiro 1992, 398). A common policy proposal is to decrease the cost of political information (e.g., Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Page and Shapiro 1992) via, for example, increased subsidies for public broadcasting services (O'Mahen 2013; Soroka et al. 2013). In our setup, this type of intervention would indeed increase the voter's attention, holding everything else constant. But greater attention, by the analysis above, would also increase the incentive for both competent and noncompetent candidates to commit to the new policy. In terms of equilibrium bounds, a reduction in the cost of attention decreases both  and .15 Whether such an intervention is beneficial critically depends on the level of the voter's interest. When interest is low (e.g., due to good economic performance), a decrease in the cost of collecting information is likely to have a positive effect on the voter's attention and welfare since the curse of the uninterested voter is mitigated ( decreases). When interest is high (e.g., due to poor economic performance), a decrease in this cost is likely to have a negative effect on attention and welfare since the curse of the interested voter is exacerbated ( decreases). In this case, the policy intervention risks changing candidates' behavior.            "
"53","Similar unintended consequences could arise if media were required or encouraged to report more political news. To see that, suppose that the probability the voter learns the platform of candidate  is , where  captures media outlets' responsiveness to the electoral campaign. An increase in ρ has a similar effect as a decrease in the cost of attention for the voter. Consequently, the equilibrium thresholds ( and ) decrease with ρ. When the voter's interest is high, policy interventions aimed at increasing media's reporting about politics can then diminish voters' welfare and attention to politics.16"
"54","To summarize, our theory implies that evaluation of policies aimed at improving political information (through increased subsidies to public broadcasting or more responsive media) based on the assumptions that the set of alternatives available to the voter is fixed suffers from a fundamental flaw. It is critical to recognize that candidates strategically respond to changes in voters' behavior induced by the policy intervention."
"55","In order to directly contrast our results with traditional models of electoral accountability, the baseline setting focuses on a single representative voter. In this model, however, there is a greater urgency to address the considerations of robustness to multiple voters. Indeed, paying attention to politics can be thought of as a form of public good provision, where well‐known issues of free riding could significantly affect the conclusions from the baseline model. In spite of these considerations, our key insights hold in large electorates.17"
"56","Consider an electorate composed of  voters (so  corresponds to the representative voter case), each indexed by the subscript i. Voter i has a gain from change  and a loss , with  so  for all i. To partially offset the significant increase in analytical complexity, we adopt a common functional form for the cost functions:  and , with .18"
"57","We assume that each voter independently pays attention to the campaign, but voters are able to pool their information before voting (e.g., due to their ability to share simple information cues). This model is of substantive theoretical interest since it isolates the effect of free riding without significantly affecting the candidates' choices of effort compared to the baseline setup.19"
"58","To reach the whole electorate, candidates simply need to successfully communicate with a single voter. Each voter, instead, values her attention only to the extent that her learning candidates' platforms is decisive for the outcome of the election. Since all voters are informed when at least one voter is, each voter is decisive when she is the only one learning a candidate's platform. As such, free riding occurs and a voter's level of attention is decreasing in other voters' attention. Nonetheless, when candidates play a separating strategy, competent candidates' communication efforts and voters' levels of attention are well defined, positive, and increasing in G (the common gain from change). As such, greater gain from change implies greater electoral rewards for committing to the new policy as in the baseline setup. Consequently, Proposition 2 generalizes to multiple voters with heterogeneous gains from change: A separating equilibrium exists if and only if the gain G lies in an intermediate range: .         "
"59","As the number of voters increases, a voter's incentive to free ride increases (and the probability she is pivotal decreases). One might conjecture then that the presence of multiple voters significantly mitigates the curse of the interested voter ( increases as N increases). The opposite, however, holds true: (a) For large enough electorates, the curse of the interested voter becomes more severe as the number of voters increases ( for  and N sufficiently large), and (b) when the electorate is large enough, the curse of the interested voter is more severe than in the model with a representative voter ( for N large enough).         "
"60","To understand these results, notice that when candidates play a separating strategy, voters face the problem of detecting a “right” alternative (a competent candidate) against a “wrong” alternative (a noncompetent candidate). This is a similar environment as in the Condorcet jury literature (e.g., Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1996; McLennan 1998). When voters can only choose between acquiring perfect costly information or staying uninformed, the public good nature of information implies that as the number of voters increases, the probability that at least one voter acquires information decreases.20 But as Martinelli (2006) shows, this conclusion is completely reversed when voters can choose the quality of their information continuously, as in our setup. The probability that at least one voter becomes informed (which determines candidates' reward for committing to the new policy) increases with N since voters always have an incentive to “buy a small amount of information” (pay a small but positive level of attention to the campaign).21 Consequently, in large electorates, the curse of the interested voter is more severe.22"
"61","In this article, we show that the commonly believed premise that a more engaged electorate improves the performance of the democratic process needs to be qualified. In line with previous theories, we identify a curse of the uninterested voter: Voters need to care sufficiently about politics for elections to effectively screen and discipline politicians. More surprisingly, our theory also uncovers a curse of the interested voter. When voters' interest in politics is very high, voters' welfare and attention to politics are low due to candidates' strategic behavior. The electoral process thus performs best when voters are like Goldilocks: They care neither too little nor too much about politics."
"62","Our theory yields two other important predictions. First, it is not possible to infer from voters' level of attention how much they care about politics. Second, policies meant to decrease the cost of voters' attention might have unintended consequences on voters' welfare and level of attention to politics by inducing harmful changes in candidates' behavior."
"63","Our article is a first step toward a better understanding of how voters' attention choices under cognitive constraints affect politicians' incentives to act in voters' interest. Our focus has been on common value issues (among voters) for which competence plays a critical role. Extending the model to settings in which politicians might strategically choose between divisive/partisan issues and common‐value issues might generate interesting effects that deserve further attention. We also study an environment where candidates are symmetric. This is not always the case. Voters might have different evaluations of candidates' competence (reputation imbalance) or what their party stands for (partisan imbalance). How these different types of imbalances affect the performance of the electoral process in our framework is a promising avenue for future research."
