"1","Ever since the first election under the new Constitution was held in 1947, inequalities in legislative representation steadily deteriorated until the mid‐1970s. This was caused by rapid population movement from rural to urban areas, which was associated with rapid economic growth as well as the government's inability to rectify the problem. Although the Public Offices Election Law (Kōshoku Senkyo Hō) stipulates that a reapportionment of seats be made based on each national census, which takes place every five years (e.g., in 1990, 1995, and 2000), the government made only minimal efforts to reapportion the legislative seats.2"
"2","We can trace the steady deterioration of inequalities in Lower House representation through a variety of measures. Table 1 lays out two indices of inequality in representation.2 The first index is the ratio of the maximum over the minimum number of seats per capita (the “maximin ratio”). This measure is sensitive to the presence of outlying observations and does not accurately reflect the overall tendency of inequalities. Nevertheless, as in the United States, it is the most frequently cited measure in judicial decisions in Japan. The figure started off at 1.76 in 1947 and reached a record high of 4.99 in the 1972 election. The two earliest reapportionment decisions in 1964 and 1975 did not hurt any incumbent, because no existing districts suffered a cutback in the number of seats. These decisions only divided a few urban districts into two and increased the number of seats in several districts. As the total number of seats reached the capacity limit of the Diet Hall, it became necessary to reduce the number of seats in several districts. The 1986 reapportionment added one seat each to eight districts and subtracted one each from seven districts, without changing district boundaries.2 The 1992 reapportionment adopted a similar process: nine districts gained one seat each and ten districts lost one each.         "
"3","Not surprisingly, these four reapportionment decisions, which merely trimmed the few extreme cases, failed to alleviate the overall level of inequality. This is evidenced by another measure of inequality in representation—the Loosemore‐Hanby (LH) index of electoral disproportionality (Taagepera and Shugart 1989).2 The index takes the value of zero when seat allocation is perfectly proportional and approaches the value of one where the allocation of seats is more concentrated in fewer districts. The LH index is less frequently used than the maximin ratio, but it reflects the overall tendency for malapportionment more accurately because the index takes into account the level of malapportionment in all districts. Consider the two cases in which the maximin ratio showed a significant decline: one in 1976 and another in 1986. Table 1 shows that although the maximin ratio dropped from 4.99 to 3.50 in 1976 and from 4.41 to 2.92 in 1986, the LH index shows only a slight decline, from 0.146 to 0.128 in 1976 and from 0.138 to 0.129 in 1986.         "
"4","It was not until the 1994 electoral reform that reapportionment was conducted in a categorical manner. This reform introduced a combination of the 300 seats elected by the single‐member district (SMD) plurality rule and another 200 seats elected by the proportional representation (PR) system from 11 regional blocs.2 The reform was mainly intended to remove excessively personalized electioneering styles under the single nontransferable vote system (SNTV) with multimember districts (MMD) and to install party‐centered competition.2 One consequence, however, was that the reform brought about a sizable reduction in malapportionment.2 Although the 1994 reapportionment did not fully achieve the goal of the “one‐person, one‐vote” principle, it significantly alleviated the overall level of malapportionment; the LH index dropped from 0.131 to 0.078.         "
"5","This dramatic change is better evidenced in Figure 1, which provides three scatter plots of pre‐ and postreapportionment voting weight. “Voting weight” is defined as the number of seats per million district‐populations (subtracted from its national average). Each data point corresponds to the voting weight in approximately 3,300 municipalities in Japan.2 The 45‐degree line serves as the benchmark of no change, while the regression line summarizes the data. If a reapportionment decision strictly embodies the “one‐person, one‐vote” principle, every observation will be aligned on a horizontal regression line. Therefore, the more horizontal the regression line, the more significant is the equalization of legislative representation.         "
"6","                 Comparison of Recent Reapportionment Decisions in Japan                      "
"7","Panels A and B show that reapportionment decisions in 1986 and 1992 did not alleviate inequalities in a sizable manner.2 Most observations are concentrated along the 45‐degree line. However, it is evident from Panel C that reapportionment associated with the electoral reform in 1994 led to a major reduction in inequality in representation.2 Although the positive slope of the regression line shows that municipalities in previously overrepresented districts still maintained heavier voting weight under the new electoral system, the slope of the regression line is more horizontal than those in the two previous cases of reapportionment (i.e., 0.20 in Panel C, as opposed to 0.78 in Panel A and 0.80 in Panel B).         "
"8","In sum, reapportionment in 1994 was considerably different from that of previous years. The reform not only drew new district borders but also alleviated the overall level of malapportionment. In the following sections, using the minor equalization in 1992 for contrast, we focus on the major equalization in 1994 and examine whether the electoral reform did, indeed, affect policy outcomes.         "
"9","Despite the fact that the malapportionment of seats in the Lower House has long been considered a serious problem in Japan, there exists only a limited number of empirical studies that examine how malapportionment affects intergovernmental transfers. What is more notable is that these studies found inconsistent results. Some of them found indeterminate effects (Yoshino and Yoshida 1988) or no significant effects (Kikuchi 1989) of malapportionment on fiscal transfers, but others found significant results (Meyer and Naka 1999; Onizuka 1997). As with the American case, we consider that this lack of consistency derives from inappropriate data and methods.         "
"10","The main problem is that literally all of the existing studies in Japan used data aggregated at the prefecture level. Prefecture‐level data is very easy to access and is convenient for examining the relationships between various types of political and economic variables. Nevertheless, with only 47 observations, the estimated effects suffer from a problem of inefficiency. More importantly, Lower House seats are malapportioned not only across prefectures but also within prefectures. For example, the largest within‐prefecture maximin ratio was 3.75 in 1972 (Chiba), 2.47 in 1993 (Tokyo), and 1.74 in 2000 (Aichi). Therefore, studies using prefecture‐level data average away analytically relevant pieces of information that could, eventually, lead to biased inferences.         "
"11","Our analysis improves upon existing studies by using municipal‐level data. In Japan, there are roughly over 3,300 municipalities (shi, ku, chō, and son) within 47 prefectures (to, dō, fu, and ken). Electoral districts, typically, include multiple municipalities, and there are only a few municipalities that belong to multiple electoral districts. In other words, electoral districts under both the old SNTV‐MMD and the current SMD rules respect municipality borders.2 Methodologically, this is very important as municipalities provide a stable frame of reference within which we can compare intertemporal differences of subsidy allocation under different districting schemes.2"
"12","Another problem with existing studies is that they examine the relationship between the apportionment of seats and subsidy allocation across prefectures in some particular years. To put it in another way, they did not examine how the change in apportionment (i.e., reapportionment) affects the change in redistribution. To date, no scholar has ever examined the consequences of not only the minor reapportionments but also the major reapportionment attributable to the 1994 electoral reform, which was, as we have argued, the single most drastic equalization of legislative representation in postwar Japanese history.         "
"13","Our article is the first, among the available literature, that investigates the effects of reapportionment in Japan. We consider that examining how the change in representation affects the change in redistribution, using differenced cross‐section data, is a more direct and appropriate method for testing the effects of institutional change on policy outcomes.2 It is also methodologically preferable because by taking the first‐order differences, we can remove the effects of time‐invariant municipality‐specific factors, which may lead to omitted variable biases in conventional cross‐sectional regressions. As a matter of fact, such location‐specific factors are substantively important in Japan. For instance, the allocation of subsidies is affected by the presence of power plants, national defense bases, oil stockpiling facilities, and so on.         "
"14","Let us now introduce our data and methods more specifically. To begin with, we conduct cross‐sectional OLS regressions using data from four fiscal years before (i.e., FY1991 to FY1994) and after (i.e., FY1995 to FY1998) the electoral reform. Having acknowledged some of the methodological problems with this approach, we employ this cross‐sectional estimation for a first‐cut analysis. The purpose is to find out if the estimated effects of the apportionment of seats on the allocation of money changed after the electoral reform.         "
"15","Then, more importantly, we examine the covariates of the changes in subsidies per capita. When choosing pairs of fiscal years, we considered the following two criteria. First, the most recent Lower House election must have been held prior to the beginning of the budget cycle in the summer.2 Second, no election must be held during that fiscal year. When these conditions are satisfied, the budgets, including supplementary ones, are approved by politicians elected in the most recent Lower House election and should be free from any outright influence by politicians who are to be elected in the next election. The fiscal years that satisfy these two conditions include 1992, 1995, and 1998. The most recent Lower House elections held nearest to these fiscal years were those in February 1990, June 1993, and October 1996. Minor reapportionment was carried out in 1992 and major reapportionment (i.e., the electoral reform) in 1994. Therefore, the first pair of fiscal years, FY1995‐FY1992, includes the minor reapportionment decision, while the second pair, FY1998‐FY1995, includes the major reapportionment decision.2 By comparing the regression estimates of these two cases, we intend to see if the effect of reapportionment differs according to the magnitude of reapportionment decisions.         "
"16","Let us clarify our operationalization and definition of the dependent and independent variables. For our dependent variables, we use the per capita amount of total transfers from the central government to municipal governments (in logs). The total transfers are defined as the sum of general (chihō kōfuzei kōfukin) and specific (kokko shishutsukin) subsidies.2 They include both formulaic and nonformulaic portions for a wide range of programs (e.g., construction, health and welfare, education, and disaster restoration). As with Ansolabehere, Gerber, and Snyder (2002), we prefer to use the total transfers rather than program‐specific or type‐specific (i.e., either formulaic or nonformulaic) transfers for the following reasons. First, the program breakdown of the subsidies for small towns and villages is simply not readily available. More importantly, when we use program‐specific or type‐specific subsidies as our dependent variable, we may not satisfactorily measure the overall political effects of reapportionment. This is because a particular project is often financed by various pockets. For example, a “public home for the aged” (rōjin hōmu) may be financed by both formulaic and nonformulaic portions under construction and welfare programs. Thus, estimating political influences on decomposed public transfers should suffer from measurement errors.         "
"17","The apportionment of seats, our key independent variable, is measured in terms of the number of seats divided by the district population (in logs).2 As explained in the introductory section, we expect that this variable is positively correlated with the dependent variable.         "
"18","One may argue that subsidy allocation during prereform years may have partly influenced the process of equalizing legislative representation through the electoral reform in 1994. If such an effect exists, our regression estimates would suffer from an endogeneity bias. We consider that this argument is inapplicable, because we could find no evidence suggesting that the 1994 electoral reform in Japan was intended to alleviate the problem of politically biased resource transfers across municipalities. As we have explained, its primary goal was to remove excessively personalized electioneering styles under the SNTV‐MMD system. Thus, the equalization of transfers, if any, should be regarded as an unintended consequence."
"19","Besides the number of representatives per capita, there are a variety of factors that may affect the geographical allocation of subsidies. As discussed earlier, formal representation may not be a significant factor when other relevant variables are appropriately controlled. Thus, to cope with omitted variable biases and to capture other formulaic and nonformulaic determinants of subsidy allocation, we included a set of control variables: LDP's seat share, municipality fiscal strength index (zaisei‐ryoku shisū), population, income, dependent population, industrial structure, and municipality urbanness.         "
"20","The LDP's district seat share (i.e., the number of LDP Lower House members divided by the number of seats; Mizusaki n.d.) is intended to control the effect of partisanship (Meyer and Naka 1998). If the LDP piles up subsidies for its constituents even after providing the formulaic portion, the coefficient should be positive. On the other hand, the LDP may want to use subsidies to buy off marginal voters who had not previously voted for the party. Under this scenario, the coefficient should be negative.2"
"21","The municipality fiscal strength index (Chihō Zaisei Chōsa Kenkyū Kai, Various issues) controls the effect of formulaic portions of transfers. Roughly speaking, it indicates the fraction of a municipality's fiscal demand that can be financed by its local taxes.2 Since the central government developed this index for the purpose of determining the amount of general (i.e., formulaic) subsidies to each municipality, there is no doubt that the coefficient is negative and highly significant.         "
"22","The municipality population (Kokudo Chiri‐in, Various issues a; in logs) and the municipality population density (Kokudo Chiri Kyōkai, Various issues; Kokudo Chiri‐in, Various issues; in logs) are also intended to control the effects of formulaic portions, because the central government also considers the size and density of populations when allocating general subsidies. Previous literature suggests that both municipality population size and population density negatively affect the allocation of subsidies per capita."
"23","There are two more theoretical justifications for including the population size. The first is the economy of scale in administration. Existing studies have shown that municipality population size is negatively correlated with the cost of administration (Saito and Nakai 1995). Another justification is the asymmetry of lobbying resources. When Lower House representatives lobby for additional subsidies from the central government, mayors and members of the prefectural assembly typically pipeline construction projects. Since both the number of mayors and prefectural assembly members per capita is inversely related to the municipality population, we expect that smaller municipalities obtain more subsidies per capita.         "
"24","The taxable income per capita (Nippon Mākettingu Kyōiku Sentā, Various issues) is expected to have a negative effect because some portions of the central‐to‐municipal subsidies are used explicitly to assist the poor and the unemployed. The share of dependent population also enters the formulaic calculation of subsidies (Sōmuchō Tōkeikyoku, Various issues). The larger the share of population under 14, the higher the demand for education spending. The same is true for the share of population over 65 with regard to welfare spending."
"25","We also set controls for the industrial structure in each municipality. Specifically, we use the ratio of the number of persons employed in the agricultural sector against the total number of employed persons in each municipality (Sōmuchō Tōkeikyoku, Various issues). A similar variable is also included for the service sector. These two industrial sectors are expected to give positive effects for the following reasons. First, since agriculture and service are vulnerable to international competition, these sectors raise their demands for protective measures. Second, the base category for comparison is the manufacturing industry, in which the strength of unions prevented a penetration of the LDP's partisan support."
"26","The ratio of the population in Densely Inhabited Districts (DID) against the total population (Sōmuchō Tōkeikyoku, Various issues) is a measure of municipality urbanness. A large portion of construction expenditure is used for purchasing project sites, and the cost is typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Therefore, urbanness is expected to have a positive effect on the amount of subsidies."
"27","We also include a dummy variable for cities designated by ordinance (seirei shitei toshi).2 This variable should be included as a control because these cities, as compared to other municipalities, have different legal, administrative, and budgetary relationships with the central government. With everything else constant, they are expected to receive more subsidies than other municipalities.         "
"28","One important characteristic of the period under investigation is the Kobe earthquake of January 17, 1995. Since then, the central government has provided a large amount of special subsidies to disaster‐stricken municipalities.2 We control this effect with a dummy variable. These municipalities, coded as one (i.e., disaster‐stricken municipalities), comprise 10 cities and 10 towns in Hyōgo Prefecture, for which the Disaster Relief Act (Saigai Kyūjyo Hō) was invoked.         "
"29","Since census‐related data is collected and published every five years, the data for noncensus years was linearly interpolated. Given the practical limitation that the 2000 census results are not yet available, the data for FY1998 was linearly extrapolated based on data from 1990 and 1995.2"
"30","Our analysis of the relationship between legislative representation and fiscal transfers boils down to the following two questions. Do municipalities in overrepresented districts, in a given year, receive disproportionately more subsidies from the central government? Did the equalization of representation result in an equalization of transfers? We present our answers to these questions in turn."
"31"," Table 2 shows the results of cross‐sectional regressions using data from prereform years (i.e., FY1991 to FY1994). In all four regressions, the number of seats per capita had a significantly positive effect on the receipt of total transfers per capita. The elasticity estimates range between 0.08 and 0.12.2 To use an example from the FY1991 sample, suppose that there are two municipalities that have almost identical demographic and political characteristics, except for the apportionment of seats. Our finding implies that if the first municipality is represented twice as much as the second municipality, the receipt of subsidies per capita increases by 11%, even after the formulaic portion of transfers is taken into consideration.         "
"32"," Table 3 shows the results from postreform years (i.e., FY1995 to FY1998). The elasticity estimates of the number of seats per capita are not considerably different in FY1995 and FY1996 than from those in prereform years. After the first election under the new electoral system was held in October 1996, the estimates increased slightly (i.e., from 0.11 in FY1996 to 0.16 in FY1997 and FY1998). This increase, however, does not necessarily mean that the equalization in representation had some effect on resource transfers, because the steeper slope estimate could be observed even without any change in the total transfers per capita.2"
"33","What is more important in Table 3 is that the effects of the number of seats per capita on the total transfers per capita are highly significant even after the reform. Tables 2 and 3 clearly suggest that municipalities in overrepresented districts received disproportionately more subsidies from the central government during both pre‐ and postreform periods. It should be emphasized that this finding is highly robust. In our preliminary analysis, we conducted a number of other regression analyses with different sets of control variables, but found that the number of seats per capita always has a positive and highly significant effect in all fiscal years. We also checked the robustness of our finding by changing the unit of analysis to the district‐level, but that also did not alter our conclusion.2"
"34","Let us now briefly look at the estimates of our control variables in the cross‐sectional regressions shown in Tables 2 and 3. Most of the control variables exhibit statistically significant effects in the expected directions. In addition, the sizes of these coefficients are fairly stable across sample years. The exceptions are taxable income per capita and the share of population below 14 years of age. These variables are insignificant in some fiscal years.         "
"35","Another important exception is the LDP's seat share, which shows some notable patterns. First of all, contrary to Doi and Seriya's (1997) analysis using prefectural data,2 our regression estimates suggest that in most (but not all) years, the LDP's seat share had a negative effect on the subsidy allocation. This finding is not necessarily puzzling, as some existing studies based on prefectural data report similar results (e.g., Onizuka 1997; Nagamine 2001). As discussed earlier, we might interpret the negative estimate as a consequence of the LDP's efforts to buy off marginal voters.         "
"36","What is puzzling is that after FY1994, the magnitude of the coefficient dropped and the effect became statistically insignificant. There are several possible interpretations for these changes. They may reflect the dichotomous nature of LDP representation in single‐member districts, vis‐à‐vis semiproportionality under the SNTV‐MMD rule.2 They may relate to the fact that regressions after FY1994 include the earthquake dummy.2 Alternatively, the LDP may have, indeed, lost their power to allocate public resources to their constituencies after Japan entered into an era of coalition governments after 1993. Since arguing this point would take us beyond the scope of this article, we leave the further examination of this important puzzle to our future research.         "
"37","Now, our first‐cut analysis with the cross‐sectional regressions shows that the number of seats per capita is positively correlated with the per capita fiscal transfers. It also shows that the elasticity estimates increased after the first election under the new electoral system. This change, as we have argued, does not necessarily indicate that there existed some substantive changes in redistribution. In order to fully examine the relationship between the change in legislative representation and the subsequent change in subsidy allocation, we conducted regressions with first‐differenced data.2 We also conducted additional first‐differenced regressions by replacing the change in the seats per capita with the preequalization seats per capita and the postequalization seats per capita. The purpose of these regressions is to examine whether the apportionment of seats had parametrically different effects, between pre‐ and postequalization years, on the growth of per capita transfers. The results of these regressions are shown in Table 4.         "
"38","The effect of our key independent variable, the changes in the number of seats per capita, did not reach the conventional five percent level of statistical significance for the minor reapportionment decision of 1992. The estimate for this variable is almost zero and the standard deviation is 0.02 for FY1995‐FY1992. On the other hand, the major reapportionment decision associated with the electoral reform of 1994 resulted in a significant change in public transfers. The coefficient estimate for FY1998‐FY1995 is 0.04 and it is highly significant.         "
"39","Regressions using the pre‐ and postequalization seats per capita show further insightful results. For FY1995‐FY1992, the effects of these variables are also almost zero and statistically insignificant. For FY1998‐FY1995, the effect of the number of seats per capita before the 1996 election under the new system (i.e., the number of seats per capita in 1995) is significantly negative, but the effect of the same variable after the election (i.e., the number of seats per capita in 1998) is positive but insignificant.         "
"40","From these findings, we claim that the minor reapportionment in 1992 had no substantive effect on fiscal redistribution, but the major reapportionment in 1994 did. The negative and significant coefficient for the number of seats per capita in 1995 suggests that after the electoral reform in 1994, municipalities in previously overrepresented districts received significantly smaller amounts of subsidies per capita, whereas municipalities in previously underrepresented districts received significantly more. The considerable degree of equalization in voting strength, which was associated with the electoral reform, resulted in the equalization of government transfers per person.         "
"41","Does reapportionment in a legislature affect policy outcomes? We examined this question with a focus on the recent electoral reform in Japan. Our findings suggest that reapportionment does, indeed, change the distribution of subsidies. This holds particularly true when there is a sizable equalization of representation, such as the one associated with the electoral reform."
"42","There is an important theoretical implication of the conclusion of this comparative study. That is, reapportionment matters regardless of who initiates reapportionment and whether or not reapportionment is intended to change redistributive policies. In the United States, the reapportionment revolution was court‐ordered, and the plaintiffs were clearly motivated to change the allocation of public funding (Ansolabehere, Gerber, and Snyder 2002, 767–8). As contrasted with the United States, Japan's electoral reform was initiated and achieved by incumbent politicians. As we discussed earlier, however, there is no evidence that the reform was intended to change fiscal transfers to municipalities. Therefore, the Japanese and American cases suggest that as long as reapportionment materializes regardless of actors in—and motivations behind—the reapportionment process, it is expected to change redistribution outcomes.         "
"43","As a logical consequence, this conclusion gives an answer to a broader theoretical debate: formal representation matters. As noted here, many empirical studies both in Japan and the United States have failed to show the link between representation bias and policy bias. As Ansolabehere, Gerber, and Snyder (2002) claim, this problem lies in the inappropriate methodology employed in existing studies. We confirm their claim. As long as we use appropriate methods and data, we can show statistically significant and robust evidence, even after controlling the effects of other relevant variables.         "
"44","There are some other comparative studies which show that legislative representation significantly affects fiscal transfers in Brazil and Argentina (Gibson, Calvo, and Falleti n.d.) and the European Union (Rodden 2002). Our article is distinct from others in that it is the first comprehensive study using data from a nonfederal Asian country. Thus, the findings here suggest that representation affects redistribution regardless of political, social, cultural, and historical contexts.         "
"45","Our findings also give an answer to another theoretical debate, which is more specific to Japanese politics. Contrary to the prevailing view that the 1994 reform had no direct effect on policy outcomes, we clearly show that the reform did, indeed, matter; it brought about a significant change in budget allocation."
"46","This conclusion, however, does not necessarily mean that the overall size of total transfers from central to municipal governments decreased. In fact, as in the United States, real per capita transfers have continuously been increasing even after the electoral reform.2 The equalization in transfers might have been achieved simply by expanding the size of transfers to relatively urban and previously underrepresented areas. Then, did the the 1994 electoral reform significantly contribute to such an expansion in the overall level of public expenditure? Since the electoral reform was implemented after the collapse of bubble economy in the early 1990s, which caused Japan's long‐lasting economic stagnation, the growth of transfers may be caused by expansionary fiscal policies to stimulate the economy. Hence, as in the case of the United States, reapportionment may affect the distribution, but not the level, of public expenditure. Since the number of observations (i.e., years) after the reform is still limited, we have to leave a fuller examination of this question, which needs time‐series data, to our future research.         "
