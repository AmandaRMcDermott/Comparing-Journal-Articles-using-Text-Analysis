"1","I define “bank rescue” or “bank bailout” as any government‐sponsored delay in the exit of insolvent banks that is explicitly or implicitly funded by public resources. In other words, a bank is bailed out if it continues to operate after insolvency. Note that bailouts do not necessarily entail money handouts from governments to banks. Bailouts also occur when governments alter bank regulation in order to change the legal definition of insolvency, even if no transfer of public money is immediately realized.3 Thus, any policy that artificially extends the life of insolvent banks is a bailout. Note also that, in line with this definition, bailouts should not be seen as discrete “either/or” events. Instead, it is appropriate to consider bailouts as ranging in the abstract from absolutely no government help to complete government absorption of all losses.         "
"2","To simplify the discussion, I refer in this section to two extreme forms of government response: Bagehot and Bailout. Between these two extremes, I posit that governments vary in their propensity toward bailouts and that these varying propensities are determined by domestic institutions, a country's insertion in the global economy, and the structure of the nation's banking system. On the one hand, the Bagehot rule, which aims to provide liquidity to solvent banks and to force the exit of insolvent institutions, is the classical policy response to banking crises. Bagehot is the choice of a government concerned with upholding the market mechanism and diminishing moral hazard incentives in the banking sector. This solution minimizes immediate public outlays—i.e., it avoids socialization of bank losses—and eventually strengthens the financial system by eliminating weak banks, but its tenability is premised on the assumption that governments have perfect information about the financial status of banks.4 Moreover, a stern Bagehot enforcer risks the collapse of the banking system if insolvency affects all banks. In seeking to understand the determinants of bank bailouts, one must allow for the possibility that the Bagehot rule may not be an optimal response to a harsh banking crisis.         "
"3","On the other hand, some governments lengthen the lives of insolvent banks without regard for moral hazard issues, approximating the ideal‐type of Bailout. The Bailout rule involves unlimited last‐resort lending so that insolvent banks can continue to operate, subsidizing their losses while they recover. Bailout policies are thus arrangements designed to restore bank solvency at minimum cost to bank shareholders, bank depositors, and even bank borrowers. In this case, taxpayers are stuck with the bailout bill. It is often argued, however, that Bailout avoids widespread failure, and thus that under certain circumstances it is a best response to banking crises.5"
"4","I emphasize that policy output, be it Bagehot or Bailout, comprises several issues. Table 1 summarizes the policies that “belong together,” i.e., that one would expect a coherent Bagehot or Bailout policymaker to implement. The leftmost column of Table 1 identifies five crucial policy issue‐areas: Last‐resort lending, nonperforming loans, bank capitalization, policy toward holders of bank liabilities (depositor insurance), and bank exit policy. Entries in each box refer to the policy decisions that a Bagehot (or Bailout) politician would make. Some of these responses are actively implemented by lower‐level bureaucrats and only monitored, if at all, by politicians. Some other responses might be stipulated in ordinary law or central bank charters and thus be legally binding. For example, legislation might constrain politicians to guarantee small deposits or to limit the amount and maturity of loans to the banking system in case of financial distress. However, politicians enjoy latitude in choosing most of these policies. In any case, the model of government response I present later allows for the possibility that some of these policies are easier to implement than others.         "
"5","I omit thorough descriptions of these five policy issue‐areas for the sake of space and clarity (see Rosas 2002). Later I suggest how to infer bailout propensities by adequately combining information about policy choice in these issue‐areas with idiosyncratic characteristics of governments.         "
"6","In the wake of the East Asian financial crisis it became common to blame bad economic outcomes on “crony capitalism.” Scholars use crony capitalism as shorthand for political links between governments and big business—notably banks—that exceed the confines of petty bribery of low‐level bureaucrats. Crony capitalist regimes are not necessarily unfit to foster economic development. In Haber's (2002) characterization, for example, crony capitalism is a second‐best solution to the government's “commitment problem”—namely, its inability to credibly protect property rights. Ideally, economic growth obtains when governments are able to guarantee the property rights of all asset holders. Crony capitalist regimes, however, are only able to guarantee the property rights of some asset holders. Politicians render this arrangement credible by sharing in the rents appropriated by the chosen few. Crony capitalist regimes can sustain economic growth by partially solving their commitment problem, though they might generate negative secondary effects such as rent seeking and economic inequality.            "
"7","Cronyism might increase the likelihood of banking crises by giving bankers incentives to finance suboptimal projects. More importantly, the political decision to bail out insolvent banks might be a related effect of crony capitalism.6 Thus, crony capitalism can be invoked to explain both causes and consequences of banking crises and is an obvious starting point to explore government bailout propensities. However, as Kang (2002) notes, measuring intrinsic features of crony capitalism is difficult. In contrast with him, I do consider that indicators of corruption provide a reasonable first approximation to the measurement of cronyism. Admittedly, cronyism and corruption are not synonyms, but it is reasonable to expect that where corruption is low the chances are also low that politicians, bankers, and entrepreneurs will be consistently enmeshed in unholy relations. I build an indicator of relative lack of corruption, transparency, from commonly employed data (Knack and Keefer 1998; Transparency International 2002). Following from crony capitalism accounts, the expectation is that transparency will be negatively associated with bailout propensity (Hypothesis 1).7"
"8","As it stands, however, the “cronyism generates bailouts” hypothesis fails theoretically on its unstated assumption that politicians never renege on assurances to cronies. Indeed, as long as cronies continue to generate profits politicians will have little incentive to renege on their promise to protect property. But what happens when crony asset holders are unable to generate profits, as occurs during banking crises? In this case, access to rents is also foreclosed unless the politician bails out cronies.8 According to the unadorned “cronyism generates bailouts” story, politicians will not hesitate to lend friends a helping hand—presumably out of loyalty, a doubtful motivational assumption. Instead, closing insolvent banks whenever politicians find it unprofitable to invest taxpayers' money today in order to reap a stream of rents in the future is consistent with the assumption of rationality. In this case, a bailout may indeed secure access to future rents, but it also implies heavy costs; at the very least, bailouts make the nature of the arrangement between politicians and cronies conspicuous to taxpayers. Rational politicians may rescue banks as part of the price they pay for continuing access to rents, but they are agents of multiple principals, and circumstances might not always push them to favor crony bankers. Thus, banking crises create a dilemma for politicians: whether to aid bankers and possibly alienate support from other principals (e.g., taxpayers) or forgo bank bailouts and lose access to rents.            "
"9","I submit that political regimes systematically pattern government responses to banking crises. I highlight electoral accountability as the mechanism that links democratic regimes to Bagehot responses. Representative democracy is often justified on the grounds that it gives voters the opportunity to “kick the rascals out.” In turn, the prospect of accountability in democratic regimes makes it more likely that governments will be responsive to the preferences of an electoral majority of citizens.9 Politicians are, almost by definition, more responsive to the preferences of taxpayers in democratic settings than in authoritarian regimes. In the context of a banking crisis, I submit that effective representation of taxpayers entails stepping up rapidly to close insolvent banks, all else constant, rather than sharing the burden of bank insolvency through Bailout policies. Since taxpayers prefer to redress bank insolvency at minimum public cost (Enoch, Garcia, and Sundararajan 1999), this argument implies that politicians are more propense to bailouts in the absence of the accountability mechanisms of democracy. In short bailout propensity should be negatively associated with measures of democracy (Hypothesis 2a).            "
"10","Premised on the assumption that it is always in the public's interest to close insolvent banks, Hypothesis 2a provides a strong statement about the relationship between political regime and policy output. However, it may occur that what we consider beneficial effects of democracy only obtain under particular societal conditions. For example, in seeking to understand the determinants of rapid stabilization after inflationary episodes, Oatley (2003) shows that democracies take longer to promote price stability in environments of high distributive conflict and societal opposition, but do so rapidly in situations of low distributive conflict. In light of this argument, I also consider a “weaker” form of the political regime argument, namely, that the optimal policy response to a banking crisis is conditional on the importance of banks within the financial sector. If most financial intermediation is carried out through banks, then bank closures threaten severe economic disruptions as projects are cut off in response to credit crunches. Undoubtedly, some of these projects should be terminated, especially if they contributed to bank insolvency in the first place, but bank closures also derail viable projects. Thus, politicians, corrupt or not, are more likely to bail out banks if their failure threatens high negative externalities. In other words, I acknowledge that redressing bank insolvency at minimum public cost might entail bailing out (some) insolvent banks. Thus, politicians in democratic regimes might choose Bailout policies, not necessarily because of crony links with bankers or entrepreneurs but as effective representatives of the median taxpayer's preference against economic disruption. To test this implication, I include an interaction term between democracy and deposit share. This indicator is a proxy for the relative importance of banks within a nation's financial system.10 If policy output depends on the importance of banks, then the the effect parameter of the interactive term should be positive (Hypothesis 2b).            "
"11","To approximate the ceteris paribus condition of these arguments, I control for factors that might affect a government's bailout propensity. For example, previous research has taken an institutional approach to decision making during banking crises (Keefer 2002; Maxfield 2003; Nava‐Campos 2002). In particular, Keefer (2002) suggests that regulatory forbearance of insolvent banks is less likely in polities with more numerous veto players; based on his evidence, we should observe a negative association between bailout and the number of veto points in a polity (vetoes). More importantly, if all that is captured by political regime indicators is the effect of checks and balances as indicated by different veto‐point configurations (democratic regimes, after all, tend to have more veto points), democracy should be statistically insignificant after controlling for vetoes. Instead, if electoral accountability is the relevant mechanism, democracy should be statistically associated with bailouts even after including vetoes in the model specification.            "
"12","Any limit on a politician's ability to accommodate fiscal expansion through lax monetary policy would also limit his ability to choose Bailout. The proposition that inflationary monetary policy is less likely where central banks are institutionally autonomous from politicians has been tested empirically (see, for example, Grilli, Masciandaro, and Tabellini 1991). Autonomous central bankers adopt more conservative stances on monetary policy because of legal stipulations to promote low inflation. From the point of view of the monetary authority, banking crises present a stark choice between an expansive policy to aid failing banks or conservative use of the monetary tool to preserve price stability. Even independent central banks could decide, however, to save the banks rather than the currency. After all, institutional independence from political pressures only guarantees that politicians will not control the money supply; it does not necessarily entail that central bankers will push for low inflation. Still, because of the legal stipulation to provide price stability, independent central bankers will be less prone to act as lenders of last resort to the banking system during a crisis and to accommodate fiscal expansion to bail out banks. Inasmuch as central bank autonomy entails tighter monetary policy, it should also curtail a politician's ability to carry out bank bailouts.            "
"13","Domestic institutions that hinder cronyism are not the only potential constraints on a politician's decision to bail out banks. Instead, international factors impinge upon domestic policy making. In an era of global integration of capital and goods markets, the ability of politicians to carry out independent public policies can be constrained by the possibility of capital flight (Andrews 1994; Cooper 1968; Oatley 1999). Though opening up a nation's borders to capital flows and more trade opportunities improves a country's access to cheaper credit and allows specialization close to comparative advantage, it might also mean foregoing the use of Keynesian tools of demand management. As Obstfeld (1998) argues, globalization has the beneficial side‐effect of disciplining governments, forcing them into a path of sustainable budgets and price stability. With respect to bank bailouts, globalization might exert a similar downward pressure on fiscal profligacy. Politicians may choose policies closer to Bagehot to the extent that their countries are more thoroughly integrated into the world economy through trade and capital markets. Therefore, I include indicators of trade openness and capital openness as controls. I also include a dummy for the existence of a stand‐by agreement with the IMF on the starting year of a banking crisis (IMF support). Support from IFIs, particularly from the IMF, comes with strings attached in the form of conditionality clauses. It is common to give out international loans in tranches, so that successive installments can be conditioned on country behavior after previous disbursements. But IFI support might ease fiscal constraints on government action and therefore extend the financial ability to bail out banks (Casella and Eichengreen 1996; Killick 1997; Montinola 2003).            "
"14","Finally, other controls include the market share of foreign banks (foreign share), the level of development of a country (log GDP),11 and the economic origin of a bank crisis (microeconomic cause).12 I also include a measure of bank concentration to control for the possibility that concentrated banking interests coordinate more easily to push for preferred Bailout policies. Table 2 provides information regarding all covariates, including sources, prevalence of missing values, and summary statistics.13"
"15","I base the empirical analysis on a sample of government responses to 40 separate banking crises from 1976 to 1998 collected by Honohan and Klingebiel (2000); I complemented this dataset with information from six other banking crises (Del Villar, Backal, and Treviño 1997; see Appendix for sample of crises). These 46 systemic banking crises are a subset of a larger collection of episodes, both systemic and borderline, recognized in the literature (Eichengreen and Arteta 2002).14 Scholars generally consider that a systemic banking crisis has occurred if any of the following events is observed (Caprio and Klingebiel 1999): (1) generalized depositor runs on banks, (2) accumulation of nonperforming loans in excess of 10% of bank assets, (3) government assistance to banks through suspension of financial activities (e.g., bank holidays or deposit freezes), or (4) government support to banks through policies with fiscal costs that exceed 2% of GDP.            "
"16","Note that two of the criteria used to determine that a bank crisis has occurred refer to government action (criteria (3) and (4) above). Government action along the lines of criteria (3) and (4) is indicative of underlying problems in the banking sector because banks would fail in the absence of these policies. Thus, for example, deposit freezes prevent bank asset fire‐sales, and therefore generalized insolvency, by stemming depositor runs. Since I look at government action conditional on the occurrence of banking crises, selection bias might arise if the assessment that a bank crisis has occurred depends on the observation of preemptive government policies. In other words, the risk is that the sample might miss banking crises that did not result in corrective action, i.e., those that were solved closer to the Bagehot ideal‐type. Fortunately, criteria (1) and (2) pick up instances of banking trouble that have not yet prompted government action, but have already caused changes in depositor or borrower behavior and should consequently be recognized as outright banking crises (criteria (1) and (2)). More importantly, variation in the range of policies that governments employ to counter banking crises is also significant, as I argue below, and runs the gamut from “keeping close to market outcomes” (the Bagehot ideal‐type) to heavy government intervention to prop up the banking system."
"17"," Table 3 reproduces Honohan & Klingebiel's coding scheme; the seven binary indicators therein can be directly traced to the five policy issue‐areas detailed in the Bagehot‐Bailout classification of Table 1. For example, bank liquidity is an indicator of government response regarding protection of bank depositors that is coded “1” if governments extend emergency liquidity support “for longer than 12 months and the overall support is greater than total banking capital” (Honohan and Klingebiel 2000, 13). Table 3 shows how the other six indicators (explicit guarantees, recapitalization, forbearance, debt relief, deposit freeze, and public asset management) relate to the policy issues in Table 1.15"
"18","I am interested in explaining the bailout propensity of governments that confront banking crises. The main quandary in addressing this issue is that this propensity is unobservable. We only observe dichotomous measures of implementation of seven policies in as many issue‐areas. Even these measures are imperfect indicators of policy choice: there is no reason to believe that policies like recapitalization or liquidity are “lumpy” or discrete, let alone dichotomous. Instead, I submit that these seven dichotomous indicators proxy for policy choices that are themselves continuous. In other words, governments do not simply choose to recapitalize failing banks or not; rather, they choose how much money, and for how long, to inject into insolvent firms.         "
"19","I posit then that a government's choices along these seven issue‐areas are a function of its unobserved bailout propensity, which is ultimately the variable of interest. In building a model of bank bailouts, I first tie the dichotomous policy choices to the unobserved propensities and then consider the factors (independent variables) that drive these bailout propensities. This model builds on, and extends, item response theory (IRT) models extensively used in the field of education.16 In the context of intelligence testing, where IRT theory was first developed, the goal is to construct test items that “discriminate well” among individuals with varying levels of ability. The probability that an individual will answer any test item correctly is modeled as a function of a latent trait, such as intelligence. Some test items are extremely easy (or extremely difficult); such items are not good indicators of intelligence because most individuals will get them right (or wrong) regardless of their idiosyncratic abilities. Aside from their intrinsic difficulty, test items also vary in their power to discriminate among individuals with varied abilities.17"
"20","In similar fashion, I assume that not all seven policy items are equally good at revealing the underlying bailout propensity of different governments. First, I acknowledge that some policy responses are easier to implement. Regulatory forbearance, for example, is generally the consequence of low‐level bureaucratic decisions that do not necessarily require the benediction of higher‐ups. This policy is equivalent to an “easy” test item in that many governments will get it “right” (forbearance is coded “1” in 28 out of 44 recorded instances).18 Other policies, like recapitalization, often require explicit legislative intervention, and are therefore relatively “difficult” to pursue (recapitalization is only coded “1” in 12 of 45 instances). Second, once differences in the relative difficulty of policy items are acknowledged, one must recognize that policies also vary in their discriminating capacity, that is, in the degree to which they are informative about underlying bailout propensities. IRT models acknowledge this duality by allowing estimation of separate difficulty and discrimination parameters for each test item.19 The set of equations in (1) lay bare the model that ties observed policies to bailout propensities(θj) and item parameters(αi, βi).            "
"21","Each one of the policy items yi,j enacted by the different governments in the sample is modeled as a draw from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter pi,j (pi,jε[0,1], i is the policy index, j indices crises). Note that pi,j is a function of y*i,j, a continuous, unbounded, and unobserved variable that represents policy choice along each of the seven issue‐areas (Φ(·) is the Normal CDF).20 In turn, y*i,j is a function of the underlying bailout propensity of each government (θj) and of the discrimination (αi) and difficulty (βi) parameters that define each issue‐area. Notice that the item parameters vary across issue‐areas but are constant across governments, whereas bailout propensities are constant across policy issue‐areas, but vary across governments.21"
"22","I further assume that θj, government j's bailout propensity, is a linear function of several covariates, as per the last equation in (1).22 In (1), xj (crisis‐specific covariates) and δ (effect parameters) are both vectors of length k (the number of covariates included in the model). The last line in (1) also states the main assumption of this model, namely, that the effect of politicoeconomic covariates on bailout propensities (δ) is identical across countries.         "
"23","This model contains 14 + (k+ 1) parameters to be estimated. In a Bayesian setting, each of these parameters requires specification of a prior distribution. In general, I have chosen uninformative priors for effect parameters (hence conveying the a priori impression that right‐side covariates may or may not determine bailout propensities). I have followed suggestions in Johnson and Albert (1999) and Bafumi et al. (2005) in specifying informative priors for the item parameters, mainly for purposes of model identification. In particular, the discrimination parameters (α) are all constrained to be positive.23 Prior distributions on these parameters as well as the derivation of the likelihood function and the posterior density function are fully described in the Appendix.         "
"24","I use MCMC simulation methods to make inferences about the joint posterior density in Equation 3 (Appendix). Ten thousand draws from this posterior density are summarized in Table 4, which presents mean, median, standard deviation, and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals for 13 effect parameters and a constant term in the model. As detailed in the Appendix, I stipulate uninformative prior distributions for these parameters. A glance at Table 4 shows that the data are extremely informative, as the updated posterior distributions of some of these parameters are narrow and in most cases consistent with hypothesized effects.24"
"25","I start by emphasizing the factors that do not show a conspicuous positive or negative effect on bailout propensity. The effect parameters associated with capital openness, deposit share, foreign share, bank concentration, and vetoes all have posterior marginal distributions centered about “0.”Keefer (2002) observes that the number of veto points in a political system is negatively associated with the incidence of regulatory forbearance of insolvent banks. However, this variable is not related statistically to bailout propensity in my model specification. Moreover, as I suggest below, regulatory forbearance is not the most informative indicator of underlying bailout propensities.         "
"26","Two factors—transparency and IMF support—show what an uncharitable commentator would perhaps consider ambiguous effects. The posterior distributions of the effect parameters of these variables are wide enough that their 95% HPD intervals straddle “0,” but the probability that the effect of transparency (IMF support) on bailout propensity is positive (negative) is still relatively low. Hence, as suggested by crony capitalism accounts (Hypothesis 1), the effect of transparency on bailout propensity is very likely negative. The posterior marginal distribution of δtransparency is centered at −13.8, and MCMC simulation results suggest that the probability that this effect is not negative is only about 0.1. The statistical association between corruption and bailouts, though not as strong as other effects estimated in the model, is still consistent with standard “crony capitalism” accounts of bank bailouts.25 Likewise, the effect of IMF support on bailout propensity is very likely negative (Pr(δIMF < 0) ⋍ 0.92).         "
"27","Five independent variables have statistically discernible effects on bailout propensity; all of their effect parameters have posterior distributions unequivocally centered away from “0.” Before discussing the substantive importance of these results, I comment briefly on the posterior distributions of the corresponding five effect parameters. First, countries that are more tightly integrated in the world economy are more likely to witness bailouts (p(δtrade > 0) > 0.99). Admittedly, this conclusion is only supported by the trade openness indicator, as I showed before that capital openness has no bearing on bailout propensity. Be this as it may, the positive impact of trade openness on bailout propensity is contrary to the view that governments' fiscal and monetary policy options are more limited in the context of globalization; if anything, it seems that trade openness actually gives politicians an incentive to protect insolvent banks.26"
"28","Second, banking crises that obtain from microeconomic mismanagement (i.e., regulatory failure) are more likely to end up in bailouts (Pr(δmicro > 0) ⋍ 0.99). This result runs counter to the common sense hypothesis that macroeconomic shocks are more conducive to bailouts, as electorates and governments would presumably be more forgiving if bankers and bureaucrats are not evidently responsible for a banking crisis. Third, richer countries are more likely to engage in bailouts, all else constant. This conclusion might seem surprising within the logic of “crony capitalism”; after all, richer, more developed, countries are generally less corrupt. Recall, however, that I have controlled for transparency. The positive partial effect of log GDPpc is thus congruent with a simpler explanation: Governments in richer countries have larger resources at their disposal to afford the unforeseen expenses associated with bank bailouts. Fourth, the institutional setup of the central bank definitely matters in understanding government bailout propensities. Table 4 shows that most of the probability mass of the posterior marginal distribution of the effect parameter of central bank autonomy lies to the left of “0” (Pr(δcbi < 0) > 0.99).         "
"29","Finally, political regimes differ in their propensity toward bank bailouts, as suggested by Hypothesis 2a. The model presented in Table 4 uses Przeworski's dichotomous indicator as the relevant measure of democracy (Przeworski, et al. 2000). The density of the effect parameter of democracy lies almost entirely on the negative side of the real line (Pr(δdemocracy < 0) ⋍ 0.98). This result does not depend at all on the democracy indicator that one uses. In alternative models, I employed Freedom House's political liberties and Polity IV's polity indicators, and these continue to show coefficients with posterior marginal densities that lie almost entirely on the negative orthant (results available from the author). Recall also that the model includes veto points as an indicator of legislative checks on executive behavior and that the posterior distribution of its effect parameter is centered about “0.” Hence, I posit that electoral constraints, not legislative checks, are the features of democracy that drive a politician's reluctance to bail out banks. As a follow‐up on this result, I used the “electoral participation” component of Vanhanen's index (Vanhanen 2000) in lieu of the democracy indicator. If electoral accountability is indeed what matters, the negative effect of democracy should be preserved even when considering indicators that proxy for exclusively electoral aspects of democracy, such as Vanhanen's index, which is indeed the case (results available upon request).27 Moreover, Hypothesis 2b is not substantiated by any of these models. The effect of regime‐type on the bailout propensity of a government is not conditional on the magnitude of a banking crisis, at least when deposit share is used as an indicator of perceived harshness. Hence, it is the “strong” interpretation of democracy as a regime that prevents bailouts regardless of the relative importance of the banking sector that receives empirical support.         "
"30","To understand the substantive impact of these covariates on the propensity of governments to bail out banks, it is important to consider first the posterior marginal distributions of the other parameters estimated in the model. Figure 1 summarizes these distributions graphically by portraying 80% HPD intervals for all probabilistic parameters in the model, plus the 46 derived bailout propensity parameters (θ). Panel (b) displays information for the effect parameters (δ) referenced above. Notice for example that most of the probability mass of the democracy effect parameter lies on the negative orthant. Panel (c) summarizes the estimated distributions of bailout propensities (θ); in Panel (c), governments are ordered according to their propensity to bail out banks, from Malaysia in 1997, which appears here as the government with the highest bailout propensity, to Argentina in 1989, here the government with the lowest bailout propensity.         "
"31","                 Estimated Posterior Distribution of All Parameters (80% HPD Intervals)                      "
"32","Notice also that uncertainty about bailout propensities is wide enough to disallow strict rank‐orders of many of these governments. For example, Ecuador (1996) or Argentina (1989) were about equally propense (and not very much so) to carry out a bank bailout. Nevertheless, we can see from Panel (c) that even after accounting for uncertainty in the estimation of bailout propensities we can still separate obvious Bailout governments (10 observations with 80% HPDIs to the right of “0”) from conspicuous Bagehot governments (14 observations with 80% HPDIs to the left of “0”).28 Indeed, the probability that the bailout propensity of Malaysia (1997) (the rightmost country in the bailout propensity scale) was less than that of Argentina (1989) is smaller than 0.001.         "
"33","Next, I comment on the posterior marginal distributions of item parameters. Each of the original seven dichotomous policy issues provides information about the underlying bailout propensities of governments. The difficulty (β) and discrimination (α) parameters summarized in Panel (a) (Figure 1) reflect the degree of information conveyed by different items. Consistent with its relatively high frequency in the data, the distribution of the difficulty parameter of forbearance lies almost entirely on the negative orthant. This means that regulatory forbearance is a comparatively “easy” policy item.29 Thus, regardless of the underlying proclivity toward bailouts, we would expect most governments to enact at least this kind of policy. Instead, recapitalization and debt relief are relatively “difficult” policies. Even governments with strong bailout propensities find it tough to pass Bailout policies in these issue areas.         "
"34","Recall from the earlier discussion that all discrimination parameters are constrained to be positive. In general, this choice is validated by posterior distributions that lay entirely on the positive orthant and are symmetrically distributed. Only deposit freeze and liquidity have posterior distributions that “bump” against “0” (as a result, their distributions are positively skewed), suggesting that these policies do not really discriminate Bagehot from Bailout governments. Conversely, explicit guarantees, public asset management, or recapitalize turn out to have large discriminating power. Thus, governments with a high propensity to bail out banks stand a high chance of engaging in direct injection of public funds into failing banks, absorbing and directly managing nonperforming loans, and/or protecting depositors. These are governments that will be keen on sheltering economic actors in the banking system from market forces. Note also that forbearance, which has been used previously as a bailout indicator, is a better discriminator of Bailout and Bagehot governments when compared with deposit freeze or liquidity, but is not particularly good when compared with recapitalize or public asset management. In future analyses of banking crises, one could focus on the latter dichotomous measures as better indicators of bailout propensities. I underscore, however, that we only know this because of the opportunity to consider all available information about government choices within a multilevel IRT model.         "
"35","With information in hand about all parameters, I now return to the substantive importance of covariates. Figure 2 displays 50% HPD intervals for each of the Bernoulli parameters pi, that give rise to the original dichotomous policies. Each of the six panels in Figure 2 shows the likely location of pi, under “high” and “low” values of relevant covariates. Panel (a), for example, conveys the finding that democracies are much less likely than autocracies to enact policies associated with Bailout. Figure 2 also reflects uncertainty about the substantive significance of these effects. Panel (d) would lead one to predict that a relatively corruption‐free regime (transparency set at the 75th percentile of the sample distribution) has a probability of about 0.47 of engaging in regulatory forbearance, whereas the probability increases to 0.61 that a crony regime (transparency set at the 25th percentile of the sample distribution) would do so. However, the estimated substantive effect of transparency on bailout propensity is uncertain enough that we cannot really dismiss the possibility that crony regimes would actually be more likely to engage in forbearance than non‐crony regimes.30"
"36","                 Estimated Probability of Enacting Seven Policy Items (50% HPD Intervals)                      "
"37","MCMC draws can thus be used to approximate probabilities of observing Bailout policies under alternative configurations of independent variables. Panels (a) through (e) display how our expectations about the probability of enacting the seven different policies change under alternative hypothetical scenarios, varying the values of independent variables one at a time (in most cases from the 25th to the 75th percentiles of their sample distributions) while keeping other covariates fixed at median values. Panel (f), in contrast, shows the effects of Bailout‐ and Bagehot‐inducive configurations on the probability that a government will enact the policies under inspection. The Bagehot‐inducive configuration corresponds to a democratic government (democracy= 1) in a corruption‐free regime (75th percentile of transparency) with low levels of global economic integration (25th percentile of trade openness) and a relatively autonomous central bank (75th percentile of central bank autonomy; all other covariates held at median values), and leads us to expect a bailout propensity (E(θ)) of about 0.07. The Bailout‐inducive configuration builds on the contrary assumptions and generates a bailout propensity distribution with E(θ) = 2.47. Since bailout propensity can be arbitrarily rescaled, it is of utmost necessity to translate its different values into probabilities of observing alternative policies under these radically different configurations. In this regard, Panel (f) shows that, even after accounting for uncertainty in the model, a government operating under Bagehot‐inducing circumstances would be quite unlikely to implement Bailout policies, particularly in the areas of debt relief, public asset management, and recapitalization. The model also suggests that neither domestic institutions nor international constraints are extremely helpful in predicting the implementation of deposit freeze and liquidity assistance. This result is consistent with the finding in Figure 1 (Panel (a)) that these policies lack discrimination power.         "
"38","Based on 46 observations, this analysis explored the determinants of government policy responses to banking crises. I embraced an institutional perspective to posit that political regimes should influence the choice of Bagehot or Bailout, even in countries where relations between politicians and bankers are not transparent. I also considered the possibility that links to the world economy, the structure of the domestic banking system, and the legal status of a country's central bank might have an impact on policy choices in response to banking crises. Regarding the effect of central banks and transparency, the analysis uncovered that they are likely to limit a government's propensity to bail out banks. The analysis also suggests that Bagehot policies are more likely to follow after banking crises caused primarily by a macroeconomic shock in countries with low levels of international trade openness, IMF support to cope with the crisis, and democratic regimes. The results closely conform to common‐sense expectations, but the effect of trade openness seems counterintuitive in light of the alleged disciplining effects of globalization (Obstfeld 1998).         "
"39","Some interesting theoretical extensions follow from the findings. First, if democratic regimes are indeed better at solving banking crises without supporting failing banks, we might then expect that banking crises should also be less frequent in democratic regimes. Admittedly, banking crises are the result of multiple causes besides bank management behavior (Caprio and Klingebiel 1997). Yet, if bankers understand that bailout prospects are much diminished in democratic regimes, they should also be less likely to engage in reckless behavior, and therefore the incidence of banking crises in democracies should be lower, all else constant. Perhaps other factors explored in the model, central bank autonomy most obviously, produce similar “dissuasive” effects.         "
"40","Second, the model could be extended by considering the possibility that different policy outputs might be determined by different politicoeconomic covariates. Here, I assumed that covariates were tied to policies through a common bailout propensity dimension. It could be the case that some of these policies (liquidity assistance, for example) are implemented by a particular actor (the central bank), whereas others (the extension of debt relief) are controlled by a different actor (the legislature). One could profitably explore this possibility by relaxing the assumption of a single bailout propensity dimension (much as in studies of legislative voting behavior that consider two or more underlying ideological dimensions)."
"41","This second argument suggests that Bayesian specifications “in the spirit” of item response models can be fruitfully employed to understand important aspects of policymaking. In studies of economic liberalization, for example, one could combine alternative indicators of policy output to infer how prone governments are to liberalize. With frequentist tools, one needs to use factor analysis or other scaling techniques to infer the existence of an underlying dimension and then use that contrived dimension as a dependent variable. Models similar to the one explored herein are flexible enough that they can account for propensities or underlying dimensions by simultaneous consideration of policy output “dependent” variables and politico‐economic “independent” variables."
