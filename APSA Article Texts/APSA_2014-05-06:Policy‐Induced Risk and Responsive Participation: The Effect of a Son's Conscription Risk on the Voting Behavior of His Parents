"1","Understanding how citizens respond when individual self‐interest5 collides with government policy has long been a preoccupation of political behavior research. Scholars have largely addressed this question through survey research examining the association between an individual's stake in a policy and his or her political attitudes or behavior.6 Far fewer studies have sought to measure the effects of self‐interest on behavioral outcome measures such as voter turnout or other forms of political participation, but the studies that do so share a common finding: Individuals who are adversely affected by a policy are more likely to respond through political participation than those who stand to gain from the implementation of a policy. For example, Green and Cowden (1992) found that although white parents of children who were likely to be bused as a result of desegregation policies did not hold opinions that differed from unaffected parents, the parents whose children were at risk of being bused were more likely to vote in subsequent elections. Hastings et al. (2007) found that parents who “lost” school choice lotteries were more likely to vote in subsequent school board elections than lottery winners.         "
"2","Though the policy feedback and self‐interest literatures are rarely conversant, the aforementioned studies and the present research offer evidence of mass policy feedback (Campbell 2012; Mettler and Soss 2004), whereby policies that induce loss create incentives for responsive political participation. Responsive participation may be retrospective or prospective in nature. The possibility that a policy may result in future losses can create incentives for preemptive political participation. For example, Campbell (2003) found that, contrary to most patterns of participation and socioeconomic status, low‐income senior citizens, who are more dependent on social security than wealthier seniors, are more likely to write letters to elected officials and turn out to vote. The findings from these studies suggest that people who stand to lose as a result of the implementation of a policy are more likely to be mobilized politically as a result than are people who stand to gain from the implementation of a policy.         "
"3","Conscription is perhaps the most imposing form of government policy in that, from the population at large, a selection of citizens is designated and compelled to risk loss of life in the course of military service and combat. If any single policy should induce considerations that culminate in egocentrically motivated political participation, arguably, it would be military conscription.7 The stakes of conscription for combat are high and clear, and involuntary induction into the armed forces places men at risk of the ultimate consequence of government policy: loss of life through compelled service during a war. However, numerous studies on the effects of one's proximity to service in the Vietnam War on political attitudes and, to a lesser extent, behavior produced positively puzzling findings.         "
"4","Some studies found little variation in opinions along the lines of socioeconomic status and demographic attributes (Mueller 1973; Verba et al. 1967;), widely considered to be proxies for draft risk. Other findings indicated that working‐class people, African Americans, and women were more likely to oppose escalation and favor withdrawal from the conflict (Hahn 1970; Hamilton 1968; Lunch and Sperlich 1979; Robinson and Jacobson 1968). In contrast, Barton (1968) found that draft status did not correlate with attitudes about U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and, similarly, Mueller (1973) argued that draft‐eligible men and their families were not systematically inclined toward pacifism or withdrawal from the conflict. In one of the most prominent studies on the subject, Lau, Brown, and Sears (1978) found that one's self‐interest in the matter of the Vietnam War, defined “strictly” as having a close relative serving in the conflict at the time of the survey or “loosely” as having any friends or relatives serving in the military as a result of the related troop buildups, had little impact on policy preferences, but, in one of the few behavioral measures examined, the authors found that personal proximity to the issue did affect the extent to which respondents paid attention to the issue of Vietnam. Findings of the null effects of draft risk on policy preferences led many scholars to question the general self‐interest hypothesis, and the overarching conclusion drawn from the Vietnam‐era self‐interest studies was that personal circumstance mattered little.         "
"5","This conclusion was premature, however, because earlier studies on the “effect” of self‐interest related to the Vietnam War paid very little attention to identification strategy and arguably produced biased estimates of the effects of one's connection to the war on individual political responses. One of the challenges of measuring the effects of any policy on political participation is that the attributes that render some individuals more or less likely to be affected by government policies may be correlated with the attributes that make them more or less likely to participate in the political process. In the case of the draft, men of lower socioeconomic status were more likely to serve in the military during the Vietnam War because fewer deferment options were available to them (Appy 1993). Low socioeconomic status also is associated with lower rates of voter turnout (Schlozman et al. 2005; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980). In this instance, the effect of draft risk on parents’ turnout could be biased downward because the attributes that rendered the son vulnerable to conscripted military service are the same attributes that made his parents less likely to engage in the political process. Research designs that measured associations between exposure to the draft or the war and attitudes about the war were unable to avoid the endogeneity of military service, compelled or volunteer, to political attitudes and participation.         "
"6","More recent research by Bergan (2009) and Erikson and Stoker (2011) addresses the endogeneity concern by employing a quasi‐experimental approach, similar to that of the present study, in order to reconsider the relationship between an individual's exposure to the draft and his political preferences. Both studies exploit the random assignment of risk via the draft lotteries to measure the effect of draft risk on survey response measures obtained from panel surveys, the waves of which were conducted before and after the lotteries. Findings from both studies call into question conclusions reached in earlier studies that an individual's exposure to the draft or service in the Vietnam War had no relationship to his attitudes about the war. Bergan (2009) finds that men assigned to low draft numbers (and therefore higher risk of induction) were more likely to favor complete withdrawal from the conflict than respondents assigned to “safe” lottery numbers. Erikson and Stoker (2011) find that male respondents with high lottery numbers were more likely to favor involvement in Vietnam and approve of the government's handling of the conflict than were men with low lottery numbers. They also find that men with low lottery numbers were more likely than men with safe numbers to have voted for McGovern (against incumbent president Nixon) as measured by self‐reported vote choice in 1973, identify themselves as “liberal,” express liberal attitudes across issues, change their party identifications between the pre‐ and postlottery measures of the panel survey, and persist in responding in the affirmative to the statement that the Vietnam War was a “mistake” into the 1990s (Erikson and Stoker 2011, 231–34). The findings of Bergan (2009) and Erikson and Stoker (2011) upend previous conclusions about the effects of policy‐induced threats to citizens’ self‐interest on their subsequent political behavior and attitudes surrounding the Vietnam War.8"
"7","The present research extends such natural experimental analysis by examining the effect of exogenously determined23 draft risk on a unique dependent variable, voter turnout, among a novel sample: parents of men at risk of being conscripted. Additionally, this study assesses the extent to which the effect of draft risk on parents’ voter turnout was moderated by community contexts. In particular, how did the prior occurrence of a local war casualty alter the way in which a low lottery number (higher draft risk) was experienced?         "
"8","Contextual theories of political behavior (Huckfeldt 1979) model participation as a function of individual attributes as well as factors that characterize the social environment in which political information is communicated and policies are experienced. One way casualties may alter political responses is by shaping the local information environment, thereby drawing media attention to the dangers of combat. Gartner (2004) finds that local casualties in the 2000 terrorist attack on the USS Cole led to increased news reporting of the event in respective local media. Kriner and Shen (2012) find that having read a news story about a casualty from one's home state decreases support for a war. Increased media attention to casualties arguably would make the risk of being drafted more salient to parents of sons at risk from towns with local casualties. News of local casualties also could have been transmitted through everyday conversations between community members. Furthermore, the local environments represented by the sample analyzed in the present research consist of small towns of relatively homogeneous populations in New Hampshire.         "
"9","The availability of images of an event has been shown to affect the probability that people assign to the possibility of events occurring (Tversky and Kahneman [1973] 1982). Relying on such an availability heuristic to implicitly assess the probability of a son's death resulting from high draft risk, parents from small towns with local casualties could more easily conjure up concrete images of draft‐related loss and therefore may have assessed a low number (higher draft risk) as inherently riskier than parents from towns in which there were no previous war casualties. One would expect the presence of casualties, a measure of loss, to be more salient than the absence of local casualties, a relative measure gain, given the zero‐sum nature of draft quotas (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the effect of draft risk on a parent's political participation should be stronger among parents in towns in which the loss associated with draft risk is enhanced by knowledge of local casualties.         "
"10","Loss aversion in the form of casualty sensitivity has been shown to have implications for a number of political outcomes. Research suggests that the social environment created by local casualties affects attitudes about and behavioral responses to ongoing engagement in military conflict abroad. Studies conducted shortly after the Vietnam War implied that, in general, as casualty rates increased, support for military engagement declined (Milstein 1974; Mueller 1973). More recent studies of the political effects of war casualties have found additional support for the notion that local and/or recent casualties can alter a proximate community's outlook on a war and have an adverse effect on public approval of the war and incumbent vote share in subsequent elections (Vietnam War: Gartner, Segura, and Wilkening 1997; Iraq War: Gartner 2008a). In particular, recent casualties from one's home state bolster support for troop withdrawal and decrease support for ongoing conflicts (War in Afghanistan: Hayes and Meyers 2009; Kriner and Shen 2012). Gartner, Segura, and Wilkening (1997) and Gartner and Segura (2000) find that recent, local casualties at the county level were inversely related to support for the president's handling of the war in the first half of the Vietnam War, but that local casualties fail to explain aggregate local public opinion in the second half of the war. They argue that later in the war, however, there would be fewer remaining persuadable advocates who could change their opinion in response to marginal casualties. Research from other conflicts suggests that local casualties are associated with lower incumbent vote share (Iraq War: Gartner and Segura 2008; Karol and Miguel 2007; U.S. Civil War: Carson et al. 2001), partisan vote share (Iraq War: Grose and Oppenheimer 2007), and support for ongoing conflict (Iraq War: Althaus, Bramlett, and Gimpel 2012; for a contrasting view, see Berinsky 2009). Research by Feaver and Gelpi (2004) suggests that social proximity to individuals involved in the military increases casualty sensitivity, and Gartner (2008b) finds that having a personal connection to a casualty affects one's approval of the president. Such a finding supports the notion that a parent whose son is at greater risk of being drafted would be more likely to factor information about local casualties into his or her assessment of the risk associated with being drafted.         "
"11","While there are many studies of the relationship between local casualties and public opinion or vote choice, the relationship between casualties and political behavior is relatively underexplored. Kriner and Shen 2010 measure the association between local casualties and self‐reported behavioral measures of political engagement, including voter turnout. They find that more casualties in one's county are associated with lower rates of self‐reported turnout. It is important to remember, however, that both lower rates of voting (Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980) and higher casualty rates (Kriner and Shen 2010) are associated with low socioeconomic status and, therefore, are likely to be correlated. The present research does not seek to measure the effect of local casualties on parents’ voting behavior. Rather, the question under consideration with respect to casualties is the extent to which local casualties from small communities moderate (intensify) the effect of draft risk on parents’ political participation.         "
"12","Throughout the majority of the Vietnam War, the Selective Service System inducted men by an “oldest man first” policy, making men eligible for conscripted service through their 26th birthday. Through this system, men closest to the age of 25 and classified 1A, or eligible and fit to serve, were inducted from the pool of potential conscripts from each Selective Service Board jurisdiction (Selective Service System 1972). The long period of uncertainty about draft status between the ages of 19 and 25 years was only one of many unpopular aspects of the Vietnam draft. By 1969, nearly 60% of survey respondents believed it was a “mistake to send U.S. troops to Vietnam” (Gallup 1969).9 The “de‐Americanization” of the war that the candidate Nixon pledged in 1968 became the policy of “Vietnamization” that his administration pursued to gradually transfer responsibility for security to South Vietnamese troops and for the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam (Szulc 1969). Nixon's controversial timeline for gradual withdrawal, growing public discontent with the practices of the Selective Service System—the agency responsible for inducting more than 1.8 million men throughout the Vietnam War(Selective Service System 2003)—and nationwide protests against the war, culminating in the massive moratorium protests of October and November 1969, motivated intensive efforts for draft reform. In line with his campaign promises,10 through executive orders and legislation, President Nixon and Congress enacted a series of changes to draft policies, including reinstating the draft lottery system,11 cancelling most categorical deferments, reversing the “oldest man first” policy, and ultimately ending the draft in the United States in January 1973.         "
"13","In November 1969, parents of draft‐age men were confronted with the sobering news that a random lottery would determine their sons’ risk of induction and that, with Nixon's change in policy to call the youngest men first, parents of men turning 19 could no longer hope that the war ended prior to their sons’ period of high draft vulnerability. On Wednesday, November 26, 1969, President Nixon signed the bill into law, a first step in reforming the draft, which had been a major element of his campaign platform in 1968. On the same day, Nixon issued Executive Order 11497, “Amending the Selective Service regulations to prescribe random selection,” thereby reinstating the lottery system to replace the “oldest man first” practice by which the Selective Service theretofore had drafted men for service during the Vietnam War. The first drawing was scheduled to be held on the following Monday."
"14","For draft‐eligible men and their families, American conscription policies and the status of American engagement in Vietnam were brought into sharp focus on December 1, 1969, when the first of several annual draft lottery drawings was held to determine the order of induction for service in the Vietnam War was broadcast on national television and radio stations. The 1969 lottery was reported to determine the fate of a draft pool of 850,000 men, 540,000 of which the government estimated would enter the service in 1970: 290,000 as volunteers and 250,000 as draftees selected at random through the 1969 lottery drawing (Corddry 1969a and b).         "
"15","On the evening of December 1, 1969, blue capsules, each containing one of 366 possible birth dates,12 were drawn by hand from a clear canister. In this first draft lottery of the Vietnam era, the order in which birth dates were drawn determined the order of induction. The first capsule was drawn by Rep. Alexander Pirnie (R‐NY), a member of the House Armed Forces Committee; it contained the birth date September 14 (Los Angeles Times 1969). Therefore, all men born on September 14 between the years of 1944 and 1950 were assigned to the lottery number “1.” Men assigned to the lottery number “1” were the first ones to be called for possible induction. This lottery number served as a man's permanent random sequence number (RSN)13 that he maintained until 26 years of age unless he was deferred throughout his time of eligibility, in which case he retained his RSN through the age of 35. Men over the age of 26 would only be called in the case of a national emergency or total mobilization. The draft lottery for 1969 determined the order of induction of men in 1970, the lottery of 1970 determined the order of induction for 1971, and the 1971 lottery determined the order of induction for 1972.         "
"16","The draft ceiling, the highest number called in a given year, was not determined at the time of the lottery or at the outset of the calendar year of eligibility. Estimates of the maximum number fluctuated with political and military circumstances. Generally, the ceiling was established around the middle of the year. For example, for men assigned RSNs in 1969, newspapers immediately reported vague estimates that the first third of numbers would likely be called, the second third of numbers may or may not be called, and the top third of numbers were probably safe (Los Angeles Times 1969). Throughout the months of 1970, the Selective Service System adjusted the ceiling in accordance with manpower needs until August, when a final ceiling of 195 was reached. At the time the final ceiling was reached, however, a firm declaration was not made. The only other indication of how high the numbers would go was a directive from the Selective Service System that only men with numbers up to 215 would be called for preclassification induction physicals (Perkins 1970).         "
"17","Ultimately, the highest number called from the December 1969 lottery was 195. Men whose birthdays were randomly assigned to lottery numbers 195 and lower were determined to be eligible for conscription, whereas men whose birthdays were assigned to values of 196 and higher were not called to report for induction (Selective Service System 2009). The draft ceiling for the July 1970 lottery was 125. The ceiling for the August 1971 lottery was 95.         "
"18","In assigning men lottery numbers, the Selective Service effectively assigned numbers to their families. The probability that parents were assigned to high draft risk (a low number) is a function not only of the year in which a son was born, but also of how many sons they had. There are many instances in which a parent couple had two or more sons between 1950 and 1952, and results may have been good news for one son and bad news for the other(s). The probability that a son would be assigned a low number is a simple ratio of the draft ceiling to the number of days in the year. While a son received only one number corresponding to his date of birth, mothers and fathers were assigned as many lottery numbers as the number of sons that were born to them in the years 1950, 1951, and 1952. For any given lottery, the probability that a parent lost was the ratio of the lottery ceiling to the number of days in the year. For example, the probability of “losing” in the 1969 lottery was 195/366. The probability of “losing” for parents with more than one son (except in the case of twins) depended upon the years in which their sons were born, since the numerators (induction ceilings) and denominators (total number of days in the year with and without leap year) of the ratio of “losing” birth dates to all possible days in the year differed between lotteries. Because an ideal randomized design requires that every subject has an equal probability of being treated, I adjust for multiple sons by adding a stratum for each possible combination and thus probability of a parent couple being “treated” by at least one son drawing a low number.14"
"19","The validity of the causal inference depends upon the integrity of the random assignment. While there is no empirical or theoretical reason to suspect that a son's random assignment to draft priority status by birth date is correlated with any attributes that contribute to his parents’ likelihood of voting, Table A2 in the supporting information presents a randomization check of the sample of mothers and fathers of potential conscripts. Since parent couples were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions, the randomization check is clustered by parent couple. It is evident that pre‐election attributes, including rates of voter turnout and voter registration, are balanced between parents of men with low and high lottery numbers."
"20","Parents for whom at least one son received an RSN beneath the respective lottery ceiling are considered to have been assigned to the treatment group for the purposes of this analysis. Parents of sons assigned to lower numbers were randomly assigned to a significant dose of policy‐induced risk, regardless of whether their sons were ultimately inducted. Men with lower numbers were immediately called to report for physical examinations and classification procedures. It is important to clarify that officials sought to randomize only the order of induction priority. Being classified as draft eligible (e.g., with a lottery number less than or equal to 195 in 1969) did not necessarily mean that men were inducted for service. Men could seek deferments for various reasons, and physical and mental health examinations rendered some men with low numbers ineligible for service. If men applied for deferments, they still had to interact with local boards (Rosenbaum 1969b) and possibly state appeals boards to justify their claims, and deferments were progressively eliminated in the course of draft reform.15"
"21","Although actual service in Vietnam was not randomly assigned as a result of classification procedures, “losing” the lottery did increase one's likelihood of serving, and deferments were harder to obtain as the conflict drew to a close. During the Vietnam War, 25.6% of draft‐eligible men served under obligation, whereas 9.3% of draft‐exempt men served as volunteers (Hearst, Newman, and Hulley 1986). Assignment to high induction priority status (low lottery numbers) threw men and their families into a period of extreme uncertainty until the potential conscript was classified as unable to serve, he was called up, his year of eligibility passed, or the conflict ended.         "
"22","Though the lottery system was intended to reduce uncertainty about the risk of induction, in some ways, it increased anxiety for men with low or uncertain numbers (Rosenbaum 1970). Under the previous system, men had more time to communicate with local boards about when they might be called for induction and related options for volunteering or deferment opportunities. Under the draft lottery system, men had only 10–30 days to prepare for induction. Local draft boards were often ill‐informed of changing policies and were so besieged by calls that they could not answer all inquiries (Lubas 1970).         "
"23","Men with numbers in the middle of the distribution present a complication for defining the treatment. These men and their families faced uncertainty of induction risk throughout at least half of their years of eligibility when the draft ceiling was announced. This could bias downward the estimated effect of receiving a low number on subsequent political participation of parents. For this reason, I operationalize the treatment assignment in two ways. First, I consider assignment to the treatment to be dichotomous, equal to 1 if a son's number falls below the eventual draft ceiling and equal to 0 if the number exceeds the respective draft ceiling. Second, as a robustness check, I consider the treatment to be a continuous variable and examine the effect of the lottery number on parents’ subsequent participation. Since I conceptualize the treatment as the assignment of draft risk by virtue of the lottery numbers, it is safe to assume that contact rates were 100%.16"
"24","Individual‐level data were assembled by transcribing and digitizing information from archival documents, and contextual‐level data were obtained from a variety of secondary data sources. The sample consists of 7,093 mothers and fathers of 3,933 draft‐eligible men born in 167 small towns in New Hampshire from 1950 to 1952.17 Every son in the sample was assigned a lottery number in the 1969, 1970, or 1971 draft lottery, depending on his date of birth.         "
"25","In order to construct the sample, it was necessary to find vital statistics information for men, including their names, respective dates and places of birth, and the names of their parents. In the state of New Hampshire, birth records are closed and considered to be private information. However, vital statistics records, including births, marriages, and deaths compiled by town clerks in the years in which they took place, were printed in the annual town reports. Copies of the annual town reports are now archived at the New Hampshire State Library. The sample for this analysis was compiled by transcribing the names of parents of boys born in the years 1950–1952 in addition to their sons’ birth dates and birthplaces from lists published in annual reports from each town. Information about the sons’ dates of birth was then utilized to create variables for strata accounting for varying probabilities of assignment to draft risk, and indicators of whether parents had been assigned at least one risky RSN that fell beneath the respective draft ceiling for the year."
"26","For the dependent variable and voting history covariates, it was necessary to find individual‐level records of voter turnout.18 The state of New Hampshire requires town clerks to submit a copy of voter checklists from presidential elections to its state archives.19 Voter checklists are printed lists of registered voters compiled by town clerks and used to keep records of voter turnout at polling places. Each individual who votes in an election receives a checkmark or an indicator of turnout by his or her name.20 Checklists for some towns were damaged or missing for one of the key elections; therefore, those towns were excluded from the sample due to incomplete data. Checklists for larger towns include multiple voting districts. Because of the limited information available on checklists to identify voters, I restricted the sample to towns with single voting districts to minimize the possibility of measurement error resulting from misidentification. In summary, towns were included if they consisted of a single voting district and if vital statistics information from 1950 to 1952 and turnout data from 1964, 1968, and 1972 were all available.21"
"27","The political behavior of voters in New Hampshire is likely to be representative of similarly situated voters located elsewhere. For example, the state of New Hampshire voted for the winning presidential candidate in all three of the elections included in the data for this study. It is, however, possible that the findings from relatively homogeneous small towns may not generalize to all contexts. While additional studies in other contexts will be necessary to assess the external validity of the findings, the New Hampshire sample offers several advantages with respect to internal validity. All parents in the sample share two key attributes in common. First, they are from small towns. Second, when analysis is restricted to parents who were registered to vote in 1968, the subsample consists of individuals who are entrenched in their respective communities as evidenced by the fact that in 1972, they lived in the same towns where their sons had been born in 1950–1952. These conditions are ideal for measuring the effect of a natural experimental intervention for two reasons. First, the relative homogeneity across many individual‐level attributes of the populations of small towns in New Hampshire capacitates the measurement of the effect of draft risk on turnout by minimizing additional sources of variation in participation. Second, in small towns, people are more likely to know one another, particularly people who have deep roots in the community as did parents included in the sample. This provides optimal conditions under which to measure the moderating effect of town casualties on the main effect of draft risk on turnout."
"28","Data for the other variables used in the analysis are compiled from diverse sources. Town and county casualty information was obtained from the National Archives and Records Administration (1998, 2008). Town‐level turnout and vote‐share data are from the State of New Hampshire Manuals for the General Court prepared and published by the Department of State in the years 1965, 1969, and 1973. Town‐ and county‐level socioeconomic data were obtained from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development “State of the Cities Data Systems” (1970) and the 1970 U.S. Census of the Population (U.S. Department of Commerce 1973). Draft lottery numbers and draft ceilings were published by the Selective Service System.         "
"29","I hypothesize that the random assignment of men to low draft lottery numbers had the causal effect of mobilizing their parents to vote at higher rates in 1972 than the parents of men who were assigned high draft lottery numbers. I estimate a series of probit models to measure the local average treatment effect, or the average effect of a son's being assigned a low lottery number on his parents’ turnout in the subsequent presidential election. The basic model may be specified as follows:            "
"30","The basic model estimates the effect of an instance in which at least one of a couple's sons was assigned to a low lottery number on parents’ turnout in 1972. Estimates from a probit analysis of the full sample of parents are reported in the first column of Table 1. The probit estimate of 0.08 (standard error: 0.05) is significant at the .10 level (one‐tailed test) and implies a marginal effect of 2.5 percentage points. Restricting the sample to parents registered to vote in 1968 slightly changes the inference one draws from the estimates but reduces the noise from spurious sources of political “inactivity,” such as having moved from the town of the son's birth prior to 1972. The probit estimate of 0.14 (standard error: 0.06) implies that the marginal effect of at least one son having drawn a low lottery number on turnout among parents registered in 1968 is approximately 4.5 percentage points, an estimate that is substantively and statistically significant. Results offer strong evidence that, among registered voters, the heightened risk of the loss of a son by means of the military draft mobilized political participation.         "
"31","More generally, estimates of the main effects offer support for the hypothesis that, even among members of a common issue public, voters who are negatively affected by government policies, particularly policies that are associated with significant potential loss, are more inclined to engage in the political process as a result. It is possible, however, that the effect of conscription policies on participation may have been moderated by relevant contextual variables. In particular, parents of potential conscripts who lived in a town from which a local man had previously been killed in the Vietnam War may have assigned a greater risk of loss to high induction priority."
"32","I hypothesize that local casualties moderated the main effect of a son's losing lottery number on parents’ turnout in 1972 by intensifying the draft risk treatment. Specifically, I contend that rates of voting among parents of sons with low lottery numbers in towns from which there was at least one casualty were higher than rates of voting among parents of sons with low lottery numbers in towns with no casualties. The four right‐hand columns of Table 1 report the results of probit analyses for towns with and without casualties. In towns without casualties, neither estimate of the effect of a low number on parents’ turnout is statistically significant. However, among parents from towns with at least one casualty in the war prior to the lottery drawings, the estimated effect of 0.23 (standard error: 0.09), which implies a marginal effect of approximately 7 percentage points, is substantively and statistically significant. Restricting the sample to parents who could be located on voter checklists in 1968, the estimate is 0.28 (standard error: 0.11), or a marginal effect of approximately 9 percentage points. Both estimates of effects in towns with casualties are statistically significant at the .05 level (one‐tailed test).         "
"33","I estimate an alternative probit model that includes an interaction term for a son's losing lottery number in a town with at least one casualty, Town Casualty × At Least One Son “Loses.” Results from this series of probit analyses are reported in Table 2. Estimates of the average effect of the interaction between a son's losing draw and a local context of prior war casualties are similar for the full sample and the sample restricted to parents found on voter checklists in 1968. Results reported in column 2, the analysis that restricts the sample to parents who were registered to vote in 1968, indicate that the estimate of the effect of a son drawing a low number in a town without casualties is 0.06 (standard error: 0.08). This estimate implies that the marginal effect of at least one son drawing a low number on a parent's turnout is 2.1 percentage points in towns from which there were no prior casualties, the coefficient of which is not statistically significant. The coefficient of the interaction term, 0.22 (standard error: 0.13), is substantively and statistically significant and indicates that the treatment effect of higher induction risk is larger in magnitude among parents who lived in towns with local war casualties. As in the previous analysis, results indicate that the effect of losing a son in a local context that is characterized by a prior war casualty is 0.28 or (0.06 + 0.22(1)), which implies a marginal effect on parents’ turnout of approximately 9 percentage points. The results support the hypothesis that a higher risk of induction had a greater effect on political mobilization in towns within which the risk of induction was made more salient by a local casualty.         "
"34","Retrospectively, assignment to treatment was binary; either a man's number was beneath the draft ceiling and he had faced the risk of being drafted or it was above the draft ceiling and he had been safe. However, two aspects of the implementation of the draft lotteries suggest that a dichotomous measure of assignment to the treatment condition may bias estimates of the effect downward. First, as mentioned above, draft ceilings were not announced until halfway through the lottery year, so parents of men with numbers, for example, in the second third of the distribution faced uncertainty until the ceiling was determined. Second, not all draft boards reached the federal draft ceiling; areas with fewer deferments filled quotas without reaching higher numbers. Results from regressions in which lottery status is treated as a continuous variable, lottery number, suggest a linear relationship between certainty of risk and responsive participation. Table 3 reports results from probit analyses of the effect of a parent couple's lowest lottery number on turnout in 1972. Results from the full sample are reported in the first column; results from separate analyses of towns with and without casualties are reported in columns 2 and 3. All estimates imply an inverse relationship between a son's lottery number and his parents’ likelihood of voting in 1972. Lower lottery numbers, which represented a higher risk of induction, are associated with higher rates of turnout among parents. Coefficients in the two far right‐hand columns suggest a steeper slope among parents in towns with local war casualties.         "
"35","Results from this analysis suggest that the risk of a son's induction into the military was more salient to parents in towns from which at least one man had been killed in the Vietnam War prior to the lottery drawings. In these towns, parents may have perceived a greater risk of service, combat, or death associated with a low lottery number compared to parents from towns without casualties. An alternative explanation might be that parents from towns with casualties were reacting to greater actual risk of induction associated with low lottery numbers due to other contextual factors, such as attributes of local draft boards or local socioeconomic factors that may have been correlated with local casualties."
"36","Results from analysis including contextual variables at the draft board level do not support the alternative claim. Classification and deferment decisions were made by local draft boards. In New Hampshire, local draft board districts were aligned with county boundaries as opposed to town limits. All but two counties had a single local draft board; residents of the two largest counties reported to one of two local draft boards. Separate analyses of the interaction effect between casualties at the county (local draft board) level and a son's low lottery number do not reveal a substantive or statistically significant relationship between casualties within a draft board district and a son's losing lottery number."
"37","Alternatively, it is possible that towns with casualties tended to be environments of lower socioeconomic status. Though the differentiation in induction rates across income classes is disputed (Flynn 1993; Zeitlin, Lutterman, and Russell 1973), poor and working‐class men are significantly overrepresented in combat‐related deaths (Kriner and Shen 2010; Zeitlin, Lutterman, and Russell 1973). Table 4 reports estimates from probit analyses that include socioeconomic and political contextual variables as well as interaction terms between each contextual variable and the binary indicator for a low lottery number. The first two columns include contextual‐level socioeconomic indicators. Binary variables indicate whether the town population is above the median for the sample, the town's median household income is above the sample median, and the percent of residents who did not graduate from high school is below the sample median. Columns 3 and 4 report results of probit models in which binary indicators for above‐median turnout in 1968 and above‐median shares of Democratic vote share in 1972 are added. Results indicate that accounting for local political or socioeconomic attributes does not substantively change the estimates of the interaction effect of a son's assignment to high draft priority status within the context of a prior local war casualty.         "
"38","Parents who faced a greater risk of losing a son to the Vietnam War as a consequence of conscription policies were more engaged in the presidential election of 1972 than parents of sons who were determined to be safe from the draft. A closer look at the data reveals that the average effect of high induction priority on a parent's turnout in 1972 is driven, in large part, by parents in towns from which there had been a local casualty. It is unlikely that the larger magnitude of the effect in towns with casualties is driven by higher levels of actual risk of combat, since towns with and without war casualties coexist within the same draft board jurisdictions. Furthermore, holding constant contextual socioeconomic variables that are likely associated with combat risk does not substantively change the estimate of the interaction effect of being a parent of a son with a low number in a town with prior war casualties."
"39","The findings offer support for the “modified sociotropic” theory of the effect of self‐interest on political outcomes (Gartner and Segura 2000), whereby people are influenced by the local information environment and factor policy consequences they have observed in their proximate environments into their assessments of and responses to those policies. Modified sociotropism has been theorized to explain the effect of proximate casualties on public opinions related to war (Gartner and Segura 2000; see also Kriner and Shen 2012). The present findings further suggest that local information environments may moderate the relationship between how policies are experienced and behavioral responses to those policies.         "
"40","The findings also suggest that a salient event, such as a local casualty, may have altered the perceived risk of conscription policies. Theories of risk perception pose different explanations as to why individuals perceive the same object or issue to be more or less dangerous. The availability of a personalized image of a war casualty, a “hometown boy” killed in the war prior to the lotteries, may have functioned as a heuristic or mental shortcut in parents’ assessment of the meaning of draft reform for the safety of their sons and quite possibly led parents of men with low numbers to overestimate the frequency and the probability of combat‐related deaths among conscripts (Tversky and Kahneman [1973] 1982). In fact, none of the men in the sample were killed in the Vietnam War.22 Another possible mechanism is suggested by knowledge theory. Knowledge theory suggests that people may perceive a policy to present a greater risk because they know it to be dangerous (Wildalvsky and Dake 1990). The perception of danger varies according to attention to an object. A local casualty from a small town may have caused parents of men from those towns to pay more attention to news about local and national casualties and to think of the draft in terms of its ultimate possible, albeit improbable, consequences. Given that people are more sensitive to the risk of loss than the opportunity for gain (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), parents would undoubtedly focus more on casualties than safe returns from war. Risk aversion and negativity bias, or the overweighting of negative information, likely translated into additional votes cast by parents who lost the lottery, by inducing them to respond electorally to punish representatives for implementing policies that caused them personal harm as opposed to lottery winners having rewarded policy makers for passing draft laws that improved their sons’ respective situations (Bloom and Price 1975; Levy 2003). In the case of draft reform, parents of sons who were suddenly free from the ambiguity of the “oldest man first” policy were not mobilized to the same extent to express their gratitude through voting.         "
"41","The data necessary to conduct this research, particularly contemporaneous individual‐level voter turnout data, are rare. The sample of voters from stable, relatively homogeneous small towns offers advantages with respect to internal validity. With respect to external validity, however, replication within different contexts would be beneficial for understanding the underlying mechanisms and the extent to which the effects are heterogeneous across varying samples and circumstances. The New Hampshire sample, due to limitations of available data, excludes residents of larger towns and cities. It would be ideal to be able to measure the effect across differing contexts of community population size, density, and heterogeneity across individual attributes. The data set also lacks ethnic and racial diversity, so it is not possible to generalize the results to other demographic contexts. Future research should seek to replicate the objectives of this study in other contexts."
"42","Limitations notwithstanding, this study is an important step toward understanding behavioral responses to government policies and connecting policy outcomes to mass political participation. Furthermore, results suggest that even among members of a common issue public, responsive participation or mass policy feedback is likely to be stronger among individuals who are directly affected by the policy. Finally, results offer evidence of the behavioral effects of retrospective policy evaluations. By the 1972 presidential election, the establishment of the All‐Volunteer Force was well underway. Parents who were mobilized to participate in response to disproportionate exposure to conscription risk were not preempting prospective outcomes, nor could their votes have been motivated by instrumental considerations, however irrational. The higher rates of voting among parents of men who faced a high risk of induction were necessarily retrospective and expressive in nature. Such analysis suggests that policy feedback effects on mass political behavior can be motivated by retrospective evaluations, are likely to be stronger among voters most affected by policies, and may be moderated by the social context in which the policies are experienced."
