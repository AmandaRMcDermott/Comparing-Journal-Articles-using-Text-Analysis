"1","We define party government as a majority party capable of controlling the House agenda through procedural means—both positively and negatively—to suit its collective goals, producing legislative outcomes that diverge from those that might be obtained by the House membership in its absence. These collective goals include, at minimum, the passage of policy tilted toward the majority and may include cultivating a valuable party record. To accomplish this, a majority party relies on the consistent support of its members on the floor to maintain a “procedural coalition”—cooperation among members of the majority on key procedural votes, such as the election of the Speaker and the adoption of rules.         "
"2","Current studies of party government have emphasized the bias in policy outcomes produced by various procedural advantages in the hands of the majority party. In particular, party government implies that the majority party uses the legislative process to limit legislative policy outcomes that would be otherwise available for majorities on the floor of the House (Aldrich 1995, 215; Cox and McCubbins 2005, 47). First, the leadership's negative power can exclude from consideration many potential pieces of legislation that a majority on the floor would prefer over those brought onto the agenda by the majority party. This aspect is the key to Cox and McCubbins’s (1993)“cartel” analogy for party government. Second, the leadership's positive power means advancing policy most of its members prefer—even when support is not universal. This positive agenda power lies at the heart of the “Conditional Party Government” (CPG) theory (Aldrich and Rohde 1998, 2001; Rohde 1991) and plays an important role in Party Cartel theory as well (Cox and McCubbins 2005). In short, theorists of party government concur that the members of the majority provide the leadership sufficient authority to help bills supported by large numbers of party members through the legislative process as well as to block those they oppose.         "
"3","In practice, party government appears to inflict substantial costs on the majority party's own members who sometimes oppose the specific policy outcomes advanced by the leadership. The majority party in Congress rarely demonstrates total unity in the pursuit of policy goals sought by the leadership. Although the party on the whole may successfully avoid the passage of bills it opposes by an internal majority (Cox and McCubbins 2005), many bills enjoying potential majority support on the floor are never allowed on the agenda. Many members of the majority party therefore face losing on policy because party leadership (using its negative power) never proposes bills these members support, in addition to losing on final passage of bills they oppose (i.e., due to the leadership's positive power). The policy benefits of a party government, therefore, fall disproportionately to those majority party legislators who prefer the outcomes allowed onto the agenda by the leadership. In unidimensional spatial terms, a consequence of this would be that a member of the majority party close to the “median” member of the House would fare better in terms of policy without party government (Krehbiel 1999).3"
"4","The failure of a substantial subset of majority party members to obtain consistent policy benefits leads to another puzzle: why do these members support their party on the procedural matters that centralize the chamber? Empirical research has found substantially greater party loyalty in procedural votes compared to substantive votes on policy choices themselves (Cox and Poole 2002; Sinclair 2002). In particular, U.S. House members almost always vote straight along party lines on votes that organize the chamber at the beginning of the session—the election of the new Speaker and adoption of the rules. These procedural votes, however, according to these scholars, are exactly what allow the majority party to advance a policy agenda that many members of the party oppose. Why then do these relative “policy losers” within the majority party support the rules and procedures that facilitate policy outcomes that they oppose and prevent policy outcomes they support? In the following sections, we review several prominent theories of Congressional organization in light of this question.         "
"5","From the preceding arguments, it follows that if House members are concerned only with obtaining policy outcomes, and if they did not have agreement upon those outcomes, we should expect party government to be unstable. As mentioned above, if Congress is characterized by a unidimensional policy space, legislative institutions and procedures rely solely on the will of a majority, of which a median voter on the floor is the pivotal member. Thus, no set of procedures that systematically shortchanges this floor median would be sustainable (Krehbiel 1993, 1998, 1999). Since party government, as defined above, operates on the principle of systematically “cheating” the floor median by unnaturally biasing outcomes in favor of the majority party,4 it follows that the floor median should reject it. If the majority leadership uses the institutions of the House against the interests of the floor median, the median can join with an alternative floor coalition (with members of the minority) to revoke the centralizing institutions that otherwise empower a party government. At minimum, this implies that agenda‐setting institutions alone cannot maintain a party government, unless the costs of changing them are sufficiently high.         "
"6","The CPG thesis (Aldrich 1995; Aldrich and Rohde 1998, 2001; Rohde 1991) recognizes the limits of legislative procedures alone in sustaining party government. According to this argument, the main necessary condition for party government is internal cohesion within the majority party. Intramajority support for party government, according to CPG theory, depends on the extent of consensus among the majority party members on common policy goals—i.e., homogeneity of their policy preferences. Without a consensus, some majority party members may prefer to join with the minority to advance a policy agenda independent of their party leadership. A critique of this reasoning, made foremost by Krehbiel (1993, 1999), argues that unity in policy preferences would make a party government redundant; “natural” majoritarian policy outcomes would be observationally equivalent to a partisan outcome. By this reasoning, a majority party cannot build internal agreement on the need for party government solely upon an exogenous consensus on policy preferences.         "
"7","Most scholars of Congress generally assume that the overarching goal motivating members of Congress is reelection. They pursue policy goals not strictly for their intrinsic value, but in large part because they expect to be rewarded electorally for their legislative actions or policy positions, whether as individuals (Aldrich and Rohde 2001; Mayhew 1974) or collectively through their party (Cox and McCubbins 1993, 1994). Parties in Congress are valuable for reelection‐seeking legislators because they can assist their electoral efforts (Aldrich 1994). According to Cox and McCubbins, the electoral benefit from sustaining party government for the majority party members comes from a collective electoral connection. A well‐defined reputation for the party is a net electoral benefit for its members and the collective action problem of maintaining it, by this account, is solved through delegation to party leaders.         "
"8","However, while the collective policy accomplishments of the majority party may provide electoral benefits to many members whose constituents demand such policies, it may impose costs on those members who sometimes oppose the party's policy goals. Rather than taking advantage of their party's overall policy record in elections, such members would find it frequently necessary to distance themselves from party positions and oppose their party on substantive policy votes."
"9","Congressional candidates seeking reelection, however, depend not only on voting on issues pertaining to national policy outcomes but also on satisfying local interests. A large body of research suggests that targeted, localized benefits can boost a legislator's electoral prospects by allowing her to claim personal credit independent of her party (e.g., Evans 2004; Fenno 1978, 2000; Jacobson 1987, 2001; Mann and Wolfinger 1980; Mayhew 1974; Popkin et al. 1976; Stein and Bickers 1994). For example, “pork barrel projects” bringing jobs or contracts for important local interest groups can, according to some scholars, “insulate” incumbents electorally. Access to particularistic benefits is therefore a potentially valuable electoral resource for a legislator.         "
"10","In the House, the key institutions influencing access to such benefits are the House committees, which play an important role in distributive politics in general and in federal outlays in particular (Adler 2002). As noted, party‐centric accounts of Congress claim that the majority party in the House wields disproportionate influence over the policymaking process, including over committees, through such mechanisms as committee assignments and the other forms of agenda control discussed above.5 From this perspective, it is reasonable to expect that the influence of the House6 in the distributive arena should also be influenced by partisan considerations.         "
"11","Several recent studies concerning the role of particularistic benefits in legislative politics assert that the majority party is in fact able to influence access to particularistic benefits (e.g., Balla et al. 2002; Evans 2004; see also Alvarez and Saving 1997; Carsey and Rundquist 1999; Lee 2003; Lee and Oppenheimer 1999; Levitt and Snyder 1995).7 Control over legislative procedures and institutions allows the majority party and its leadership to influence, at least indirectly, distributive allocations that can benefit members who might not benefit directly from its policy pursuits. This provides a mechanism by which selective incentives can reward contribution to the majority party's goals. The notion that the majority is able to at least bias particularistic benefits to meet organizational concerns is specifically suggested by Cox and McCubbins in their claim that members from “policy loser” districts can “be given larger office and distributive benefits to counterbalance their policy losses” (2005, 47).         "
"12","Reelection‐seeking legislators can thus obtain two distinct types of electoral rewards from their standing with the majority party in Congress. In policymaking, the party helps its members who benefit electorally from association with the party's policy choices build a valuable policy record with which they can associate. With regard to particularistic benefits, the party can use its organizational influence to ensure that members who more often oppose the party's overall policy record still receive some benefits helpful for their elections. Both policy and particularistic benefits can incentivize majority party members to support stronger party control over the chamber."
"13","We can now summarize our argument and its implications as follows. Partisan theories of Congress suggest that the majority party in the House enjoys a disproportionate share of power because of its procedural control, which, in turn, is created and maintained by the support of its members on organizational and procedural votes. Maintaining this procedural control requires the consistent support of the majority party membership on organizational and procedural matters, Yet, by biasing policy outcomes, party government also creates “policy losers” who would have little to gain from perpetuating a party government, were they purely motivated by policy goals alone."
"14","To resolve this conflict, we conceptualize the benefits of party government as consisting of both policy and distributive benefits. The party is constrained by the coalitional need to use its influence to create a positive net benefit for all its members’ individual reelection goals. To maintain its coalition, the majority should use its procedural power to ensure a distribution among its members on both dimensions to ensure that supporting party government is electorally beneficial overall. Among majority party members, those who most frequently support the policy pursuits of the majority party require the least additional incentive to support their party's hold on power, since the party's influence on policy outcomes constitutes a direct reward. Those who consistently lose out with regard to the majority party's choice of policy pursuits, on the other hand, should require the most additional incentives to provide procedural support for partisan organization. That is, “policy losers” consistently require relatively more “nonpolicy” compensation—such as particularistic spending—in order to consistently benefit electorally from allowing the majority party procedural control."
"15","This argument is related to but distinct from Evans's argument that the majority party can use pork to “shore up the majority party's coalition” (2004, 231) when necessary. The majority party, by this account, can “grease the wheels” by diverting electorally valuable particularistic spending to pivotal legislators’ districts as needed to obtain votes on individual pieces of legislation (see also Groseclose and Snyder 1996; Lee 2000; and Wiseman 2004). Like Evans, we argue that the majority party wins the support of potential “opponents” of its policy aims by disbursing sufficient particularistic benefits. However, whereas in the policymaking process the needed votes might be obtained on a discrete basis in return for aiding passage of specific bills, the votes that allow the majority to organize the chamber lead to a stream of policy losses warranting more systematic nonpolicy compensation. These votes help create and maintain a set of institutions in the House through which the majority party will influence outcomes on a series of policies during a session of Congress.8"
"16","The core implication of our argument is that majority party members who support their party in organizing the chamber and in procedural votes, but are disproportionally denied benefits from its policy choices, require greater compensation in nonpolicy benefits. Overall, then, those in the majority who “lose” more often on policy should gain more in nonpolicy benefits for their districts.9"
"17","This is not to say that policy and nonpolicy benefits are necessarily mutually exclusive. Some legislators could enjoy a “privileged” status within the party so that they have somewhat more consistent access to both forms of benefits, being more likely to receive more particularistic benefits even while suffering comparatively fewer policy losses. For example, some research suggests that various procedurally advantaged members of Congress, such as committee chairs and members of influential committees, may be disproportionately represented among this “privileged” subset of the majority party.10 A substantial body of studies has argued that committee chairs and members of influential committees often enjoy greater opportunities to accumulate distributive benefits for their districts (e.g., Arnold 1979; Ferejohn 1974; Grier and Munger 1993). Attainment of committee chairs and other possible sources of privileged status in the House, in turn, relates to a legislator's length of service and accumulated seniority (Dodd and Oppenheimer 1977; Sinclair 1989). Legislators with longer tenure are more likely to become committee chairs and members of key committees, including conference committees, but they also may be the more influential members of all committees. Thus, members who are more senior could enjoy greater advantages relative to less experienced members.         "
"18","Our empirical predictions follow directly from these expectations: We expect a broadly positive relationship between policy “losses,” as we have defined them, and distributive benefits. Members supporting the majority party's legislative organization should not suffer high “policy losses” without obtaining some relatively large share of particularistic benefits. Majority party legislators, controlling for their status, should therefore “trade off” between policy “losses” and particularistic benefits along a positive slope. This expected relationship between policy losses and particularistic benefits in party government is illustrated in Figure 1.         "
"19","                 Expected Relationship between “Pork” and “Policy” in Party Government                      "
"20","The dependent variable we wish to investigate is the share of distributive benefits that each member of the majority party accrues as the compensation for the policy losses she suffers in the course of Congressional policymaking. We operationalize this using each district's percentage of total projects and dollars allocated by federally funded projects derived from the Federal Domestic Outlays dataset compiled by Kenneth Bickers and Robert Stein (1997). These data are used in some form by a number of studies on Congressional distribution of pork barrel projects (see Alvarez and Saving 1997; Bickers and Stein 1996, 2000; Levitt and Snyder 1995, 1997; Lowry and Potoski 2004; Martin 2003; Sellers 1997; Stein and Bickers 1994; cf. Frisch 1998).         "
"21","The data compiled by Bickers and Stein are designed to assess spending on discretionary federal grant programs that can be targeted to particular districts for the purpose of credit‐claiming opportunities (Bickers and Stein 1995, 1996).11 Scholars disagree on exactly which programs are best to include in Congressional studies. Our interest is in the role played by particularistic benefits in the context of Congressional elections and pork barreling strategies. Here, for each district, we count the total number of discretionary grants, including project grants and cooperative agreements, and contingent liability awards, such as direct loans, guaranteed loans, and federal insurance.12 According to Bickers and Stein (1996), these represent the programs over which Congress exerts distributive influence and which can deliver concentrated benefits to electorally valuable groups. From this subset of targeted federal grants and awards, we have further excluded projects coded as authorized in a previous budget period. As the total number of the awards varies substantially from session to session, we normalize the dependent variable by examining the percentage of the total number of grants and awards in a given Congressional term rather than raw totals. Previous work has suggested that only the number of projects is meaningful for this purpose, both because of its greater relevance to credit claiming (Bickers and Stein 1995) and because the dollar amount of some types of projects may be based on guarantees that are never realized. However, we also provide a supplementary analysis of the percent of dollars allocated to grants. To approximate a normal distribution for these quantities, we take the natural log of each version of the dependent variable.         "
"22","Our principal independent variable is the extent to which a majority party legislator suffers “policy losses” in the legislative process. We operationalize policy losses using roll rates on final passage votes developed by Cox and McCubbins (2002, 2005) for all members serving full terms during this period. Through roll rates, Cox and McCubbins offer a means to distinguish the policy winners and losers. They define a legislator to be “rolled” if she votes against the final passage of a bill that passes successfully regardless of her vote. Those who are rarely or never rolled constitute the “policy winners”—legislative outcomes can be considered to generally reflect their wishes. On the other hand, those rolled frequently constitute “policy losers”—the policy outcomes that prevail generally run counter to their expressed interests.13 Each legislator's “roll rate” is simply the percentage of votes that she cast for final passage of bills on which she is rolled. These data were gathered and calculated by Gary Cox and Mathew McCubbins (2005).         "
"23","To isolate the relationship between ordinary majority party members’ policy losses and their district's share of distributive benefits, we introduce two categories of control variables to account for the electoral context of each member's district and for each member's position within the House."
"24","Those who are electorally vulnerable might be more consistently in “need” of reelection‐enhancing distributive benefits (Bickers and Stein 1996; Stein and Bickers 1994). Electoral vulnerability, in turn, can arise from both the general weakness of the legislator's party in the district, independent of the personal qualities of the legislator herself, or the electoral weakness of the candidate herself rather than her party. We address each of these potential factors by incorporating two control variables: (1) the district's two‐party vote share for the majority party's presidential candidate in the most recent elections (Majority Party Pres. Vote) and (2) the district's two‐party vote share for the majority party's candidate in the most recent Congressional election (Majority Party Cong. Vote).14 Electoral data for each Congressional district, including district presidential votes and Congressional vote shares, have been provided by Gary Jacobson.         "
"25","Second, the relationship between distribution of nonpolicy and policy benefits may be influenced by the status of certain majority party legislators within the chamber enjoying privileged access to both. Specifically, in light of the foregoing discussion of committee influence in the House, those holding committee chairs and membership in the so‐called “power committees”—Rules, Appropriations, and Ways and Means Committees—may be more likely to be among these privileged legislators. Attainment of a privileged status, in turn, may depend on the seniority status of the legislator—the length of her service in the House—rather than directly from the particular formal positions she holds. We include dummy variables indicating committee chair status (Committee Chair); membership in these power committees (Power Committee); and (3) the number of sessions that the legislator has served in Congress (Chamber Seniority). Data on chamber seniority and committee assignments come from the Congressional Committees dataset (Nelson 2005; Stewart and Woon 2008).15"
"26","Because certain federal awards allocated to states are counted as allocated to state capital districts (Stein and Bickers 1994, 159), we include a dummy variable indicating these districts.16"
"27","We also present models using several demographic controls of potential relevance to (or proxying for factors relevant to) grant frequency or amount: the proportion of the district population living in urban areas, the proportion unemployed, and the median income—each from data compiled by Adler (2003).17"
"28","We employ below an OLS regression designed to test the significance of the correlation between policy losses and distributive benefits across majority members of the House. We regress the log transformed Share of Projects on the Roll Rate, chamber status controls, district political controls, state capital, and the demographic controls. We employ cluster robust standard errors to account for the correlation within districts within the sample.18 Our unit of analysis is the majority party member and the number of observations includes all majority members serving full terms for whom data were available on all variables during the time period under study. Our prediction is cross‐sectional, in that variation in these averages is expected relative to other members of the majority during a given Congress, on average. That is, districts whose members tend to be policy losers overall within the majority should tend to receive a greater overall share of particularistic benefits.         "
"29"," Table 1 illustrates the results of our analysis. Columns 1 and 2 illustrate the findings of the models using the share of the overall number of the projects allocated to each Congressional district represented by a majority party member in the U.S. House as the dependent variable. Columns 3 and 4 show the results of the models using the share of the spending allocated. Models shown in Columns 2 and 4 incorporate the additional demographic control variables for each district: percent of the population unemployed, percent of the population living in urban areas, and the median income in the district.         "
"30","These results show support for our principal expectation that among majority party members, a larger share of distributive benefits is allocated to those who lose most on final passage votes. That is, in all models, the amount of distributive benefits allocated is positively correlated with the roll rate of the representative."
"31","Among the control variables, committee chairs do not obtain larger shares of distributive benefits for their districts in either measure. Members of “power committees,” on the other hand, do appear to obtain larger shares in terms of obtaining larger numbers of projects (but not more spending); however, this relationship is statistically significant (at p = 0.05) only when additional demographic control variables are included in the model. Members of the majority with greater seniority do receive somewhat larger numbers of projects, but again in statistically meaningful (at p = 0.1) amounts only in the model incorporating additional demographic variables. The Congressional vote share for the majority party has a consistent negative effect in the distribution of particularistic benefits across all specifications. The more marginal members who received relatively fewer votes than their copartisans indeed appear to obtain more projects and spending. The majority party vote share in the most recent presidential elections, on the other hand, has a more ambiguous relationship vis‐à‐vis the amount of benefits allocated to a given district. In the basic models, the relationship is negative, suggesting that districts where the majority party's presidential candidates do well receive less by means of particularistic benefits. However, the relationship is positive—statistically significant in the case of the numbers of awards—when additional demographic variables are incorporated. Among the demographic control variables, districts that are more urban, with higher median income, and with greater unemployment, tend to receive less targeted federal projects and less spending on those projects."
"32","The relationship between policy wins and distributive benefits within the majority party in the U.S. House is illustrated more clearly in Figure 2, which plots Model 1's fitted values against roll rates.         "
"33","                 Percent of Federal Targeted Projects and Roll Rate, 98th– 104th Congress, Predicted Values                      "
"34","The x‐axis represents the roll rates for each majority party legislator. The y‐axis represents the predicted share of federal assistance projects allocated to a Congressional district held by majority party members in a given year in percentage points. As shown in the figure, the quantity of targeted projects allocated to the legislators’ districts increases as roll rates increase. Among majority party members, those with relatively high individual roll rates receive a substantially larger share of federal assistance projects than those with low roll rates, consistent with a trade‐off between access to policy and distributive benefits."
"35"," Cox and McCubbins (1994, 2005) argue that the party in power must offer a net positive benefit for all its members in order to build and maintain a procedural coalition. In effect, party government will be stable in its procedural coalition as long as everyone in the majority party “wins.” However, as critics such as Krehbiel (1998, 1999) have observed, policy outcomes alone make for an insufficient reward for maintenance of a majority coalition, since its benefits are limited only to those who directly favor those policy outcomes.         "
"36","This article has attempted to address this puzzle by considering the potential for nonpolicy benefits within party government. Members who often do not support the policy efforts of the party, and do not benefit electorally from those legislative outcomes, should obtain access to other benefits sufficient to counter those losses in order to win support on procedural considerations. For most members, each can function as a partial substitute for the other in benefiting their reelection efforts. We have argued that party government therefore must rest on two pillars—the distribution of policy benefits and localized, distributive benefits. The majority party can manipulate the agenda to bias policy outcomes to benefit the party as a whole, allowing many, but not all, among its membership—the policy “winners”—to benefit electorally from their party's collective policy accomplishments. The majority party can also use its influence to channel distributive benefits toward policy “losers” who frequently do not benefit the party's policy goals, providing these members a record of local accomplishments on which to base their reelection campaigns. For the party, this practice ensures that all members have a stake in party government and therefore an incentive to support the party on organizational matters, even if not on policy. Put differently, everyone in the majority party benefits from at least one of these resources if she is to see a positive value in continuing to support her party on procedural votes."
"37","The findings presented in this article suggest that, at least during the period under study, the pattern of one form of distributive politics in the U.S. House is consistent with what we would expect from efforts to stabilize and maintain “party government.” We have provided an argument and some evidence that distributive politics may help provide stability for the majority party's procedural coalition, or, as we have put it, that party government rests in part on a “cohesive power of public plunder.” This distributive component of party organizational strategy can reconcile the majority party's goal of power maintenance with the goals of its policy dissidents, effectively “shaping” their preference for party government."
