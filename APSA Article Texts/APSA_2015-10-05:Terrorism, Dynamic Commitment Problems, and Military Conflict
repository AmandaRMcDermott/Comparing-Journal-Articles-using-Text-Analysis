"1","Much of the current systematic research defines terrorism as the premeditated use of violence by nonstate actors against noncombatant targets aimed at influencing a group larger than the immediate victims for the purposes of producing some political change.7 Terrorism is typically considered to be one of many tactics employed by militants to accomplish two types of goals: outcome goals and process goals (Abrahms 2012). Outcome goals are generally politically oriented or intended to effect some form of political change. These objectives may include the expulsion of foreign troops and their bases, the overthrow of a regime, or the granting of a territorial homeland. The realization of each of these goals requires the government to acquiesce to the terrorists’ demands (Abrahms 2012; Kydd and Walter 2006; Lake 2002). Process goals, by contrast, include recruiting followers, gaining monetary resources, fomenting government opposition, and securing public support. Much, if not most, of the process‐related activity occurs at the microlevel or substate level.         "
"2","Several systematic studies demonstrate that terrorists tend to be ineffective in accomplishing their outcome goals (Abrahms 2012; Cronin 2009; Jones and Libicki 2008). However, recent advances indicate that these groups can be effective at gaining influence in smaller geographic regions. This suggests that by seeking out the effectiveness of terrorism at the macrolevel, we may inadvertently overlook the successes these groups can achieve in gaining membership, enforcing compliance with laws, and possibly gaining material support at the microlevel of towns, villages, districts, or cities (Tarrow 2007). Recent studies indicate that terrorists may effectively seize control over these smaller geographic areas, thereby transitioning their movements to insurgencies, which are more likely to attain some success (Abrahms 2012; De la Calle and Sánchez‐Cuenca 2012; Findley and Young 2012). Theoretical and empirical studies of terrorism at the microlevel typically conceptualize conflicts between governments and militants as a political contest for support from a targeted population (Kalyvas 2006; Weinstein 2007). Both sides attempt to gain popular support using a mix of violence and offers of protection.8 These studies further indicate that the power of both the government and the militants is endogenous to the territory they control and the level of support they gain from a population. To increase their authority over territory and civilians, terrorists may attempt to provoke the government into using indiscriminate versus selective violence (Condra et al. 2010; Kocher, Pepinsky, and Kalyvas 2011). This response compels civilians to turn to the militants for protection (Bueno de Mesquita and Dickson 2007; Jaeger et al. 2012; Rosendorff and Sandler 2004). Terrorists therefore engage in violence and subsequently hide within a population in hopes of pushing the government into errant strikes (Kydd and Walter 2006) or into adopting counterterrorism measures that foment opposition to the government (Bueno de Mesquita 2005).         "
"3","These studies demonstrate that terrorists can gain enough influence within smaller geographic areas such that there is genuine potential for them to transition into insurgencies that control territory. This evolution may endogenously weaken the government by depriving it of the resources from this lost territory. For example, if terrorists compel villagers to cease paying taxes to central governing authorities, the government is deprived of revenue and will have fewer resources to defend itself from the group or foreign threats. For relatively wealthier and militarily stronger governments, these losses will not be sufficient to weaken their power significantly. However, governments with less wealth and capacity maintain a more tenuous hold over their territories (De Rouen and Sobek 2004; Fearon and Laitin 2003; Hendrix 2010).         "
"4","If such states are dependent on resources drawn from particular areas to sustain a considerable part of their economies and military capacities, the loss of valuable territory can be significant. It may also be the case that particular terrain is valuable not for the economic rents it produces, but for its strategic worth. For example, Israel and Syria have often clashed over the Golan Heights. This does not occur because the area itself is economically valuable, but rather because control of this zone imparts a clear strategic advantage in the ability to observe military movements in rival territory. In these cases, if terrorists hypothetically gain influence over strategically valuable territory, a government may find itself vulnerable to a rival. If a government's power is critically dependent on its control of specific territories, and terrorists threaten the government's control of such areas at the microlevel, the success of terrorists at the microlevel can weaken a state at the macrolevel.         "
"5","To illustrate with an example, consider the conflict between the United States and the Taliban insurgency, composed of several groups such as the Quetta Shura and the Haqqani network. After the fall of Kabul in late 2001, these groups consistently engaged in terrorist attacks against U.S. positions in Afghanistan from their bases in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Slowly but surely, these groups infiltrated numerous Afghan villages and towns and began exercising coercive influences over local populations. After the United States responded to Taliban activity with airstrikes, the group further cemented its control over the area, promising to punish any individual who cooperated with the coalition's efforts. As Taliban activity spread throughout southern and eastern Afghanistan, the United States found that its hold of the territory was becoming increasingly tenuous. By 2009, the Taliban appeared to wield total control over southern Afghanistan, and the central government's prospects for survival appeared to be in decline. The situation further deteriorated in 2009, as Taliban fighters were threatening Highway 1, a key route for American troops and supplies. Had the Taliban successfully secured this road, the group would have cut off the U.S. and Afghan forces from resupply routes on the ground, potentially resulting in a rapid shift in power in favor of the Taliban."
"6","In this case, it is evident that while the Taliban's demand for the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. coalition forces from Afghanistan was unsuccessful, the group was quite effective at gradually gaining influence and power at the microlevel. Moving village by village, the Taliban emerged from an assortment of terrorists into a virulent insurgency, extending its collective influence and eroding the government's territorial control. Assuming the Afghan government's power was critically reliant on the territory it held, we see that microlevel terrorism results in what Powell (1996) called “salami tactics” (Schelling 1966). By 2009, the Taliban were in a position to create a dramatic and perhaps irreversible drop in the U.S. and the Afghan government's military position. This case demonstrates that if terrorists are successful in destabilizing territory at the microlevel, they may gain enough influence to create substantial vulnerability in weaker governments at the macrolevel. Similar dynamics have transpired between India and Pakistan over the disputed province of Kashmir, where Indian forces have fought militants on a near‐consistent basis to maintain control of the mountain ranges in the region. These peaks are essential to guard against Pakistani incursions into the territory. In 1999, Pakistani‐backed militants attempted to take control of the peaks and were met with swift Indian military retaliation. India refused to tolerate increased vulnerability in Kashmir by ceding control of the peaks to Pakistani militants. Similarly, Israel consistently refuses to cede any of the Shebaa Farms region to Hezbollah, simply because doing so would not only make its own cities more susceptible to rocket attacks, but could also potentially threaten Israel's supply of freshwater. Each of these examples demonstrates the following logic: If terrorism can destabilize a government's control over small parts of its territory at the microlevel, and the government's power is contingent upon the control of its territory, terrorist destabilization can potentially create commitment problems by creating rapid shifts in power (Fearon 1995; Powell 2006).         "
"7","To examine how rapid power shifts created by terrorist destabilization can contribute to conflict, let us consider two hypothetical states: 1 and 2. State 1 is facing terrorists within her territory, whereas 2 is a neighboring state. Let us assume that the terrorists attacking 1 are transnational and primarily conduct their operations from within 2's territory. Should the terrorists in 1 threaten to seize a strategic piece of territory, such as Highway 1 in Afghanistan, the peaks in Kashmir, or an oil well, the success of the terrorists may weaken 1's ability to draw resources from its territory. With the loss of these resources, 1 may be unable to maintain the balance of military forces between itself and 2. The ability of terrorists to compromise 1's control over valuable territory may therefore create a shift in power between States 1 and 2. This shift in the balance of power is generally reflective of a change in a state's likelihood of winning a military contest at some point in the future. For example, State 1's probability of victory against State 2 may be initially fixed at p but then decreases to p’ after terrorists destabilize critical territory. If 1 takes no action, 1's probability of victory will remain at p’ for all subsequent periods. This translates into a weaker bargaining position for State 1 relative to State 2. As a result, terrorism that saps 1 of key resources undermines 1's ability to defend itself from its rival. State 1 may be compelled to initiate military conflict against the terrorists in 2's territory to reverse this decline in power. Similarly, 2 will anticipate the decrease in 1's bargaining leverage and will have an incentive to exploit it. If the expected change in power is sufficiently large (i.e., Δp, the relative change between p and p’), then one of the two states may prefer fighting in equilibrium to striking a mutually beneficial bargain with the other.         "
"8","Given the basic balance‐of‐power alterations underlying commitment problems, the question becomes this: How can terrorist activity (or what type) precipitate such a shift in the distribution of power between States 1 and 2? We focus specifically on micro‐related activity, arguing that when terrorists threaten to seize an area of strategic importance or otherwise alter a state's strategic ability to protect itself, then states should be more likely to resort to interstate violence. This result is likely to obtain because the set of agreements both 1 and 2 find preferable to conflict depends on their expectations of the conflict outcome. If terrorism in either one of the states worsens one state's expectations and improves the other's, then agreements that were formerly mutually acceptable may no longer hold (Wagner 1994).         "
"9","The first premise we employ is that, all else equal, states care more about strategic resources than nonstrategic resources. A strategic resource is defined as any asset, the loss of which would affect a state's ability to defend itself or engage in military activities. This definition is broad enough to include numerous domestic resources vital to the protection of the state.9 For instance, this definition includes lucrative natural resources and primary commodities such as oil, rare and valuable minerals, and diamond mines. But it may also include strategically vital portions of territory or chokepoints, to include hills and high ground essential for maintaining military advantages. By way of illustration, Tuarag rebels enjoined al Qaeda groups in taking over large swaths of mostly uninhabited areas of desert in northeast Mali during the last decade. This activity in a remote area of the country with little strategic or economic importance went unchecked by the Malian government for many years. By contrast, when Pakistani‐sponsored militants infiltrated the strategic point of Tiger Hill in Kargil, India wasted little time in initiating the 1999 Kargil War to retake the peaks.         "
"10","Second, terrorist destabilization of areas of economic or strategic importance may compromise a government's ability to extract valuable resources or to defend itself from threatening neighbors. This dynamic is likely to transpire even if the type of terrorist activity occurs only at the microlevel over process‐oriented goals. We should therefore expect that if a government is dependent on natural resources for its security—and faces terrorists who could weaken its ability to procure these resources—the government might initiate attacks against terrorists within its neighbor to defend itself.10 An interesting implication of this argument is that the initiation of a “war on terror” is not necessarily aimed at disarming terrorists. Instead, the more limited goal is simply to prevent the terrorists from undermining or seizing control over particularly valuable areas. Attacks on terrorist sanctuaries may represent efforts to disrupt the group's supply chain or attack its commanders, all with the intention of preventing the group from consolidating its gains within the government's territory. This logic helps to explain why rational states would elect to undertake such wars, even when there are few identifiable cases of governments successfully disarming terrorists as a result of such costly actions.         "
"11","To illustrate, we return to the case of the United States and Pakistan. As discussed earlier, the “center” of the Taliban was in the Waziristan province of Pakistan, which shares a long border with Afghanistan. Yet both the Quetta Shura and the Haqqani network appeared to be making substantial gains in the late 2000s in the southern and eastern portions of Afghanistan. By 2009, Kabul was nearly encircled by hostile forces, and the supply route into Kabul remained in jeopardy. In response, the Obama administration surged ground forces into Afghanistan and escalated assaults against the Taliban within Pakistani territory. This suggests that if governments believe that terrorist activity at the microlevel is creating a potential for greater destabilization, governments may attack terrorist bases in foreign territory. The goal of these attacks is not necessarily to disarm the group entirely, but rather to undermine the group's ability to consolidate control over parts of the government's territory. As noted, these attacks may allow the government to reassert its control over areas within its own territory, thereby restoring the flow of resources needed to maintain its stability. The interesting conclusion is that preventive “wars on terror” are not necessarily aimed at completely defeating the group in its foreign sanctuaries. Instead, the goal may be to temporarily weaken the group such that the government can reassert control over its own territory. In the aforementioned case of Afghanistan, the troop surge and attacks into Pakistan allowed the United States to halt the Taliban's momentum and pacify Helmand and Kandahar, but they did not disarm the Taliban in the tribal areas.            "
"12","Preventive wars on terror represent an effort by targeted nations to defend their territory and their government against terrorists and their host states. Let us now consider a second possible conflict that could result from power shifts caused by terrorists. In this case, assume that State 1 loses some portion of territory to the terrorists within its country. This loss of territory might cause 1 to weaken due to the forfeiture of resources and income from the territory, or possibly the concession of a strategic military position. In this case, terrorism may exacerbate or otherwise increase her vulnerability. To use the terminology developed above, if Δp is sufficiently large and in favor of State 2, the neighboring state, she may no longer be able to credibly honor the status quo distribution vis‐à‐vis State 1. That is, Δp entices State 2 to renege and alter the equilibrium in a manner that reflects the new balance of power. Under such conditions, State 2 will have the incentive to take advantage of the instability occurring in State 1 on account of terrorist activity. State 2 may initiate conflict under the guise of humanitarian intervention, restoring order, stopping state failure, or protecting its minorities.         "
"13","We would further expect that 2 should only initiate a conflict if it has some motivation to take control of 1's territory. We therefore anticipate that 2 will have a greater motivation to attack 1 as its own dependence on natural resources increases. Second, we should only expect 2 to initiate violence in response to terrorism if 1's territory actually contains strategic or valuable assets. To illustrate, consider Rwanda's intervention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). At the end of the first war in the Congo, Rwanda occupied much of the eastern part of the country, an area full of mineral riches. Newly installed DRC President Laurent Kabila soon demanded that all foreign troops leave Congolese territory and return to their homelands. However, the Rwandan government argued that the Hutu extremist group known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) was still active in the eastern part of the country and needed to be disarmed. Given that Kabila had recently assumed power, and lacked popular support in the territory, it was quite clear that he lacked the capability to disarm the FDLR. This weakness justified Rwanda's continued presence and reinvasion of the territory, particularly given Rwandan leader Paul Kagame's references to the past massacres of Tutsis at the hands of Hutu. In addition to continuing the fight against Hutu extremists in neighboring Congo, the Rwandan occupation afforded it the added benefit of access to the eastern Congo's diamonds, coltan, and other mineral deposits. The “war on terror” in the eastern Congo proved quite lucrative, and the presence of Hutu terrorists gave Rwanda the pretext to wage it.            "
"14","Let us consider some secondary implications of predatory conflict. Since 9/11, academic studies have demonstrated that weak states were hubs of terrorist activity (Bapat 2007; Fearon and Laitin 2004; Piazza 2008), suggesting that it was necessary to stabilize these ungoverned spaces using a combination of military intervention and state building.The argument is that since these failed states create opportunities for terrorism, and the sovereign cannot reassert control of the area, it is the responsibility of some outside actor to assume control and provide stability in the territory. That is, the weakness of the state facing the terrorists may provide a policy and moral justification for external powers to initiate conflict with “weak” governments in the name of fighting terror. However, these rationalizations may be potentially self‐serving. The theory and the dynamics underpinning predatory conflicts point to terrorists as potentially destabilizing, thereby validating third‐party intervention. But the theory does not dictate from whence such groups may garner support. It remains entirely consistent with the theory that the very country intending to invade a neighbor on account of terrorist activity may actually be supporting the group in whose name the intervention is justified. The necessity of external intervention to confront strong terrorists may incentivize rival states to support terrorism, weaken a neighboring government, and thereby justify their own intervention as a remedy for the chaos within their neighbor's borders. Terrorism may therefore afford rival states a reason to initiate aggressive wars to fight the very terrorists they may allow to operate from their own territories.         "
"15","Although this argument may appear nefarious and far‐fetched, it may be more common than previously assumed. In addition to Rwanda's intervention in the DRC, consider the case of Ethiopia's invasion of Somalia in 2006. In this case, Ethiopia justified its intervention in Somalia as necessary to defeat the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). Although this campaign was marred by difficulties and led to the rise of the al Shabaab terrorist organization, the end result was the reinstallation of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) as the sovereign of Somalia. The TFG committed itself to cooperation with Ethiopia and to fighting Islamists in its territory. Arguably, Ethiopia put itself in a far better security situation after the war, considering its long hostility toward Somalia and the possibility of an Islamist government on its border. The growth of the Islamic Courts Union opened the door for Ethiopia to gain a lasting influence in the politics of its rival. An even more recent example concerns Russia's behavior in the Ukraine, where Vladimir Putin has been accused of supporting pro‐Russian militants and their efforts to challenge the state's control of the eastern part of the country. The instability Russia helped perpetuate provided the perfect ploy for an overt takeover of the Crimea followed by a stealth invasion into eastern Ukraine, both of which contributed to substantial gains in Putin's domestic popularity. In both cases, the struggle of a particular government against terrorists enabled rival states to intervene and carve up valuable territory."
"16","The argument above posits that the two types of “wars on terror” can occur if (1) transnational terrorists are present, (2) the terrorists gain influence in strategically or economically valuable territory, and (3) the loss of this territory can produce a sudden loss of power for the government relative to its neighbors. We therefore only expect to observe the initiation of wars on terror in states that are more critically dependent on their territories to maintain both their power and their sovereignty, and only in areas where these states face legitimate threats from rival neighbors. In the post–Cold War era, this condition excludes areas of the world such as North America or Western Europe that are not solely dependent on their territory for their power and face no challenges to their sovereignty. To examine the empirical validity of the theory, we therefore seek a sample of relatively weaker states that share tenuous political relationships but are also afflicted by transnational terrorists. Further, analytically investigating the argument requires a systematic measure of territorial value. This is a nontrivial task since the value of territory is somewhat difficult to standardize. For example, if we were to measure the value of territory simply by its relative elevation, this would miss cases where the territory is relatively low but encompasses strategic railways, ports, or harbors. Because there is so much variance in “strategic value,” we need to locate a set of cases where the value of territory can be standardized."
"17","We maintain that the sample of cases to best test the hypotheses is the African state system. African states face considerable challenges to their legitimacy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Surprisingly, however, terrorism in Africa is relatively infrequent. The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) indicates that, on average, Africa accounts for 9% of total yearly global terrorist events from 1970 to 2013.11 The GTD also reveals that with the exception of the period 1994–99—coinciding with the Rwandan civil war, the conflict in the Congo, and al Qaeda's embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania—African fatalities from terrorism are consistently lower than the rest of the world, as is shown in Figure 1. However, although terrorist attacks appear infrequent, the risk associated with terrorists seizing control of territory and transitioning to insurgencies is relatively higher for each of the African states due to their weak institutions, large ungoverned spaces, and porous borders that enable transnational tactics. Other regions in the world typically contain only one or two states that face these similar conditions. However, conditions are systematic in Africa, thereby allowing us to test the hypotheses with this collection of states.12"
"18","The selection of Africa is further advantageous in that it allows us to standardize the value of territory. Primary commodities, such as oil, gold, minerals, and/or rare earths, account for the vast majority of revenue generated by each of the African states. This revenue is necessary to fund public investment and military spending, thereby making it a key source of power for each of the states. From 2003 to 2006, over 80% of the African states generated more than 50% of their exports from primary commodities. Over 40% of these states relied on only one commodity as their key export.13 If we divide the African states into states that are rich in primary resources and states that are not, we see that the states with primary resources outperform their counterparts in terms of overall gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, and exports (Clapham 1998; Englebert 2000; Rabasa et al. 2007).         "
"19","Natural resources accounted for 32% of the growth in Africa's GDP from 2002 to 2007, which was 146% larger than the next largest sector, retail (Leke et al. 2010). Clearly, since African states with abundant natural resources are more powerful, are larger economically, and attract more FDI, control over natural resources is critical in the African state system. Consequently, commodities extracted from resource‐rich territory are placed at a premium. In short, the African states are ideal to test the hypotheses because transnational militant groups are active, these states are more sensitive to terrorist activity, and we can standardize a metric for territorial value by focusing on natural resources.         "
"20","We therefore construct a data set that consists of politically relevant, contiguous, non–major power African dyads from 1990 to 2006.14 The post–Cold War period eliminates the influence of U.S.‐ and Soviet‐backed proxy groups, given that it is impossible for any of the African states to attack the superpowers. In this period, major power activity in the continent was minimal, though not entirely nonexistent. The data set therefore consists of dyads with a primary state and each of its neighbors (2,3,…n). We then use the UCDP‐PRIO data (Gleditsch et al. 2002) to determine whether the primary government faces militant challengers in a given year. Theoretically, this group may be domestic, but given the fluidity of borders in Africa and the frequent use of transnational tactics, we assume that each organization is potentially transnational. It is entirely possible that foreign support is unobservable for a given group due to lack of data coverage. Another issue is that there are sometimes multiple groups operating in various primary states in a given year. Since we are only interested in whether the presence of terrorists contributes to conflict, we do not create multiple observations for each group. The assumption is therefore that the effect of a group on the probability a dyad experiences conflict is the same irrespective of the number of groups. It is also possible that a given state appears as the primary state in some observations, and later as a neighbor. For example, some of the observations consist of Kenya as the primary state and Sudan as the neighbor. The data set later contains observations where Sudan is the primary state and Kenya is one of the neighbors. This allows us to capture cases where terrorism is occurring in both states, which is not uncommon.         "
"21","We employ two dependent variables: (1) whether 1 initiates an attack against 2 in response to terrorist activity in its territory and (2) wehther 1 is the recipient of an attack by 2 as a result of terrorists in its territory. Both variables are dichotomous and are coded as 1 if the event occurs in a given year and 0 otherwise. We identify both types of attacks using the newly updated Militarized Interstate Dispute data (MID4). These data identify whether states threaten, display, or use force against another state. Theoretically, we are only interested in cases where states actually use force against each other, rather than cases where states simply threaten or display force. We first examine whether a particular dyad contains a MID. We next identify whether the primary state or the neighbor initiated the hostilities using MIDs identification of “SideA,” which is designated as the side that took the first militarized action. If both sides were identified as SideA, we interpret that both sides initiated the dispute jointly, and the case is coded as 0. If only one side is designated as SideA, however, we consulted the conflict narratives to ensure that the actual use of force took place between the two sides. If this is the case, we next identify whether 1 (with the terrorists in its territory) or 2 was responsible for initiating the hostilities. In the former case, where 1 initiates against 2 (indicating a preventive war), we code our first dependent variable Attack as 1. In the latter case, where 2 initiates hostilities against 1 (indicating a predatory war), we code the second dependent variable Recipient as 1. The cross‐tabulation in Table 1a indicates that 71/83 (86%) of the Attacks occur when terrorists are operational inside the primary state's territory, indicating a preventive war. On the other hand, 55/88 (62%) Recipient cases occur when terrorists operate inside 1's territory, as is evident in Table 1b. This cursory look suggests that preventive initiations of force appear more frequent then predatory ones in this period.            "
"22","Hypothesis 1 states that preventive conflicts are more likely to occur if terrorists cause a decline in the ability of governments to extract valuable resources from their territory. If we focus on the set of African states, the primary state's ability to extract resources is captured by the rents it generates from natural resource extraction. We obtain this primary state's natural resource rents using data from the World Bank. This indicator is a sum of all of the government's resource rents, including oil, coal, natural gas, minerals, and forests. Theoretically, this reflects the primary government's profits from the resources in its territory. Higher scores indicate greater profitability to the primary government, whereas lower scores indicate that natural resources are either difficult to extract or that no resources exist within the territory. We add 1 and take the natural log of this variable for the primary government. The new variable (Primary State Resource Rents Logged) indicates the primary state's dependence on natural resources to support its government.            "
"23","However, we are acutely concerned with whether or not terrorists are harming the primary state's revenues from its natural resource exploitation. We therefore create a measure of the percent change in the primary state's annual growth in resource rents from t–1 to t. As in the previous case, we add 1 and take the log of the variable to correct for its non‐normal distribution. This new variable is called % Change in Resource Rents. The variable has a range of –1.53 to 2.34, a mean of .03, and a standard deviation of .34. Negative values indicate that the primary government's profits from its natural resources are declining. In cases where no terrorist activity is occurring, there is no reason for the primary state to initiate violence against its neighbors. However, if this decrease occurs when terrorists are active, the primary state may respond to decreasing resource rents by initiating interstate conflict. On the other hand, positive growth in resource rents indicates that the primary state is continuing to generate profits from its natural resources, despite terrorist activity. This indicates that the terrorists do not threaten the primary state's ability to extract resources and, consequently, do not create the commitment problem necessary to trigger conflict. Therefore, our expectation is that terrorists will precipitate preventive conflicts only in cases where the primary state's resource rents are declining, but not in cases where the primary state's resource rents are increasing. Our expectation is therefore represented as follows:               "
"24","Hypothesis 2 elaborates the conditions under which the neighboring state becomes the (predatory) aggressor. It posits that increasing a neighboring state's resource rents increases the probability that it initiates a predatory “war on terror” if the primary or target state's territory contains valuable resources. To capture the first component, we again use the World Bank data to capture the neighbor's rents generated from natural resources. This gives us some indication as to whether or not the neighbor gains economically from controlling natural resources in their area. This variable is then interacted with the dichotomous terrorist indicator. We next create a measure of natural resources within the primary state's territory using the World Bank's Commodity Rent data. These data allow us to identify whether the primary state gains any rents from the extraction of oil or gold specifically. These two commodities are among the most lucrative available. We then create a dichotomous variable called Resource‐Rich that is coded 0 if the primary government derives no rents from either oil or gold and is coded 1 if the primary government draws some rent from either oil or gold. The primary government is identified as having oil or gold in its territory in 53% of the observations versus 47% of the cases where the primary government is identified as lacking these resources. Finally, we again use the UCDP/PRIO and Jones and Libicki data to identify whether terrorists are active in the primary state. This hypothesis is captured by the following equation:               "
"25","We create a ratio of State 1's share of the two sides’ military expenditures using the equation (State 1 military expenditures)/(State 1 military expenditures + State 2 military expenditures). Higher scores indicate that State 1 has more power, whereas scores that tend to 0 indicate that State 1 has less power relative to State 2."
"26","We further include Arbetman and Kugler's (1997) lagged measure of relative political capacity (RPC) for the primary government. The RPC indicator is a ratio of actual tax revenue collected by the state to the state's predicted amount of tax revenue (Arbetman and Kugler 1997).               "
"27","This covariate reflects the degree to which the primary government maintains some control over its territory. However, the indicator also captures the primary government's ability to draw resources from its exploitation of natural resources."
"28","We also include control variables capturing the logged per capita GDP scores of both states in the dyad."
"29","We use Gibler's (2009) International Military Alliances to determine whether Primary State 1 and Neighbor State 2 have an alliance with another state outside the dyad. Both variables are coded 1 if such an alliance exists and 0 otherwise.               "
"30","We also include measures of size of both the primary and neighboring states’ logged area in hectares."
"31","The data set is a pooled cross‐sectional time series with a binary dependent variable (BTSCS). Since the variables capturing 1's initiation of a conflict and 2's initiation of a conflict are both dichotomous, we use logit models and correct for duration dependence using an indicator of the duration between conflicts along with its square and its cube (Carter and Signorino 2010). The standard errors in both models are clustered on the primary state.15"
"32","Table 3 presents the test of Hypothesis 1. Our expectation is that the presence of terrorists should increase the probability that the primary state initiates a conflict against its neighbor if and only if the terrorists are harming growth in the primary state's resource revenues. We see that the interaction term is negative and statistically significant in both models. However, marginal effects are necessary to properly interpret these interaction results. Figure 2 examines the effect of the terrorist variable (on the initiation of preventative war) across all values of ∆ Primary State Resource Rents. The x‐axis represents the percent change in the primary state's resource rent revenue from the previous year. The mean growth in primary resource rents is equal to .03, or about 3%. The plot demonstrates that if the primary state is experiencing negative growth in resource rents, the presence of terrorists significantly increases the probability that it will initiate an attack against its neighbor. This result also holds if the growth in resource rents is positive, but less than approximately 25%. Substantively, this demonstrates that primary states facing resource losses or declines as a result of terrorist activity are more likely to initiate conflicts against neighboring states where terrorists have sanctuaries. However, the presence of terrorists has no statistical effect on the probability of conflict once the primary state's rate of growth in resource rents exceeds 25%. This indicates that terrorists are unlikely to have any effect on the probability that the primary state initiates a conflict, so long as the primary state is maintaining its ability to draw profits from its resource exploitation. Since the profits from the exploitation of resources are essential to the economies of African states, this result demonstrates that states are only likely to initiate preventive conflicts in response to terrorism if their profits fall under strain. However, terrorists do not increase the likelihood that states initiate conflicts if their profits continue to grow. Figure 3 depicts the predicted probability that the primary state initiates an attack. The double bar charts indicate the probability of an attack at three distinct values of growth in the primary state's natural resource rents—the mean (.03) and two standard deviation shifts of 0.34. We see that although the predicted probabilities are small (indicating that attacks are rare), the loss of resource rents increases the probability of an attack by 1066% at two standard deviations below the mean, by 700% at one standard deviation below the mean, and by 383% at the mean.

"33","The results support Hypothesis 1. Primary states are only likely to initiate “wars on terror” if the terrorists are harming their ability to extract resources, thereby creating the possibility of future commitment problems. However, if a state's capacity to secure resource rents remains unfettered, the presence of terrorists has no substantive effect on the primary state's behavior. Consistent with Hypothesis 1, we see that the effect of terrorism is conditional on the ability of the group to undermine the primary state's extraction of resources from its territory."
"34","Table 4 presents the test of Hypothesis 2. We see that the interaction term is statistically significant at the p < .05 level in the baseline model; and we note that it is significant at the p < .1 level in the model with controls. However, the table itself tells us little as far as how to interpret the three‐term interaction. Table 5 presents the effect of increasing the neighbor's resource rents across four categories. Natural resources alone do not meaningfully induce conflict initiation in this case, as indicated in the upper‐right cell. The same may be said in this case for the singular impact of terrorists on conflict incidence, as shown in the lower‐left quadrant. By contrast, the table indicates that increasing the neighbor's resource rents is significant at the p < .05 level in two instances: one where there are no terrorists and no resources in the primary state's territory, and another where there are terrorists and resources within the primary state.         "
"35","Figure 4 plots the predicted probability that the neighbor initiates conflict as a function of its natural resource rents in both cases. In the case where the primary state's territory contains no resources and no terrorists are active, we see that increasing the neighbor's natural resource rents from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above increases the probability of conflict from .006 to .02. However, we see that when the primary state's territory contains resources and terrorists are active, the predicted probability of a predatory conflict ranges from .02 to .04, which is 200% higher at the mean level of neighbor resource rents and 100% higher at one standard deviation above.         "
"36","We see that neighbors are more likely to initiate “wars on terror” in cases where the primary state's territory contains either oil or gold. For the results to support the theoretical explanation, they should demonstrate that the neighboring states are only more likely to attack if terrorists weaken the primary state. We see that if the primary state has either gold or oil, but does not have terrorists in its territory, the neighboring states are no more likely to attack than they would be if the primary state lacked any resources. Similarly, if the primary state has terrorists in its territory but no valuable resources, neighbors are also unlikely to attack. The probability of an attack is maximized when the primary state controls valuable territory and is weakening due to terrorism. These outcomes are consistent with Hypothesis 2. The results offer a clear explanation for why states choose to intervene in weak states—doing so offers the opportunity to loot valuable resources. This further suggests that neighbors will take advantage of political turmoil caused by terrorists at the microlevel in valuable territory to initiate expansionist adventures. Taken together, we see that arguments to intervene against terrorists in failing states do appear to be self‐serving and motivated by economic incentives."
"37","This study began with the following question: Why are states willing to initiate costly wars on terror when terrorists appear so insignificant? Our argument is that while terrorists do appear insignificant at the macrolevel, terrorists can achieve their process goals at the microlevel. In these smaller geographic areas, terrorists may compel smaller populations to join their movement, cease paying taxes, or sabotage government installations. If terrorists succeed with these activities in strategically valuable areas, and a government's power is endogenous to the territory it holds, it follows that terrorist success at the microlevel may contribute to macrolevel shifts in power. This in turn may create commitment problems for governments facing terrorists and their rivals."
"38","We argue that wars on terror can take one of two forms. First, governments fearing that terrorist activity will make them vulnerable may launch preemptive attacks against terrorist sanctuaries in foreign states. The literature notes that these attacks rarely succeed in disarming terrorists. However, we argue that this may not be the key objective these governments have in using force. Instead, governments may use force against terrorists in foreign territories to prevent the groups from consolidating their gains within the government's territory. We also identify a secondary mechanism that may generate wars on terror. If terrorists significantly weaken a government using coercion at the microlevel, the government's loss of power may make it impossible for its rivals to accept the current status quo. The “attractive targets” thesis posits that shifts in power on account of terrorist activity tempt outside actors to intervene in a country to restore stability or prevent further deterioration. Empirically, we expect rivals to declare that a state has failed and/or that it requires some form of external intervention to survive. This provides a pretext for rival states to enter into the government's territory and carve it up, particularly if it is valuable. It is interesting that “wars on terror” may serve as a new justification for territorial expansion."
