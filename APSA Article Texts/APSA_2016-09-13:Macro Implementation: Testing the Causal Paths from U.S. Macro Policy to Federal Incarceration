"1","The defining feature of a democracy is the reflection of popular preferences in government actions. A simple process supposedly drives this relationship: Popular opinion influences policy (e.g., statutes, executive orders, court rulings), and policy shapes bureaucratic outputs (e.g., public expenditures, welfare services, incarceration). Accordingly, democracy depends on these two critical dynamics: the translation of public opinion into policy (i.e., representation) and the translation of policy into action (i.e., implementation). A rich literature has established that popular preferences generally shape U.S. policymaking (e.g., Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Page and Shapiro 1992); however, the nature and extent of policy implementation remains hotly contested. Some policies seem to produce swift bureaucratic responses, whereas others fall flat (Shipan 2004; Wood and Waterman 1994). Does U.S. policy generally influence bureaucratic outputs? And if so, how?         "
"2","Most implementation studies test the short‐term effects of a particular policy on a specific bureaucratic behavior. These microlevel studies have tested the effect of a congressional act on regulatory enforcement (Wood and Waterman 1991), the effect of a presidential appointment on antitrust litigation (Wood and Anderson 1993), and the effect of Brown v. Board of Education on school desegregation (Hall 2011; Rosenberg 2008). This micro approach provides valuable insight into the implementation of specific policies; however, it may overlook the broader consequences of cumulative, aggregate policymaking on long‐term bureaucratic outputs. Congress rarely creates policy from a clean slate; instead, statutes build on existing laws—sometimes abruptly, but often incrementally. Similarly, courts do not typically pronounce major policy shifts in individual rulings; instead, judges tend to form policy gradually, on a case‐by‐case basis (Landes and Posner 1979, 270; Ponzetto and Fernandez 1979, 379). Consequently, microlevel implementation studies may fail to notice the cumulative effects of aggregate policymaking over time.         "
"3","As a result, we know a good deal about how specific actors react to selected (and, therefore, possibly idiosyncratic) policies, but we do not know whether the ebb and flow of bureaucratic behavior follows the overall tenor of public policy. A few studies have explored the macro effects of elite ideology (Kelly and Witko 2012; Shipan 2004; Whitford 2002), but this work neglects the actual creation of public policy (but see Kelly 2005). The dearth of macro implementation studies is especially glaring given the assumed importance of macro phenomena in other fields of political inquiry, such as representation (Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002), political economy (Bartels 2008), and legitimacy (Ura 2014). Most importantly, microlevel studies cannot resolve a crucial democratic question: Does U.S. macro policy—that is, the set of cumulative, aggregate national policies—affect the general patterns of governmental action? And if so, what institutional mechanisms facilitate that process in a large and complex polity such as the United States?         "
"4","To address these questions, I adopt a macro approach to study policy implementation. My approach offers several advantages. First, I examine the influence of all three branches of the federal government. Second, instead of testing the effects of a particular policy (e.g., the Supreme Court's ruling in Miranda v. Arizona), I develop cumulative, aggregate measures to capture the state of macro policy over time. These measures facilitate a global, systematic, and theoretically appropriate test of macro implementation. Third, rather than examine a narrow bureaucratic behavior (e.g., police reading Miranda warnings), I test the influence of U.S. policy on a broad bureaucratic output that affects numerous social outcomes. Specifically, I examine the effects of macro criminal justice policy on federal incarceration. Incarceration offers an ideal test of macro implementation. Most criminal justice policies—including the enactment of criminal statutes, the prosecution of suspects, and the interpretation of criminal laws—potentially influence one basic bureaucratic output: who goes to prison and who does not. Finally, I employ a variety of methodological techniques to test the long‐term relationships and mediating links between macro policy and incarceration.         "
"5","I find that U.S. macro policy influences bureaucratic outputs: Supreme Court rulings, public laws, and presidential preferences are all associated with long‐term shifts in the federal incarceration rate. Additionally, Court rulings are associated with convictions and plea bargaining in district courts, and public laws and presidential preferences are associated with case filings by federal prosecutors. These variables (case filings, convictions, and plea bargaining) likely mediate the influence of macro policy on incarceration. Overall, I find strong evidence that the Supreme Court shapes incarceration by altering the behavior of district court judges; I also find mixed evidence that Congress and the president influence incarceration by altering prosecutorial behavior."
"6","The United States incarcerates a greater proportion of its population than any other nation in the world, topping Russia, Rwanda, and Cuba by substantial margins. As of 2010, one out of every 200 adults in the United States was behind bars, a rate more than five times the world average (Guerino, Harrison, and Sabol 2011; Walmsley 2006). The vast majority of these inmates are held in state penitentiaries, but the federal incarceration rate has also been steadily increasing for decades. Just 30 years ago, the rate of new admissions to federal prison was less than one‐fourth what it is today.         "
"7","This drastic change has prompted numerous social consequences. Mass incarceration has disenfranchised a significant portion of African Americans (Mauer 2006), reinforced cycles of poverty and crime (Pager 2007; Western 2006), and disrupted family life (Western 2006). The emphasis on penal policies has also diverted resources from other programs (Mauer 2006); in fact, reducing incarceration rates back to those in 1993 would lower correctional expenditures by almost $17 billion per year (Schmitt, Warner, and Gupta 2010). More broadly, personal interactions with the criminal justice system lead to decreased democratic participation and inspire negative orientations toward government (Weaver and Lerman 2010). All told, the increase in U.S. incarceration constitutes one of the most radical and consequential political changes in the last half century.         "
"8","What factors shaped this dramatic transformation? Surprisingly, increased incarceration may not be the result of increased crime; in fact, many studies find an inverse relationship between crime and incarceration (Enns 2014; Nicholson‐Crotty and Meier 2003; Western 2006). Nonetheless, other social forces may affect incarceration, such as economic inequality (Garland 1990), racial cleavages (Alexander 2011; Smith 2004), or a proliferation of out‐of‐wedlock births (Jacobs and Helms 1996). Others point to the influence of social movements and interest groups (Gottschalk 2006) or public opinion generally (Enns 2014; Nicholson‐Crotty, Peterson, and Ramirez 2009).         "
"9","Social forces might shape incarceration rates in two ways. First, public opinion, economic inequality, and demographic patterns probably influence the political institutions that create public policy, and policy subsequently affects incarceration. Alternatively, social forces—particularly public opinion—might directly affect bureaucratic behavior; that is, bureaucrats may “respond in an anticipatory sense to broad public preferences without explicit intervention or signaling from politicians” (Meier and O'Toole 2006, 178). Most previous work remains agnostic on the particular mechanisms that link public opinion to incarceration rates (e.g., Enns 2014, 859). Because my goal is to identify the effect of macro policy on incarceration, any antecedent influence of public opinion on policy is unrelated to, but not inconsistent with, my theory. However, if public preferences directly affect bureaucratic behavior, it is important to control for this confounding factor. In the supporting information, I test the direct effects of public opinion, but I find no evidence that public opinion affects incarceration after controlling for macro policy. Accordingly, I expect any effect of popular preferences on incarceration to operate through the creation of public policy.         "
"10","Consistent with this view, the composition and behavior of policymaking institutions has been found to influence prison admissions. Increased incarceration may be a strategy employed by “tough‐on‐crime” politicians to curry electoral favor, especially during election years (Jacobs and Helms 1996; Yates and Fording 2005); even elected judges tend to become more punitive as reelection contests approach (Huber and Gordon 2004). More specifically, increased incarceration is associated with Republican Party power (Jacobs and Helms 1996; Smith 2004) and conservatism (Hall 2015; Yates and Fording 2005) in state and federal political institutions. Public officials often increase incarceration through the pursuit of specific policy agendas, such as the “war on drugs,” limitations on parole, the restriction of defendant rights, and the enactment of sentencing guidelines and mandatory minimums (Mauer 2006; Nicholson‐Crotty and Meier 2003).         "
"11","Accordingly, I expect macro criminal justice policy to influence incarceration. Specifically, I test the cumulative, aggregate influence of Supreme Court rulings, public laws, and presidential preferences on the rate of new admissions to federal prison."
"12","Policy implementation is a complex and imperfect process. In his seminal study of street‐level bureaucrats, Michael Lipsky finds that “policy implementation in the end comes down to the people who actually implement it” (2010, xii). If implementers disagree with policy, they can shirk responsibilities or sabotage goals (Brehm and Gates 1997; Huber and McCarty 2004). Disagreement is not uncommon; in fact, some agencies are designed to insulate bureaucrats from political pressure (Lewis 2003). Consequently, implementation depends on the ability of policy makers to overcome these obstacles and successfully influence the behavior of street‐level bureaucrats.         "
"13","How do policy makers accomplish this task? The implementation literature suggests at least three mechanisms through which policy makers influence bureaucratic behavior (May and Winter 2009; Meyers and Vorsanger 2012). First, bureaucrats often respond to signals from their political superiors about policy preferences and goals (Carpenter 1996; Keiser and Soss 1998; Langbein 2000). Second, bureaucrats are strongly influenced by the “organizational implementation machinery” (May and Winter 2009, 454), such as administrative procedures (McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1987), “fire alarms” (McCubbins and Schwartz 1984), institutional capacity (Huber and McCarty 2004; Winter 2003), and incentive structures (Miller 2005; Moe 1984). Third, policy makers can shape the attitudes and preferences of street‐level bureaucrats through the appointment of like‐minded agents (Wood and Waterman 1991, 1994). Accordingly, if policy makers hope to influence bureaucratic behavior, they must do so by shaping one or more of these factors. For example, congressional committees use budgetary appropriations, legislative investigations, and new appointments to shape agency action (Weingast 1984), and, in a system of separated powers, multiple principles wield comparable tools (Moe 1985).         "
"14","I posit that macro criminal justice policy influences incarceration by altering the behavior of federal prosecutors and district court judges. First, policy makers alter bureaucratic behavior by sending policy signals, altering institutional resources, and appointing like‐minded bureaucrats. I expect Supreme Court rulings, public laws, and presidential preferences to drive case filings by federal prosecutors. I also expect Court rulings to affect convictions and plea bargaining in district courts. These mediating variables—case filings, convictions, and plea bargaining—should, in turn, affect the rate of new admissions to federal prison. Figure 1 illustrates my hypothesized causal pathways from macro policy to incarceration. Below, I elaborate on these theoretical expectations.         "
"15","First, I posit that all three branches of government shape the behavior of U.S. attorneys filing criminal charges. Like other street‐level bureaucrats, prosecutors respond to signals, resource capacity, incentive structures, and their own preferences (Gordon and Huber 2009). For example, appointed prosecutors pursue high conviction rates in order to demonstrate their legal prowess to potential future employers (Boylan 2005; Glaeser, Kessler, and Morrison Piehl 2000). Therefore, policy makers should be able to influence case filings by sending policy signals to federal prosecutors and by altering their resources, incentives, or preferences.            "
"16","Most obviously, the enactment or repeal of criminal laws alters the capacity of U.S. attorneys to prosecute crimes (Huber and Gordon 2007). When Congress creates a new crime involving potential imprisonment, prosecutors gain the ability to indict new defendants; if Congress repeals the statute, prosecutors lose that power. Other congressional action might also affect case filings. For example, if Congress creates mandatory minimum sentences, it may significantly alter the strategic calculations of U.S. attorneys. Accordingly, case filing practices tend to follow congressional preferences (Whitford 2002; Wood and Anderson 1993).            "
"17","The president should also influence case filings. The appointment and removal powers are central to presidential control over implementation (Lewis 2011), and presidents can replace all U.S. attorneys. Presidents can also signal policy preferences through pronouncements, memos, and informal expectations. Additionally, the Justice Department's conflict referral procedures ensure that local disagreements are resolved by the respective U.S. attorney, and interoffice conflicts are resolved in Washington (Whitford 2002). As a result, the president exerts considerable influence over prosecutors by selecting like‐minded agents and constraining their behavior through administrative procedures (Whitford 2002; Wood and Anderson 1993; Wood and Waterman 1991). However, since presidential influence is exerted primarily through appointments and signaling, the preferences of the president, rather than an explicit set of policies, should drive case filings.            "
"18","Finally, Supreme Court rulings should also affect filing rates. The Court strongly influences the behavior of lower court judges (Hansford and Spriggs 2006; Westerland et al. 2010). Consequently, Court rulings that can be implemented through lower courts significantly alter the behavior of state and private actors (Hall 2011). Because lower courts generally follow Supreme Court rulings, the Court can make it more or less difficult for prosecutors to obtain convictions (Cassell and Fowles 1998; Donohue 1998). However, prosecutors do not simply respond to the actual behavior of lower courts; instead, most litigants, including prosecutors, actively anticipate judicial behavior and make decisions to file cases based on their expectations (Albonetti 1987; see Lederman 1999; Taha 2010). Therefore, Supreme Court rulings should directly influence filing decisions by federal prosecutors when those rulings shape the anticipated outcomes of future cases.            "
"19","Consistent with this logic, Supreme Court rulings should also affect the rate of convictions in district courts. Judges also respond to incentives and constraints as they pursue various motivations, such as role conceptions (Howard 1981), respect for higher courts (Baum 1977), concern for legal accuracy (Johnson 1987), or fear of reversal (Caminker 1994). Regardless of the specific motivations, the Supreme Court maintains strong control over the federal judiciary (e.g., Westerland et al. 2010), including federal district courts (Gruhl 1980; Randazzo 2008). As a result, district court judges should convict defendants at a lower rate when the High Court issues more pro‐defendant rulings; when the Court issues anti‐defendant rulings, district courts should respond with more convictions. Therefore, by shaping the incentives of lower court judges, the Supreme Court's rulings should influence conviction rates, which should in turn affect incarceration.            "
"20","I do not expect conviction rates to respond to the enactment of new public laws. The creation of a new crime may result in more case filings, but not necessarily a higher rate of conviction for those charged. New crimes may be more or less difficult to prosecute than existing crimes; therefore, the rate of convictions could increase or decrease as prosecutors utilize new criminal statutes. The president should also have little influence over conviction rates. Whereas presidents can appoint every federal prosecutor, they can only appoint judges when vacancies arise or new judgeships are created. Additionally, the president cannot give orders to judges or remove them from office. Therefore, both Congress and the president are limited in their ability to influence judges."
"21","Lastly, I expect Supreme Court rulings to affect plea bargaining behavior. As noted above, prosecutors and defense attorneys are strategic actors who anticipate the probability of success when deciding whether to prosecute a case, appeal a decision, or plea bargain. Therefore, all else equal, their decision to plea bargain should be primarily driven by the odds of conviction. As the Supreme Court restricts defendant rights and lower courts comply, they should anticipate greater probability of conviction, defense attorneys should be more willing to plea out, and incarceration rates should increase. Consequently, I expect Supreme Court decisions to influence plea bargaining by shaping the expectations of federal prosecutors."
"22","I expect public laws and presidential preferences to have no direct relationship with plea bargaining. A punitive president might pressure prosecutors to put more defendants behind bars by plea bargaining; however, such a president might also encourage higher conviction rates, and prosecutors can enhance their conviction rates by engaging in inefficient plea bargaining (Rasmusen, Raghav, and Ramseyer 2009). Instead, I expect plea bargaining behavior to be primarily driven by each party's anticipated likelihood of success at trial. Accordingly, the plea bargaining rate should respond to the same forces that drive the conviction rate.            "
"23","Most implementation studies test the effects of a particular policy by comparing a bureaucratic behavior or social outcome before and after the policy's enactment. This approach has been employed to test the effects of presidential actions (Randall 1979), legislative acts (Pressman and Wildavsky 1973; Wood and Waterman 1991), and judicial rulings (Hall 2011; Rosenberg 2008). These studies offer simple and intuitive evaluations of a particular policy's effects; however, they are not designed to capture the continuing influence of numerous policies over time.         "
"24","Instead, I adopt a cumulative, aggregate approach to test the implementation of macro criminal justice policy on federal incarceration. The dependent variable is the annual rate (per 10 million people) of individuals convicted and sentenced to prison in federal courts from 1950 through 2009.1 Analyzing new admissions is appropriate because changes in criminal justice policy should primarily affect new conviction and sentencing practices rather than the existing prison population as a whole.2 Additionally, the increase in incarceration over the last few decades has been primarily driven by new admissions rather than an increase in the average sentence (Wacquant 2010).3"
"25","I employ three measures of macro criminal justice policy as shaped by the federal judicial, legislative, and executive branches. First, I construct a measure of cumulative, aggregate Supreme Court Policy analogous to Ura's “caselaw index” (2014)). I begin with a list of every Supreme Court decision from 1950 to 2009 that is related to criminal law, originated in a federal district court, and involved potential imprisonment (Spaeth et al. 2014).4 I code each of these decisions as either punitive (conservative) or liberalizing (liberal) based on the ideological coding in the Supreme Court Database. I then subtract total liberalizing rulings from total punitive rulings for each year to create an aggregate measure of annual policy change. I calculate the current level of punitive Supreme Court Policy by accumulating annual policy change over time.            "
"26","Next, I construct a measure of cumulative, aggregate Congressional Policy analogous to previous measures of national policy (Kelly 2005; Stimson, MacKuen, and Erikson 1995). I begin with a list of every public law enacted from 1950 to 2009 that is coded as a “Law, Crime, and Family Issue” by the Policy Agendas Project and is potentially related to incarceration.5 Because this list excludes some major drug statutes, I supplement it with the Congressional Research Service's list of significant public laws related to drug enforcement (Franco 1986). I code each of these public laws as either punitive (enhancing penalties) or liberalizing (reducing penalties). I then subtract total liberalizing legislation from total punitive legislation for each year to create an aggregate measure of annual policy change. I calculate the current level of punitive Congressional Policy by accumulating annual policy change over time.            "
"27","Although the data include many liberalizing laws, aggregate congressional policy has only moved in a liberalizing direction once since the late 1940s. Accordingly, I examine the accumulation of annual congressional policy change relative to the long‐term trend of increasingly punitive laws.6 In Figure 2, I present my measures of Supreme Court Policy and Congressional Policy (before removing the linear trend) with the incarceration rate.7"
"28","Lastly, I employ a proxy measure to assess the influence of presidential policy. Given the numerous avenues through which presidents might shape incarceration (appointments, signaling, informal expectations, etc.), it is difficult to fully capture the president's criminal justice policy. Therefore, I use second‐dimension Poole‐Rosenthal (1997)) Common Space scores to measure Presidential Preferences. These scores capture the president's noneconomic policy preferences, which, for the period of my analysis, generally reflect preferences on social issues. I expect higher scores (i.e., conservative preferences) to be associated with higher incarceration rates.8"
"29","I argue that macro criminal justice policy influences incarceration via three mediating variables. First, I expect Supreme Court Policy, Congressional Policy, and Presidential Preferences to all be associated with the annual rate of Case Filings by federal prosecutors. I calculate the case filing rate as the total number of original criminal proceedings filed in federal district court per 10 million people in the United States for each year.9 This measure yields an estimate of the U.S. attorneys' propensity to initiate prosecutions.            "
"30","Next, I expect Supreme Court Policy to be associated with the annual rate of Convictions in district courts. I calculate the conviction rate as the number of convictions per 1,000 case dispositions (i.e., the sum of convictions and acquittals).10 This measure yields an estimate of district court judges' propensity to convict defendants who are brought to trial.            "
"31","Finally, I expect Supreme Court Policy to be associated with the rate of Plea Bargaining in district courts. I calculate the plea bargaining rate as the total number of guilty pleas (or pleas of nolo contendere) per 1,000 criminal defendants.11 This measure indicates the propensity of prosecutors and defendants to reach a plea bargaining agreement after a defendant has been indicted.            "
"32","I employ two variables to control for the population's propensity for illegal activity. The first is an index based on the annual rate of murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and motor vehicle theft.12 Prior research has shown that these variables share a great deal of over‐time variation, and a principal components analysis indicates the six crime rates load onto a single factor.13 That factor serves as an estimate of the violent and property Crime Rate. I also control for the use of illegal drugs. Drug‐related offenses have become increasingly prevalent over the last several decades, and they actually became the modal category of federal prison admissions in the 1980s. Unfortunately, direct measures of drug use are not available for the time period of my study. The best indirect measure of over‐time drug use is the annual drug mortality rate (Paulozzi and Xi 2008; Samkoff and Baker 1982), which assumes that an increase in drug‐related deaths coincides with increased drug use. I employ this proxy to control for Drug Use.            "
"33","Some incarceration studies employ additional controls, such as public opinion and the ideological or partisan composition of political institutions. In the supporting information, I demonstrate that my results are robust to these controls; however, these variables are not significantly associated with incarceration after controlling for macro policy, and their inclusion produces multicollinearity problems. I exclude these variables from my primary analyses because their inclusion is atheoretical. If these variables affect incarceration, they should do so primarily, if not exclusively, through the creation of criminal justice policy. Accordingly, these controls would be appropriate in an analysis of factors that influence the creation, rather than the effects, of macro policy."
"34","I argue that macro policy influences the incarceration rate by altering the behavior of policy implementers. Unfortunately, identification of a causal effect is difficult, particularly with observational data (Morgan and Winship 2007). Accordingly, I employ a variety of methodological approaches to support my causal narrative.            "
"35","First, I utilize a single‐equation error correction model (ECM; De Boef and Keele 2008) to facilitate the analysis of both short‐ and long‐term effects on the incarceration rate. Whereas most implementation studies focus on short‐term effects, I expect macro policy to gradually shape incarceration as the effects of Supreme Court rulings and congressional statutes cascade through the criminal justice system over time. The ECM is perfectly suited to capture these long‐term effects.14 One way to express a single‐equation ECM is as follows (excluding a constant for simplicity):               "
"36","I expect Supreme Court and Congressional Policy to have long‐term effects on incarceration, as these policies shape the behavior of implementers over time. However, I expect the effect of presidential preferences to operate quite differently. First, because presidents primarily influence incarceration rates through appointments, signaling, and informal expectations, I do not expect them to exert substantial influence over incarceration rates after they leave office. Therefore, I do not include lagged presidential preferences in the model. Second, I do not expect the election of a new president to shape incarceration rates the same year the president takes office. New presidents are inaugurated in late January, and it sometimes takes months to nominate new prosecutors. More than 20% of nominations linger over 100 days in the Senate, and some last more than 600 days; 15% of nominees are ultimately rejected, requiring the process to start again (Nelson and Ostrander 2014, 18–19). Until 1986, district court judges appointed interim prosecutors to serve until a nominee was confirmed, and these courts still do so if a confirmation takes more than 120 days (Nelson and Ostrander 2014, 7). Even if the president were able to instantly appoint every prosecutor and immediately communicate all of his policy preferences to those prosecutors, the behavior of these prosecutors would still have a delayed effect on incarceration because federal criminal cases often last several months or longer. Therefore, I expect a shift in presidential preferences to have a lagged, rather than an immediate, effect on incarcerations. Accordingly, I include only the lagged, differenced value of Presidential Preferences, which is an acceptable approach in an ECM framework.15"
"37","Third, I conduct a mediation analysis via a structural equation model (SEM) within this ECM framework. SEMs are multivariate regression models used to confirm an a priori causal theory involving complex relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. A mediation analysis tests the direct effects of an explanatory variable on a dependent variable, as well as indirect effects via mediating variables (Baron and Kenny 1986; Sobel 1987). Mediation analysis does not resolve the problems of causal inference inherent in observational studies (Bullock, Green, and Ha 2010), nor does it resolve the inherent difficulties in identifying indirect effects (Imai et al. 2011). However, SEM mediation analyses provide a sophisticated approach to modeling measurement error (Bullock, Green, and Ha 2010, 552) and consistently perform better than other mediation approaches (Iacobucci, Saldanha, and Deng 2007).16 I employ the SEM to test my theory that macro criminal justice policy influences incarceration via several mediators.17"
"38","Next, I apply an instrumental variables (IV) approach to test the causal influence of Supreme Court Policy on incarceration. I use the retirement and death of Supreme Court justices as an instrument for Supreme Court Policy after controlling for previous appointments and the sitting president. I detail my IV approach and defend the exclusion restriction below."
"39","Lastly, I conduct Granger “causality” tests between macro policy, the mediators, and incarceration. Granger tests do not prove a causal relationship; however, the results suggest that the temporal ordering of changes in these variables fits with the causal narrative (Baumgartner and Jones 1993). Accordingly, Granger tests can reinforce causal inferences.            "
"40","I begin with a preliminary analysis testing the association between macro criminal justice policy and the incarceration rate. The results reported in Table 1 confirm my expectations. Punitive Supreme Court Policy and Congressional Policy have positive and significant long‐term effects on incarceration; shifts in Presidential Preferences also have a positive and significant lagged effect. These results are consistent with my theory that macro policy influences incarceration. Drug Use is also positively associated with long‐term shifts in incarceration; however, consistent with previous studies, Crime Rate is negatively associated with short‐term changes in new admissions.            "
"41","Macro policy appears to have a substantial effect on incarceration. A one standard deviation increase in Presidential Preferences is associated with a lagged increase of 90.27 in the incarceration rate. I use the long‐run multiplier (LRM) to calculate the total long‐term effect of Congressional Policy and Supreme Court Policy on incarceration. Figure 3 reports the LRM for each variable with a significant long‐term effect in Table 1, as well as the decay of these effects over time.18 As reported in Figure 3(a), a one standard deviation increase in punitive Supreme Court Policy is associated with a total long‐term increase of 583 new admissions to federal prison per 10 million people (i.e., more than a standard deviation shift in new admissions). A one standard deviation increase in punitive Congressional Policy is associated with a total long‐term increase of 354 new admissions per 10 million people. Based on the current U.S. population, these findings suggest that a typical increase in the punitiveness of both Supreme Court Policy and Congressional Policy is associated with an additional 29,412 new admissions over time.            "
"42","Long‐Term Effects of Macro Policy on Federal Incarceration"
"43","Note: Figure 3(a) reports the total long‐term effects of a one standard deviation increase in each explanatory variable on new admissions to federal prison. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Figure 3(b) reports the annual long‐term effects of a one standard deviation increase in each explanatory variable on new admissions to federal prison. Long‐run multipliers and confidence intervals were calculated using the Bewley transformation (De Boef and Keele 2008) based on the model in Table 1.                        "
"44","As illustrated in Figure 3(b), the effect of macro policy on incarceration appears to manifest itself rather slowly. The error correction rate of –0.15 in Table 1 indicates that 15% of the total long‐term effect of a shift in macro policy occurs at time , an additional 15% of the remaining effect takes place at time , and so on until the total long‐term effect has been distributed. Accordingly, it takes 10 years for 80% of the total effect of policy in a particular year to be realized in the incarceration rate. This delay suggests that macro policy does not directly affect incarceration; instead, policy implementation is most likely mediated through complicated political processes as the influence of policy spreads through the criminal justice system.            "
"45","Next, I fit a structural equation model within an error correction framework to evaluate the causal paths between macro policy and incarceration. I then calculate direct and indirect effects based on this SEM.19 Table 2 reports the direct and indirect effects with 95% bootstrapped percentile confidence intervals (Sobel 1982).20 The first three columns report the direct effects of macro policy on three variables that may mediate the relationship between policy and incarceration: Case Filings, Convictions, and Plea Bargaining.            "
"46","These results generally confirm my theoretical expectations. Punitive Congressional Policy and Supreme Court Policy have positive long‐term effects on Case Filings; the effect of Congressional Policy is statistically significant, and the effect of Supreme Court Policy approaches conventional significance levels. Additionally, changes in punitive Presidential Preferences have a positive and significant lagged effect on Case Filings. These results suggest that all three branches of the federal government influence the behavior of federal prosecutors when deciding whether or not to file criminal charges. Additionally, punitive Supreme Court Policy is positively and significantly associated with long‐term increases in Convictions and Plea Bargaining. These findings are consistent with my expectation that Supreme Court Policy shapes decision making by district court judges and the anticipated prospects of prosecutors and defendants when making plea decisions."
"47","Also consistent with my expectations, the long‐term effects of macro policy manifest themselves much more quickly in these models: 80% of the total effect on the mediators is realized in less than 4 years. In other words, the association between macro policy and these potential mediators manifests itself more quickly than does the association between macro policy and incarceration. This temporal pattern suggests that Case Filings, Convictions, and Plea Bargaining may mediate the link between macro policy and incarceration because the relationship between policy and the mediators appears more quickly than the relationship between policy and incarceration."
"48","The fourth column in Table 2 reports the direct effects of macro policy and the mediators on changes in new admissions to federal prison. As expected, both Case Filings and Convictions have positive short‐ and long‐term effects on changes in incarceration; the short‐term effects are statistically significant, and the long‐term effects approach or reach conventional significance levels. The short‐ and long‐term effects of Plea Bargaining on incarceration are both positive, but not statistically significant. The error correction rate in the fourth column indicates that, in addition to the short‐term effects, the long‐term effects manifest themselves more quickly than the effects of macro policy on incarceration. Almost 80% of the total long‐run effects of these variables on new admissions is realized in 4 years. This temporal pattern suggests that Case Filings, Convictions, and possibly Plea Bargaining are more proximate drivers of incarceration than macro policy.            "
"49","The fifth column in Table 2 reports the indirect effects of the explanatory variables on changes in new admissions. Consistent with expectations, Supreme Court and Congressional Policy have positive long‐term indirect effects on incarceration. The indirect effect of Supreme Court Policy is statistically significant, and the indirect effect of Congressional Policy nears statistical significance. The indirect effects of Presidential Preferences are positive, but not statistically significant. These results support my causal narrative: U.S. macro policy is associated with long‐term increases in incarceration, and this relationship is likely mediated by the behavior of federal prosecutors and district court judges.            "
"50","Skeptical readers may doubt the causal influence of macro policy because policy is conceivably related to other unobserved determinants of the mediators or incarceration. For example, policy and incarceration may both respond to social or political trends that are difficult to observe or measure. In order to partially alleviate these concerns, I repeat the SEM analysis, this time employing an instrumental variable (IV) in place of Supreme Court Policy. An IV analysis replaces a problematic independent variable with a proxy variable (or an instrument) that is uncontaminated by unobserved factors that may affect the outcome (Sovey and Green 2011, 188). I propose the ideology of justices departing from the U.S. Supreme Court as a viable instrument for the Court's policy. I calculate Departure Liberalism by summing the standardized Segal‐Cover (1989) scores of the justices who died or retired in the previous year.            "
"51","A valid instrument must satisfy two criteria. First, it must be associated with the variable it replaces. This criterion is empirically testable. As I demonstrate in the supporting information, Departure Liberalism is positively associated with conservative shifts in Supreme Court Policy. Second, a viable instrument must influence the dependent variable solely through the independent variable it replaces after controlling for covariates. This criterion is not empirically testable and, instead, must be defended theoretically. To defend this criterion, I assume that Departure Liberalism is driven by three factors: (1) the timing of appointments to the Court (and all of the factors associated with those appointments), (2) the strategic calculations of justices choosing to retire, and (3) idiosyncrasies of the individual justices (see Stolzenberg and Lindgren 2010).            "
"52","First, the ideology of justices departing from the bench is obviously associated with the factors that led to their initial appointment, including the ideology of the president and Senate at the time, the pool of viable appointees, and the public's ideology. I account for the timing of initial appointments by controlling for the Segal‐Cover scores of appointed justices (Appointment Liberalism). I lag this variable 18 years, the average length of a justice's tenure. If every justice served for the same length of time, Appointment Liberalism would be perfectly correlated with Departure Liberalism; therefore, by including this control, I capture only the variation away from mean length of tenure—that is, only factors related to the justices' departure after their initial appointment.            "
"53","Second, justices may strategically calculate the timing of their retirement in order to influence the selection of their successor. Consistent with this theory, justices are less likely to retire and more likely to die in office when the sitting president is of the opposite party as the president who nominated the justice to the Court (Stolzenberg and Lindgren 2010). Therefore, I control for the justices' strategic calculations with a lagged indicator for Presidential Preferences.21"
"54","Third, a justice's decision to retire is undoubtedly influenced by a range of personal, idiosyncratic factors, including the justice's life span, health, pension eligibility, and suitableness for the position (Stolzenberg and Lindgren 2010). All of these factors should be unrelated to broader political trends; in other words, if these idiosyncrasies influence the incarceration rate, it should only be through their influence on judicial departures and subsequent shifts in Supreme Court Policy.            "
"55","Accordingly, I fit the SEM again, this time employing a two‐stage least‐squares IV approach. In the first stage, I regress changes in Supreme Court Policy on Departure Liberalism, Appointment Liberalism lagged 18 years, lagged Presidential Preferences, and all of the covariates in the previous SEM. I use the predicted values from the first‐stage regression as my instrument for changes in Supreme Court Policy. I calculate the predicted level of Supreme Court Policy by accumulating the predicted changes over time. I use the lag of this value as the instrument for lagged Supreme Court Policy. Table 3 reports the direct and indirect effects of macro policy based on the SEM with 95% bootstrapped percentile confidence intervals, this time using Departure Liberalism as an instrument for Supreme Court Policy.22 Consistent with my expectations, the instrument for Supreme Court Policy has significant, long‐term, direct effects on Convictions and Plea Bargaining, as well as significant, long‐term, indirect effects on incarceration. Stated another way, after controlling for the ideology of justices appointed to the Court and the preferences of the sitting president, the ideology of justices departing the Court is associated with changes in the incarceration rate.            "
"56","Lastly, I conduct Granger “causality” tests to evaluate whether the timing of shifts in macro policy, the mediators, and incarceration fits my causal narrative.23 The rationale behind Granger tests is straightforward: If a predictor variable causes changes in a dependent variable, then changes in the predictor should precede changes in the dependent variable. Table 4 reports the results of the Granger tests. Granger p‐values indicate the probability that the predictor does not “Granger cause” the dependent variable; low Granger p‐values suggest Granger “causality.” The reverse p‐values indicate the probability that the dependent variable does not “Granger cause” the predictor; low reverse p‐values suggest the possibility of reverse causation. I mark the test results as indicating Granger “causality” if the predictor “Granger causes” the dependent variable and there is no evidence of reverse causality.            "
"57","Consistent with my expectations, both Supreme Court Policy and Congressional Policy “Granger cause” the incarceration rate. Additionally, Supreme Court Policy “Granger causes” Case Filings and Convictions, and Convictions “Granger cause” the incarceration rate. However, I cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality between Supreme Court Policy and Plea Bargaining, Congressional Policy and Case Filings, Case Filings and the incarceration rate, or Plea Bargaining and the incarceration rate. Accordingly, the results of the Granger tests are consistent with my theory that the conviction rate mediates the causal influence of Supreme Court Policy on incarceration. However, the Granger tests provide only mixed support for the other possible causal paths."
"58","This study tested the effects of macro policy on bureaucratic outputs. As described, my approach offers several important advantages. First, I examine the simultaneous influence of policymaking by the Supreme Court, Congress, and the president. Second, I utilize original measures of cumulative, aggregate Supreme Court and congressional policy to capture the state of macro policy over time. Third, I test the effects of macro policy on an important and comprehensive policy output: the rate of new admissions to federal prison. Finally, I employ a variety of methodological techniques to test the influence of macro policy on incarceration via three potential mediators: cases filed by federal prosecutors, conviction rates in district courts, and plea bargaining practices."
"59","I find that macro criminal justice policy is associated with long‐term changes in new admissions to federal prison: As macro policy becomes more punitive, the incarceration rate increases. The results strongly support my hypothesis that the criminal justice policies adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court have a causal influence on incarceration. Supreme Court Policy appears to have significant indirect effects on incarceration via Convictions and Plea Bargaining, and the results of the instrumental variables model suggest that these relationships are not driven by omitted variables, measurement error, or reverse causation. Additionally, the conviction rate appears to directly affect new admissions. The Granger “causality” tests further reinforce this conclusion: Supreme Court Policy “Granger causes” Convictions, and Convictions “Granger cause” new admissions."
"60","Evidence for congressional influence is more tentative. Congressional Policy is associated with and “Granger causes” shifts in the incarceration rate. More specifically, Congressional Policy appears to indirectly influence incarceration via Case Filings by prosecutors, and Case Filings appear to influence incarceration. However, a valid instrument for Congressional Policy is not readily available, preventing an IV analysis, and the Granger tests do not support my hypothesis that Congressional Policy influences Case Filings or that Case Filings influence new admissions."
"61","Nonetheless, these findings generally support my theoretical expectations. The results suggest that macro criminal justice policy substantially influences incarceration. Additionally, the influence of macro policy appears to be mediated through the behavior of policy implementers working in political hierarchies—specifically, federal prosecutors and district court judges. The behavior of policy implementers appears to be the critical link between macro policy and bureaucratic outputs. In the case of incarceration, the influence of Supreme Court rulings on the conviction rate in federal district courts appears to be the primary mechanism for policy implementation."
"62","Democracy is often conceptualized as the representation of popular interests in public policy; however, representation is only one step in a long and complicated process. A democratic system requires not only representation, but also policy implementation. With successful implementation, the democratic process comes full circle: Public opinion broadly shapes macro policy (e.g., Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002), and macro policy yields the intended bureaucratic outputs. Without successful implementation, representation alone cannot yield democratic outcomes.         "
"63","I find that the translation of policy into action appears to function fairly well in the criminal justice context. U.S. macro criminal justice policy tends to shape long‐term trends in bureaucratic outputs. However, my findings are limited to the context of federal incarceration. Macro implementation may function particularly well in this context due to its high degree of salience among policy makers and the public. Additionally, several institutional features distinguish criminal justice from other policy processes (e.g., the direct involvement of policy makers and bureaucrats from multiple branches of government). Consequently, my findings should be interpreted with caution; macro implementation may be substantially more dysfunctional in other issue domains."
"64","My findings reinforce prominent theories of policy implementation. Policy makers appear to possess at least three mechanisms through which they can influence bureaucratic behavior and, in doing so, affect bureaucratic outputs. First, policy makers at the top of political hierarchies can influence behavior by signaling policy goals to their agents. Second, policy makers can alter the implementation machinery in order to incentivize and facilitate compliance. And third, policy makers can promote their policy goals by appointing like‐minded bureaucratic agents. My findings suggest these mechanisms successfully promote macro implementation in the criminal justice system."
"65","My findings paint an encouraging picture of the democratic process; however, the patterns of macro implementation also raise some difficult normative questions. First, I find that Supreme Court policy influences incarceration, but the evidence for congressional influence is mixed. Convincing evidence of congressional influence would strengthen the democratic narrative because members of Congress are electorally accountable. Although the Court may generally follow public opinion (McGuire and Stimson 2004), it does not do so in criminal cases (Hall 2014). Consequently, the Court's influence on incarceration may not reflect popular preferences. Second, my results depict macro implementation as a slow and imperfect process. The full effects of macro policy do not manifest themselves in the incarceration rate for more than a decade after enactment, during which time public opinion may well have shifted in a new direction. Third, my findings support Michael Lipsky's argument that “policy implementation in the end comes down to the people who actually implement it” (2010, xii). In the realm of criminal justice, policy implementation depends on compliance from federal prosecutors and district court judges. When implementers enjoy relative independence from policy makers (as federal judges do from Congress and the president), policy has little or no effect on bureaucratic outputs.         "
"66","Finally, the imperfections in policy implementation may suggest broader deficiencies in the democratic process. Bureaucratic outputs in some policy areas may be primarily driven by unaccountable policy makers or street‐level bureaucrats rather than popular public policies. If so, representation studies that focus on the translation of preferences into policy may overlook the critical subsequent steps in the life of public policy. Only by exploring the dynamics of macro implementation can we fully understand and evaluate the democratic process."
