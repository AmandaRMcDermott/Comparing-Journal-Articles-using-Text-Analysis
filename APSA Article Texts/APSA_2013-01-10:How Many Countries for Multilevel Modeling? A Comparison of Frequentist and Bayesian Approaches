"1","I start by describing the basic types of multilevel models used in applied research and outlining key differences between the dominant frequentist paradigm and Bayesian approaches. Accessible introductions to multilevel modeling are given by Rabe‐Hesketh and Skrondal (2008) and Gelman and Hill (2007). More thorough introductions are given by Snijders and Bosker (1999) and Goldstein (2010) in a frequentist framework and by Gill (2008, chap. 10), Jackman (2009, chap. 7), and Draper (2008) in a Bayesian framework. In‐depth treatments covering a broader variety of estimation strategies are available from McCulloch and Searle (2001) and Jiang (2007).         "
"2","Table 1 lists multilevel specifications for continuous and binary dependent variables that are considered in this article.3 The most basic model (types I and II) tries to capture systematic differences between countries by including country random effects. This model is often termed “random intercept model,” since it can be understood as providing country‐specific intercepts, while all other effects are constant across countries (for a graphical illustration, see Gelman and Hill 2007, 238). These unexplained differences between countries often are central objects of study in applied comparative research. For example, a researcher might be interested in testing whether individual preferences for income redistribution differ between countries as a function of welfare policies. Then, the random intercept model is extended by including country‐level variables, such as measures of institutional features or income inequality, in order to explain variation in the dependent variable that is not captured by characteristics of individuals (model types III and IV).         "
"3","Somewhat more formally, one models the response of individual i () living in country j () as a function of individual and macrolevel variables, xij and zj, respectively:            "
"4","Here  captures the individual‐level effect of covariate xij, and  are country‐specific intercepts, which are assumed to follow a normal distribution with freely estimated variance . Since the goal here is to explain variation in country‐specific intercepts, they are modeled by a regression equation including country characteristics. An overall intercept  represents the “country‐averaged level” or grand mean of the dependent variable, and the systematic effect of country characteristic zj is captured by .         "
"5","To reduce notational complexity, equation 1 refers to both continuous and binary dependent variables. With continuous outcomes, this yields a standard linear model with freely estimated individual‐level variance . For binary dependent variables, this is a probit model, where  is a latent variable which generates observed categorical responses, such that one observes y=1 if  and 0 otherwise. Here the individual‐level variance has to be fixed at some value, usually .4"
"6","More sophisticated comparative theories often include hypotheses which specify that the effect of an individual‐level variable varies as a function of country‐level characteristics (types V and VI). For example, a researcher might want to test whether the relationship between income and left‐right self‐placement is stronger in countries characterized by high levels of income inequality. In this setup, often termed “cross‐level interaction” (Snijders and Bosker 2012, 81), intercept and covariate effects vary over countries, and one tries to explain (some of) the covariate's effect variation by an explanatory country‐level variable:            "
"7","The key addition in equation 3 is the country subscript of  signifying that covariate xij has a different slope in different countries. These different slopes are now, too, modeled by a regression equation. The country‐average effect is captured by , and systematic differences in slopes between countries are predicted by country characteristic zj and its associated effect coefficient . As before, systematic variation in the level of the dependent variable is explained by a macrolevel covariate zj with coefficient . The fact that intercept and slope vary over countries leads to a more complex variance structure: one generally assumes that intercept and slope come from a common multivariate normal distribution, with variance covariance matrix .5 Thus, with one intercept and one random slope, there are now three variance parameters to estimate: variances of intercept () and slope (), and the covariance between intercept and slope ():            "
"8","However, are multilevel models even applicable to political science problems? What does it mean to test the “significance” of country‐level effects? Many authors take a strong sampling‐based perspective (e.g., Snijders and Bosker 2012), where multilevel models are applicable when groups are sampled from a larger population.6 This works well in fields such as educational research, where researchers design studies sampling schools and pupils. Comparative (political) research is markedly different. Most data sets do not contain a random sample of countries but have a rather strong regional focus (e.g., Eurobarometer, Latinobarometer). Furthermore, a random sample from the population of all countries is often not even desirable, since middle‐range theories are limited in their applicability to, say, advanced industrialized countries.            "
"9","It is well known that, using the maximum likelihood estimate  and its associated standard error , the frequentist confidence interval is constructed by , where q is the appropriate quantile from the normal sampling distribution. In contrast, Bayesian confidence intervals (called “credible intervals”) can be constructed without reference to a hypothetical sampling distribution (Jaynes 1976). As the full posterior probability distribution of a parameter is available, credible intervals are simply the corresponding quantiles of that distribution (Gill 2008, 45).7 Thus, a Bayesian credible interval simply gives the posterior (i.e., after looking at the data) probability that the coefficient lies in that interval—without any reference to a population of countries.8"
"10","When employing a Bayesian approach, prior distributions are needed for all parameters, which, multiplied with the data likelihood, yield the full posterior distribution. For a graphical illustration of the role of priors in Bayesian analysis, see Jackman (2009, 15–17).9 Many applied researchers prefer those priors to be noninformative; in other words, they should exert as little influence on the resulting posterior distribution as possible.10 Therefore, I consider commonly employed, noninformative or vague prior distributions in my simulations.               "
"11","More sophisticated priors have been proposed (Gelman 2006; Natarajan and Kass 2000); however, I employ specifications which are commonly used by researchers (e.g., Gelman and Hill 2007; Spiegelhalter et al. 1997).            "
"12","For this Monte Carlo study, I focus on quantities that are usually at the center of comparative researchers’ interest: effect estimates and uncertainties of individual and country‐level variables. I use a setup which mimics data structures commonly found in comparative (survey) research and which differs starkly from those found in educational research: large numbers (usually thousands) of individuals nested within a small number of countries (often fewer than 20). While systematic differences exist between individuals from different countries, individuals vary on a number of (often unobserved) factors so that the ratio of between to overall country heterogeneity, the intraclass correlation, is rather low.11"
"13","For each of the six multilevel model types, I use a full factorial  design. The following factors are varied:               "
"14","For each of those 756 conditions (126 experimental conditions for six types of multilevel models), I generated 1,000 data sets and calculated estimates and confidence intervals using maximum likelihood and fully Bayesian estimation. More specifically, likelihood estimation is carried out using a standard EM algorithm (McLachlan and Krishnan 2008), and the integration needed in the probit model is done numerically via adaptive Gauss‐Hermite quadrature using 15 points (Pinheiro and Bates 1995; Rabe‐Hesketh, Skrondal, and Pickles 2002).12 I use a Gibbs sampler for the Bayesian model implementations (Gelfand and Smith 1990; Gelman et al. 2004, chap. 11), running two chains for 4,000 iterations, and compute posterior mean, median, and mode as “point estimates” summarizing the posterior distribution.13"
"15","I concentrate on two central quantities summarizing the Monte Carlo simulations, which are of primary importance for applied research: bias of estimates and noncoverage of confidence intervals. First, in order to assess the bias of point estimates, I calculate the percent relative bias, which is simply the difference between estimated and true value expressed as a proportion of the true value:               "
"16","To reduce the number of graphs and the complexity of the presentation, I do not display results for simple linear and probit random effect models not containing a country‐level explanatory variable (types I and II). Results for those model types are similar to those from models including a macro predictor (types III and IV).15 Below, I focus on models with an intraclass correlation of 0.10 and use the mean as posterior summary for Bayesian models,16 since results show that both choice of ICC and posterior summary measure do not substantially influence the central conclusions of this study. More detailed versions of these plots including posterior mean, mode, and median are available in the online appendix. The following subsection documents bias in individual‐ and country‐level covariate effects for different estimation strategies in linear and probit random effects models (types III and IV). Models with random coefficients (or random slopes, types V and VI) are discussed next. Finally, I discuss the role of intraclass correlation and different variance prior choices in the last two subsections.         "
"17","Before examining estimates of substantive variables, I turn to results for the residuals, , and random effects, . In all model types, individual‐level residuals are estimated well by both the frequentist and Bayesian approaches, which is to be expected given the large number of individuals. The situation looks less rosy for the estimated random effect variance, where both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates exhibit strong bias (the Bayesian posterior mean estimate bias is more than 100% when only five countries are available). Contrarily, the 95% interval coverage of the Bayesian estimator is excellent independent of the number of countries used. Maximum likelihood results show greater noncoverage even when 30 countries are available (similar results are presented by Browne and Draper 2000; Kreft and de Leeuw 1998; Maas and Hox, 2004a). For a much more extensive simulation study of variance component estimation, see Browne and Draper (2006).17"
"18","While unbiased estimation of variance components is certainly important, most applied researchers are arguably most interested in the quality of estimates of their theoretical variables. Therefore, I now examine the extent of bias in estimates of individual‐ and country‐level covariates. Figure 1 shows how well the effect  of an individual‐level covariate xij is estimated, both in linear (upper panel) and probit (lower panel) hierarchical models. For linear and binary dependent variables, both estimation methods produce quite reliable coefficient estimates, even when using only five countries. Similarly, the coverage level of the 95% intervals is very close (within 2%) to the nominal 95% level. In practice, this means that for the models considered here, which contain large numbers of individuals, individual‐level estimates are robust to small country‐level sample sizes (cf. Maas and Hox 2005).            "
"19","However, the main interest in multilevel models with macro variables lies in testing effects of country‐level characteristics on individual‐level outcomes. Therefore, Figure 2 displays the relative bias of effect estimates  of a macro variable zj; and here we see that estimation strategy matters quite a bit for substantial results. At any number of countries used, Bayesian estimates are within  5 % of the true population value. In contrast, maximum likelihood estimates are sharply biased upward when the number of countries is fewer than 20 in a hierarchical linear model. Matters get worse when examining actual versus nominal coverage of 95% intervals: when fewer than 15 countries are used, maximum likelihood confidence intervals are 5 to 15 percentage points too narrow, while Bayesian credible intervals are virtually congruent with their nominal level.            "
"20","In this subsection, I consider random coefficient or slope models, which specify the effect of a covariate as varying between countries. As discussed above, there are three central parameters of interest: the effect of a country‐level variable on the outcome, denoted ; the average effect  of an individual‐level covariate that varies over countries; and the effect of country‐level variables on that varying variable, .            "
"21","Estimates of  are displayed in Figure 3. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian point estimates are biased when very small samples are used but display good properties as sample size grows. The coverage of estimated 95% intervals looks much more damaging. In contrast to simpler models (cf. Figure 2), Bayesian credible intervals for  differ from their nominal level, even when larger numbers of countries are available. Compared to Bayesian credible intervals, the extent of noncoverage is larger for maximum likelihood confidence intervals. However, the most striking difference between both approaches lies in the direction of noncoverage. Bayesian intervals are too wide and consequently provide overly conservative tests of hypotheses, whereas maximum likelihood intervals underestimate uncertainty of the effect of  and will provide hypothesis tests that are much more lenient than indicated by their nominal level.            "
"22","Figure 4 shows bias and noncoverage results for , which represents the country‐average effect of an individual‐level covariate.18 Results show that this coefficient is estimated reasonably well by Bayesian as well as maximum likelihood procedures — with ML estimates exhibiting somewhat more bias when country‐level sample sizes are small. This picture looks less favorable for the classical approach when considering actual coverage of confidence bounds. Both Bayesian credible intervals and ML‐based confidence intervals get close to their nominal level as sample size gets larger, but when fewer than 15 countries are used, coverage of maximum likelihood confidence intervals is again strongly anticonservative.            "
"23","Finally, I examine parameter , which is of primary interest in random coefficient models: it estimates how a country‐level variable zj influences the strength of the relationship between changes in xij and the dependent variable, often denoted “cross‐level interaction effect.” Values of this coefficient are influenced by estimates of variance components  and again differ sharply between maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Figure 5 shows that the relative bias in estimates is most substantial when maximum likelihood estimation is used with a small number of countries (fewer than 15). In hierarchical linear models, this leads to an underestimation of the true effect by 10 to 15%, while the converse is true for hierarchical probit models. Bayesian point estimates produce less bias for small numbers of countries and are virtually identical with ML estimates when 25 or 30 countries are available. Considering the actual coverage of nominal 95% intervals, the now familiar picture emerges: Bayesian credible intervals are too wide, i.e., they provide more conservative tests of hypotheses, while ML confidence intervals are too short, providing tests that are potentially very misleading, even at medium sample sizes.            "
"24","Previous results were based on an average intraclass correlation value of 0.10, since my results show that it is of minor importance for the kind of model setups considered here. The pattern among the different estimators, established above, is similar at different ICC levels. If anything, higher ICC levels yield biases that are slightly more pronounced—thus making the gap between Bayesian and ML estimators even wider. An instance where an ICC effect is discernible is displayed in Figure 6, which shows relative bias in estimates at different ICC levels in a hierarchical probit model of type VI. When high correlations between unobserved characteristics of individuals from the same country exist, Bayesian as well as maximum likelihood procedures produce slightly larger bias when the number of countries is very small. With increasings numbers of countries, this effect vanishes, with the Bayesian posterior mean getting closer to the true population value at a slightly faster rate than maximum likelihood estimates.            "
"25","The previous discussion ignored the role of priors for the variance components in Bayesian analyses. Results presented used inverse gamma priors with small values for shape and scale, which showed to yield reasonable results in my simulations, despite their technical shortcomings (Gelman 2006). The difference between prior choices is illustrated in Figure 7, which shows interval coverage for country‐level covariate effects  in a hierarchical linear model under different prior specifications. The slight differences between inverse gamma and uniform on the standard deviation priors vanish as more information becomes available. This pattern is similar for other coefficient estimates in both linear and probit models. When inverse Wishart priors are used as priors for variance‐covariance matrices, I find similar results: differences in prior values are only relevant when little country‐level information is available. This suggests that applied researchers who have to work with small samples should test the robustness of their findings by estimating several models using varying prior values (cf. Gill 2008, 204f.).19"
"26","To illustrate the behavior of different estimators in a practical setting, I continue the example of Steenbergen and Jones's (2002) introductory article. They model citizen support for the European Union (see also Hooghe and Marks 2004) as a function of individual, party, and country characteristics. To that end, they employ a three‐level model with a continuous dependent variable (our type III) where individuals are nested in parties and countries. To stay in line with the setup of this article, and to keep this example simple, I will focus on individual‐ and country‐level factors. Using the Eurobarometer 46.0 survey fielded in September and October 1996, I find that—as expected from my Monte Carlo study results—maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates agree with each other as far as individual‐level effects are concerned.20 What I will focus on here is the effect of country‐level variables.         "
"27","Suppose a researcher is interested in testing the claim that, as dependence between EU countries increases, citizens realize the importance of the common market, which leads to higher popular support for the European Union (Eichenberg and Dalton 1993). Following Steenbergen and Jones (2002), this dependence is measured using a country's trade balance—the ratio of a country's intra‐EU trade to its total trade. I also include a country's tenure, i.e., the number of years a country has been a member of the union, in order to capture the effect that public opinion in new member states is often negative (Steenbergen and Jones 2002, 228). Furthermore, since countries differ widely in their level of economic development and economic performance, I include their gross domestic product per capita and rate of inflation (see Mahler, Taylor, and Wozniak 2000 for more detailed analyses). All macro variables are standardized, i.e., centered around the overall mean and divided by their standard deviation.21"
"28","Figure 8 plots estimates and confidence intervals for our macro variables of interest.22 We see the now familiar “overconfident” confidence intervals produced by maximum likelihood estimation when the number of countries is small. While parameter estimates of macro effects produced by both estimation strategies are virtually identical, maximum likelihood's 95% confidence intervals are considerably shorter than those obtained when following a fully Bayesian approach. With respect to our main variable of interest, trade balance, two researchers could arrive at two different theoretical conclusions simply by using different estimation strategies. A researcher relying on maximum likelihood estimation might confidently conclude he or she has demonstrated the link between trade dependence and public opinion. Contrarily, a researcher relying on Bayesian estimation would have to conclude that such an effect cannot be unambiguously demonstrated with the data at hand. Clearly, even if one is only interested in substantive questions when applying multilevel models to comparative data, attention should be paid to the implications of maximum likelihood versus Bayesian inference.         "
"29","In this Monte Carlo study, I examined the effects of using a small number of countries in multilevel models. I used an extensive design, covering both linear and nonlinear models estimated via maximum likelihood in a classical framework and via MCMC sampling in a Bayesian framework, different posterior summaries, different prior choices, and different levels of intraclass correlation."
"30","Results are rather sobering from a classical maximum likelihood perspective. The simulations confirm, once more, the literature on problems with maximum likelihood inference for multilevel models when the number of groups is small—a problem that arises when the log‐likelihood is not close to being a quadratic function of the parameters. Simple linear or probit models containing only a random intercept are the best‐case scenario. Here ML estimates and confidence interval coverage of estimated macro effects are only biased to a limited extent, as long as more than 15 or 20 countries are available. But even in this optimal setting, using fewer countries quickly leads to confidence intervals that are far from their declared level. While confidence interval noncoverage is undesirable in itself, it is the direction of this bias which is cause for concern. Without exception, ML produces confidence intervals that are too short, so that hypothesis tests are anticonservative."
"31","Many comparative theories build on interactions between effects of individual‐level variables and country‐level characteristics, the so‐called “cross‐level interactions.” Here, the problems of ML estimation are most apparent. Even in their most simple specification (as employed in this simulation study), those models include three variance parameters: intercept and slope variance and the covariance between them. Their estimation is difficult even with 20 or more countries. ML estimates of cross‐level interactions tend to be biased upward in probit models, whereas the opposite occurs for linear models. More problematic is, again, the fact that actual and nominal confidence interval levels do not match: ML confidence intervals are invariably too short. Furthermore, in these more complicated models, testing the effect of a country‐level covariate on the dependent variable is problematic as well. Estimated with 15 or 20 available countries, ML confidence intervals are almost 5% too short—in other words, researchers are more likely to obtain 90% confidence intervals rather than the 95% intervals announced by their software package.23"
"32","In contrast, estimates obtained using a Bayesian approach show far better properties, especially with respect to confidence interval coverage. When using only a small number of countries (<10), Bayesian point estimates are biased as well. But the magnitude of this bias is much smaller as in the case of ML estimates: under conditions considered in this study, Bayesian point estimates were biased at most 5%, whereas ML estimates reached 10 or 15%. The clearest advantage of employing a Bayesian approach to multilevel modeling lies in its excellent confidence interval coverage. Bayesian credible intervals are closer to their nominal level than their ML counterparts. What is more, when they are biased, they usually are too long. Thus, one could claim that researchers using Bayesian multilevel models put their hypotheses to more rigid tests than their colleagues relying on ML estimates! However, there is no magic bullet. A small number of countries combined with complex models can present problems for the Bayesian approach as well. This is evident in complex cross‐level interaction models, where the credible interval for this interaction effect is consistently too large, even with 20 or more countries."
"33","This point is worth repeating. As already discussed above, estimation of models with just one cross‐level interaction can already prove to be difficult. For practical applications, this means that researchers should be cautious when fitting complex models with a large number of macro‐micro interactions. Researchers might be tempted to include many such cross‐level interactions to specify flexible models where “everything depends on context.” A seemingly simple strategy then starts from a specification with many interactions and removes those with “nonsignificant” variances one‐by‐one. My results strongly suggest that this is doomed to fail: confidence intervals of cross‐level interactions will likely be severely biased and theoretical conclusions drawn from such a procedure are not particularly trustworthy. This suggests that analyses using many cross‐level interactions with a limited set of countries should be met with a healthy dose of skepticism."
"34","Despite these reservations, my results show that the integration of micro‐ and macrodata is a worthwhile enterprise—provided one's tools are chosen wisely. Thus, for researchers in comparative politics (and adjacent “comparative” fields) who are interested in multilevel analyses, turning to a Bayesian approach might be a fruitful choice."
