"1","The first theoretical perspective we consider is what we refer to as “distributive universalism.” Many empirical studies have noted the tendency in the U.S. Congress to structure legislation to appeal to universalistic coalitions (see Collie 1988; Shepsle and Weingast 1981 for a long list of citations).5Weingast (1979) develops a formal model to explain this phenomenon, focusing on how uncertainty about who will be included in a coalition (and thus obtain distributive benefits from legislation) leads legislators to build maximal coalitions. Weingast (1979, 252) claims that legislators adopt rules to “institutionalize and maintain a tradition of unanimous coalitions” because it serves their reelection and other interests. The Senate's lack of a cloture rule could be viewed as a way of institutionalizing universalism. Without a cloture rule, if one senator or a small group of senators opposed ending debate on a bill then technically they could have prevented it from being terminated and therefore prevented the passage of the legislation.6"
"2","This matches one common understanding of how the Senate operated prior to 1917. Burdette (1940, 52, 69, 78–79) discusses several cases in the pre‐cloture period where he claims a single senator defeated legislation. In making his case for the adoption of a cloture rule in 1917, Woodrow Wilson argued that “The Senate has no rules by which debate can be limited or brought to an end, no rules by which dilatory tactics can be prevented. A single member can stand in the way of action, if he have but the physical endurance,” adding that “the Senate cannot act unless its leaders can obtain unanimous consent” (New York Times, March 5, 1917, p. 1). Historian Herman Von Holst (1893, 264) likened the rules permitting filibusters to the liberum veto of the Polish parliament, which gave any single deputy the power to veto resolutions. A testable hypothesis based on this view is that unanimous or near unanimous coalitions would have been the empirical regularity in the pre‐cloture period.7 Although our empirical focus in this article is on the pre‐cloture Senate, the distributive universalism perspective would lead one to expect unanimous or near‐unanimous coalitions after 1917 as well.8"
"3","There are reasons to doubt that universalism was enforced by the absence of a cloture rule. Parliamentary rules would have required a single senator to hold the floor during the entire time a piece of legislation was being considered in order to maintain the obstruction. Unless the effort occurred at the very end of a congress, opponents of the obstruction could have kept the Senate in continual session, making it physically impossible for a lone senator to hold the floor long enough to prevent a vote on the targeted legislation (Rogers 1926, 172–73). For those cases where an allegedly one‐person filibuster was successful, there was probably more widespread support for the goals of the obstruction, although the visible effort was undertaken by one senator. A single senator was most likely successful at obstructing legislation because either there existed a sufficient number of less vocal or less active senators who were nonetheless in favor of the obstruction or the legislation was considered with almost no time left in the congress.         "
"4","The second theoretical perspective we consider is Krehbiel's pivotal politics approach, which places filibusters at the center of a model of lawmaking in the United States. The “filibuster pivot” is one of the key players that determine outcomes in Krehbiel's game‐theoretic model of the separation of powers system, because without the support of the filibuster pivot, cloture cannot be invoked and a final passage vote cannot occur. In the pivotal politics approach, a pivot is a formally defined, exogenously determined institutional feature. That is, a player is pivotal if under the explicit rules of the lawmaking game, his or her support is required for legislation to pass (Krehbiel 1998, 22). Krehbiel's analysis covers the period after the Senate adopted a cloture rule, thereby establishing the existence and location of the filibuster pivot.         "
"5","Given a strict, rules‐based interpretation, a filibuster pivot did not exist prior to the 1917 cloture reform.9 This gives rise to the theoretical conjecture that the only potentially pivotal players in the Senate then would be either the median or the veto pivot (i.e., the member of Congress whose vote is required to override a presidential veto). The rules and precedents of the Senate, as well as general parliamentary procedure, establish the median as a pivot, because a floor majority is a necessary condition for any motion to pass, while the Constitution defines the veto pivot. If this theoretical conjecture is correct for the pre‐cloture period, then the following hypothesis should hold: coalitions were typically just a bare majority of the chamber when the median senator was pivotal but coalitions were approximately two‐thirds of the chamber when the veto pivot was the key player.10 After 1917, a strict interpretation of the pivotal politics model predicts coalition sizes of two‐thirds, since the institution's rules now codified this hurdle for gaining a vote on passage.         "
"6","According to this theoretical perspective, lawmaking in the pre‐cloture Senate was majoritarian despite the lack of formal rules for cutting off debate. Simply put, since the chamber's rules required only a majority to adopt a motion, senators understood that in the end majorities would be sufficient to legislate. This is consistent with an alternative conventional wisdom about the Senate. For example, Binder and Smith (1997) claim that, at least until the end of the nineteenth century, minorities did not take full advantage of opportunities to obstruct, implying that the median member of the Senate would typically be decisive when it came to passing laws (see also Koger (2002), Mayhew (2003), and Oppenheimer (1985)).         "
"7","However, one challenge to this perspective that is immediately raised by the history of Senate reforms is that cloture by majority vote was never accepted when it was proposed (Binder 1997). The Senate refused, on several occasions, to make the median member the formal filibuster pivot. The position of the filibuster pivot that was officially established in 1917 was the 67th percentile. If narrow majorities were generally required to legislate before 1917, then the effect of the reform would have been to make it more difficult to close off debate and pass legislation. This would be somewhat surprising, given that reformers were at least ostensibly attempting to rein in filibusters when they adopted the cloture rule.         "
"8","We add an important theoretical refinement to the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot model that is rooted in the institutional features of the pre‐cloture Senate and can help explain the logic of cloture reform. The median voter is pivotal on initial passage in that model because, under the voting rule, a floor majority is sufficient for passage when a vote is held on legislation. But even though only a majority coalition would be necessary to pass the bill according to the voting rule, without a cloture provision that majority may be obstructed from reaching the voting stage. Based on prior case studies of nineteenth‐century filibusters, we conjecture that members understood that a determined majority would generally be able to apply the voting rule eventually, even in the face of obstruction. However, as Oppenheimer (1985) argues, this ability to sit out obstruction and eventually take a vote ran up against another institutional feature of the Senate: the automatic adjournment date in the lame duck session. In the pre‐cloture era, the date of March 3rd in odd‐numbered years constituted a fixed adjournment date, which brought about the death of any legislation not passed by that point.11"
"9","When adjournment loomed, it no longer could be assumed that the voting rule would eventually be applied. Instead, obtaining a vote on passage would have depended on the resources the obstructionists possessed to employ dilatory tactics to block action until adjournment. These resources would need to be sufficient to overcome the costs of engaging in obstruction given the time left in the session. The costs of obstructing include the actual physical burden of this behavior as well as forgone opportunities to engage in other beneficial activities.12 The costs themselves are institutionally rooted since rules and precedents defined what it would take to hold the floor to prevent the application of the voting rule. For example, the rules required senators to stand when they had the floor (which would be physically taxing), limited them to speaking twice on the same question in a legislative day, and forced them to give up the floor upon making certain motions. The amount of resources the obstructionists possessed would depend on how many of them there were. The larger their number, the more likely they could have occupied the floor for the amount of time required either to consume the time remaining in the congress or disrupt the legislative process enough to imperil other legislation that was important to the majority. As time constraints became severe at the very end of a congress, the costs of obstructing would be lower and thus the size of the coalition required to obstruct successfully would have decreased (cf. Binder, Lawrence, and Smith 2002; Oppenheimer 1985; Sala 2002).         "
"10","In the absence of an explicit cloture rule, it was uncertain how many obstructionists were sufficient to bear the costs of outlasting the majority's ability or tolerance to sit out the delay. Our refinement implies that coalitions seeking passage of legislation had to be larger toward the end of a congress, perhaps even reaching universalistic proportions as the amount of time left went to zero. That is, if there was only one day left before the adjournment date, it is conceivable that a single senator could have held the floor to prevent a vote on passage from occurring. Thus, the famous one‐person filibusters noted by historians need not imply that universal support was generally required to overcome obstruction. Instead, these likely were a consequence of the extreme time constraints at the end‐of‐congress deadline.13"
"11","Therefore, when applied to the pre‐cloture Senate, the pivotal politics framework suggests that bare majority coalitions would have been sufficient to pass legislation except when a veto threat was credible. Our refinement about time constraints and costs adds the prediction that the coalition size required to overcome obstruction likely was greater than a simple majority when time was running out before the automatic adjournment date. The refinement also suggests that senators would not have always needed to resort to invoking cloture to pass bills in the few decades after cloture reform because the costs to obstructionists at earlier points in a congress would have been too great.14 But the 1917 rule would have provided a recourse for dealing with end‐of‐congress obstruction. While our primary concern is understanding lawmaking in the pre‐cloture period, we point out where our empirical analysis allows inferences about post‐cloture lawmaking. In particular, our analysis of coalition sizes on major legislation and on the tariff each provide some potential insights into the post‐1917 period, and thus permits a more general test of our theoretical conjectures. We also offer a hypothesis and some preliminary evidence in the conclusion in favor of the view that the cloture rule was mainly about dealing with the problems caused by end of congress filibusters.         "
"12","One might go even further than our refinement and argue that the pivotal politics approach actually implies that universalism should be the empirical regularity in the pre‐cloture period, regardless of the specific time constraints imposed by the end of congress deadline. The basis for this argument is the claim that the absence of a cloture rule is equivalent to a requirement of universal agreement for legislation to be adopted. This “pivot‐based universalism” hypothesis rests on a more expansive definition of a pivot than that developed by Krehbiel. Instead of being rooted in the explicit, formal rules of the Senate, the pivot in this perspective would be rooted in the absence of a rule specifying how debate could be ended. The theoretical difficulty with such an approach is that defining a pivot in terms of what is not (i.e., in terms of the rules that do not exist) would open up an array of possible contradictory predictions that might be considered under the pivotal politics rubric. Any set of institutional rules has numerous “absences” or loopholes, and defining an institutional pivot in terms of rules that are lacking would in principle allow for any of these possibilities. This would significantly dilute the theoretical usefulness of the pivot concept by weakening its status as an explicitly defined institutional construct.15 Nonetheless, it is worth noting that such a pivot‐based universalism model would make the same predictions as the distributive universalism model for the pre‐cloture period, and therefore our empirical analysis gives us some leverage for assessing its validity, notwithstanding our qualms about its theoretical usefulness. As it turns out, our empirical evidence clearly contradicts the notion that universalistic coalitions were necessary in the pre‐cloture era.         "
"13","We can summarize the predictions of the various models as follows: distributive universalism leads one to expect unanimous or near‐unanimous coalitions before 1917. The refined median‐plus‐veto‐pivot model leads to the prediction of narrow majorities except when veto threats are credible or final adjournment looms. After 1917, the original pivotal politics model predicts that coalitions of two‐thirds would be the regularity, although our refinement implies that costs of filibustering can produce coalitions of less than two‐thirds. By contrast, distributive universalism expects oversized coalitions to persist after 1917. By testing the hypotheses derived from these alternative theoretical frameworks, we not only can resolve the empirical puzzle concerning how the Senate operated without a rule for ending debate, but we also can assess the applicability of the general pivotal politics approach—which Krehbiel (1998) applied to the specific context of the post‐World War II Senate—to alternative institutional settings and historical periods.16"
"14","The first way we test the competing theories discussed in the previous section is to examine coalition sizes on final passage votes. Krehbiel (1998, 83–84) notes that the pivotal politics model, when applied to the contemporary Senate in which a three‐fifths vote is required to invoke cloture, implies that coalitions enacting legislation will generally include at least 60% of the membership. Thus, the size of coalitions in the pre‐cloture era, especially when compared with coalition sizes after cloture reform, is informative as to which of the theories best describes reality.17"
"15","Since opponents may not find it worthwhile to obstruct minor legislation, we follow Krehbiel in examining coalition sizes on major laws. One issue is identifying major laws from the pre‐cloture era in such a way as to make our analysis comparable with Krehbiel's, which used Mayhew's (1991) dataset of landmark laws enacted from 1947 to 1994. Unfortunately, compiling a list of major laws is made difficult by changes in newspaper coverage and by the lack of such sources as Congressional Quarterly. We use as our primary data source a list of significant acts compiled by Petersen (2001), who has attempted to replicate Mayhew's methodology as closely as possible for the period 1881–1946.18 We are especially interested in comparing coalition sizes before and after the 65th Congress, which Petersen's list allows, in order to examine whether adoption of the cloture rule coincided with significant changes.         "
"16"," Table 1 reports results on coalition sizes for significant legislation.19 A first noteworthy observation is that the average coalition size in the 47th–64th Congresses (1881–1917) was smaller than in the 65th–79th (1917–1946): on average, 70.8% voted yea in the pre‐cloture era, while the average coalition size was 80.5% after adoption of the cloture rule. This comparison indicates that legislation in the pre‐cloture era certainly did not require unanimous coalitions and that the sizes of coalitions in many cases were smaller than what would have been required after the codification of the filibuster pivot in 1917.         "
"17","If we consider the percentage of bills that passed with supermajorities before and after cloture, we find strong evidence that an oversized majority was by no means necessary to adopt significant legislation in the pre‐cloture Senate. From the 47th through the 64th Congress (1881–1917), 48.4% of major laws were approved with fewer than two‐thirds voting yes and 20.3% were approved with fewer than three‐fifths voting in favor. By comparison, from the 65th through the 79th Congress (1917–1946), just 17.5% of bills were adopted with fewer than two‐thirds voting yea, and an even more paltry 8.3% were adopted with less than three‐fifths in favor.20 Thus, consistent with the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot hypothesis, many bills passed with narrow majorities in the pre‐cloture Senate. While a fair number of bills passed with fewer than two‐thirds in 1917–46 as well, which is consistent with our refinement concerning costs of obstruction, it was more common for coalitions to exceed the threshold established by the 1917 cloture rule.21"
"18","There also is a tendency in the pre‐cloture period for there to be fewer close votes on bills passed late in a congress (which we define as the last thirty days before final adjournment), than those passed earlier in the congress. Only 33.3% of major laws passed late in a congress prior to 1917 were approved with less than two‐thirds support, as compared to 50% of bills passed earlier in pre‐1917 congresses. This comparison implies that timing constraints late in a congress did force legislative entrepreneurs to build bigger coalitions, although unanimity or near unanimity was still not generally required. By contrast, after 1917, there is essentially no difference in the share of close votes for bills passed early and late in a congress."
"19","To sum up the results, oversized coalitions were less prevalent on major legislation in the pre‐cloture period.22 The relatively small average coalition size prior to 1917 is especially noteworthy given that coalitions in recent years are generally larger than one would expect based simply on the pivotal politics model (or, for that matter, based on a median voter model or the majority party's seat share). For example, Krehbiel (1998) finds an average coalition size of 81.9% when analyzing Mayhew's list of landmark enactments from 1947 to 1994.23 The tendency toward oversized coalitions implies that finding an average coalition size of 70.8% prior to 1917—coupled with the prevalence of legislation passed by narrow majorities—provides strong evidence against the universalism hypothesis and in favor of the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot hypothesis.24"
"20","Another way to assess the competing hypotheses about lawmaking in the Senate is to consider the role of the veto pivot explicitly (i.e., the member of Congress whose vote is required to override a presidential veto). Krehbiel (1998, 82–90) argues that an implication of the pivotal politics model is that when partisan control of the presidency changes hands, the veto pivot is less likely to be a constraint because the president and both chambers of Congress are more likely to be on the same side of the status quo. The empirical implication of such a “presidential regime switch” is that, since vetoes require two‐thirds coalitions to be overridden, there should be no change in Senate coalition sizes during the period where two‐thirds coalitions were needed to invoke cloture, but there should be reductions in coalition sizes since 1975 when only three‐fifths of the chamber has been required to stop a filibuster. For our analysis, if the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot hypothesis is correct for the pre‐cloture Senate, then we should see reductions in coalition sizes with presidential regime switches in that period. But our refinement that considers costs suggests that we might also see some coalitions smaller than two‐thirds after post‐1917 regime switches. Alternatively, if the distributive universalism hypothesis holds, implying that coalitions had to be greater than what was constitutionally required to override a veto, then we should see oversized majorities (that is, majorities well above two‐thirds) regardless of regime switches and in both periods.         "
"21","To test these predictions, we estimate regression models similar to those used by Krehbiel (1998) to test coalition‐size predictions in the post‐war period (see his Table 4.2). That is, we regress coalition sizes for final passage votes on two interaction variables, one indicating presidential regime switches prior to 1917 and the other indicating presidential regime switches after 1917. We also include a dummy variable for the pre‐cloture era to capture the possibility that coalition sizes were generally smaller prior to 1917.25 The median‐plus‐veto‐pivot hypothesis predicts a negative coefficient on the pre‐1917 regime‐switch variable. A coefficient on this variable that is not statistically different from zero would be consistent with the distributive universalism hypothesis.         "
"22","The results are reported in Table 2. The negative and statistically significant coefficient on the main effect for the pre‐1917 era reinforces the bivariate results that coalitions were generally smaller in the pre‐cloture era than from 1917–46. Consistent with the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot hypothesis, the interaction term measuring pre‐1917 presidential regime switches is also negative and statistically significant. Therefore, when the veto pivot was not a constraint, small majorities were especially successful in legislating. If near‐unanimity—or even two‐thirds—was required to pass major legislation in the pre‐cloture Senate, reduced coalition sizes would not coincide with presidential regime shifts. The negative and significant estimate for post‐1917 presidential regime shifts indicates that reduced coalition sizes continued to coincide with presidential regime shifts (though coalitions were generally larger after 1917 than before the cloture rule). This is consistent with the conjecture that even after 1917, the costs of filibustering meant that two‐thirds majorities were not always a necessary condition for passage of major legislation.26"
"23","Our model of coalition size is admittedly relatively sparse. However, the results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications. In the model reported in the second column of Table 2, we include the majority party's seat share, but it has a statistically insignificant impact and does not affect the other coefficient estimates.27 We also tried including a variable to measure end‐of‐congress effects—see column 3 of Table 2—but the coefficient on this variable was not statistically different from zero.28"
"24","To sum up, although many major bills enjoyed supermajority support in 1881–1917, coalitions were typically smaller than in 1917–1946, with a much larger proportion of bills passing with only a slim majority in favor. In terms of coalition sizes on significant legislation, the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot variant of the pivotal politics approach does a better job of explaining lawmaking in the pre‐cloture Senate than do the approaches that predict universalism. Our analysis of dilatory motions, which we turn to next, provides additional support for this conclusion."
"25","Our second approach to investigating obstruction and lawmaking in the pre‐cloture Senate is to examine roll‐call votes on dilatory motions to determine whether the size of coalitions supporting these motions predicts success or failure of the obstruction. For example, if unanimity or near‐unanimity was required to pass legislation, then we should observe that obstruction generally succeeds even when large majorities of senators oppose the dilatory motions directed at a given bill. However, determining when obstruction has actually taken place is a difficult task. The lists of filibusters that exist for the period we are examining are often incomplete and not specific as to what pieces of legislation were actually targeted (Beth 1995). It is also difficult to tell with any precision from the descriptions of these filibusters how broad the support or opposition was.         "
"26","In order to uncover incidents of obstruction, we examine legislation that was subject to multiple dilatory motions. Dilatory motions, as defined by Binder and Smith (1997), are motions to adjourn or postpone consideration of legislation that did not garner majority support. We also consider unsuccessful motions to recess, to table legislation, and to go into executive session during the consideration of legislation that is not “executive business” (i.e., treaties and nominations). These motions disrupt and delay the legislative process, especially when roll‐call votes on the motions are forced, and, given their failure, indicate that only a minority supported the obstruction of the legislation's progress. In addition to the general delay caused by these motions, another reason for forcing roll‐call votes on them is to demonstrate the lack of a quorum, which under the Constitution brings consideration of the legislation in question to a halt. The disruption that these motions caused made them one of the main tactics that obstructionist senators employed in the pre‐cloture period (Binder and Smith 1997, 47–49; Dion 1997, 12), which makes them good measures of obstruction. Indeed, in the nineteenth century, dilatory motions, as much as long speeches, were what senators understood to constitute filibusters.         "
"27","We collected data on dilatory motions from roll‐call voting records where it could be determined that the motions were targeted at a bill or resolution.29 We determined which pieces of legislation were targeted by examining descriptions of roll‐call votes and the debates surrounding the motions.30 For this analysis we focus on incidents of “significant” obstruction, which we define as three or more dilatory motions targeted at a piece of legislation.31"
"28","While identifying incidents of obstruction is a difficult task, determining the success or failure of dilatory tactics is even more complicated because the goals of obstructionist senators are often not obvious. It is easy to tell whether a filibustered bill passed the Senate, but the goal of the filibuster may have been to force compromise rather than kill the targeted legislation. It could also be the case that one bill is blocked in order to kill, force consideration of, or compromise on a different measure. Given the difficulties of determining senators' goals, we consider only whether or not obstructed bills passed the Senate in the congress in which they were considered. This is an admittedly extreme measure, but it is the outcome that has typically been the focus of analyses of filibusters and the major concern of normative assessments of the Senate's rules regarding limits on debate.32 Our dependent variable equals one if the bill passed and is zero otherwise.         "
"29","We model the success or failure of a piece of legislation as a function of the maximum size of the coalition opposing dilatory motions. The aforementioned issue of obstructionists using various motions to demonstrate the lack of a quorum indicates that we should measure the size of the coalition opposing the obstruction rather than the size of the coalition supporting it. Obstructionists have an incentive to abstain from voting on these motions if abstaining makes a quorum “disappear,” thereby bringing the legislative process to a halt. Thus, the number of those voting in favor of dilatory motions would not be a good indicator of the number who engaged in the obstruction. However, opponents of obstruction should more accurately reveal their numbers through their nay votes. They have an incentive to vote in force, both to make sure that dilatory motions are defeated and to try to maintain a quorum in order to keep the consideration of legislation on track. For the numerator of our measure, we use the largest number of votes cast against the dilatory motions targeting a given piece of legislation. The denominator is the number of senators who were members of the Senate at the time of the vote.33 We expect that larger coalition sizes will increase the probability of passage. The key question though, is by how much at particular sizes. The distributive universalism hypothesis suggest supporting coalitions will tend toward unanimity to be successful; the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot hypothesis implies narrow majorities will generally overcome obstruction.34 Thus, if we find a high predicted probability of passage associated with slim majorities, we would have support for the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot hypothesis; by contrast, if support from a narrow majority yields a low predicted probability of passage, this would refute the hypothesis.         "
"30","We strongly expect the effects of coalition size on the likelihood of passage will depend on when obstruction occurs. As discussed in an earlier section, as the end of a Congress draws near, time constraints increase, and thus reduce the costs faced by the obstructionists (Binder and Smith 1997, 62–63; Oppenheimer 1985). We tap into these time constraints by including a variable measuring the number of days remaining in a congress when the obstruction occurs, along with a dummy variable indicating whether the obstruction occurs in the final thirty days of a congress. The coefficient on this dummy variable should be negative, implying that a given coalition opposing obstruction will be less successful late in a congress. A key contribution of the dilatory motions analysis is that it allows us to assess whether the threat of late‐congress obstruction drives the required coalition size above a minimal majority, as is expected by our refinement to the pivotal politics model. The model also includes interactions between the coalition size variable with the number of days until the end of the congress and the end of congress indicator. The end‐of‐congress effect should be attenuated as the coalition size and the number of days left increase.         "
"31"," Figure 1 displays a time‐series plot of the number of incidents of significant obstruction in the 1st through 64th Congresses. By this measure, obstruction increased substantially throughout the nineteenth century, peaking in the 41st Congress (1869–1871) with 19 incidents, and then declined thereafter. The plot shows that a fair number of obstructed measures—22%—failed to pass. This plot also demonstrates a shortcoming of our measure of obstruction. Although our measure indicates the amount of obstruction was declining toward the end of the nineteenth century, extant lists of filibusters indicate that obstruction was increasing (Binder and Smith 1997). The plot clearly shows the shift in obstructionists' tactics in response to the creation of precedents that limited the usefulness of dilatory motions (Burdette 1940, 85–88). Our approach to measuring obstruction then is probably not suitable for constructing a complete time series that covers both the pre‐ and post‐cloture periods. It is suitable, however, for determining sizes of obstructing coalitions in the pre‐cloture period, especially up through the late nineteenth century.35"
"32","                 Time Series Plot of Incidents of Obstruction                      "
"33","The results of the probit analysis of the passage of significantly obstructed legislation in the pre‐cloture period are reported in Table 3. The coefficients on the variable measuring the size of the coalition opposing obstruction and the end‐of‐congress obstruction indicator variable are statistically significant and have the expected signs. The larger the size of the coalition opposing obstruction, the more likely a bill is to pass, although this effect is tempered if the obstruction occurs at the end of a congress. The coefficient on the three‐way interaction between coalition size, days left in the congress, and end‐of‐congress dummy, is positive and marginally statistically significant. This result, combined with the statistical insignificance of the coefficients on the main effect for days left in the congress and its interaction with coalition size, indicate that time constraints really only have an impact at the end of a congress.36"
"34","In order to adjudicate among the competing hypotheses, we simulated the probability of passage for particular coalition sizes for obstruction occurring early or late in a congress (again, “late” here means the last thirty days prior to adjournment). The other variables in the model were set to their median values. We account for uncertainty in the simulations by employing the method advocated by Herron (2000, 87) to compute 95% confidence intervals around the predicted probabilities.         "
"35","If the coalition opposing the obstruction is 51% and the obstruction takes place early in a congress, a bill has a .80 probability of passage with a 95% confidence interval of [.65, .90]. Late in a congress, an obstructed bill has a probability of passage of only .68 for a coalition of this size, with confidence bounds of [.56, .79]. On the last day of a congress, the predicted probability of passage is only .51 [.34, .68]. A bill with a bare majority thus has a very good chance of passage early in a congress, but its chances are substantially less if it is considered late in a congress. However, contrary to the universalism hypothesis, those chances are never near zero. The largest coalition size in our sample—.83—gives approximately the same predicted probability regardless of when the obstruction occurred: .95 [.81, .99] early in a congress and .94 [.77, .99] late in a congress."
"36","These results are consistent with the analyses of significant legislation, indicating that unanimity or near unanimity was not necessary to overcome obstruction prior to 1917.37 Fairly narrow majorities were still very successful in passing legislation despite obstruction. As implied by our refinement, their success rate decreased when the obstruction occurred late in a congress, but unanimity was still not required. As adjournment drew near, there was increasing uncertainty about how large a coalition had to be in order to overcome obstruction. We return to the issue of uncertainty and how it relates to cloture reform in the conclusion.         "
"37","Our third approach shifts attention to a single substantive issue area in order to identify the coalition size required to enact significant policy changes. This enables us to draw upon both a rich historical literature and primary sources to gain a nuanced understanding of the dynamics of coalition building, while holding certain political factors constant, and provide a reality check on our more general quantitative analysis."
"38","The tariff was one of the dominant political issues in the United States for much of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (see, e.g., Bensel 2000). No issue reached the top of the political agenda more often. For much of the hundred years from the rise of Jackson through the presidency of Herbert Hoover, the tariff was one of the key issues distinguishing Democrats from their Whig, and later, Republican, adversaries. It is especially important that the tariff was salient to both its supporters and opponents.38"
"39","The tariff also seems well‐suited for evaluating our competing hypotheses. Some view the tariff largely as a distributive policy (Lowi 1964; Schattschneider 1935), and Weingast's (1979) formal model that produces universalistic equilibria was specifically designed to apply to distributive policies.39 Others view the tariff as a contentious, partisan issue central to sectional battles over redistribution, which suggests that coalitions would be far from unanimous (Bensel 2000; Epstein and O'Halloran 1996; O'Halloran 1994). We cannot resolve this debate in this article, but we simply note that the existing literature provides some prior basis to believe that either of our competing hypotheses could be borne out.40"
"40"," Table 4 presents a summary of major tariff legislation from 1827 through 1930.41 To mitigate problems of selection bias, it includes both successful and unsuccessful efforts to change rates.42 The table excludes narrow tariff bills that affected only a small subset of duties.43 It also excludes bills that failed due to lack of sufficient support in the House.44 Finally, the table excludes the tariff measures adopted during the Civil War in order to raise revenue for the war effort.45"
"41","One pattern that immediately stands out from the table is the number of tariff bills that passed with very thin majorities. Only two bills—those passed in 1870 and 1872—had anything approaching universalistic coalitions. A comparison of coalition sizes on final passage votes on tariff bills with coalition sizes on all major legislation included in Petersen's (2001) list makes it clear that tariff bills were consistently controversial. In the pre‐cloture period, the average coalition size supporting successful tariff bills was just 63%. Furthermore, 69% of final passage votes on tariff bills had fewer than two‐thirds in favor; in half of the final passage votes, fewer than 60% of senators voted yes. Close votes were especially common between 1881 and 1917 (83% of the final passage votes after 1881 had fewer than two‐thirds voting in favor, as compared to 60% prior to 1881). This is greater than the proportion of close votes for all major legislation during this period (see Table 1).46 The prevalence of close votes supports the prediction that the median voter was generally pivotal for tariff bills in the pre‐cloture era, rather than the prediction derived from universalism. An additional nuance is that coalition sizes were 4% greater for tariff bills passed under divided government. This conforms to the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot prediction: since divided government makes a veto more likely and thus the veto pivot relevant, coalition sizes tend to increase.         "
"42","Another interesting pattern which is confirmatory of our previous analyses concerns action on tariff bills that occurred late in a congress. In the antebellum period, bills that passed in the lame duck sessions had relatively wide support. These include the tariff reductions of 1833 (64% in favor), the compromise bill of 1857 (80% in favor), and the Morrill tariff increases of 1861 (64% in favor).47 By contrast, the single example of a tariff bill killed by minority obstruction occurred in February 1827, late in the lame duck session of the nineteenth Congress. In that case, a narrow Senate majority appeared to favor proposed legislation to increase rates on woolen products. Bill supporters narrowly defeated a series of obstructive motions, but the bill was finally tabled on a 21–20 vote when it became clear that it was precluding consideration of other legislation in the waning days of the session.48"
"43","It is worth emphasizing that when major tariff bills were considered in the antebellum regular sessions, a narrow majority proved sufficient to overcome opposition. The Senate passed a significant tariff increase in 1842 by a mere 24–23 vote and enacted a noteworthy reduction in 1846 by a 28–27 majority. The 1842 case is a particularly nice illustration of the validity of the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot hypothesis. Congress had initially passed a slightly different version of the legislation—also by extremely narrow margins—that President John Tyler had vetoed because he opposed a provision regarding the distribution of funds from land sales. After the veto, both chambers dropped this provision but kept the rest of the bill essentially unchanged (Stanwood 1903, v. 2, 26–28). It is noteworthy that the president's veto forced changes to the bill even as the opposition of over 45% of the Senate did not appear to exact concessions. Of course, proponents of the original bill would have been able to keep the funds distribution provision if they had two‐thirds support, but the binding constraint was the veto pivot rather than the threat of a filibuster.49 Therefore, antebellum tariff politics clearly appear majoritarian, with the caveat that minority obstruction posed a threat late in the lame duck sessions.         "
"44","The contrast between the lame duck sessions and regular sessions is less sharp from the 1860s through the 1880s. In both 1875 and 1883, the Senate adopted significant tariff changes by a single vote margin in the closing days of a Congress. This suggests that senators were not particularly afraid of obstructionists capitalizing on the lack of available time to kill proposals, and that narrow majorities could successfully legislate.50"
"45","However, from the 1890s to the 1930s, the pattern of consideration of tariff legislation implies that concern about obstruction had an influence on the timing of floor deliberation. It became quite typical for the consideration of tariff bills to drag on for several months in the Senate, due in part to the immense number of amendments typically proposed by the Finance Committee to the House‐passed legislation, which led to numerous additional floor votes. But the minority's increased use of procedural tactics and long speeches fueled the delays. Indeed, where accusations of minority obstruction were uncommon when tariff bills were considered in the 1860s–1880s, they were a recurrent feature of Senate tariff debates after 1890."
"46","The increased threat of obstruction may explain the shift away from considering tariff bills in the lame duck sessions. From 1890 to 1930, only once—in 1921—was a significant tariff change considered in a lame duck session. Instead, several of the key proposals were passed in special sessions convened soon after the preceding Congress had adjourned. The bottom line, however, is that so long as the lame duck session was avoided, a narrow majority was sufficient to pass major tariff changes: only one of the five major tariff bills passed from 1890 to 1917 enjoyed support from two‐thirds or more of voting senators."
"47","Interestingly, the adoption of the cloture rule in 1917 did not make it noticeably easier to pass tariff bills, nor did it seem to raise the threshold for winning coalitions to two‐thirds in the period immediately following the reform. Tariff bills of 1921, 1922, and 1929–30 each encountered obstruction,51 and though cloture votes were held and failed on two of them, they each eventually passed with less than two‐thirds votes. Consistent with our analysis of final passage votes on all major legislation, this suggests that even after 1917, the costs of obstruction made a two‐thirds majority a sufficient, but not always a necessary, condition for passing controversial bills.         "
"48","In sum, our evidence suggests that narrow floor majorities were generally able to pass major tariff legislation in the Senate for much of the period before and immediately following the adoption of the cloture rule. However, obstruction by a large and determined minority appears to have created considerable uncertainty for bill supporters late in the lame duck sessions. Nevertheless, the politics of the tariff with respect to obstruction were far from universalistic, and are more consistent with the median‐plus‐veto‐pivot hypothesis.52"
"49","The three sets of analyses presented in this article generate broadly consistent results that indicate the refined median‐plus‐veto‐pivot version of the pivotal politics approach best explains how the lack of a cloture rule affected lawmaking in the pre‐cloture Senate. Little to no evidence supports the position that the absence of a cloture rule meant that senators possessed a liberum veto that made universalistic coalitions necessary for the passage of legislation. One caveat is that the end‐of‐congress deadline appears to have decreased the effectiveness of narrow majorities to legislate by increasing the veto power of small groups of senators. Our analysis of coalition sizes on dilatory motions suggests that larger than minimal majorities were generally required to ensure that obstruction would not kill legislation at the end of a congress. The apparent avoidance of tariff bills during the lame duck sessions after 1890 also suggests that minority obstruction posed a significant danger late in a congress. While bare majorities could still pass legislation in the face of obstruction, they were less successful as the date of adjournment drew near. Still, legislative entrepreneurs did not generally need to build universalistic coalitions in order to get legislation through the Senate, even with adjournment looming.         "
"50","The results from the dilatory motions analysis and the case study of tariff politics might explain a puzzle that is presented by our findings concerning the success of narrow majorities in the pre‐cloture era. Legislation often passed with majorities below the two‐thirds threshold incorporated in the 1917 cloture rule. If the 1917 rule, which required two‐thirds to end debate regardless of when legislation was brought to the floor, had been in place in the nineteenth century, it could have made it more difficult to pass many bills considered during that period if senators thought it necessary to use the cloture procedure to overcome obstruction. While many believed that the reform would not be very effective in stopping obstruction, to our knowledge no one has claimed that it would have had the effect of making the passage of legislation more difficult in certain cases.         "
"51","We conjecture that the 1917 reform was aimed at reducing uncertainty about the effectiveness of obstruction late in a congress. As our analysis of dilatory motions demonstrates, legislation that was considered close to adjournment faced a great deal of uncertainty as to how large its supporting coalition had to be for it to pass. While smaller majorities seemed to suffice earlier in a congress, it was not clear whether majorities of this size would be successful close to the end of a congress. By enacting a cloture provision with a two‐thirds threshold, senators may have been trading off the possibility of passing legislation with less than two‐thirds majorities in exchange for a decrease in the uncertainty about the coalition sizes needed to pass legislation near automatic adjournment.53 If this was the case then cloture reform was not merely symbolic as some have claimed (Koger 2002; Luce 1922, 295).         "
"52","Thorough theoretical development and empirical testing of this conjecture is beyond the scope of this article. However, we can offer some preliminary supportive evidence from our analysis of coalition sizes on significant legislation. If the cloture rule was aimed at reducing uncertainty toward the end of congress, then the variance of coalition sizes late in a congress in the post‐cloture period should be smaller than the variance of coalition sizes late in pre‐cloture congresses.54 The data do fit this pattern, although we need to be careful about our inferences due to small sample sizes. The variance of coalition sizes in lame duck sessions prior to cloture reform was 0.017 (for six bills), but then dropped slightly to 0.013 (for four bills) after cloture reform. Although this difference is small, a nonparametric test of equal variances, which is particularly well‐suited for samples of this size (Conover 1999), indicates the difference in variances is significant at the .1 level.55 By contrast, the variances for important legislation considered early in a congress are identical for the pre‐ and post‐cloture periods. If we include voice votes taken at the end of a congress and treat them as unanimous, this increases the sample size to 21 in the pre‐cloture period (with coalition size variance equal to .025) and eight in the post‐cloture period (with coalition size variance equal to .01). The nonparametric test with the larger sample size also leads us to reject the null of equal variances (at the .05 level).56 These results are consistent with the argument that one goal of cloture reform was to reduce the uncertainty created by obstruction toward the end of a congress.         "
"53","Although our evidence on the uncertainty‐reducing effects of cloture reform is preliminary, it does suggest that the 1917 change was not merely symbolic, and instead addressed problems presented by unlimited debate in the Senate. Clearly, a reconsideration of the politics of cloture reform is necessary if we are to understand thoroughly the motivation for and the ultimate impact of the reform and its larger consequences for lawmaking in the United States. Our conjecture about cloture reform as an uncertainty versus coalition size trade‐off is a step toward the development of a theory of supermajority procedural reforms, which could be developed and tested more thoroughly in a comparative context."
