"1","In order to prevent a challenge, the government must buy off or co‐opt an opposing faction. To this end, the government begins the game knowing π, the size of the pie to be divided, and makes an offer y≥ 0 to the opposition, who can accept the offer or fight. Accepting ends the game with the government and opposition receiving π−y and y, respectively.6 Fighting destroys a fraction 1 −σ of the pie while a fraction σ survives. If the opposing faction wins, which it does with probability p, it gets the surviving spoils. If the government wins, it keeps the surviving spoils. Thus the payoffs to fighting for the government and opposition are (1 −p)σπ and pσπ, respectively.         "
"2","To formalize the informational asymmetry, let π=c+r where r has mean 0 and is distributed over  according to H which has a continuous and strictly positive density h over . The government knows c and r, but the rebels only observe c. The parameter c measures the general climate of the times. The larger c, the larger π is and the larger the rebels expect it to be (i.e., the larger  is). Thus the opposition knows whether times are good or bad (i.e., the opposition knows c), but the opposition does not know precisely how good or bad the times are (i.e., what the value of π=c+r is).         "
"3","A pure strategy for the government specifies the government's offer as a function of its private information about the spoils:  where .7 A strategy for the opposing faction defines the probability that the opposition accepts as a function of the government's offer: . As for what the opposition believes about the size of the spoils after receiving an offer, let Δ be the set of distributions over  and let μ(x) ∈Δ for all  denote the opposition's beliefs following an offer of x. Finally, a perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) is a strategy profile (y, α) and beliefs μ such that the government can never profitably deviate from offering y(π) given the opposition's strategy α(x); α(x) is a best reply to x given μ(r | x); and μ is derived from H and y via Bayes's rule.8"
"4","Although the effects of asymmetric information about the size of the pie are our primary interest, we begin by analyzing the complete‐information game, which provides a baseline. When the size of the pie is common knowledge, both the government and opposition know that the latter's expected payoff to fighting for control of the spoils is pσπ, and there is nothing for the government to bluff about. The government must therefore offer the opposition at least as much as the latter expects to get from fighting in order to buy the opposition off and dissuade it from fighting. The game itself reduces to the complete‐information version of the simple take‐it‐or‐leave‐it‐offer models commonly used to model war (e.g., Fearon 1995; Powell 2002).         "
"5","In the unique subgame perfect equilibrium, the government offers just enough to make fighting unprofitable, i.e., the government offers the opposition its certainty equivalent of fighting y=pσπ. The opposition then accepts this offer for sure, leaving the government and opposition respectively with equilibrium payoffs of π−pσπ and pσπ. The equilibrium probability that bargaining breaks down in fighting is zero.9"
"6","When the government has private information about the size of the spoils, the game has infinitely many PBEs. In some, the government pools on a specific offer, i.e., the government makes the same offer regardless of the size of the pie. In other semi‐separating equilibria, the government's offer varies with the spoils but does not fully reveal the exact size of the pie. In these equilibria, there are a set of cutpoints  and a set of ever more favorable offers  such that the government proposes yj if π∈ (kj−1, kj). And, there is a fully separating equilibrium in which the government's offer is strictly increasing in the size of the pie. Incentive compatibility ensures that the equilibrium offers are weakly increasing in the spoils and that larger equilibrium offers are generally more likely to be accepted than smaller offers (see Lemma 1 in the appendix).         "
"7","Although there is a surfeit of equilibria, only the separating equilibrium is predicated on reasonable out‐of‐equilibrium beliefs in the sense that they satisfy Cho and Kreps's (1987) condition D1. Roughly, D1 requires the opposition to discount the possibility of facing type η after an out‐of‐equilibrium offer z if another type η′ would always deviate to z whenever η does and sometimes even when η does not.10"
"8","The key implication of D1 is that no two types can pool on the same offer in equilibrium (see Lemmas 2 and 3 in the appendix). Therefore, each type must make a distinct offer, and the equilibrium must be fully separating. The remainder of this section shows that full separation uniquely determines the government's and opposition's equilibrium strategies.11"
"9","Separation implies that the government must offer the opposition its certainty equivalent to fighting, i.e., y(π) =pσπ. To see why, observe that if every different π leads to a different offer y(π), then the opposition can infer the size of the pie from the offer the government puts on the table. Based on this inference, the opposition believes that its expected payoff to fighting is pσπ.         "
"10","Recall further from the discussion above that the opposition must reject lower offers with higher probabilities in order to deter lowball offers. This means that the opposition must generally play a mixed response to the government's offer, i.e., the opposition must both accept and reject an offer with positive probabilities. Mixing in turn implies that the opposition must be indifferent between accepting the government's offer and fighting. Were the opposition not indifferent, then mixing would not maximize the opposition's payoff as it could do better by either accepting for sure or fighting for sure depending on which alternative gave the higher payoff. Finally, the opposition's indifference between accepting and fighting means that its payoff to accepting, y(π), must equal its expected payoff to fighting, pσπ. Hence, y(π) =pσπ.         "
"11","As for the opposition's acceptance strategy α(y), the government's offering y(π) =pσπ must be a best reply to α(y) in equilibrium, and this uniquely determines α. To sketch the argument, consider two types  and their respective offers y=pσπ and . In equilibrium, no type can profitably deviate by mimicking another type. That is, π's payoff to offering y must be at least as large as its payoff to offering . Formally,            "
"12","Combining the previous two inequalities leaves             "
"13","This relation holds for any π and  and in particular for types arbitrarily close to each other. Taking the limit as  goes to π and using the fact that the probability of acceptance α is bounded between zero and one yields . Hence,  and α is continuous.         "
"14","Now divide the previous inequalities by  to obtain            "
"15","Solving this differential equation with the boundary condition  leads to  or .12"
"16","Proposition 1:   The unique equilibrium strategies in any PBE satisfying D1 are y(π) =pσπ and α(y) = 0 if if and α(y) = 1 if .            "
"17","Proof:  See the proof of Proposition 6 in the appendix.            "
"18","In words, in the unique PBE satisfying D1 the government offers the opposition exactly the latter's certainty equivalent for fighting given the prevailing state of nature. The opposition is sure to accept the offer associated with the largest possible pie () but fights with positive probability if offered anything less. The lower the offer, the more likely the opposition is to fight. Notably, in the separating equilibrium the government ends up offering the same amount it would offer if information about the state of nature were symmetric to begin with, and in equilibrium the opposition learns that private information through the offer made by the government. However, the opposition fights with positive probability because it needs to discipline the government into not making lowball offers.            "
"19","Empirical evidence indicates that hard times make civil war and political conflict in general more likely. There is a strong negative relation between income and the likelihood of civil war (e.g., Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Fearon and Laitin 2003; Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti 2004). Low income also makes coups more likely (Londregan and Poole 1990), and recessionary crises tend to undermine democratic regimes (Gasiorowski 1995). Among other things, in this section we show that the empirical effects of income on conflict can be unbundled into different but complementary effects. This unpacking of the income‐conflict connection is useful not just for understanding the nature of that link, but also for guiding empirical research.         "
"20","Hard times make conflict more likely in the model as do a stronger opposition and lower costs of fighting. Proposition 2 formalizes the comparative statics of the equilibrium described in Proposition 1."
"21","Proposition 2:   Hard times (low expected income c), a strong opposition (high p), and less destructive conflict (higher σ) make fighting more likely."
"22","Proof:  Recalling that π=c+r with r distributed according to H over , the probability of fighting is               "
"23","The integrand  is decreasing in c (∂I/∂c < 0). Bad times (lower values of c) therefore make fighting more likely (∂F/∂c < 0). The integrand is increasing in both p and σ. So a stronger opposition makes for more fighting (∂F/∂p > 0) while lower costs to fighting (i.e., a higher surviving fraction σ) lead to more fighting (∂F/∂σ > 0).     ▪            "
"24","Two comments about the comparative statics are in order. The first centers on the interpretation of “hard times” as a low value of c rather than a low realization of r. The second remark provides some intuition for the comparative static results. We then specify how income could have both a direct and an indirect effect on conflict.            "
"25","One might think of hard times as a negative value of r, which makes the realized pie π=c+r smaller than its average value of c. Incentive compatibility then implies (via Lemma 1 in the appendix) that the probability of acceptance is weakly increasing in r. Thus hard times in the sense of a low r makes fighting weakly more likely. Moreover, this relation holds in every PBE because it is derived from incentive compatibility conditions that all PBEs must satisfy. By contrast, the fact that hard times in the sense of a low c makes conflict more likely only holds (or at least has only been shown to hold) in the particular equilibrium described in Proposition 1.            "
"26","Why focus on the comparative statics involving c rather than the more general results for r? The reason is that the former are more in keeping with the econometric evidence linking hard times to political conflict. In these studies, most of which involve cross‐country regressions, both the government and opposition know that the country is poor or rich. The government and opposition also know whether the state is strong or weak and generally lacking in repressive capabilities. These conditions are common knowledge at the outset and define the strategic arena in which the interaction between the government and opposition plays out.            "
"27","In the model, the climate of the times c is part of the backdrop; it is common knowledge when play begins. If c is low, both sides know that times are hard when they try to divide what spoils there are. If, by contrast, hard times were defined as a low r, then the general conditions would not be part of the backdrop. It would not be true that both sides know whether times were good or bad. Thus although they are less general than the incentive compatibility results on r, the comparative statics on c in a specific equilibrium are of interest because they provide a more natural formal referent for the empirical findings.            "
"28","The second remark offers some intuition for the comparative statics summarized in Proposition 2. Formal work in international relations theory shows that the relation between the distribution of power and the probability of fighting is ambiguous in general because of two competing pressures. As an actor gets weaker, it is more likely to accept any given offer and this tends to make fighting less likely. But as the other actor gets stronger, it demands more, and this tends to increase the probability of fighting. These opposing factors exactly cancel each other out in Fearon's (1995) model of war. But this is not a general result. Powell (1996), for example, finds that the probability of fighting increases as the distribution of power diverges from the distribution of benefits.13"
"29","In the government‐opposition model analyzed here, the probability of fighting unambiguously goes down as the opposition weakens (p falls). Indeed, the probability that the opposition will accept the government's offer, , goes to one as p goes to zero regardless of the value of r. The reason for this is rooted in the strategic tension at the heart of the model. When the opposition is almost powerless the government need only pay a very small amount to keep the opposition from fighting. (In the limit when p= 0, the government's offer of the opposition's certainty equivalent pσπ is zero regardless of the state of nature.) Thus, when p is very low, the government's temptation to lowball the opposition is also very low. After all, being sure of buying the opposition off by offering  is nearly costless when p is small. That means the opposition need not threaten with high fighting probabilities to prevent the government from making low offers. Thus, a weak opposition goes hand in hand with low chances of conflict.            "
"30","A similar rationale lies behind the results for the comparative statics on σ and c. If the cost of fighting is very high (σ is close to zero), the cost of offering enough to be certain of buying the opposition off, , is again very small. Hence the temptation to lowball the opposition is small and a small probability of fighting is enough to deter the government from making lowball offers. As for the effects of c, a higher c shifts the whole distribution over π upwards, and this too reduces the government's temptation to lowball the opposition. Relative to the size of the pie π=c+r, the gain to be had by risking war in order to convince the opposition that the size of the pie is at some lower value π′=c+r′ (with r′ < r) is (π−π′)/π= (r−r′)/(c+r), which decreases as c increases.            "
"31","Our model can help distinguish between two complementary effects that higher income per capita may have on conflict. First, there is a direct effect, as captured by changes in c, working through the raw incentives of the two players. Second, there can be an indirect effect if the strength of the opposition p goes down as average income c gets larger, because we have shown that weaker opposition and stronger government lead to less conflict. Therefore, empirical work studying the connection between income and conflict should take into account that there can be two separate effects of income, one of which is mediated by the (potentially endogenous) strength of the opposition. This unbundling of the effects of income on conflict helps frame the debate on why poorer nations have more conflict by categorizing different arguments as pertaining to the direct versus indirect effects of income. According to one class of arguments (e.g., Collier and Hoeffler 1998), more income reduces conflict because it makes players' incentives less conflict‐prone (as with our c‐driven effects). For others (notably, Fearon and Laitin 2003) the reason is that wealthier countries have stronger governments, and hence, in relative terms, weaker oppositions. Note that the latter argument contains two parts. One is that more national wealth translates into a weaker opposition, and the other one is that weak oppositions make for less conflict. Our comparative static on p offers a formal proof for the second part of that argument. Our model can easily incorporate the first part by endogenizing p as a negative function of c.            "
"32","Previous work in political economy has emphasized that regime transitions (which are usually associated with a form of conflict, namely coups) are more likely during recessions, although in a different context. Acemoglu and Robinson (2001) analyze a dynamic model where an elite lacks the ability to commit to future redistributive transfers. In their setup, democratization may be followed by coups engineered by the displaced elite. Coups are more likely during recessions due to lower opportunity costs of staging a coup (see also Acemoglu and Robinson 2006 for related treatments). Our model emphasizes an informational problem—rather than a commitment one—that arises even in a static environment.            "
"33","Turning to the role of uncertainty, greater uncertainty makes fighting weakly more likely when the opposition is weak. By contrast, the effects of greater uncertainty on the probability of fighting are ambiguous when the opposition is strong. Formally, assume that the distribution of benefits is π=c+s where s is distributed over  according to the cumulative distribution G. Assume further that the spoils when distributed according to H are more uncertain than when distributed according to G in the sense that G second‐order stochastically dominates H.14 Then,            "
"34","Proposition 3:   If the opposition is sufficiently weak (i.e., if p≤ (1 −σ)/σ) and the distribution of spoils H is more uncertain than G in the sense that G second‐order stochastically dominates H, then the probability of conflict is weakly higher with the more uncertain spoils H than with G."
"35","Proof:  See the appendix.            "
"36","The opposition fights because it has to deter the government from bluffing, i.e., making low offers when the spoils are relatively large. Why is conflict, and the informational roots driving it, so hard to eliminate? Suppose there were some way the government could reveal the size of the pie to the opposing faction that was not vulnerable to misrepresentation. Then the government would find itself playing the complete‐information version of the spoils game. Would the government prefer to play this symmetric information game instead?"
"37","The answer is yes, as committing to revealing the size of the spoils would increase the government's payoff. Recall that in the unique equilibrium of the complete‐information game, bargaining never breaks down. Rather, the government offers just enough to buy the opposition off (y=pσπ), the opposition accepts this offer for sure, and the government and opposition respectively receive payoffs of π−pσπ and pσπ. In the asymmetric‐information game, by contrast, the government still offers pσπ, but the opposition is no longer sure to accept this offer. Indeed, the probability of acceptance falls to , and the government's payoff drops to α(pσπ)(π−pσπ) +[1 −α(pσπ)](1 −p)σπ=π−pσπ−[1 −α(pσπ)]π(1 −σ), which is clearly less than π−pσπ since α(pσπ) < 1.         "
"38","Why, then, does the government not verifiably reveal its private information? One answer may be that there is simply no way to reveal private information that is not vulnerable to bluffing. An alternative is that there are ways to credibly reveal information, but those are typically costly for the government so the latter may eliminate its private information only rarely. Here we examine one such alternative and ask under what conditions, if any, would the government eliminate its own private information. Suppose that the government cannot credibly commit to transparent institutions which would reveal the size of the pie to outsiders, but the government can reveal the size of the pie to the opposition by bringing it inside—possibly through some sort of power‐sharing arrangement. However, revealing information in this way is costly. In particular, giving opposition elements positions of influence also shifts the distribution of power in the opposition's favor by increasing the probability it prevails from p to p+ψ.         "
"39","This shift introduces a commitment problem alongside the original informational problem. If the opposition could commit to accepting pσπ and to not exploiting its enhanced bargaining power, then the government would reveal the spoils, the opposing faction would accept the government's offer, and there would be no fighting. But the opposition cannot commit to this and will fight if offered anything less than (p+ψ)σπ. Thus, verifiably revealing the spoils to the opposition also raises the cost of buying it off from pσπ to (p+ψ)σπ. When this cost is too large, we will show that the commitment problem swamps the informational problem, and the government foregoes the opportunity to reveal the spoils.         "
"40","In effect, the shifting distribution of power creates a trade‐off between efficiency gains and distributive costs. Sharing power solves the inefficiency problem, which benefits the government as it alone pays the efficiency costs. But sharing power also affects the distribution of the spoils as the now more powerful opposition can claim a larger fraction of the pie. If the distributive costs to the government are too high, the government prefers the larger share of the (in expectation) smaller pie to the smaller share of the larger pie.15 In these circumstances, the government will forego the opportunity to resolve the inefficiency. Indeed, this prospect illustrates one reason why governments are often reluctant to increase transparency by sharing power with an opposing faction. Doing so would eliminate the opportunistic temptation and would be efficient. But the distributive cost of sharing power may be too high.         "
"41","To formalize these issues, assume that the government can reveal the spoils to the opposition by sharing power or it can make an offer to the opposing faction. If the government shares power, the game ends with payoffs π− (p+ψ)σπ and (p+ψ)σπ for the government and opposition, respectively. (These are the payoffs that would result if the size of the pie were known to both at the outset of the game.) If the government makes an offer rather than sharing power with the opposition, the game proceeds as before, and we again focus on equilibria of the game under asymmetric information that satisfy D1. The only difference is that, in equilibrium, the opposition must have consistent beliefs about the distribution of the pie in the respective events in which power is shared and when it is not. Then,         "
"42","Proposition 4:   If times are bad enough and the shift in power is small enough, i.e., if where χ≡[(1 −σ−ψσ)/(1 −σ)](1−σ)/(pσ), then the government shares power in equilibrium. Otherwise, the government keeps power and makes an offer as in the original game."
"43","Proof:  If the game after no power sharing is played in a way that satisfies D1, the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium takes the form stated in the proposition. A proof of this uniqueness result is available upon request. Here we simply demonstrate that the strategy in the Proposition is indeed part of a PBE. The payoff from sharing power and thereby avoiding any risk of fighting is π[1 − (p+ψ)σ] while the expected payoff from playing the game with private information is α(pσπ)π(1 −pσ) +[1 −α(pσπ)](1 −p)σπ where . Algebra demonstrates that former payoff is larger than the latter if and only if the condition stated in the proposition holds.     ▪            "
"44","Our results on power sharing yield several testable hypotheses. Proposition 4 implies that power sharing will occur if and only if . Hence, the probability that the government shares power is .            "
"45","Proposition 5:   The probability of power sharing increases when:             "

"49"," The highest possible value of the spoils is larger (i.e., when goes up)."
"50","Proof:  See the appendix.            "
"51","The last proposition implies that there is a subtle difference in the effects that different income‐related magnitudes have on power sharing. An increase in average income c makes power sharing less likely, while an increase in the highest potential income shock  makes power sharing more likely. Note also that power sharing never occurs if the induced shift in power ψ is too large. In particular, when the power shift is too large (i.e., when ), we have  and the probability of power sharing  is zero.            "
"52","The strategic problem examined in this article is more general than that confronting an incumbent government and an opposing faction and seems likely to arise in many different substantive settings. For example, those controlling an organization—be it a firm, a committee, a ministry, or the state—typically have better information about the organization's resources than outsiders do. If these outsiders have the ability to challenge the insiders for control of the organization and its spoils through a costly conflict, the insiders have an incentive to try to buy the outsiders off. The outsiders in turn must be concerned about low‐ball offers. In fact, the dilemma is still more general as the model of war below illustrates. If one player has private information about the value of the other player's payoff to rejecting the former's offer (say by fighting or walking away from negotiations), then the latter player must be concerned about lowball offers."
"53","One advantage of formalization is that it can help bring general strategic problems into sharper focus and thereby help us see that the same strategic problem often arises in very different substantive settings. To this end, this section formalizes a class of “coercive” signaling games in which the sender has private information about the receiver's payoff to rejecting the sender's offer to divide the pie. We then illustrate our more general results with models of war and litigation."
"54","Let Γ be the class of signaling games in which the sender (player 1) knows t, which defines the situation facing the actors. The receiver believes t is distributed according to H, which has a continuous and strictly positive density over . In the example above, t was the size of the spoils. The sender then proposes a division x of the spoils s(t) as illustrated in Figure 1 where .16 The receiver (player 2) can accept this offer or try to impose a settlement through the costly use of some form of power. Accepting ends the game in payoffs s(t) −x and x for 1 and 2, respectively. Fighting ends the game in an inefficient outcome with payoffs w1 (t) and w2 (t) where s, w1, and w2 are assumed to be continuously differentiable.         "
"55","                 A General Coercive Signaling Game                      "
"56","These functions satisfy three additional conditions: Fighting is inefficient, i.e., w1 (t) +w2 (t) < s (t) for all . The receiver's payoff to fighting is increasing in t, w′2 (t) > 0. And, the difference between the spoils and the sender's payoff to fighting is increasing, s′(t) −w′1 (t) > 0.17 These conditions capture what we call a coercive signaling game. The most general feature of a coercive signaling game is that a fight occurs whenever the uninformed player rejects the offer made by the informed player. Fighting is essentially defined by the presence of dead weight losses: play following a rejection is inefficient because aggregate payoffs are lower than they would have been following an agreement. The additional conditions are that the informed player's potential gains from peace are larger in better states of nature and that fighting for a larger pie should in expectation be better for the uninformed player than fighting for a smaller pie.         "
"57","Definition 1:   A signaling gameγis coercive if (i) s (t), w1 (t), and w2 (t) are continuously differentiable; (ii) s′(t) −w′1 (t) > 0 and w′2 (t) > 0; and (iii) w1 (t) +w2 (t) < s (t) for all "
"58","The receiver in this game faces the same dilemma in any coercive signaling game as the opposition does in the example above. If the value of t were common knowledge and the receiver was weak (t is small), the receiver's expected payoff to fighting would be low and it would accept a low offer. But if the receiver is unsure of t and hence w2 (t), it needs to deter the sender from making low offers when t is high. To do this, the receiver must reject offers less than  with positive probability. The probability of fighting and the corresponding probability of acceptance are given by the solution to a differential equation analogous to equation (1) above. More precisely,            "

"61","Two examples illustrate the proposition."
"62","War and uncertain military power:  Suppose two states, S1 and S2, are bargaining about revising the territorial status quo. S1 makes a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it offer x∈[0, 1] to S2, who can accept or reject by fighting. Accepting ends the game with payoffs 1 −x and x for S1 and S2. Fighting destroys a fraction 1 −σ of the value of the territory with the winner taking what is left. The payoffs to fighting are therefore (1 −p)σ and pσ for S1 and S2 where p is the probability that S2 prevails. However, the distribution of power p is uncertain. In particular,  where ɛ is distributed over  according to G with mean zero. S1 begins the game knowing the balance of power, i.e., S1 knows ɛ, but S2 does not.            "
"63","This formulation parallels Fearon's (1995) model of interstate bargaining but with two differences. First, the informed state makes the offer here whereas the uninformed state makes the offer in Fearon's game. Second, the uninformed party is uncertain about the distribution of power here and not about the rival's cost of fighting as in Fearon's formulation. Formally, the present model entails correlated values whereas Fearon's setup and much of the existing work in international relations entail independent private values. More substantively, the source of uncertainty highlighted here is more in keeping with Blainey, who argues that “wars usually begin when fighting nations disagree on their relative strength” (1983, 122).            "
"64","Because S1 knows whether it is strong or weak, S2 is uncertain about the distribution of power and hence its payoff to fighting. It must therefore try to deter S1 from claiming to be strong and offering little when S1 actually is weak. Formally, S2 fights with positive probability in response to all  in order to deter S1 from making low offers when S2 is strong (ɛ is large). To determine the corresponding probability of acceptance, take . It follows that , and, by Proposition 6,  with .            "
"65","Litigation:  Models of litigation and conflict are closely related. In each, one actor threatens to use coercive force—legal or military—to impose a settlement. But the use of force is costly and the resulting outcome is ex post inefficient. (Powell[1999, 216–19] discusses the parallel between models of litigation and war.)            "
"66","The second example is Reinganum and Wilde's (1986) model of litigation. A plaintiff, P, has private information about the damages d it has suffered and makes a settlement offer of x to the defendant D. The defendant is unsure of d but believes it to be distributed over  according to the strictly increasing distribution G(d). The defendant can accept the demand or fight by going to court.            "
"67","If the plaintiff proposes x and the defendant agrees, the game ends with payoffs −x and x for D and P, respectively. If D refuses x, and the case goes to court, the court finds in favor of the plaintiff with probability π and awards td to her.

The payoffs to going to court are therefore πtd−cP for the plaintiff and −πtd−cD for the defendant.            "
"68","Unsure of the actual damages, the defendant must deter large demands when the actual damages are small. To appeal to Proposition 6, let s(d) = 0, w1 (d) =πtd−cP, and w2 (d) =−πtd−cD. Because w1 (t)′2=−πt < 0, redefine the type‐space via  where φ is the difference between the worst‐case damages and the actual damages. Larger φ therefore mean higher payoffs for the defendant. Now define , and observe  and . Proposition 6 then implies that the plaintiff demands  and the probability of acceptance satisfies               "
"69","Hence the probability that a case goes to court is                "
"70","The results summarized in Proposition 6 are closely related to previous work on D1 in signaling games. Cho and Sobel (1990) show that D1 implies uniqueness and separation in monotonic signaling games with finitely many types.19Ramey (1996) extends Cho and Sobel's analysis to signaling games with a continuum of types, the sender's and receiver's strategies are elements of  and  respectively, and the game satisfies a more general monotonicity condition. (Mailath 1987 also analyzes separating equilibria in signaling games with a continuum of types.) Cho and Sobel (1990) observe that D1 implies uniqueness and separation in many models that are nonmonotonic (e.g., Reinganum and Wilde 1986), and in which the sender's action space is a closed interval, and the receiver has two responses (e.g., accept or fight). The results derived above complement those analyses by identifying a set of continuous‐type, nonmonotonic, signaling games which is easier to characterize than Cho and Sobel's set and in which D1 implies uniqueness and separation.

"71","In this article we offer a formal model of spoils politics. In spoils politics governments and opposing factions vie for control of the state and the spoils that come with it. Because of an absence of checks and balances, as well as limitations on transparency, governments tend to have discretion over the allocation of resources and an informational advantage regarding the true value of those resources. (For example, the government knows more about how much oil the national oil company is extracting.) But the opposing faction typically has the ability to rebel if the allocation proposed by the government is deemed inappropriate. Therefore, governments decide the allocation of resources with an eye towards buying off the opposition and thus avoiding a challenge."
"72","These factors create a vexing strategic problem for the government and the opposing faction vying for control of the state. Formalizing the interaction between government and opposition as a signaling game highlights and helps to answer two important questions. First, what makes conflict more likely? Do more (in expectation) resources, more destructive conflict technologies, or a stronger opposition make for more conflict? One might have supposed, for example, that a stronger opposition could lead to less conflict because the government will be more willing to offer more in order to buy the opposition off. The formal analysis shows this is not the case. Harder times, a stronger opposition, and lower costs to fighting all make fighting more likely for the same fundamental reason. They increase the value to the government of exploiting its private information relative to the cost of fighting. The effects of uncertainty on the probability of fighting depend on the strength of the opposition. If the opposition is weak enough, more uncertainty leads to more conflict."
"73","The second question, which is relevant to any theory where asymmetric information creates inefficiency, relates to the incentives facing the informed party to share its private information and eliminate the inefficiency. Sometimes the only bluff‐proof way to reveal the spoils to the opposition may be by giving members of the opposing faction influential positions in government. This, however, may make the opposition more powerful and thereby create a commitment problem. If the opposition could commit to not exploiting its more powerful position, the government would reveal the information to the opposition by bringing it into the government. But if the opposition cannot commit, the government faces both an information and a commitment problem. The former dominates the latter and the government shares power with the opposition when the efficiency gains which the government alone captures are large enough relative to the distributive shift induced by the change in the distribution of power. This occurs if the shift in power towards the opposition is sufficiently small and times are bad enough."
"74","Finally, the government‐opposition signaling game can be seen as one example of a larger class of coercive signaling games in which the sender has private information about the value of the receiver's outside option. This class includes models of war and litigation. In these games distributive struggles become inefficient when outsiders (the receiver) have to deter lowball offers from insiders (the sender) who have private information and cannot commit not to exploit it. The larger the insiders' temptation to exploit their private information, the more likely conflict becomes."
