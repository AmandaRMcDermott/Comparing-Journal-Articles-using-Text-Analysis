"1","Challenging Downs’s (1957) prediction that politicians should converge to the position of the median voter, scholars have recently asked, “Whatever happened to the median voter? Rather than attempt to move her ‘off the fence’ or ‘swing’ her from one party to another, today's campaigners seem to be ignoring her” (Fiorina 1999, 3). Although it is unlikely that complete convergence occurs between candidates (e.g., Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart 2001; Miller and Stokes 1963), many scholars have nonetheless suggested that members seek to be representative of their constituents lest they face electoral defeat (Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Erikson 1978; Erikson and Wright 1980).         "
"2","In contrast to solely focusing on electoral competition in a Downsian space, recent work on legislative behavior has taken an alternative approach to understanding representation and nonconvergence to the median by examining institutional explanations for polarization. For instance, members can face tensions between their party and constituency, particularly for cross‐pressured members in competitive districts. This research suggests that some members find it easier to converge to the median than others. Many studies of political parties focus on the positive electoral benefits of the party brand (Grynaviski 2010) and the need for collective action in order to enact a legislative agenda (Cox and McCubbins 1993, 2005). Parties provide a number of tangible resources to members, including campaign funding, valuable committee assignments, and deal making to shepherd legislation introduced by the member (Smith 2007). Members who are loyal to the party and vote the party line are much more likely to receive these benefits than are disloyal members. Much of this research suggests that there are benefits to voting with the party even if a member's district preferences lean away from the party position on a particular bill (Aldrich 1995; Rohde 1991). Thus, partisan conflict in Congress may reflect party influence on members (Fiorina and Levendusky 2006).         "
"3","In many cases, members’ partisan and constituent interests are reinforcing. However, some members are pulled in opposite directions by party and constituency interests (Bond and Fleisher 1990). These cross‐pressured members may have the most to lose from engaging in partisan behavior. Many party theorists find that members who are cross‐pressured by their party and constituency may be able to break party discipline on certain votes. As noted by Lebo, McGlynn, and Koger (2007), party unity is a double‐edged sword—it increases the likelihood of legislative success but can also expose members in moderate districts to electoral defeat. Similarly, Patty notes that a “fundamental tension occurs when [a] member's individual and collective interests are in conflict” (2008, 640).         "
"4","The rise of polarization in Congress since the 1970s has led scholars to question whether members are following the party rather than their constituents, leading to a decline in responsiveness to constituent interests and thus to the median voter (Fiorina and Levendusky 2006). Our analysis suggests that party polarization is not incompatible with responsiveness to a member's constituents, as members may focus their actions on winning support in a narrower constituency than the geographic constituency (Fenno 1978). In particular, we focus on the differential preferences of strong partisans and other individuals (including weak partisans and independents), whose electoral influence may vary by district type.         "
"5","In addition to party pressure, primary competition may cause members not to adopt the preferences of the median constituent in their districts. A member may face a competitive primary election challenge from within his or her own party (Brady, Han, and Pope 2007) and/or a strong general election challenge from the opposing party (Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002). Previous research has found that the electoral stage at which members expect an electoral challenger affects legislative behavior and coalition formation (Crisp, Kanthak, and Leijonhufvud 2004; Kanthak and Crisp 2005). The logic is that members who represent competitive districts (i.e., those that the opposing party has a chance of winning), and where the challenge is likely to come in a general election, will have the incentive to work across the aisle and engage in bipartisan collaboration. In contrast, members who represent districts that are safely Democratic (or Republican), and thus where the challenge is more likely to come in a primary election, may engage in partisan behavior in an attempt to shore up support from strong partisans, who make up a larger portion of the primary electorate (Geer 1988; Grofman 1993; Norrander 1989). While competitive primary and general elections are not mutually exclusive, we can think of members as focusing on gaining support from specific reelection constituencies, which will be related to where they anticipate challengers. Further, even in the general election, strong partisans are more likely to turn out to vote (e.g., Wattenberg and Brians 1999),1 and the median voter in these districts is more likely to be a strong partisan, thereby incentivizing the member to engage in partisan legislative discord (consistent with electorally responsive behavior).         "
"6","Hence, building on Mayhew's (1974) central premise that members of Congress are “single‐minded reelection seekers,” we argue that the electoral incentives of members influence the level of partisan conflict in Congress.2 Rather than just focusing on institutional features that incentivize members, however, we bring together the behavioral and institutional bases of partisan conflict. Following Ramirez (2009), we use the term “partisan conflict” loosely to refer to any outcome or scenario where Democrats and Republicans do not appear to be working together to achieve common goals.3 This includes party‐line voting on roll calls, partisan composition of cosponsorship coalitions, acrimonious floor speeches and rhetoric, and the use of procedural tactics against the opposing party.4 For instance, studies of partisan polarization in Congress consider partisan homogeneity in roll‐call voting as a sign of conflict and a lack of bipartisan cooperation. In conceptualizing party conflict, we purposely adopt a broad definition since citizens may have differing interpretations and reactions to various forms of congressional behavior. We hypothesize that voters who are Independents and weak partisans prefer that their member engage in bipartisan activities, whereas strong partisans prefer partisan behavior as a result of their greater likelihood of agreement with, and attachment to, their political party. Accordingly, members of Congress have incentives to exhibit a certain mix of bipartisan and partisan behavior depending on the composition of their districts and which electoral stage they expect competition.         "
"7","Aggregate‐level data show that members from competitive (general election) districts are less likely to engage in partisan conflict and more likely to behave in a manner that might be classified as bipartisan. These behaviors include (1) voting with opposing partisans on roll calls with greater frequency and (2) joining cosponsorship coalitions with members of the opposing party. With respect to roll‐call voting, Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan (2002) analyze congressional elections from 1956 to 1996 and find that, when controlling for district preferences (measured by the normal presidential vote) and a range of other factors, members with more extreme voting records (i.e., more liberal or conservative than the district median voter) are less likely to be reelected as compared to their colleagues whose voting behavior better represents their districts. In every election year between 1956 and 1996, roll‐call extremity has a negative effect on members’ general election vote share, even when controlling for factors such as challenger quality and spending. Substantively, a 25‐point shift in a member's Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) score away from the median voter (an approximately one standard deviation shift) decreases a member's vote share by 1 to 3 percentage points (Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002, 133). They find that this pattern is true across types of districts. For members in both marginal and safe seats, the extremity of a member's ADA score relative to his or her district's preferences adversely affects the probability of reelection. Since competitive districts have more moderate median voters, members who represent these districts will have more moderate voting records than members of more liberal (or conservative) districts where the median voter pulls the member toward the ideological poles. Similar results are found by Carson et al. (2010), who focus specifically on partisanship rather than ideological extremity.         "
"8","We find similar results using bill cosponsorship coalitions—members from more centrist districts are more likely to engage in bipartisan cosponsorship. In some ways, cosponsorship is an even better metric than roll‐call votes in assessing strategic decision making on the part of congresspersons because bill cosponsorship is in the purview of individual members and is less likely to be subject to agenda control (Kessler and Krehbiel 1996; Krehbiel 1995). Whereas previous work on cosponsorship tends to focus on the frequency of cosponsoring (Campbell 1982) or on the dyadic patterns of cosponsorship (Fowler 2006), we focus on the relative incidence of partisan and bipartisan cosponsorship, similar to roll‐call analyses that examine the extremity of a member's voting position.5 In Figure 1, we plot district6 preferences (proxied by the normal presidential vote7 in the district) against the percentage of the member's cosponsorships that are bipartisan for the 103rd–109th Congresses. Lower values of the normal vote indicate districts that are more competitive for the incumbent party. A member is coded as engaging in a bipartisan cosponsorship if he or she cosponsors a bill on which at least 20% of the bill's cosponsors are from the party opposite the party of the bill's original sponsor.8 All other cosponsorships are considered partisan cosponsorships. As is clear from the figure, members from moderate districts (i.e., normal votes near 50% or less) are more likely to cosponsor legislation with members of the opposite party.         "
"9","                 Regression of Bipartisanship on Normal Vote                      "
"10","This relationship is robust to the inclusion of several member‐level control variables (majority party status, gender, age, tenure, leadership position) and Congress‐level controls—divided government, majority seat share, and presidential election years.9 As shown in the first two columns of Table 1, there exists an inverse relationship between the normal vote and bipartisan cosponsorship activity, either estimating an OLS model or a quasi‐binomial model10 to predict the frequency of bipartisan cosponsorship. Moving from a competitive district where the normal presidential vote is 50% to a moderately safe district where the normal vote is 60% corresponds to a 6.1% decrease in the percent of bills cosponsored by the member that are bipartisan. Over the period of analysis, the median member cosponsored 101 bipartisan bills (out of a total 180 cosponsored), so a 6.1% effect is equivalent to decreasing the number of bipartisan bills by 11. Alternatively, we can consider the percentage of bills that a member cosponsors and its range in the data. For the period of analysis, the interquartile range is bounded by 47% and 65% bipartisan cosponsorships, with a median of 56%. Thus, the magnitude of the effect of the normal vote is quite substantial when considering where in the distribution it would move a member. Looking at a few examples from California illustrates this pattern. The normal presidential vote in Representative Jim Costa's (CA‐20, Dem) Fresno district is 51% Democratic and in the 109th Congress 59% of the bills that he cosponsored were bipartisan. In contrast, the normal presidential vote is 87% Democratic in the nearby Berkeley and Oakland areas and only 24% of the bills that Representative Barbara Lee (CA‐9, Dem) cosponsored were bipartisan.         "
"11","District preferences not only explain between‐member variation in bipartisan activity but also within‐member variation across time. In the third and fourth columns of Table 1, we include fixed effects for members.11 In both the OLS and quasi‐binomial models, even when controlling for member fixed effects and Congress‐level variables, the normal presidential vote exerts a significant negative effect on bipartisan cooperation. Drawing on the third model, a 10% increase in the normal vote is associated with nearly a 2% decrease in bipartisan cooperation. While substantively smaller than the effects that examine variation between members, this effect still shows the pull of a member's constituency. That is, when a member's district becomes more partisan, the member's bipartisan cooperation declines. Indeed, there have been some notable cases of members becoming more frequent bipartisan cosponsors as their district becomes more moderate. Consider the example of Steve Chabot (OH‐1), a Republican who represented southwestern Ohio from 1995 to 2008. Between the 104th and 107th Congresses,12 the normal Republican presidential vote in this district declined from 57% to 47%. Over this period, the percent of his cosponsorship coalitions that were bipartisan increased from 41% to 55%. Certainly, district preferences are not the only factors that explain legislative bipartisanship.13 However, these patterns suggest that bipartisan cooperation, like patterns of legislative extremism more generally, are strongly related to district preferences. Further, the propensity to reach across the aisle is not simply a fixed characteristic of a member. Rather, it endogenously changes in response to electoral and strategic incentives. The implication of this fact is that district‐level changes in the composition of voters—either through redistricting, mobility, or political and demographic shifts—can significantly alter the legislative dynamics in Congress even if the composition of the legislature remains the same.         "
"12","These empirical patterns suggest that there may be a differential desire for bipartisanship within the public. Accordingly, we turn from looking at district types to analyzing individual‐level behavior. Whereas voters who are strong partisans may not want their copartisan representative to compromise his or her beliefs in order to reach agreement with the other party, people less attached to or aligned with a political party may believe that compromise and collaboration are the basis of effective government. Hence, the composition of individual voters underlying district preferences should lead some members to engage in behavior contributing to party conflict and others to engage in bipartisan behavior. The experiments presented in this article explore the individual‐level dynamics that underlie this electoral connection."
"13","To empirically evaluate whether partisan polarization affects mass perceptions of Congress as an institution and support for individual members, we conducted two survey experiments over the Internet as part of the 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) administered by YouGov/Polimetrix."
"14","The CCES preelection wave was conducted during October 2008, and the postelection wave was conducted two weeks following Election Day (November 4, 2008). In addition to common content questions administered to 32,800 respondents, 1,000 respondents participated in our experimental module.14 All experiments were conducted in the preelection wave and were placed after the common content on the questionnaire.         "
"15","The CCES uses YouGov/Polimetrix's matched random sample methodology (Ansolabehere 2009). This procedure uses matching to select representative samples from nonrandomly selected pools of respondents. After a target sample, or random sample from the target population, is drawn, each member of the target sample is matched to an individual in the pool of opt‐in survey respondents. Matching is based on demographics, voter, and consumer characteristics. The matched cases are then weighted using propensity scores. The resulting sample is a nationally representative panel of U.S. adults. Differences between this method and random digit dialing methods administered during the 2008 election were slight (Ansolabehere 2009). As shown in online Appendix A4, distributions of gender, age, race, education, and partisanship were generally similar to those in the 2008 American National Election Study, which was administered face‐to‐face to a probability sample. All of the experiments presented actual data to respondents and required no deception, thereby enhancing the ecological validity of the findings. Randomization was successful. As shown in online Appendix A5, experimental conditions were balanced on observables.         "
"16","Although the dominant view has been that “members are not held individually responsible for their collective performance in governing” (Jacobson 2004, 227) and Fenno (1978) suggests that members of Congress can make up for negative evaluations of Congress by running against Washington, there are a number of recent studies that indicate that aggregate approval or confidence of Congress is politically important. First, approval of individual members and approval of Congress track closely over time even if they have very different intercepts (Born 1990; Kimball 2005; Ramirez 2009). Thus, “an unpopular Congress may harm the reelection chances of incumbents and members of the majority party” (Kimball 2005, 64). Recent work by Jones (2010) finds that party polarization has increased the magnitude of the relationship between congressional approval and incumbent vote shares. Second, negative evaluations of Congress may discourage prospective politicians from serving (Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse 2001, 145; Kimball 2005). Third, negative evaluations may disincentivize current politicians from tackling difficult but important policy issues (Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse 2001, 145). Finally, low levels of trust in government may lead the public to be less supportive of policies that incur real costs but yield little direct benefits to some citizens, including race‐conscious and social welfare policies (Hetherington and Globetti 2002).         "
"17","To examine how perceptions of party conflict affect opinions of Congress as an institution, we conducted a survey experiment in which we manipulated the extent to which Congress was portrayed as being a place where members of opposite parties cooperated and worked together. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the first “partisan” condition, respondents were provided the following information:"
"18","                              "
"19","In a recent session of the United States House, about 30% of legislation that was introduced had bipartisan support—that is, it had support from significant numbers of both Democrats and Republicans."
"20","In the second “bipartisan” condition, respondents were shown the following blurb:"
"21","                              "
"22","In a recent session of the United States House, about 80% of legislation that became law had bipartisan support—that is, it had support from significant numbers of both Democrats and Republicans."
"23","The information in both blurbs is accurate. Note that we are able to manipulate the level of party conflict and still remain truthful by distinguishing between bill introductions and bill passage.15 Although this distinction may be substantively meaningful to some respondents, we believe that is unlikely, especially since respondents saw only one of the two blurbs. More important, although that technical distinction might affect their view of specific pieces of legislation, it should not affect how they view the institution as a whole. Hence, our manipulation is able to present respondents with two different levels of party conflict while holding other features of Congress constant.            "
"24","After the blurb about the extent of partisan conflict was presented, respondents were asked, “Based on this information, how much confidence do you have in the U.S. Congress?”16 with the following five response options: “a great deal,”“a lot,”“a moderate amount,”“a little,” and “none.” The main independent variable was a dummy indicating whether respondents were assigned to the condition presenting Congress as bipartisan, with the partisan presentation as the baseline. Although we did not explicitly provide a control condition,17 the common content did include an item asking respondents about their overall approval of Congress on a 4‐point scale ranging from “strongly disapprove” to “strongly approve” (question CC335con), which can be used as a baseline.            "
"25","In order to estimate the overall treatment effect, we estimated the following regression model via ordinary least squares:18"
"26","To assess the moderating effect of partisanship, we estimated the following model:                "
"27","We included control variables for age, gender, race, education, and media use.20 Although the treatment was randomly assigned and we can obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal effect in the absence of these controls, we included them to increase the efficiency of the estimates. Additionally, they provide baselines with which to assess the substantive significance of the treatment effects. All variables were coded to lie between zero and one, meaning that we can interpret a one‐unit change in an independent variable (i.e., going from the lowest value to the highest value) as inducing a 100β percentage‐point change in the dependent variable.21"
"28","When the legislative activity of Congress is framed as being characterized by partisan conflict, people have less confidence in the legislative branch as an institution. As illustrated in Figure 2, confidence in Congress is higher among all partisan groups in the “bipartisan” condition compared to the “partisan” condition. Regression results confirm this pattern. As shown in the first column of Table 2, the treatment information showing that 80% of passed legislation has bipartisan support significantly increases confidence in Congress as compared to information showing a much lower rate of bipartisanship on introduced legislation (β1= .031, p= .021, two‐tailed). We can use the estimates of the effects of party identification on the dependent variable to put this treatment effect into context. Given that the survey was conducted when Democrats controlled both chambers, it is unsurprising that Democrats have more confidence in Congress than Republicans. Strong Republicans’ level of confidence was .09 units less than Independents, and strong Democrats’ level of confidence was .16 units more than Independents. The effect of the bipartisan framing is about 12% of the effect of party identification. This is quite large given that party identification is considered to be one of the most important explanatory variables in the study of political behavior (Campbell et al. 1960).            "
"29","                 Impact of Bipartisanship on Confidence in Congress by Partisanship (Study 1)                         "
"30"," Note: Y‐axis represents difference in percentage of respondents having at least “a moderate amount” of confidence in Congress between “bipartisan” condition and “partisan” condition.                        "
"31","To calibrate these results against a baseline, we can compare them to respondents’ overall approval of Congress. Prior to receiving any treatment information, 43% of respondents strongly disapproved of Congress’ job performance. Forty‐six percent of respondents reported having little or no confidence in Congress in the “bipartisan” condition; this figure was 55% in the “partisan” condition. Although we did not include an explicit manipulation check,22 these results suggest that the treatments achieved their desired objectives.            "
"32","This treatment effect was not moderated by partisanship per theoretical expectations. Bipartisanship is universally considered a positive trait of Congress as an institution, regardless of one's partisan leanings. As shown in the second column of Table 2, none of the interaction terms between partisanship and the treatment dummy are statistically significant at conventional levels. Moreover, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that β6, β7, β8, and β9 are jointly equal to zero (p = .61). Also, none of the coefficients associated with the interaction term are significantly different from one another, meaning that the treatment effects were constant across partisan subgroups. We also estimated a model pooling Republican and Democratic respondents and including dummy variables for “strong partisans,”“weak partisans,” and interactions between these two dummies and the “bipartisan” treatment. As shown in the third column of Table 2, we find that there are no significant differences between Independents, weak partisans, and strong partisans with respect to the treatment effect. Hence, Americans of all partisan leanings are more confident in Congress when informed that it has engaged in more bipartisan activity.            "
"33","This study suggests that partisan conflict lowers the standing of Congress in the public's eyes. This is true not only for Independents, but also for Americans across the partisan spectrum. Thus, when evaluating bipartisan cooperation in the abstract, the public is generally supportive of members of Congress working with members of the opposite party. These experimental findings are consistent with previous observational (Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse 1995) and aggregate‐level (Ramirez 2009) studies showing that partisan conflict decreases congressional approval. However, it is important to note that the public votes for individual members, not for a party or for Congress as a whole. Although the public may not prefer high levels of partisanship in Congress, individual citizens have no vote over aggregate congressional behavior as the electoral pressures fall on individual members rather than on the institution as a whole. Therefore, in the second experimental study, we assess whether mass preferences for bipartisanship in the abstract apply to the behavior of individual members.            "
"34","In Study 2, we explored how partisan conflict affects the public's view of members of Congress. There are a number of ways we could portray members as engaging in partisan or bipartisan behavior, including presenting their voting records and their cosponsorship coalitions. As the most direct test of partisan behavior, we decided to examine roll‐call voting behavior, which may be more intuitively understandable than cosponsorship coalitions, which requires respondents to have some knowledge of legislative procedure. Our interest in this experimental design is not to capture the actual information that members communicate to voters in campaigns, but rather to quantify the more qualitative information that members deliver. For example, former Senator Gordon Smith (R‐OR), a moderate from a Democratic‐leaning state, said in a 2008 campaign advertisement, “I’m Gordon Smith and I approve working across party lines” (Smith 2008). The narrator of the ad mentioned Smith's bipartisan work with Democrats such as Senator Barack Obama and Governor Ted Kulongoski on environmental legislation.            "
"35","We asked respondents to evaluate a member of Congress based on his voting behavior. Democrats were asked to evaluate Bud Cramer (D‐AL), Republicans were asked to evaluate Steve LaTourette (R‐OH), and Independents were randomly assigned to one of the two members.23 We did not present respondents with their actual member of Congress because most legislators’ voting behaviors do not vary dramatically from year to year, requiring deceptive information (that a clearly conservative/liberal member was moderate, or vice versa) that would decrease the ecological validity of the findings.24 Both Cramer and LaTourette were unique among their parties in actually having a dramatic change in their voting records in the two‐year period before the administration of the survey.            "
"36","Respondents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In one condition, we assigned respondents to view the member's voting history in 2007, which almost always toed the party line:"
"37","                              "
"38","Some members of Congress work with members of their own party almost all of the time. Other members work with members of both parties.25 On key issues identified by the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) [American Conservative Union (ACU)] in 2007, Representative Bud Cramer (AL‐5) [Steve LaTourette (OH‐14)] almost always voted the Democratic [Republican] position.                  "
"39","In the second condition, respondents viewed the member's 2006 record, which was more bipartisan:"
"40","                              "
"41","Some members of Congress work with members of their own party almost all of the time. Other members work with members of both parties. On key issues identified by the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) [American Conservative Union (ACU)] in 2006, Representative Bud Cramer (AL‐5) [Steve LaTourette (OH‐14)] took the Democratic [Republican] position on about half the votes and the Republican [Democratic] position on about half the votes."
"42","The first sentence of the blurb is intended to focus the respondent's attention on the member's level of intraparty collaboration. Hence, we communicate various aspects of partisan conflict that citizens might find distasteful: ideological extremity, lack of accommodation and cooperation, and incivility."
"43","Comparing approval ratings between conditions allows us to assess whether citizens had more favorable opinions of members who engage in partisan activity, contributing to congressional polarization. By simply changing the year of the voting record—which should be immaterial to respondents—we are simultaneously able to manipulate bipartisan legislative behavior, hold the member constant, and remain truthful to respondents."
"44","After the blurb about voting behavior was presented, respondents were asked, “Based on this information, do you approve or disapprove of the job Representative Cramer [LaTourette] is doing in Congress?” with the following five response options: “strongly approve,”“somewhat approve,”“neither approve nor disapprove,”“somewhat disapprove,” and “strongly disapprove.” This 5‐point measure served as the principal dependent variable of interest. The main independent variable was a dummy indicating whether respondents were assigned to the condition showing bipartisan voting behavior, with the party line voting blurb as the baseline. While we did not explicitly provide a control condition, the common content did include an item asking respondents about their overall approval of their member of Congress on a 4‐point scale ranging from “strongly disapprove” to “strongly approve” (question CC335rep), which can be used as a baseline."
"45","Although we are ultimately interested in how perceptions of bipartisanship affect voting decisions, asking respondents about their vote intentions for a member that would never appear on their ballot may have been confusing. Consequently, we use job approval as the dependent variable of interest. Nonetheless, our findings do speak to vote choice as approval strongly predicts voting intentions. Among respondents who reported voting for the incumbent House member, 48% strongly approved of the member's job performance and an additional 42% approved somewhat. In contrast, among respondents who reported voting for the challenger, only 2% strongly approved of the incumbent and 13% somewhat approved (χ2(3) = 269.8, p < .001).            "
"46","In order to estimate the overall treatment effect, we estimated the following regression model:                "
"47","To assess the moderating effect of strength of partisanship, we estimated the following model:                "
"48","Overall, Americans were not more favorable to members who exhibited a less polarized voting record, but there was significant heterogeneity by strength of partisanship. As illustrated in Figure 3, strong identifiers negatively respond to the member when told that he is engaging in bipartisan behavior, whereas weak identifiers and Independents are positively disposed to bipartisanship, which nets to an overall null effect. Returning to the statistical models in equations (3) and (4), we first show the results pooling Democrats, Republicans, and Independents (and accordingly evaluations of both Cramer and LaTourette) together. The first column of Table 3 presents coefficient estimates from equation (3). The bipartisan information relative to the partisan information did not significantly increase approval of the member.26 However, the effects vary significantly by partisan attachment. Whereas Independents and weak partisans were supportive of bipartisan behavior, strong Democrats and Republicans actually approved of the members less when told they voted with the opposing party. The second column of Table 3 presents coefficient estimates from equation (4). Among Independents, the treatment effect is positive and statistically significant (β1= .108, p < .001), indicating that Independents in the bipartisan treatment condition approved of the member nearly .11 units more than Independents in the partisan condition. Compared to Independents, the treatment effect was significantly more negative among strong partisans (β4=−.183, p < .001). Moreover, strong partisans approved of the member significantly less when told he voted with members of the opposite party (β2+β4=−.075, p < .001).            "

"50"," Note: Y‐axis represents difference in percentage of respondents either “somewhat” or “strongly” approving of Cramer [LaTourette] between “bipartisan” condition and “partisan” condition.                        "
"51","Finally, weak Democrats and Republicans were also positively disposed to bipartisanship and behaved much more like Independents than strong partisans. The interaction term between the treatment dummy and the weak partisan dummy (β5) was statistically insignificant, meaning that weak partisans and Independents were statistically indistinguishable with respect to their response to the treatment information. Analyzing the treatment effect within the subgroup, weak partisans were more approving of the member when he was portrayed as bipartisan (β3+β5= .116, p < .001). Despite their partisan affiliations, weak partisans have preferences for bipartisanship that are more similar to Independents than to strong partisans, as the treatment effect was significantly different between strong and weak partisans (β4−β5=−.191, p < .001). We also replicated our analyses examining the Cramer and LaTourette blurbs separately. As shown in columns 3–6 of Table 3, the estimates are similar to the pooled results. Hence, whereas strong partisans were actually negatively affected by bipartisan legislative behavior, this effect was offset by approval of bipartisanship among Independents and weak partisans.

"52","The findings from Study 1 provide microlevel evidence consistent with extant aggregate‐level findings and demonstrate little heterogeneity within the public by strength of partisanship. When combined with the findings from Study 2, the results offer a new way to think about party conflict, representation, and mass preferences. A priori, we could have expected a number of potential positive findings, including preferences for partisanship among members and partisanship in the institution; preferences for bipartisanship among members and bipartisanship in the institution; preferences for partisanship among members and bipartisanship in the institution; or preferences for bipartisanship among members and partisanship in the institution. As mentioned previously, theories of party cues and partisan rationalization would predict the first outcome. In contrast, previous findings of general unhappiness with discord in Congress would predict the second outcome. Yet, we find the third outcome, which is both consistent with our theoretical expectations and helps resolve some existing questions in the literature, such as why we have observed persistent polarization and discord in Congress despite the damage it provides collectively to the institution as a whole."
"53","What are the implications of these findings for our understanding of polarization in Congress? First, since the median voter may differ in partisan strength across districts, these results may help explain why bipartisan voting and cosponsorship behavior is most prevalent among members from marginal districts and less prevalent among members from safe districts. Second, strong partisans may support abstract conceptions of bipartisanship, but not when specifically applied to the voting behavior of a copartisan member of Congress. This is similar to the commonly found pattern in the literature on political tolerance (e.g., McClosky 1964; Prothro and Grigg 1960), which finds that Americans support civil liberties as abstract principles, but not when applied in specific circumstances or when applied to unpopular groups such as communists and atheists. Thus, our understanding of representation and the extent to which researchers judge members as responsive may need to be conditioned on what segments of the electorate members are responding to. Whereas a partisan Congress is not representative of the preferences of the public as a whole, individual members may be representative even when they engage in partisan behavior.         "
"54","Finally, these results reconceptualize previous explanations of public attitudes toward Congress positing that the public's negative perception of the institution stems from members denigrating it for electoral benefit. Early work by Fenno (1975, 1978) observed that people are generally favorable toward their own member of Congress but are much less positive in their evaluations of Congress more generally, consistent with members running for Congress by running against Congress. Subsequent work on “Fenno's paradox” suggests that people use different criteria for evaluating their own member than for evaluating Congress as a whole. For instance, Parker and Davidson (1979) and Born (1990) argue that whereas Congress is judged (poorly) on the basis of the process and output of lawmaking, individual members are judged (favorably) on the basis of constituency service and personal characteristics. Actions such as casework and position taking can assist members in building a personal vote and increasing support among their constituents (Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987) but may not translate into positive evaluations of Congress as an institution. Mutz and Flemming (1999) suggest a social‐psychological process of negative perceptual biases when making evaluations in the aggregate, combined with positive perceptual biases when evaluating the local or personal, leading citizens to use different criteria when evaluating Congress versus individual Congresspersons.         "
"55","In contrast, our findings offer an alternative understanding of Fenno's paradox, suggesting that even when citizens evaluate similar criteria, what people want from individual members is different from what they want from Congress as a whole. Although the public generally rebukes Congress in the aggregate for partisan bickering, some citizens reward individual members for eschewing bipartisan cooperation. Hence, we present a new paradox: voters’ displeasure with discord in Congress as a macrolevel institution is due to their support of those same behaviors performed at the microlevel by members of that institution. Simply put, citizens disapprove of Congress because it is composed of officials with characteristics they like. This paradox is explained by some voters’ inconsistent standards of evaluating similar behaviors by level of the institution.         "
"56","Hence, this study addresses the question raised by previous studies (e.g., Ramirez 2009) that voters are less approving of Congress when it engages in partisan conflict but that members continue to engage in discord. Although citizens (including strong partisans) approve of Congress more when it effuses an image of bipartisanship, individual members—particularly those from safe districts characterized by primary election competition—are individually incentivized to behave in a partisan manner, thereby harming the collective image of the institution. While Cox and McCubbins (1993) observed that parties in legislatures can wield selective benefits to solve collective action problems and compel members to behave in the interest of the party brand, no similar institution exists for Congress as a whole to protect its reputation.         "
"57","In addition to addressing an important problem, our studies also raise additional questions that can be explored by subsequent research. For instance, how do voters respond to polarization on other forms of legislative behavior, such as the formation of bill cosponsorship coalitions? Due to agenda‐setting power, members have less flexibility in demonstrating bipartisanship on roll‐call votes. Can bipartisan cosponsorship by members offset the perception of increased rancor and partisanship on roll‐call voting? An experiment in which members’ activities in both of these areas is manipulated can help address these questions. In addition to exploring the impact of bipartisanship on evaluations of Congress and individual members, future studies can also include evaluations of specific pieces of legislation, examining those with bipartisan versus partisan support. Subsequent research can vary both the substantive content of legislation and its bipartisan nature to see how much the policy substance of a bill matters in voters’ minds, compared to the cue of bipartisan support. Examining public opinion related to Congress and its actions can potentially shed light on important theoretical debates, particularly those which posit the presence of an electoral connection."
"58","In addition, future work ought to explore why bipartisanship is preferred by strong partisans in general, but not for individual members of Congress. One possibility is that strong partisans prefer that copartisan members engage in partisan behavior because the member is seen as protecting their interests. However, if these individuals view bipartisanship in Congress as a whole as occurring when the opposing party compromises its position (but when their own party does not), this seemingly paradoxical set of positions makes sense. That is, bipartisanship occurs when the other party moves from their preferred position. Leveraging differences in expectations for how likely “your side” prevails when they are in the majority versus minority may help uncover whether people see bipartisanship as leading to more “wins” or ”losses” for their side than would have occurred in the absence of bipartisanship."
"59","Beyond the specific topic of inquiry in this article, our results speak to a number of important questions in the broader study of Congress and electoral accountability in political institutions. For example, this research suggests that even in a period of anti‐incumbent sentiment and proclaimed desires among the public for greater interparty cooperation, many members of Congress may end up better off engaging in partisan conflict. Additionally, from a comparative perspective, our results suggest that confidence in political institutions may be lower in single‐member district electoral systems when citizen preferences over who is representing their districts conflicts with preferences for legislative behavior in the institution at large. Since the public votes for members of Congress, rather than for parties as in parliamentary systems, the incentives for partisanship by individual members may trump the collective incentives for bipartisanship."
