"1","We first briefly (as it extends Krehbiel's 1996 model) introduce our basic model's setup and then derive the EGIs. We then employ three different assumptions about parties to make our model more consistent with arguments assuming an important partisan role and derive corresponding EGIs."
"2","Like Krehbiel, we assume a unidimensional policy space (e.g., liberalism‐conservatism) and players with single‐peaked preferences. Players include the median voters and override pivots in the House and Senate, the liberal and conservative filibuster pivots in the Senate, and the president."
"3","Key differences between our basic model and Krehbiel's are our incorporation of an additional filibuster pivot that Krehbiel does not model (roughly, a liberal [conservative] pivot when the president is liberal [conservative]) and our inclusion of bicameralism. Modeling this additional filibuster pivot is more consistent with a preference‐based approach, as this pivot may not always abstain from challenging the president or the override pivot whose preference is closer to her own. Incorporating bicameralism provides a more general theory of gridlock and makes more precise EGI specification possible; although ignoring key features such as the need for oversized majorities (e.g., as produced by possible Senate filibustering), which may make bicameralism's effects conditional or nonmonotonic, theoretical work has established the desirability of integrating bicameralism as a determinant of policy change and stability (e.g., Hammond and Miller 1987; Riker 1992; Tsebelis and Money 1997; for corroborating experimental results, see Bottom et al. 2000).            "
"4","The game sequence is as follows: (1) the Senate median proposes a bill;5 (2) each filibuster pivot (a conservative and a liberal) chooses whether to filibuster, leading to a status quo outcome, or to let the game proceed to the next stage; (3) the House median rejects or accepts the bill, either maintaining the status quo or allowing the game's continuation;5 (4) the president signs (leading to policy change) or vetoes the bill; (5) if the bill is vetoed, the chamber override pivots decide whether to sustain or to override the president's veto, with a new policy emerging only when both override.            "
"5","To reiterate, we assume no party role for now. Majority parties lack agenda control, individual lawmakers vote according to their preferences without considering partisanship, and the president cannot discipline his party's members."
"6","Let fL and fR represent the ideal points of the left and right filibuster pivots, respectively, VH and VS the ideal points of the House and Senate override pivots, respectively, MH and MS the ideal points of the House and Senate median voters, respectively, P the ideal point of the president, and q the status quo. Given that we assume complete information and the game is dynamic, subgame perfect equilibrium is an appropriate solution concept (Fudenberg and Tirole 1991). Equilibrium gridlock intervals are derived by solving for the subgame perfect equilibrium policy under different status quos and player preference configurations (see Appendix A for a formal definition). Consistent with Krehbiel's definition of gridlock as “the absence of policy change in equilibrium in spite of the existence of a legislative majority that favors change” (1998, 26), we define gridlock as situations in which the status quo is maintained in equilibrium; the sole difference distinguishing our approach to gridlock is that we define a legislative majority as a Senatorial majority.5 The EGI then consists of status quos maintained in equilibrium (given our focus on EGIs rather than on equilibrium policy outcomes for empirical testing, we do not show the subgame perfect equilibrium policy here). Proposition 1 gives the EGI under different player preference configurations.            "
"7","Proposition 1:  (Preferences with No Party Role)            "
"8","Depending on player preference configurations, the EGI can be grouped into three cases."
"9","Case 1: When P ≥ Max{VH, VS} (where VS > MS and VH > MH), the EGI is [Min{fL, MH}, Max{VH,VS}]. Symmetrically, when P ≤ Min{VH, VS} (where VS < MS and VH < MH), the EGI is [Min{VH,VS}, Max{fR, MH}].            "
"10","Case 2: When Max{MH, MS}≤ P ≤ Max{VH,VS}, the EGI is [Min{fL, MH}, Max{P, fR}]. Symmetrically, when Min{VH, VS}≤ P ≤ Min{MH, MS}, the EGI is [Min{P, fL}, Max{fR, MH}].            "
"11","Case 3: When MS≤ P ≤ MH, the EGI is [fL, Max{fR, MH}]. Similarly, when MH≤ P ≤ MS, the EGI is [Min{MH, fL}, fR].            "
"12","Proof:   Appendix A.            "
"13","While our bicameral model and Krehbiel's unicameral model are preference‐based, the EGIs produced either differ significantly (Case 1) or deal with situations not covered by the unicameral model (Cases 2 and 3). In Case 1, which reflects when the president is rather extreme, our bicameral model specifies the EGI more precisely than its unicameral analogue by indicating whether the House or Senate veto override pivot determines the interval. In Cases 2 and 3, the filibuster pivot closer to the president plays an important role of determining the EGI. In Case 2, the president is less extreme than either the House or Senate override pivots; when the president is conservative, and assuming that the left filibuster is more liberal than the House median, the EGI is between the left filibuster and the president if the latter is more extreme than the right filibuster and between the left and right filibusters otherwise. In Case 3, the president is quite moderate, lying between the two chamber medians, as bicameralism again influences the EGI. With respect to bicameralism, it also indicates that, as Corollary 1 shows, bicameral differences affect EGI size nonmonotonically."
"14","Corollary 1:   Assume that the House median is between two filibuster pivots (i.e., fL < MH < fR).5 The preference difference between the two chambers matters for the width of the EGI if and only if P > VH > VS(symmetrically, when P < VH < VS), in which case the EGI is[fL, VH] ([VH, fR]).            "
"15","Hence, actors' relative preferences condition the effect of bicameral differences. When such differences matter, it is due to the distance between the Senate filibuster pivot and the House override pivot rather than to that between chamber medians (an inference differing from previous bicameral theories mainly because we incorporate the Senate filibuster rule). These results cast doubt on empirical tests, such as Binder's (1999), specifying that greater ideological difference between the chamber medians always increases political gridlock and reduces legislative productivity.5"
"16","Evaluating party effects on legislative gridlock requires models in which party plays different roles and ascertaining the conditions determining whether and how party is theoretically essential. While modeling party roles endogenously to see how they affect the EGI in equilibrium would be ideal, we follow Krehbiel (2001) and Cox and McCubbins (1999) by assuming that parties play some fixed roles. In our different models, we assign distinct roles to parties, mainly legislative agenda control and exercising party discipline on floor voting, and evaluate whether party is theoretically essential in determining gridlock and assess subsequently which model(s) gain(s) empirical support.            "
"17","As a first step, we modify our game structure to incorporate possible agenda control by majority‐party medians (Cox and McCubbins 1993, 1997, 1999; Aldrich and Rohde 2000; Cox 2001; but see Krehbiel 2001). In contrast to our basic model, we specify that the Senate majority‐party median (or, in practice, the party leaders or committee chairs whom they select), rather than the chamber median, proposes a bill and the House majority median rejects or accepts it in stage (1). Additionally, relative to our basic model, instead of the House median accepting or rejecting a proposal, in stage (3) each chamber median chooses whether or not to exercise a veto and retain the status quo, with the game proceeding to (4) only if both medians decide not to veto.5 Despite the shift in agenda‐setting power, member floor votes are determined by preferences, and chamber medians, as in the basic model, remain decisive for final passage as the medians must endorse policy shifts in equilibrium (alternatively, allowing chamber medians to amend the policy proposal of party medians produces the same EGI despite different welfare effects). Proposition 2 describes the EGI for different cases.            "
"18","Proposition 2:  (Party as Agenda‐Setter)            "
"19","Letting MPMH and MPMS represent the ideal points of the majority‐party medians in the House and Senate respectively, the EGI can be grouped into three cases that depend on player preference configurations.            "
"20","Case 1: When P ≥ Max{VH, VS} (where VS > MS and VH > MH), the EGI is [Min{fL, MH, MPMH, MPMS}, Max{VH,VS, MPMH, MPMS}]. Symmetrically, when P ≤ Min{VH, VS} (where VS < MS and VH < MH), the EGI is [Min{VH,VS, MPMH, MPMS}, Max{fR, MH, MPMH, MPMS}].            "
"21","Case 2: When Max{MH, MS}≤ P ≤ Max{VH,VS}, the EGI is [Min{fL, MH, MPMH, MPMS}, Max{P, fR, MPMH, MPMS}]. Symmetrically, when Min{VH, VS}≤ P ≤ Min{MH, MS}, the EGI is [Min{P, fL, MPMH, MPMS}, Max{fR, MH, MPMH, MPMS}].            "
"22","Case 3: When MS≤ P ≤ MH, the EGI is [Min{fL, MPMH, MPMS}, Max{fR, MH, MPMH, MPMS}]. Similarly, when MH≤ P ≤ MS, the EGI is [Min{MH, fL, MPMH, MPMS}, Max{fR, MPMH}].5"
"23","Comparing Propositions 1 and 2 finds that, because majority parties now control the agenda and can exercise gatekeeping authority, the EGI given partisan agenda‐setting is at least as large as for the basic preference model. Gatekeeping's impact on the EGI is greater when the difference between the majority‐party medians and the filibuster or override pivot is larger."
"24","Additionally, given agenda‐setting authority, bicameralism's impact varies considerably depending upon the relative preferences of key actors. Differences between chamber medians have no impact when party medians are more extreme than the override point unless the House median is more extreme than the Senate majority‐party median; they lead to a wider EGI if both chambers' majority‐party medians are sufficiently extreme to exceed some chamber cutpoints."
"25","A stronger view of parties is that they help solve collective action and coordination problems so that members' long‐term interests are maximized given repeated play (e.g., Cox and McCubbins 1993, 1997; Aldrich and Rohde 2000). Various theoretical and empirical analyses have focused on the mechanisms by which this process may operate (e.g., Rohde 1991; Binder, Lawrence, and Maltzman 1999; Aldrich and Rohde 2000; Calvert and Fox 2000; Hager and Talbert 2000; Cox and Poole 2001; Nokken 2000; Snyder and Groseclose 2000; McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2001; Snyder and Ting 2001). However, previous theoretical work does not explore party's impact on gridlock intervals (e.g., Krehbiel 1998), while most empirical studies examine partisan effects without an explicit theory (e.g., Mayhew 1991; Coleman 1999; Binder 1999; Howell et al. 2000). To capture possible party influence, we recast our basic model by incorporating party unity, assuming each party's members vote identically to its median because of party discipline—an assumption that might seem extreme but that is consistent with theoretical and empirical findings for various circumstances.5 We assume that the president cannot influence the members of her legislative party and that a party in one chamber cannot influence its counterpart in the other. The game sequence is: (1) analogous to the Senate chamber median in the basic model, the Senate majority‐party median proposes a bill; (2) the Senate minority‐party median chooses whether to filibuster, continuing the status quo, or to let the game proceed to the next stage; (3) the House majority‐party median chooses whether to reject the bill (maintaining the status quo and ending the game) or to accept the bill (continuing the game); (4) the president decides whether to sign (leading to policy change) or to veto; (5) if the bill is vetoed, the majority and minority parties in both chambers choose whether to sustain or to override, with a new policy prevailing if both chambers prefer to override.            "
"26","Note that this game sequence holds only when the Senate majority party controls insufficient seats to invoke cloture (which we define as a supermajority) and the Senate and House majorities hold insufficient seats to override presidential vetoes. A supermajority invalidates stage (2) because of party unity and any majority party holding greater than two‐thirds of the seats negates the opposing‐party's veto override power."
"27","Letting |MPH| and |MPS| represent the number of majority‐party members in the House and the Senate, |C| the number of legislators required to end a filibuster, |VO| the number required to override presidential vetoes, and MIPMH and MIPMS the ideal points of the House and Senate minority‐party medians, we have two Propositions—one for when the same majority party controls both chambers and the other for when party control is split (e.g., during the 97th–99th Congresses).            "
"28","Proposition 3:  (Party Unity—Same Party Control in Both Chambers)            "
"29","Assuming that the majority party, MPMS and MPMH, is Republican (findings are symmetric for Democrats), there are two possible cases.            "
"30","Case 1: When |MPS|≥|C|, the EGI is between MPMH and MPMS if P ≥ Min {MPMH, MPMS} or if |MPH|≥|VO| and |MPS|≥|VO|; otherwise, the EGI is [Max{P, I}, Max{MPMH, MPMS}], where I = Min{MIPMi, i =H, S: for i, |MPi| < |VO|}.            "
"31","Case 2: When |MPS| < |C|, the EGI is [MIPMS, Max{MPMH, MPMS}] under each of the following conditions: (1) MIPMS < MIPMH; (2) MIPMH < MIPMS < P; and (3) Max{P, MIPMH} < MIPMS and |MPH|≥|VO|. The EGI is [Max{P, MIPMH}, Max{MPMH, MPMS}] if Max{P, MIPMH} < MIPMS and |MPH| < |VO|.            "
"32","Proof:   Appendix B.            "
"33","Although complicated, we can summarize these results by discussing the effect of party unity for EGI types between: (1) the majority medians in both chambers; (2) the president and the majority medians; and (3) one of the majority medians and one of the minority medians."
"34","As Case 1 shows, the first EGI type occurs if and only if (1) both chamber's majority parties hold sufficient seats to override a presidential veto, or (2) the Senate majority party holds enough seats to invoke cloture and a president is more extreme than the less extreme majority‐party median of the two chamber medians but is on the same side as the majority [presumably, his own] party (i.e., P ≥ Min{MPMH, MPMS}). As for the first possibility, because party medians can pressure members to vote together rather than their preferences as assumed in the basic and agenda‐setting models, the filibuster pivot disappears if the Senate majority party holds sufficient seats; the majority‐party medians then need only consider the override pivot. When the majority parties hold sufficient seats to override a presidential veto—for example, the first two years after the 1964 election—their medians can alone determine the success of any such attempt. In equilibrium, the two chamber majority‐party medians can essentially dictate policy outcomes regardless of presidential preferences (in which case, the existence of divided or unified government is irrelevant).5 As for the second possibility, the president cannot veto the bill successfully whether or not the majority parties hold sufficient seats to override because the majority‐party medians can influence their members and the minority‐party medians will always support the majority party against the president.5"
"35","To gain insight into party discipline's importance, contrast the EGI for the basic, agenda‐setting, and party‐unity models when there is a filibuster‐proof Senate majority (Figure 1). While the basic model predicts that the EGI is [VH, fR], the agenda‐setter model predicts [MPMS, fR] because shifting the status quo without hurting either agenda‐setter, i.e., MPMS or MPMH, is impossible when the status quo is located at [MPMS, VH], and the party‐unity model predicts that any status quos located outside [MPMS, MPMH] shifts within this interval as the president is more extreme than the majority‐party medians and the Senate majority party holds a supermajority.            "
"36","                 Alternative Model EGIs—Filibuster‐Proof Senate Majority (Assuming that                           VH < VS < fL                           )                         "
"37","Besides showing party discipline's impact, these results for the first EGI type contrast with claims by those focusing on whether government is unified and supermajorities exist. Although the conditions producing the first EGI type might seem equivalent to unified government with a Senate supermajority, this is incorrect. For the first situation, as long as the majority parties hold sufficient seats to override, unified or divided government is irrelevant; for the second, unified government with a Senate supermajority is insufficient as presidential preferences must satisfy certain conditions (this will be clearer shortly when the second EGI type is discussed).5"
"38","The second EGI type in Proposition 3, the interval between the president and majority‐party medians, occurs when the president is between the majority‐ and minority‐party medians so that the minority medians do not always support the majority parties (which control insufficient seats to override vetoes) against the president's interests. Figure 2 illustrates party discipline's importance analogously to Figure 1 for this EGI type. While the basic model predicts an EGI of [fL, fR] and the agenda‐setting model predicts [MPMS, fR], as any attempt to move status quos located between MPMS and fL closer to the majority‐party medians would be filibustered, the party‐unity model predicts [MPMS, P], as the lack of a filibuster threat allows the majority‐party medians to move the status quo.            "
"39","                 Alternative Model EGIs—Veto‐Proof Senate Majority (Assuming that |MPH| < |VO|)                         "
"40","Also, and highlighting how preference and partisan lawmaking theories are complementary, note that this EGI type is easily produced under unified or divided government despite claims that each generates different policy outputs. Analogous to the first EGI type, this second type might be expected when there is a unified government with a Senate majority median controlling a supermajority, i.e., there may be substantial gridlock despite unified government (e.g., if the president is close to, but the majority medians are far from, chamber medians). But the same EGI type may be produced under divided government with a president more moderate than the party medians. Consequently, depending upon preferences, rather than always producing a small EGI, a unified government with a Senate supermajority may produce the kind of relatively large EGI commonly associated with divided government."
"41","While the third EGI type occurs for various subcases in Cases 1 and 2 of Proposition 3, it may be boiled down to two situations: (1) when the Senate majority party has a supermajority, the president is more extreme than his parties, and these parties are minorities but control more than one‐third of the seats; or (2) when the Senate majority party lacks a supermajority (the only exception being when the president is between the House and Senate minority medians and the House minority party holds more than one‐third seats). In these contexts, party influence exercised by majority parties essentially expands both EGI boundaries from the override or filibuster pivots of the nonpartisan model to the party medians. Returning to our illustrative example, Figure 3 shows that the EGI is at least as large as that for the basic and agenda‐setter models under these situations.            "
"42","                 Alternative Model EGIs—Senate Majority Subject to Cloture (Assuming that |MPS| < |C|)                         "
"43","Proposition 4:  (Party Unity—Different Party Control across Chambers)            "
"44","Assuming that the majority parties in the Senate and House are Republican and Democratic, respectively (findings are symmetric when the majority parties are switched), there are two possible cases."
"45","Case 1: When |MPS|≥|C|, the lower bound of the EGI is MPMH if |MPS|≥|VO|, and Min{MPMH, Max{P, MIPMS}} otherwise. The upper bound of the EGI is MPMS if |MPH|≥|VO|, and Max{MPMS, Min{P, MIPMH}} otherwise. The EGI is the interval between the upper and lower bounds defined above.            "
"46","Case 2: When |MPS| < |C|, the EGI is [Min{MIPMS, MPMH}, Min{P, MIPMH}] if |MPH| < |VO| and Min{P, MIPMH} > MPMS, and [Min{MIPMS, MPMH}, MPMS] otherwise.5"
"47","This Proposition, by allowing party control to be split between chambers, further illustrates the value of incorporating bicameralism, as the inference for the EGI would be misleading if Congress was assumed to be controlled by a single party. Specifically, the EGI is at least as large as the interval between the two majority medians of both chambers. Given that the parties split control, the EGI's width is generally large, regardless of whether majority‐party numbers in the Senate or House are high enough to override vetoes, the Senate majority party controls a supermajority, or the president belongs to the House or Senate majority party."
"48","More generally, when Propositions 3 and 4 are considered jointly, they show that incorporating party unity is quite important—indeed, it seems far more fundamental than adding agenda setting to our basic model. But they also show that party discipline's effect is nuanced, as it depends on the Senate majority's size, presidential preferences, and bicameralism. The party‐unity model is an explanation of variance in legislative gridlock grounded in more subtle differences than past attempts.5 For example, in contrast to empirical work (e.g., Coleman 1999), it suggests that unified government with a Senate supermajority is neither theoretically necessary nor sufficient for ascertaining the EGI and producing predictions for productivity.            "
"49","Although we have defined party roles, they have been exclusive to the legislature. Yet, many scholars studying party government emphasize the importance of the president, more specifically the chief executive's power to control the legislative agenda (especially under unified government) and to discipline her party's members (e.g., Brady, Cooper, and Hurley 1979; Patterson and Caldeira 1988; Sundquist 1989; Rohde 1991; Miller 1993).            "
"50","To make our theory correspond more closely to the idea of party government, we expand our partisan model to include presidential leadership by assuming that the president and his opposing‐party medians discipline their respective party's members. The game sequence is similar to that used previously and Proposition 5 characterizes the EGIs produced by the model (see Appendix C for a formal definition of the game).5"
"51","Proposition 5:  (Strong Presidential Leadership of Party)            "
"52","There are three possible cases depending upon the nature of government control."
"53","Case 1: When Congress is unified and government is divided, the EGI is between MPMH and MPMS if |MPS|≥|C| and Min{|MPH|, |MPS|}≥|VO| and otherwise [P, Max{MPMH, MPMS}] ([Min{MPMH, MPMS}, P]) if P < 0 (P > 0).            "
"54","Case 2: When Congress is divided and the president's party either controls the House or controls the Senate with MIPMS falling between P and MPMH, the EGI is between P and the majority‐party median (different party from the president's). When Congress is divided, the president's party controls the Senate, and MIPMS is outside the interval between P and MPMH, the EGI is between P and MPMH, if |MPS|≥|C|, and between P and MIPMS, if |MPS| < |C|.            "
"55","Case 3: When government is unified, the EGI is an empty set if |MPS|≥|C| and is between MIPMS and P if |MPS| < |C|.            "
"56","Proof:   Appendix C.            "
"57","Incorporating presidential leadership produces two types of gridlock intervals. The first is between MPMH and MPMS or is an empty set. This EGI is very narrow and likely rare, occurring only when the party other than the president's has House and Senate majorities and sufficient seats to override a presidential veto or when government is unified and the Senate has a supermajority. The second EGI type is the interval between the president and her opposing‐party median(s) and occurs (1) when government is divided with a united Congress whose majority parties lack the seats to override; (2) when Congress is divided; or (3) when government is unified but the Senate lacks a supermajority.            "
"58","Comparing Propositions 3, 4, and 5 shows that adding strong presidential leadership has two main impacts. One is to help overcome bicameral differences (when the president's party has House and Senate majorities) and differences between the president and her party medians. The other is to increase the importance of presidential preferences: While these preferences only affect the EGI when the president is moderate in the party‐unity model,5 they are quite important for the second EGI type in the leadership model, resulting in an EGI that tends to be either very narrow or very wide. For instance, for the example in Figure 1, the EGI is an empty set, for that in Figure 2 it is an empty set if the president has the same party affiliation as the majority parties and is [MPMS, P] otherwise, which is very wide if the president is extreme, and for that in Figure 3 it is [MIPMS, P], which is also very wide if the president is extreme.            "
"59","Interestingly, returning to the theme of unified versus divided government, the results for the presidential leadership model are, in some sense, consistent with the argument that a unified government with a Senate supermajority produces legislative productivity. But, by making explicit the assumptions of party government, this model goes further by explaining more of the variance in gridlock when there is no supermajority by focusing on the preferences of the president and of the opposing‐party medians. It also shows that divided government does not necessarily result in more severe legislative gridlock than unified government. Empirically, this implies that testing for party government by using divided government as a key independent variable is inappropriate and that even explaining variance by including party division (e.g., Coleman 1999) or homogeneity (e.g., Binder 1999) may be misguided as such factors must be synthesized with government regime, the size of majority parties, and the president.5"
"60","Having expanded on past theoretical work, we can now test our theory to see if it makes political gridlock in the post‐World War period more understandable.5 We lay out hypotheses, describe variable measurement and model estimation, and report and discuss our findings.         "
"61","Translating our theory to hypotheses involves incorporating our different EGIs into a framework amenable to estimation. Having synthesized the effects of preferences and institutions by theoretically deriving the EGI for our four models—preference‐based (the basic model), agenda setting, party unity, and strong presidential leadership of party—we want to test which theoretical derivation has a statistically significant effect on legislative gridlock or productivity and better explains observed variance."
"62","To specify the relationship between EGI and gridlock, we follow Krehbiel (1998) by assuming that status quo policies in each period are identically and uniformly distributed, which makes comparing the widths of different gridlock intervals at the same time or gridlock intervals at different points in time possible.5 Given our theory and this assumption, it follows that larger EGI width produces lesser legislative productivity and that absolute EGI values and their change will affect legislative gridlock or productivity and their change, respectively (we concentrate on absolute values for parsimony's sake).            "
"63","Furthermore, to make our empirical analysis manageable—and to reflect our theoretical finding that, while each model predicts different EGIs, incorporating party unity either with or without presidential leadership greatly distinguishes the gridlock intervals produced—we classify the EGIs for the basic and agenda‐setter models, which emphasize preferences and exclude party discipline, as weak‐party intervals and the EGIs corresponding to our party unity and presidential leadership models, where preferences and party discipline are integrated, as strong‐party intervals. For further simplification, while there are 16 possible scenarios supporting different interval combinations, we test hypotheses for the four that are most intuitive and basic to our interest in how preferences and parties effect political gridlock: (1) both weak‐ and strong‐party gridlock intervals are supported; (2) neither is supported; (3) only the weak‐party interval is supported; and (4) only the strong‐party interval is supported. If the first scenario receives support, we must then ascertain whether adding strong‐party effects makes much difference;5 if the second receives support, we will infer that no EGI is essential for understanding gridlock; if the third gets support, we will suggest that preferences matter over party; and, if the fourth holds, we will conclude that party, or more specifically the forces producing party unity, is essential.            "
"64","Estimating our model requires measuring political gridlock as a dependent variable and the EGI and any control variables as independent variables."
"65","Operationalizing political gridlock is difficult. While it is commonly recognized that understanding gridlock requires considering legislative demand and supply, as low production may indicate high gridlock or a limited political agenda, legislative demand is unobservable, and as such no existing measure is perfect. Hence, we employ three alternative measures of legislative gridlock:            "
"66","                              "
"67"," Binder's (1999) measure, the total number of failed legislative issues divided by the total number of policy issues on the agenda per Congress.5 This is likely the closest to the kind of systematic measure of gridlock level, allowing demand to vary rather than implicitly assuming it is the same across periods, necessary for testing our models.5"
"68"," Coleman's (1999) measure, which basically divides Edwards, Barrett, and Peake's (1997) enumeration of significant bills failed by the sum of Mayhew's (1991) significant bills passed and failed (for comparability with Binder's measure, we use percentage of bills failing rather passing as Coleman does). However, this measure is susceptible to various criticisms and should be viewed cautiously.5"
"69","To deal with some of the potential problems of Coleman's measure, a modified version dividing Edwards et al.'s significant bills failed by the sum of such failed bills and Mayhew's (1991) Sweep One bills.5"
"70","To measure the different EGIs, we deviate from the work of those such as Krehbiel and Binder by employing Poole's (1998) common space coordinates.5 Doing so allows us to place all lawmakers in both chambers and presidents in the same ideological space in a manner permitting temporal comparisons (unlike Poole and Rosenthal's [1997] NOMINATE scores, which lack this quality) and to identify the pivots needed to test our model, with some caveats.5 By contrast, alternative measures lack these qualities: For example, Krehbiel (1998) uses the net percentage of seats changing party from one Congress to another which, by his admission, has several serious drawbacks—among them that new lawmakers' party affiliations only imperfectly proxy their preferences. Additionally, their use requires assuming that presidential preferences are more moderate than override pivots, which is minimally ad hoc and arguably untenable: For example, assuming that Johnson, Kennedy, and Reagan were moderates with preferences lying inside these pivot points is likely problematic. Regardless, careful investigation shows that our results are not artifacts of common space scores.5"
"71","To illustrate how EGIs are calculated, consider the 84th Congress, where MPMS=−.255, MPMH=−.199, fL=−.162, MH= .066, MS= .101, VH= .208, P = .267, MIPMH= .267, fR= .281, VS= .281, and MIPMS= .337 (these players' relative locations are illustrated in Figure 3).5 Given that Max{MH, MS}= .101 ≤ P ≤ Max{VH,VS}= .281, by Proposition 1, Case 2 the EGI is [Min{fL, MH}, Max{P, fR}] ( =[fL, fR]), the basic model EGI is .443. Similarly, by Proposition 2, Case 2 the agenda‐setting EGI is [Min{fL, MH, MPMH, MPMS}, Max{P, fR, MPMH, MPMS}] or [MPMS, fR], which is [−.255, .281] or .536. For the party‐unity EGI, since |MPS| < |C|, and MIPMS > MIPMH, by the symmetry of Proposition 3, Case 3 (since now two majority parties are both Democrats), the EGI is [Min{MPMH, MPMS}, MIPMS] or [−.255, 337], which is .592. As for the presidential leadership EGI, since Congress is united, government is divided, and |MPS| < |C| (i.e., Proposition 5, Case 1), the EGI is [Min{MPMH, MPMS}, P], or [−.255, .267].            "
"72"," Figure 4 displays the trend of the common space‐generated EGIs for our four models and shows that they differ markedly in terms of mean and variance.5 As implied above, the EGIs of the nonpartisan and agenda‐setter models are much more different from the EGIs of the party‐unity model and strong presidential leadership models than they are from one another. Interestingly, differences between EGIs are especially large during the Kennedy‐Johnson years and after 1976. More generally, Figure 4 makes it clear that strong‐ and weak‐party intervals differ in ways not simply corresponding to distinctions such as divided versus unified governments and reflect the importance of considering different player preferences.5 Thus, for the basic model, the EGIs for the 80th to 82nd Congresses and for the 104th and 105th Congresses are so great mainly because both filibuster pivots are rather polarized, while that for the 96th Congress is so small principally because of a very moderate right filibuster (the one farther from then‐President Carter). As mentioned, the agenda‐setting model EGI is similar to that for the basic model except that it typically expands one side of the basic model EGI to a majority median; the only exception is during most of the Reagan administration (beginning with the 98th Congress), when both sides of the EGI expand simultaneously, widening the discrepancy between the basic and agenda‐setting EGIs. By contrast, the EGIs for the party‐unity model are smaller than for the first two models when the president is relatively extreme and his Senate party controls a supermajority (the 87th–90th and the 95th Congresses) and larger otherwise. The EGI for presidential leadership model tends to be very large after the 95th Congress.            "
"73","                 Gridlock Intervals by Congress                         "
"74","As for control variables, the existing literature suggests that three, which are not directly incorporated into our theory, merit inclusion (and facilitate comparison with other studies): public mood, budgetary situation, and divided government. As for the first two variables, for example, Binder hypothesizes that “the greater the federal budget surplus relative to outlays, the lower is the level of policy gridlock. …[and] the greater the level of public support for governmental action, the lower is the level of policy gridlock” (1999, 523–4).5 Thus, like Krehbiel (1998), Binder (1999), and Coleman (1999), we use Stimson's (1991) public liberalism index to measure mood and, following Binder, we use the budget deficit as a percentage of federal outlays to measure the budgetary situation (see Ragsdale 1996).5 Divided government, of course, has been widely cited as a key determinant of political gridlock. As such, we include a dummy variable, scored one when one or more legislative chambers are controlled by a party other than the president's and zero otherwise. However, as divided government is correlated with our EGIs (.15, .53, .58, and .73 for the four models, respectively), we run our estimation both with and without this measure to see if there is any effect not picked up by the EGIs.            "
"75","Given our time‐series data, we first run OLS and conduct Durbin‐Watson tests. Unless the null hypothesis that no autocorrelation exists is maintained, we reestimate our model with the Prais‐Winsten FGLS correction for serial correlation (see Greene 1997, chap. 13). Additionally, we conduct a Cook‐Weisberg heteroskedasticity test and, if detected, we plot our residuals to see the nature of the problem and model the variance as a function of independent variables using maximum‐likelihood estimation.            "
"76"," Tables 1 through 4 present results for our four models.5 We report Prais‐Winsten FGLS coefficients (although OLS results are comparable), as the Durbin‐Watson statistics are indeterminate at the .01 level, so the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation cannot be rejected.5"
"77"," Table 1 shows that the EGI of the basic, preference‐based, model does not have the predicted, positive, impact on political gridlock. Indeed, the coefficents for the Coleman measure and for the modified measure when divided government is incorporated are wrongly signed.5 Whether such findings are real (e.g., suggesting the failure to incorporate party effects) or artifactual, the lack of a significant, positive effect of the preference‐based EGI on political gridlock is very clear.5"
"78","Results for the agenda‐setter model mirror those for the basic model. The EGI is either insignificant or wrongly signed while there is evidence that divided government per se matters, suggesting that the latter may be capturing a partisan effect."
"79","Findings in Tables 3 and 4 for EGIs presupposing party unity without and with presidential leadership are consistent, with some caveats, with such an interpretation and strongly confirm theoretical predictions for the models incorporating party discipline. For example, as seen in the first column of Table 3, the EGI is now significant, with an increase in gridlock interval of .10 leading to a corresponding increase in political gridlock of .03 (we might add that the adjusted R2 increases from .036 to .445 when models without and with the EGI are compared). Also, the gridlock interval has the most importance (.176) if we roughly measure substantive significance by multiplying the difference between the low and high values of our variables by our coefficients. Additionally, our result regarding the EGI remains the same even when we include divided government (column 2). However, while we find the same effect of the EGI without divided government for the other two dependent variables, its effect is attenuated when divided government is included (keep in mind these dependent variables have more potential measurement problems), presumably due to multicollinearity.5 Moreover, we find that, given this model, for the Binder and Coleman measures adjusted R2 increases from .115 to .445 and from .520 to .639 when divided government is replaced by the EGI in this model, controlling for budget and public mood, although for the modified Coleman measure, adjusted R2 decreases from .273 to .172. Overall, synthesizing pivotal and partisan politics improves our explanatory power. More broadly, comparing Tables 2 and 3 makes it clear that party unity rather than agenda‐setting explains substantial variance.5"
"80","Results for the presidential leadership model in Table 4 mirror those in Table 3.5 For the Binder measure the EGI matters with or without divided government while, for the other two dependent variables, the effect is obscured once divided government is placed in the model for, admittedly, atheoretical reasons (and F‐tests again indicate that distinguishing the two variables is difficult). Furthermore, replacing divided government with the EGI for presidential leadership improves adjusted R2 substantially for the three different measures (results available from authors).5 Theory clearly improves the traditional partisan government thesis.            "
"81","Put differently, our findings essentially reject a pure preference‐based approach. A number of robustness tests find additional support for our findings (all results available from authors). Dropping bicameralism so that our model mirrors Krehbiel's with the exceptions of party and presidential roles leaves our empirical results unchanged.5 Modifying our EGI estimation so that it conforms more closely with Krehbiel's by using Senate seat change for those periods in which the president remains the same (as, for these periods, the EGI is determined by shifts of the filibuster pivot given how Krehbiel translates his theory empirically).5 Nor do our results qualitatively differ if we rely exclusively on Mayhew's (1991) significant or landmark enactments (i.e., when we use only Sweep One) or on Howell et al.'s (2000) different measures of legislative productivity or if, following the emphasis of Rohde (1991), we adjust our EGIs by the extent of intraparty homogeneity (all results available from authors). Also, in the spirit of Rohde's work emphasizing the conditional impact of parties, we find the gridlock interval is still significant if we combine the basic model EGI for earlier times (e.g., before the party reforms of the 1970s, so that we use 1976 or 1978 as cutpoints) with the EGI of the models assuming party unity subsequently—reinforcing the evidence that our results for party effects are not proxying for the existence of a cloture‐proof majority as this possibility only occurs before the party reform era.            "
"82","In short, our findings suggest that, at least for the kind of aggregated time‐series analysis of political gridlock that has been the norm, a model incorporating partisan effects works nicely while one exclusively focusing on preferences does not. No matter how we try to find flaws, the results suggest that the preference‐based, pivotal politics, view does not hold up."
"83","Recent years have witnessed numerous efforts to understand legislative productivity and political gridlock. While many emphasizing party have concentrated on the effects of divided government rather than on the determinants of productivity per se, others, notably Krehbiel, have focused on legislative productivity without carefully incorporating party roles despite empirical evidence emphasizing a partisan role. A comprehensive perspective on legislative productivity and political gridlock linking preferences, institutions, and parties both theoretically and empirically has been lacking. Theory has rejected the relevance of parties and empirical students of parties have not integrated their work with theory in a manner capturing this potentially complicated and dynamic relationship."
"84","Our analysis has modeled gridlock both as a function of preferences and institutions—incorporating bicameralism and presidential preferences—and as a function of parties in a manner that is testable given the availability of common space scores. By showing that EGIs associated with parties having no effect or an agenda‐setting role do not help explain gridlock but that those with party‐unity effects with or without strong presidential leadership do, our results demonstrate that carefully accounting for the roles that parties and their leaders play is important for explaining legislative choices and that, indeed, the results are robust."
"85","Our encouraging findings suggest a variety of potential extensions. Theoretically, endogenizing the role of parties to capture the possibility that some factors, such as party discipline, may be more important under some sets of conditions (perhaps correlated with factors of interest) than others promises to be illuminating. Following the party government literature and our empirical tests for robustness, we could further model the process of party discipline by endogenizing situations under which legislators do not vote with their fellow partisans or by temporally varying party strength. We could also modify the assumption of uniformly distributed status quo policies. Empirically, our results rely on a small number of cases and specific definitions of important legislation—we could and should implement alternative definitions of gridlock and different research designs using more disaggregated units of analyses so that we can more thoroughly explore the different predictions generated by our competing models."
