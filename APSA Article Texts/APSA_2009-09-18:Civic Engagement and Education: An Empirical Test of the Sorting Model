"1","The sorting model rests on the assumption that democratic engagement entails political conflict. In the words of NJS:"
"2","                        "
"3","We argue that certain aspects of democratic citizenship are in fact bounded, or limited, by their essentially competitive nature. The instrumental behaviors and cognitions of political engagement can be seen as more of a zero‐sum game, bounded by finite resources and conflict, where one's gain will necessarily be another's loss. (101)"
"4","NJS do not limit their description of political engagement as zero‐sum to a small number of activities, as they apply the sorting model to campaign activity, voting, political attentiveness, and knowledge of candidates in elections for the House of Representatives. They find evidence that it pertains to all (145). Furthermore, NJS extend the sorting model to a form of engagement that typically has no overt political content at all, namely membership in voluntary associations:"
"5","                        "
"6","[M]embership in voluntary associations is, we expect, the result of relative, rather than absolute, educational attainment. Members of associations obtain substantial psychic and social rewards for their organizational involvements. Moreover, voluntary membership requires time, energy, and often money, and those who are relatively near the center of the social network can better afford to pay the costs and are more likely to reap the benefits. (162)"
"7","NJS thus argue that group membership is driven by the same conflict over rewards as political engagement. Undoubtedly, participation in some civic groups indicates social status, lending plausibility to NJS's argument. However, a case can also be made that many, perhaps even most, group memberships are not driven by a zero‐sum competition over social position. While membership in voluntary associations does require time and energy, it is not clear that money is necessary at all (a point essentially conceded by NJS by their qualification that money is “often”—and thus not “always”—required). Social status does not necessarily give people more free time (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). Indeed there is reason to think that more status means less leisure time (Aguiar and Hurst 2006). Neither is it clear why people with more social standing would have more energy to devote to civic activity. NJS also indicate that the rewards for this form of engagement are psychic and social, rather than material. While material rewards clearly are scarce resources, why should psychic and social rewards be considered finite and thus competitive?         "
"8","The application of the sorting model to group memberships is one example of where we have reason to question the reach of NJS's sorting model, but a close look at the assumptions underpinning their theory reveals that applying it to numerous other forms of participation is potentially problematic as well. Recall that NJS make the twin claims that political involvement is both bounded and competitive. While NJS see boundedness and competition as mutually reinforcing, it seems plausible that participation in a competitive political contest is anything but zero‐sum (and thus bounded). If you feel your interests are at stake in an election, do you not have an incentive to encourage more people to work on behalf of your preferred candidate? Rather than a zero‐sum game, in political campaigns the “more the merrier” principle applies.         "
"9","Even if political activity is not bounded by zero‐sum competition, however, that does not mean that everyone is equally motivated to get involved. Many people are motivated to participate in politics because they perceive that their interests are at stake. Therefore, it follows that those people who have more at stake in a political outcome have a greater motivation to aid their side in the contest. On average, those with the greatest stake are “substantially more likely to be found closer to the central nodes of politically important social networks,” or have social network centrality (Nie, Junn, and Stehlik‐Berry 1996, 45).         "
"10","Thus, NJS and this analysis concur that social network centrality matters for political engagement. There is also agreement that greater relative education—that is, more education than others in the same environment—serves as the primary criterion determining who is at the center of politically relevant networks. However, NJS and this analysis diverge on the mechanism that links social network centrality and engagement, which in turn leads to different empirical predictions. NJS argue that people at the center of social networks are more engaged because they are in a zero‐sum competition with everyone else to have their voices heard, given that government has limited capacity to respond to voters' demands. They thus hypothesize that the sorting model applies to many different forms of public engagement."
"11","Alternatively, this analysis proceeds from the supposition that the closer you are to the center of politically relevant social networks, the greater your stake in the outcome of political contestation, which in turn spurs greater political involvement to see your side prevail (which often requires recruiting more supporters to one's cause). Consequently, sorting should apply to engagement for which, on average, contestation is most salient and the stakes most clearly defined—specifically, electoral activity. Of course, one's stake in the outcome of an election is not solely determined by social network centrality; many other factors matter too. To the extent that education has a positive impact on engagement in electoral activity, its impact is a function of sorting by relative education."
"12","Sorting, it is hypothesized, does not apply to group memberships, which except in rare cases are not likely to be motivated by protecting one's interests in a political contest. It is less clear whether sorting should apply to political activities that are not tied to campaigns, such as expressive activities like protesting or contacting a government official. In some cases such activities do not entail a contest per se and thus do not necessarily provide the same competitive motivation to see one's side prevail. (Picture a rally for a valence issue like “support for the environment.”) To the extent that expressive activity is not driven by a sense of competition, we should not expect the sorting model to apply. However, sometimes expressive activity is for a cause that resembles an electoral campaign (e.g., a demonstration in favor of a particular environmental bill). To the extent that expressive activity is election‐like, sorting would be applicable. Unfortunately, existing data do not permit classifying expressive activity as being of one type or another. Therefore, for this analysis the hypothesized relationship between relative education and expressive activity is unclear.         "
"13","Finally, we should not expect relative education to matter for voter turnout, which is appropriately considered to be distinct from participation in political campaigns. Even though voting is obviously central to elections, previous research has demonstrated that the decision to vote has a distinctive bundle of motivations, blending both self‐interest and a sense of civic obligation (Blais 2000; Campbell 2006; Fiorina 1976; Riker and Ordeshook 1968; Shachar and Nalebuff 1999). For example, while voter turnout rises where elections are most competitive, it is equally high in communities where elections are the least competitive (Campbell 2006), suggesting that we should not expect voting to be driven primarily by competition. NJS themselves acknowledge the unique nature of voting by referring to the “double‐barreled nature of voting as part instrumental and part symbolic behavior” (68). Consequently, the existing literature typically isolates voting from other forms of engagement (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995), which will also be the case here.         "
"14","The general point is not that there are a few special cases of engagement which fall outside the reach of the sorting model, but rather that only a few fall within it."
"15","The second supposition underpinning the sorting model is that jockeying for status occurs within one's educational environment, defined as the people with whom we interact. NJS stress that social position is not determined by one's education level relative to the entire population, but rather relative to one's own age cohort. Accordingly, they compare a respondent's level of education to the mean educational attainment of people age 25–50 at the time that the respondent was 25 years old. Tenn (2005) criticizes this definition as too imprecise and offers an alternative: measuring educational environment as one's educational attainment relative to people born in the same year.3Helliwell and Putnam (2007) offer a still more critical assessment. They note that NJS have operationalized the educational environment so that it only accounts for the education level of people born before you, which means that “no one ever competes against anyone younger, but everyone always competes against everyone older (including the dead)” (2–3). In their analysis, Helliwell and Putnam do not differentiate educational attainment by age.         "
"16","No matter the age range used when measuring relative education within the educational environment, there is a critical omission when the educational environment is defined in national terms (as NJS and Tenn have done). The sorting model assumes that relative education serves to position people within their own social networks. In the words of NJS: “[E]ducation works as a sorting mechanism by placing those with higher levels of education in positions closer to the center of social and political networks” (131–32). Indeed, much of Education and Democratic Citizenship in America is dedicated to explaining the significance of social network centrality as a factor driving political participation. Social networks, however, are not national; they are local. Consequently, Helliwell and Putnam argue that the sorting model requires the analyst to account for the geographic differences in educational attainment across the United States. They do so by comparing respondents' own educational attainment to the mean education level—not differentiated by age—within the same U.S. census region.         "
"17","Using their measure of relative education, Helliwell and Putnam arrive at conclusions that contrast sharply with those of NJS, stressing that they “find no systematic evidence that increases in average education have any negative effects on participation” (15). Helliwell and Putnam are careful to note they do not assume that “census region” (really, a conglomeration of states) is the ideal geographic unit for their analysis, but mean only to emphasize that shifting the parameters of the educational environment even a little produces different results. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that NJS's results differ from those of Helliwell and Putnam because the latter have not accounted for the considerable differences in educational attainment across age cohorts. Also, note that Helliwell and Putnam's analysis does not include any activities in the electoral domain, even though that is where theory gives us the strongest expectation of educational sorting."
"18","In sum, the literature has defined educational environment in terms of age (NJS and Tenn) and place (Helliwell and Putnam). Both matter. The average level of education has undergone a steady increase over time—the average 25–34‐year‐old has 13.8 years of education, compared to 12.3 years for 65+‐year‐olds.4 At any given point in time, there is wide variation in average education across the United States. For instance, in the McAllen‐Edinburg‐Mission, Texas, metropolitan area, the average educational attainment for people over age 25 is 10.6 years, while residents of the Corvallis, Oregon, MSA average 14.8 years of schooling. While the previous literature has defined educational environment in terms of either age or place, this analysis measures the educational environment by uniquely combining age and place.         "
"19","To combine age and place when measuring educational environment requires determining which ages and which places should go into the measure. On this score, the sorting model itself provides some guidance. Recall that, according to NJS, status is determined within social networks—the people with whom we interact within our local communities. This analysis accounts for the local nature of social networks by defining educational environment on a much smaller scale than the national population, or even census regions. While theory suggests that the geographic scale should reflect the local community, it is not necessarily clear how that should be operationalized for the purpose of empirical measurement. Accordingly, the analysis tests three levels of geography: the state, the metropolitan area, and the zip code.5 While none of these perfectly mirror an individual's own social networks, each comes closer than defining educational environment on a national or regional scale. Including all three enables a test of the hypothesis that educational sorting takes place within localized social networks. If sorting is a local phenomenon, then we should observe a stronger impact for educational environment the smaller its geographic scale.         "
"20","The zip code, while the smallest of the three geographic units, is not a tangible community per se, and is meant only to proxy a more localized geographic location than the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by the Census Bureau. Many MSAs cover a vast geographic area and a significant population—larger on both counts than some states. The Atlanta MSA, for example, covers 28 counties, while the New York–Northern New Jersey MSA has a population of over 21 million people. Units of this size and scope are not likely to capture a respondent's social network. The zip code is admittedly also imperfect as a measure of one's local networks but is the smallest geographic unit available for the data employed in this analysis. (Future research would profit from testing the empirical consequences of using still other geographic units to measure educational environment.)"
"21","For each geographic unit—state, MSA/county, and zip code—years of education have been measured within the standard age cohorts that the U.S. Census Bureau uses when reporting educational attainment: 25–34, 35–44, 45–64, 65+. Educational environment is therefore operationalized as the mean educational attainment, measured in years of schooling, for each age cohort within the relevant geographic unit. When measured in this way, there is considerable variation in educational environment by age cohort. For example, the localized educational environment (measured at the zip code level) for those age 65 and up is a mean of roughly 11.6 years of education, while for 25–34‐year‐olds it is approximately 13.2 years6—the difference between not graduating from high school and a year of post‐secondary education.         "
"22","Recall that Tenn objects to the 25‐year span of the NJS measure, while Helliwell and Putnam criticize NJS for their asymmetric definition of educational environment. Using the Census Bureau's age cohorts addresses both concerns—the cohorts are relatively narrow, and respondents' education levels are compared to others within the same age range, both older and younger.7 While not identical to the method used by either Tenn or Helliwell and Putnam, it is consistent with the spirit of both.         "
"23","For the analysis, the geographic data on educational environment has been merged with individual‐level survey data (described in more detail below). For respondents in, say, Chicago, think of their educational environment as defined by three concentric circles. The widest circle is the average educational attainment of people in their age cohort who also live in the state of Illinois, the next covers the Chicago metropolitan statistical area, while the smallest circle is the zip code in which they live."
"24","Note that allowing the educational environment to vary across place enables a test of the sorting model that can simultaneously account for both age and the average educational attainment within the environment. As noted by NJS, untangling age and environment is impossible in cross‐sectional analysis using their method of measuring the environment on a national scope, since age is almost perfectly correlated with a nationwide measure of educational attainment (167–68). However, age is not so closely correlated with a localized measure of educational environment."
"25","This analysis employs the National Civic Engagement Study (NCES). Conducted by Zukin et al. (2006) in the spring of 2002 (with a total N of 3,248), it meets the criteria necessary to test the relationship between educational environment and different forms of public engagement.8 First, the NCES entails a major effort to measure the full range of civic and political engagement in the twenty‐first century. In addition, as a national telephone survey it includes respondents across an extensive range of geographic locations. As well, the inclusion of geocodes makes it possible to link respondents to their educational environment, down to the level of the zip code.9"
"26","Since the refined hypothesis stemming from the sorting model being tested here is that only those forms of engagement most likely to be driven by competition are explained by the sorting model, it is necessary to differentiate among the many forms of civic and political participation. Different means of participation vary in many ways, including their motivations, frequency, and objectives. To sort through this complexity, scholars have developed a number of useful typologies, typically informed by theory and then confirmed empirically. Typologies of participation, however, are a moving target, since social, political, and even technological changes mean that citizens come to adopt new and different forms of engagement. Periodically, new indices have to be developed to reflect these changes (Barnes and Kaase 1979; Clarke, Kornberg, and Stewart 1985; Milbrath 1965; Putnam 2000; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Verba and Nie 1972; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995).10Zukin et al. (2006) have recently developed a new typology, updated to reflect Americans' changing repertoire of civic and political participation Rather than rely on the preexisting measures of engagement that have long been used by social scientists, they employed a multimethod approach (including consultation with experts, focus groups, and pretesting) to produce an index of 19 items that covers the gamut of public engagement. This index forms the core of the NCES. Some of the index items replicate measures that have been used for decades (such as voting and volunteering in political campaigns), while others are not typically found on other general‐purpose surveys (e.g., biking, walking, or running for charity).         "
"27","Grouping these many different forms of engagement into a manageable number of categories requires attention to both theory (which activities share common purposes?) and empirics (which activities load together on common factors?). Recall that, above, four different types of participation were differentiated from one another on theoretical grounds: electoral activity, expressive activity, group membership, and voting. As detailed by Zukin et al. (2006), principal components analysis of the NCES confirms the intuition that these are distinctive types of engagement, comprised of activities that are similar in nature. The first grouping includes activities that all take place in the electoral arena (Electoral Index), and the second constitutes expressive political activity (Expressive Index). The third includes involvement in voluntary groups but also entails other forms of civic activity like working with others to solve a community problem and raising money for charity (Civic Index). Voting is modeled on its own, using an item that asks respondents how often they vote in national and local elections.11Table 1 lists the activities in each category, as well as their factor loadings. Since this analysis explicitly adopts the classification system of Zukin et al. (2006), the table echoes their method of analysis and thus reports results from principal components analysis; other methods of scaling produce comparable results.12 To simplify the presentation of the results, the indices used in the analysis are additive and thus consist of tallying the number of activities in which the respondent has engaged. Note that models that use the factor scorings as dependent variables produce substantively identical results.13"
"28","As is often the case when constructing indices, there are not always bright lines between one category and the next. An activity grouped in one category could plausibly also be placed in another. In these cases, the analysis follows Zukin et al. and uses both theory and empirics to decide on the placement of the item. For example, “displaying a campaign button” is classified as an electoral activity even though it obviously also has an expressive component. Theory suggests that, on balance, it is properly classified as electoral, since wearing a button is generally for the purpose of supporting a candidate in a competitive electoral contest. That decision is confirmed by the principal components analysis, which shows that “campaign button” has a higher loading with the other electoral activities than with the expressive items."
"29","In addition to differentiating among types of engagement and combining both age and place when measuring educational environment, this analysis employs a third innovation in testing the sorting model. In previous research, models of democratic engagement have included educational environment alongside the individual's level of education. Using this specification, a negative coefficient for educational environment is interpreted as evidence favoring the sorting model, since it indicates that, when controlling for education at the individual level, a greater mean level of education in the environment drives engagement down. However, this specification does not fully test what sorting predicts, as the model posits an interaction between the individual's own education and the educational environment. Sorting means that, as the average level of education in the environment rises, each year of education matters less. Operationally, this would be observed as a negative coefficient for an interaction between individual‐level educational attainment and the mean years of education in the environment (Education × Educational Environment). To use an intuitive example, it would mean that having a college degree in a place where few people have college degrees provides a larger boost to engagement than being college‐educated in a place where college degrees are the norm.         "
"30","Summarizing thus far, three interlocking hypotheses have been proposed, each distilled from the sorting model's own assumptions:"
"31","                        "
"32","The Interaction Hypothesis: As average education rises, each year of an individual's own education has a smaller impact. Education × Educational Environment should be negative and statistically significant."
"33","The Geography Hypothesis: The interaction between education and educational environment should be stronger as the geographic scope of the environment narrows. The smaller the geographic scope of the educational environment, the greater its impact, and the greater the confidence, in statistical terms, we can have in the coefficient for Education × Educational Environment. That is, the coefficient should be larger and the p level should be smaller as the geographic area covered by the environmental measure narrows."
"34","Electoral Hypothesis: The sorting model should apply to electoral activity, and not to civic activity or voting. The coefficient for Education × Educational Environment should be both negative and statistically significant for the model of the Electoral Index, but should not be significant in models of the Civic Index or Voting. A priori, it is unclear whether sorting should apply to expressive political activity without further specifying the objective of that activity (which is not possible with these data)."
"35","The models also control for a number of factors known to be correlated with engagement and education. For the sake of comparison, the array of variables replicates those used by NJS. They include gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, retirement, home ownership, church attendance, rural residence, having recently moved, strong partisanship, and independent partisanship.14 The model also controls for age, by grouping respondents in one of the four age categories defined by the Census Bureau (18–34, 35–44, 45–64, 65+). As noted, age is an especially important control variable to include, since it correlates highly with civic and, especially, political engagement. By including age in the model, we can separate the impact of being in a particular age cohort from the impact of the educational environment (Miller and Shanks 1996; Putnam 2000; Wattenberg 2002; Zukin et al. 2006).15 All four dependent variables are ordinal, which calls for the use of ordered logit as an estimator.         "
"36"," Table 2 displays the results for Electoral Index, the form of engagement for which we have the strongest theoretical prediction. Each column reports results from defining educational environment at, respectively, the level of the state, metropolitan area/county, and zip code (recall that the environment measure also accounts for differences in educational attainment across age groups within each geographic unit).The inclusion of these contextual variables requires attention to the geographic clustering, and thus potential nonindependence, of cases. Intuitively, the econometric problem is that, by design, all respondents within the same age cohort in the same geographic stratum have identical values for educational environment and thus are not independent of one another. The standard errors of all the models, therefore, account for clustering by educational environment, defined as the respondent's age cohort within the relevant geographic unit.16"
"37","First, we find support for the Interaction Hypothesis. All three models have a negative interaction between Education and Educational Environment."
"38","Second, evidence for the Geography Hypothesis is mixed. Across the three definitions of educational environment, the magnitude of the coefficient for Education × Educational Environment is essentially the same (−0.031 for the state, −0.037 for the MSA/county, and −0.032 for the zip code). We can, though, have greater confidence in the coefficient for Education × Educational Environment as the educational environment narrows in scope. It is not statistically significant (p value of 0.54)17 when the environment is defined as the state, is marginally significant (p = 0.08) when it is measured at the MSA/county level, and is clearly significant for the zip code (p = 0.03).18 We thus find evidence for one of the two claims embedded within the Geography Hypothesis—we can be more confident in the interaction between Education and Educational Environment as the geographic scope gets smaller but cannot conclude that its impact has a greater magnitude. More precisely, we can most safely conclude that the zip code and the MSA/county are the relevant educational environments, both of which are more localized than the state. In short, the evidence confirms that educational environment should be defined in local terms.         "
"39","Third, we find support for the Electoral Hypothesis by comparing Tables 2 and 3. Table 3 displays the identical model specification as before, but applied to Voting, the Expressive Index, and the Civic Index. For these models, the educational environment is defined as the zip code, but results are no different when the state and MSA/county are used instead. Across the board, we see that while the coefficient for Education × Educational Environment is negative, it does not approach statistical significance (the p values are 0.49 for Voting, 0.67 for the Expressive Index, and 0.36 for the Civic Index).19"
"40","Interactions are often difficult to interpret from coefficients alone, particularly for a maximum likelihood estimator like ordered logit. Determining the magnitude of the sorting effect is thus best accomplished graphically. Figures 1A and 1B display the interaction of education and educational environment (zip code) for two illustrative categories, 25–34‐year‐olds and 65+‐year‐olds (with every control variable set to its mean value). The y‐axis reflects the score on the political activity index, while education at the individual level is arrayed along the x‐axis. The three lines represent respondents in educational environments at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles for their age group.20 In both figures, we see that all the lines slope upward, indicating that more education correlates with more engagement. The slope is steepest, however, for people in an educational environment at the 10th percentile and least steep for the educational environment at the 90th percentile. In other words, we see visual evidence of the fundamental claim underlying the sorting model—educational attainment at the individual level interacts with the educational environment.         "
"41","                 (A) Evidence for the Sorting Model, 25–34‐Year‐Olds(B) Evidence for the Sorting Model, 65+‐Year‐Olds (C) Sorting Applies More to Men Than Women                      "
"42"," Note: All control variables set to their means.                     "
"43","The significance of accounting for educational environment is underscored when we note that for people with 12 years of education, the educational environment makes essentially no difference, while for people with 18 years of education the difference across educational environments is substantial. For 25–34‐year‐olds in a low‐education environment (10th percentile), an increase in educational attainment goes a long way toward boosting their electoral activity, lifting their score on the electoral index from 0.63 for those who have a high school diploma to 1.04 to those with four years of graduate education, a gain of 0.41. In a high‐education environment (90th percentile), the same increase in individual educational attainment lifts the electoral index score from 0.61 to only 0.78, an increase of less than half as much. Among 25–34‐year‐olds, the gap between the electoral activity of someone with 18 years of schooling (two years of postgraduate study) in an educational environment at the 10th versus the 90th percentile is 0.26, or roughly the same magnitude as moving from a high school diploma to having a master's degree in a model which does not account for the educational environment.21"
"44","When comparing across the figures, we see the higher overall rate of engagement among the 65+‐year‐olds. More importantly for present purposes, we also see that individuals' educational attainment has a bigger impact on the engagement of 65+‐year‐olds (all three lines have a steeper slope than the corresponding lines for 25–34‐year‐olds). The contrast between 25–34‐year‐olds and 65+‐year‐olds provides still another way of visualizing the sorting model. Because 65+‐year‐olds are, on average, in less educated environments than 25–34‐year‐olds, each year of a 65+‐year‐old's own education has a larger impact on engagement. Among 65+‐year‐olds, having 18 years of education puts you near the top of the class hierarchy, but among 25–34‐year‐olds, a more highly educated stratum of the population, that much education does not confer nearly as much status (and thus social network centrality)."
"45","There are two ways to read the finding that the sorting model applies to electoral activity. The validity of the model has been affirmed, but its application has been narrowed. Rather than applying to many forms of engagement, as argued by NJS, this analysis finds that sorting only applies to electoral activity. However, it is important to stress that the limits placed on the application of educational sorting derive from the assumptions of the model as described by its originators. Sorting by education does matter for the most clearly competitive forms of engagement; it is just that not all forms of engagement are equally competitive, or even competitive at all. Our theoretical understanding of the sorting model is also enhanced with the observation that evidence for sorting only emerges when we define the educational environment by age cohort and at the local level, which is consistent with the claim that sorting by education takes place within localized social networks. Furthermore, the argument that sorting occurs within social networks finds still more support in the results, which indicates that the relevant educational environment is the MSA/county and zip code, not the state."
"46","Since the sorting model applies to only one form of engagement, it naturally raises the question of whether it applies equally across the population. NJS report that the mechanisms underpinning the sorting model are “apparently substantially the same for all major segments of the population” (57), including males and females, blacks and whites. Given that we observe gender and racial differences in electoral activity in the new sorting model, does this statement still hold?22"
"47","The general applicability of the sorting model can be tested by interacting the variables of interest—gender, race—with the key term that captures educational sorting: Education × Educational Environment. When this is done, the interaction with African American is nowhere near statistical significance (not shown), but the interaction with Female is highly significant (column 4, Table 2). Since a negative coefficient for Education × Education Environment indicates sorting by education, the positive coefficient for the interaction with gender means that women experience less sorting than men. A complete assessment of gender differences, however, requires accounting simultaneously for the complete set of variables necessary to interpret the interaction. This is best accomplished graphically, as in Figure 1C, which—holding everything else constant at its mean—compares the impact of Years of Education for men and women. For illustrative purposes, the figure displays results for 25–34‐year‐olds in a high‐education environment (90th percentile). Among men, the line is essentially flat, confirming the sorting effect: in places where average education is high, having more education does not make it more likely that you will be involved in political campaigning. For women, however, the line slopes upward, meaning that sorting matters less for them than men. Regardless of the educational environment, a woman's education level has a positive impact on participation in electoral activity. In fact, even though women generally participate less in electoral activity than men, women with advanced degrees in highly educated environments participate at about the same rate as men in an identical context. In sum, not only does sorting apply only to electoral activity, but it also applies mostly to men.         "
"48","In contrast to democratic engagement, NJS argue that the educational environment has a very different relationship to what they call “democratic enlightenment,” which includes both political tolerance (i.e., respect for civil liberties) and knowledge. Instead of sorting, they argue that the educational environment has a cumulative effect on enlightenment—that is, more education in the environment increases enlightenment for everyone (the cumulative model). In their over‐time analysis of repeated cross‐sectional data, they find evidence to support the cumulative model's impact on tolerance, but are unable to test it on knowledge."
"49","Estimating the impact of a localized educational environment on tolerance and knowledge presents another opportunity to confirm, and elaborate, the theory proposed by NJS. Specifically, NJS find that an environment with greater average education is a rising tide, lifting the tolerance of everyone equally, regardless of an individual's own level of education. This analysis tests whether that will also prove to be the case when accounting for the variation in educational environment across both age and place, and when applying the cumulative model to measures of both tolerance and knowledge. Incorporating the interaction between individual‐level and environmental education also presents an opportunity to test an important, but unexamined, theoretical implication of the cumulative model. While NJS argue that more education in the environment raises the enlightenment of all equally, their own explanation of the mechanism at work implies an interaction between education at the individual level and the educational environment."
"50","                        "
"51","For characteristics of enlightenment, the educational environment represents the cognitive sophistication of those with whom one has contact and by whom one is influenced. In the cumulative model, a more educated environment works in a positive direction in its influence on certain characteristics of enlightenment, such as tolerance. (107, emphasis added)               "
"52","In other words, NJS argue that it is through direct contact with people who have a higher level of education that an educated environment pushes up an individual's level of tolerance and, by implication, knowledge as well. Since “like attracts like,” it is the highly educated who are most regularly in contact with others who have a high level of education. The greater the average attainment level within the educational environment, the more likely that highly educated people have a social network comprised of people with a similarly high level of education. We should thus expect that, in stark contrast to the model for electoral activity, the more education one has, the greater the impact of living in a highly educated environment—because of social interaction with others who have a high level of education and, therefore, enlightenment. In other words, a more educated environment amplifies the impact of an individual's own level of education (the amplification model).         "
"53","To test the amplification model, the identical set of variables used to model the various forms of engagement is included in equations predicting both tolerance and knowledge. Tolerance is measured with a single item that asks whether it should be permissible for someone to give a speech advocating the inferiority of women, while knowledge is tapped with three factual questions.23 The amplification model presumes personal interaction as a mechanism, which requires a localized context for the educational environment. Zip code is the smallest geographic unit available, and so that is the level at which the educational environment is measured. In operational terms, the amplification model predicts that the interaction between Education and Educational Environment is positive. Ordered logit is again the estimator, and the standard errors are adjusted for clustering by educational environment.         "
"54","As displayed in columns 4 and 5 of Table 3, the amplification hypothesis finds support for both tolerance and knowledge; in each model, Education × Educational Environment is positive and highly significant. Figures 2A and 2B graph the cumulative effect for 25–34‐year‐olds. In both figures, we see that the educational environment makes no difference for people with a high school diploma, but that as individuals' educational attainment rises the educational environment has a stronger impact. In short, the results for enlightenment are a mirror image of what was observed for electoral activity. The impact of education is larger (that is, amplified) within a more educated environment. Unlike the impact of sorting on electoral activity, analysis not shown also indicates that amplification's impact on democratic enlightenment does not differ by gender or by race.         "

"56"," Note: All control variables set to their means.                     "
"57","The evidence favoring the amplification hypothesis suggests a contagion effect—being around others with a high level of tolerance and knowledge begets greater tolerance and knowledge. If further evidence for a contagion effect holds up, it would support the claim that education has positive externalities for fostering these two democratic virtues. In other words, it is not just that individuals who have more education are more enlightened. Living in a community with others who are highly educated accelerates that enlightenment."
"58","Note that cross‐sectional data cannot determine whether there truly is a contagion effect, as these results are also consistent with a self‐selection process whereby people who are more knowledgeable and tolerant choose to live in more highly educated environments. Contagion is mentioned as a mechanism worth pursuing in other research better designed to sort out causation."
"59","The purpose of this article is to revisit the theoretical claims made by Nie, Junn, and Stehlik‐Barry (1996) about the need to account for relative, not just absolute, education in models of civic engagement. But while NJS focus their attention on variation in education levels by age, this analysis also accounts for variation in educational levels across place. In their essentials, these results concur with NJS: educational environment matters. In a finding consonant with NJS, when educational environment is defined in terms of both age and place, it has a cumulative effect on both political tolerance and knowledge. These findings also extend the work of NJS by showing that the cumulative effect is not the same for everyone, as the educational environment amplifies the impact of an individual's own educational attainment.         "
"60","However, this analysis narrows another application of educational environment. Rather than applying to multiple forms of participation, it only applies to one—electoral activity. Accordingly, we can refine our understanding of the mechanism underlying educational sorting. NJS postulate that educational sorting applies because engagement is zero‐sum—a gain by one equals a loss by another. The specific campaign‐related activities to which sorting applies, however, are not truly zero‐sum, since electoral activity usually entails mustering more supporters for your cause. Instead, these results are consistent with the argument that education matters for electoral activity because of the greater stake those with more education, and thus greater social network centrality, have in the outcomes of an electoral contest."
"61","In addition to age and place, this article further narrows the sorting model by incorporating gender into the analysis. Results here indicate that the educational environment has less impact on women than men. For women, unlike men, educational attainment continues to have a positive relationship to electoral activity even in a high‐education environment. This difference between men and women suggests that in spite of—or perhaps because of—women's increasing levels of educational attainment, their social network centrality is less a matter of relative than absolute education. Sorting out the precise explanation for the gender difference is beyond the scope of this particular article, but should be a priority for future research."
"62","Because this article's objective has been to clarify the theoretical underpinnings of the sorting model, it has been limited to a single cross‐sectional dataset with especially rich measures of civic and political participation. Consequently, it is silent on trends over time, obviously a primary concern for NJS and others who have written about the sorting model (Helliwell and Putnam 2007; Tenn 2005). Future research would profit from combining measures of educational variation over age and place and time. Americans' tendencies toward both mobility and homophily suggest that, over time, people with similar education levels have increasingly clustered together. If so, we should expect relative education to have a diminishing impact on electoral activity. Confirmed empirically, such a finding would only further narrow the application of the sorting model.24"
"63","Narrowing the sorting model actually broadens our understanding of “education as the universal solvent,” as these results suggest that education's effect on civic engagement is not limited to the social status it confers. This finding, however, simply clears the way for research on what schools do to facilitate civic engagement. For example, virtually every study that employs education, including this one, treats all types of schooling as equal, when there are obviously wide disparities across high schools and colleges. Fortunately, research on civic education has begun to move in this direction, as recent studies have shown that racial diversity and the openness of the classroom climate matter for civic education (Campbell 2007, 2008), while the size of the school does not (Lay 2007). Clearly, though, much more can be learned about schooling's effects on civic engagement.         "
"64","Policymakers should be encouraged that the public investment in education appears to have a civic payoff after all. At a time when an instrumental, careerist perspective on education dominates public discourse, we are reminded that education—at all levels—has a civic dimension as well. Hopefully, more policymakers will recognize the civic component of education, and partner with researchers in order to better understand, and even improve upon, it."
