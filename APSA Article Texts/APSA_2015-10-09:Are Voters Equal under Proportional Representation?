"1","Are voters under proportional representation (PR) equally represented in parliament? If not, is there a systematic ideological bias in representation under PR? And finally, what districting principles enhance representational equality among voters? Surprisingly, in spite of voluminous literature on electoral systems and representation, a systematic analysis of representational equality of voters under PR is almost entirely wanting."
"2","From Spain to Finland, by far the most common electoral system in Europe (and beyond) is proportional representation with districts.1Interestingly, in almost all PR systems, some districts have only a few representatives and others many, with the largest district having as many as 20 times more representatives than the smallest one. Districts of the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic (2009), for example, range in their magnitude from 2 to 47 seats. The Norwegian Storting (2009) has nine different district magnitudes, ranging from 4 to 17. Compensatory seats (an issue we address below) notwithstanding, this creates variation of electoral regimes within states: Some voters have their vote counted by majoritarian‐like rules, and others by proportional ones.         "
"3","This basic and often overlooked institutional variation within states brings up an issue with crucial normative implications relevant for all democracies, but particularly potent where the rules of the game vary across voters: What if “one person, one vote” only nominally holds as votes unequally translate to seats in legislature in a fashion generating ideological bias?"
"4","In answering these questions, we offer two contributions. First, we demonstrate that there is a systematic ideological pattern to representational inequality under PR. Borrowing analytic tools from the study of income inequality, we find that substantial variation in district magnitude often leads to bias of the parliamentary pie in favor of right‐wing voters (see discussion of Monroe and Rose's 2002 findings below). Simply, the smaller the district, the more majoritarian is the electoral regime and thus the more advantaged are the leading parties. Since in Western democracies small districts tend to be conservative whereas large ones, usually cities, tend to be both more liberal and more proportionate in comparison, voter support for right‐wing parties is overconverted to parliamentary seats and that for left‐leaning ones is underconverted.         "
"5","Our second contribution identifies how different districting schemes affect the level of representational inequality across countries. While the vast literature on electoral systems focuses on the average (or median) district, we call attention to the distribution of districts: It makes a difference if some are small and others are large or all are of similar magnitude. We show that across countries, irrespective of the average district, the share of parliament elected via small districts affects voter inequality. This finding has important implications for institutional design.         "
"6","It is well established that democracies with proportional representation are characterized by better representation compared with majoritarian democracies. PR allows diverse voices and interests to be heard and considered in parliament, government, and the policymaking process (e.g., Amorim Neto and Cox 1997; Clark and Golder 2006; Cox 1997; Duverger 1954; Lijphart 1999; Norris 2004; Rae 1967; Taagepera and Shugart 1989). It also enables better representation of minority groups (Shugart 1994), as well as women (Darcy, Hadley, and Kirksey 1993; Norris 1985), and better ideological congruence between the government and voters in comparison to majoritarian systems (Huber and Powell 1994; Powell 2000; Powell and Vanberg 2000).2Perhaps best established of all is that parliamentary seats under PR are allocated (more or less) proportionately to the votes obtained by the different parties (Gallagher 1991), and indeed, students of electoral politics offer different ways of accounting for disproportionality between votes and seats (Grofman 1983; Rose 1984; Taagepera and Shugart 1989, 105).3"
"7","Measures of representation such as congruence or disproportionality at the national level compare median ideology of the electorate to that of the median legislator, national vote shares to seat shares, or some other attribute of the electorate as a whole to the analogous one in parliament.4 While providing an excellent summary under national‐district PR, this approach to studying representation is in tension with ample evidence demonstrating that where the electoral system is districted, both voters’ positions and representative behavior are colored by districted interests. Studies of legislative behavior provide evidence of geographically geared representation under PR. In both the German Bundestag (Stratmann and Baur 2002) and the European Parliament (Bowler and Farrell 1993), variation in legislators’ behavior is explained by whether they were elected in district or nationally. District‐specific efforts by legislators (Heitshusen et al. 2005) and the effectiveness of personal‐vote attributes in getting elected (Shugart, Valdini, and Suominen 2005) were shown under multimember districts as well.5 It is not the case, these studies show, that representatives from one district serve their party supporters residing in another district as much as they serve their own voters. Informed by these studies, our analysis of representation below identifies votes by both the party cast for and the district in which they are cast.         "
"8","A related line of research studies representational bias (sometimes referred to as partisan bias; e.g., Besley and Preston 2007; Browning and King 1987; Calvo 2009; Linzer 2012). A recent study by Rodden (2010) is particularly relevant for our analysis. Analyzing bias under First Past The Post (FPTP), Rodden shows that due to the legacy of the Industrial Revolution, left‐leaning voters tend to be geographically concentrated, and hence left‐leaning parties win their districts by a wide margin compared with right‐leaning parties. Thus, votes for left parties are less efficiently turned into seats than votes for the right. At the core of Rodden's argument, therefore, is the high skewness of the distribution of votes in left‐majority districts versus that in right‐majority districts, both under the same institution of single‐member district.         "
"9","We analyze representational inequality—and hence representational bias—under proportional representation, an unlikely suspect. Unlike other studies, our analysis draws attention to institutional variation within countries as a potential source of the bias: Different voters have their vote channeled by different rules of the game."
"10","We conceptualize the voter as embedded in two contexts: the district she resides in and the party she votes for. Figure 1 lays out our conceptual setup. Take two neighbors, Anne and Bob, who reside in the same district but cast their ballot for different parties first (see Panel 1A). We wish to know whether their votes are equally converted to seats or whether the voice of one of them is amplified at the expense of the other. Although our framework is constructed for the individual voter, we can group voters and more easily analyze representational inequality across them. We group the electorate to groups of voters categorized by the party they support and the district in which they reside, as is described in Panel A. There is thus a group of voters such as Anne who reside in D1 and support P1, a group such as Bob who reside in D1 and support P2, and so on.            "
"11","Voter (In)equality in Two Contexts"
"12","Note: The setup (Panels A and B): Voters cast V votes in total, electing representatives for an S seats parliament. K parties (j = 1, . . . , K) compete in N districts (i = 1, . . . , N). In Panel C, the axes denote cumulative vote share against cumulative seat share. The downward arrow notes the position (cumulative vote share) where the inequality curve dips the most and CR = 1 (hence, votes of voters to the left of it are underconverted to seats and those to its right are overconverted).                        "
"13","This setup allows us to take an explicit account of the fact that votes are cast and counted in and seats are allotted to districts. Just as in any given district some votes may be overconverted to seats and others underconverted, it is also the case that for a given party, electoral support originating from some districts may be overconverted and that from others underconverted. A party, say P1, which Anne and Cindy both support, may form policy that inevitably prioritizes interests in society. These interests, even if not regional per se, often correlate strongly with geography. A tax code that benefits farmers over industry will promote the interests of rural areas at the expense of industrial ones; a developmental plan that invests in infrastructure in the north indirectly transfers wealth from south to north; pork provision to Cindy's district rather than Anne's will have clear consequences; and so on. In other words, forming policy, a party may de facto allocate resources across districts.            "
"14","We borrow and adapt tools of analysis from the study of income inequality. In particular, we adapt the Lorenz curve of income inequality and Gini inequality index score to the study of representation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this approach has been taken in the study of representation.6"
"15","Assume a democracy with a PR electoral system of N districts (i = 1, . . . , N) in which voters cast V votes in total, electing representatives for an S seat in parliament. Assume further that K parties (j = 1, . . . , K) compete in the elections.7 Let () denote the number of votes and seats in district i and of party j. For each group of voters in the table (Figure 1B), we calculate its vote share and seat share out of all votes cast and seats allocated ( and , respectively). We then calculate for the group (and, in fact, for every member of the group) the conversion ratio of votes to seats: . Voters who contribute a share of votes greater than the share of seats they receive (CR < 1) have their voice diminished, whereas those whose seat share is greater than their vote share have their voice amplified (CR > 1). We line up voters by ascending order of that ratio whereby every data point is a group of voters residing in district i and supporting party j and draw the representational inequality curve of the election. The vote (seat) share of one group serves as a baseline for the next, such that on the horizontal axis is the cumulative vote share and on the vertical axis the cumulative seat share. For example, if of all NK groups of voters the two smallest conversion ratios are for supporters of P1 in D3 (the party won 15% of the votes and 10 out of 100 seats in parliament) and for P2 in D1 (the party won 8% of the votes and no seats), the coordinates of the two lowest points on the curve are D1P2 = (0.08, 0.00) and D3P1 = (0.23, 0.10) with conversion ratios of  and , respectively. The slope of the curve leading to each data point thus stands for the conversion ratio of the relevant group of votes.            "
"16","Panel C presents a hypothetical curve of representational inequality among voters. We marked our four voters from Figure 1A (initialed) on the curve. The 45‐degree line denotes perfect equality in the conversion of votes to seats. The figure reveals several interesting quantities. First, as the figure in this example indicates, 5% of the votes were not converted to seats. Also, note that voters such as Anne and Bob with a slope smaller than 1 are underrepresented, whereas Cindy and David are overrepresented. Third, the shape of the curve is indicative of the type of misrepresentation in the country. With the curve reaching a maximum vertical distance from the 45‐degree line at about 0.53, 53% of the votes in the country are underrepresented, and the remaining 47% are overrepresented in parliament. The more rightward the curve reaches its maximum dip (“high belly”), the greater the proportion of voters whose voice is diminished in parliament. Fourth, an examination of the actual parties/districts at different places along the curve can reveal which votes (characterized by both district and party) are systematically underleveraged to seats and which voices get overleveraged.            "
"17","Lastly, constructing a summary figure for the election, we calculate the Representational Inequality Index (RI), which equals the area between the 45‐degree line of perfect equality and the curve divided by 0.5. Graphically, other things equal, a curve denoting greater inequality will be closer to the bottom right corner compared with a curve of little inequality that will be closer to the 45‐degree line. Varying in size between 0 and 1, the more unequal is the transformation of votes to seats across groups of voters, the greater the RI index of the country as a whole."
"18","Notice that the analysis we propose is informed by both partisan and geographic components of votes‐seats discrepancy. The following illustration might shed light on the relationship between our approach, disproportionality, and malapportionment. Assume a state with 20 single‐member districts and no malapportionment. Assume further a two‐party competition such that Party A wins districts 1–10 with 51% of the vote and Party B wins districts 11–20 with 51% of the vote. Each of the two parties ends up with 10 seats in the legislature. At the national level, therefore, each of the two parties has 50% of the votes and 50% of the seats. Both malapportionment and measures of disproportionality would show no representational discrepancy. Our analysis, on the other hand, would produce an inequality curve of a straight horizontal line at 0 up to 49% (20 of 40 groups of voters who gained no representation in parliament and cast 49% of the votes in their district each) and an RI index of 0.49. At the same time, since our measure identifies votes (seats) by party and district, other things equal, had the state been malapportioned, representational inequality would have been even greater."
"19","We are now able to derive hypotheses about the pattern of representation both within and across countries. We begin with the former."
"20","Our first question was as follows: Are voters equal under proportional representation, and if not, who equals more? Some discrepancies between the distribution of votes and that of representatives are inevitable. Below, however, we show substantial inequality and turn to investigate its pattern."
"21","We expect that large parties will enjoy a seat premium under districted systems, particularly under small districts (Cox 1997). Ideologically mapping the majority and minority parties in different magnitude districts, we can substantively identify winners and losers. An electoral district is often an institutional boundary of a community. Communities in small towns, rural areas, and the periphery are usually small, whereas cities are often large districts. This is the case in the majority of Western European countries (e.g., 47 and 39 seats in the two largest cities while the median district magnitude equals 6 in Portugal; 42 and 28 while the median is 9 in Sweden). But there is an additional important difference correlating with district magnitude: In Western countries, cities tend to be more liberal than rural areas and small towns. Thus, conservative parties tend to be a majority (or plurality) in those districts where the rules of the game benefit the largest competitor (relatively small districts), whereas liberal parties tend to be a majority (or plurality) in districts where the rules of the game are relatively proportional (larger districts in comparison). Our first hypothesis is thus:                  "
"22","An exception to this pattern is small but geographically concentrated parties. Calvo (2009) convincingly shows that the geographic dispersion of voter support affects the ability of small parties to compete and in particular to withstand competition from new parties. Calvo as well as Ziegfeld (2013) demonstrate that small and geographically concentrated parties are better able to secure seats compared with their geographically dispersed counterparts.               "
"23","Before we continue, a particularly insightful recent work examines the relationship between geography and the electoral success of particular interests and merits our attention. Monroe and Rose (2002) offer an account of representation of urban versus rural interests due to what they term the variance effect—the fact that districted PR often has large variation in the magnitude of districts. They show that urban interests are better represented than rural ones, that there is higher parliamentary fragmentation of urban parties compared with rural ones, and that the largest urban party is systematically disadvantaged.8Our argument here, in combination with the rest of our analysis of voter inequality, complements Monroe and Rose's in that we offer a general framework for examining voter inequality. One can think of the right‐wing bias we identify as a specific case in which the magnitude of the district and hence the rules of the game covary with voter preferences and result in representational bias.               "
"24","Does the districting structure in a country affect its representational inequality? One of the most established stylized facts in the study of electoral systems is that the greater the district magnitude, the more proportional is the system (see, e.g., Lijphart 1984; Taagepera and Shugart 1989). Specifically, the relationship established is between a central tendency of district magnitude and the degree of proportionality in the country, commonly specified in one of three ways: average district magnitude in the country (e.g., Edwards and Thames 2007; Taagepera and Ensch 2006), median district magnitude (e.g., Carey and Hix 2011), and the magnitude of the district electing the median legislator (Amorim Neto and Cox 1997; Gabel and Scheve 2007).9Our theorizing suggests that perhaps something else is at work. If indeed supporters of right‐leaning parties are overrepresented in small districts more than in large ones, as is the case in most Western countries, then the share of parliament elected via small districts should matter irrespective of the average (or median) district.10This allows us to shift from winners and losers within a country to cross‐country analysis of the general level of representational inequality. In particular:                  "
"25","If supported empirically, this conjecture has key implications not only for our understanding of parliamentary representation of different groups but also for the design of electoral systems."
"26","These hypotheses allow us to examine inequality among supporters of different parties as well as differences in representational inequality across countries. We turn now to empirically evaluate them."
"27","We utilize district‐level data of recent elections in 20 Western parliamentary democracies. These include a wide range of electoral systems: 14 cases of districted proportional representation complemented by three cases of FPTP and four cases of national‐district PR in our cross‐country analysis. Geographically, 17 of our cases are Western European, and to those, Canada and New Zealand 1993 are additions on the majoritarian end, and Israel and New Zealand 1996 are additions on the national‐district PR end.11The two New Zealand cases, immediately before and after the reform, give us additional empirical traction. Excluded from our data is Austria. The Austrian system allocates a large fraction of parliamentary seats above the district level (e.g., in 2008, only 71 of 183 seats were allocated at the district stage). This makes any attempt to empirically analyze representation based on allocation of seats at the district level futile. (Greece, too, has a fraction of parliamentary seats that are allocated above the district level, but in the relevant elections, 96% of the seats were allocated in the districts themselves; hence, we include it in our analysis.) Table A1 in the supporting information presents a full list of our cases and information about their districting structure.12"
"28","Our 14 districted PR systems vary both in their average and median districts and in the variation of their district magnitudes. With the exception of Italy (22.5), average district magnitude varies from 3.9 (Ireland) to 15 (Luxembourg) and is 9.4 on average. Within‐country range is as small as two in Ireland and as large as 45 in Portugal. The distribution in most countries tends to be right‐tailed, with many districts of small magnitude and a few districts of large magnitude."
"29","Before we move on, an important issue needs to be addressed. Some of our districted PR cases have compensatory seats designed to mitigate district‐level distortions. Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have “at large” seats tagged onto each district, consisting of 0.14, 0.11, and 0.11 seats in their parliaments, respectively. These seats are allotted to parties by national vote shares and are added to every geographically defined district after district‐level gaps between votes and seats are calculated. Put differently, districts have a few (or one) seats that are allotted by a calculation different from that of the rest of the seats in the district. Our data include these seats as part of the district, and hence such mechanisms aimed to mitigate distortion in representation are accounted for by our data. Unlike these three cases, in Denmark, a compensatory district of 40 seats exists separately from the geographically defined districts. Similar to the other cases, however, this district does not result from a separate set of votes but rather from the regular votes cast in the districts. In this case, our analysis does not include that additional district (in fact, we cannot include them, as they do not result from separate votes) and potentially somewhat overestimates distortion in representation.            "
"30","Overall, our data consist of 236 parties (153 of which attained seats in parliaments) in 1,391 districts (330 in districted PR systems). We included in our database all competing parties but grouped voters of extremely small parties and individual candidates if they failed to reach 0.2% of the national vote. Our data sources are official online records of election results usually published by the committee of national elections or the Ministry of the Interior in the relevant country."
"31","Figure 2 presents a general picture of representational inequality in 20 democracies. These are the empirical realizations of the hypothetical graph in Figure 1C, with every point on each curve representing voters who support a particular party and reside in a particular district (NK points per country). The countries are organized by ascending order of average district magnitude, beginning with FPTP (the first three cases), moving onto districted PR in the following 14 cases, and ending with national‐district PR in the last four cases.            "
"32","Representational Inequality in 20 Democracies"
"33","Note: The figure presents representational inequality curves for the 21 election years in our analysis. At the top left corner is the Representational Inequality index (RI) for each election. Countries are organized in ascending order of average district magnitude (see Table A1 in the supporting information for details).                        "
"34","The first three cases display particularly high inequality, with an RI index of close to 0.6 and over 50% of the votes that are not converted to seats in parliament (the horizontal part of the curve at zero). For comparison, in the United Kingdom, 53% of the votes cast in constituencies are not represented, whereas the parallel figure ignoring constituencies and aggregating votes and seats nationwide instead is no more than 7%. The smallest inequality is observed in the four national‐district PR cases at the bottom row. There, only a relatively small fraction of the vote is not converted to seats and the RI index ranges from 0.02 to 0.08. Notice in particular the dramatic difference between New Zealand 1993 and 1996."
"35","The 14 districted PR systems are characterized by greater voter inequality than one might expect. In fact, they are as much as halfway between the PR in a single national district and the FPTP systems. Importantly, voter inequality is not only about the votes that are not converted to seats in the district. Recall that the shape of the curvature is informative. In some countries, the curve dips the most on the left while in others it dips on the right—not only does the overall degree of misrepresentation vary by country, but so does the proportion of underrepresented."
"36","A bird's‐eye view, then, indicates that there is substantial variation in voter inequality within countries as well as variation in the general level of inequality across countries. The latter, it seems, is not only about the magnitude of the average district. We next turn to within‐country analysis, followed by cross‐country comparison in the subsequent section."
"37","Whose voice is amplified and whose is diminished? As mentioned above, large districts are often an electoral reflection of urban communities, whereas small districts are those of rural and peripheral areas and small towns. Given that in Western democracies the former are often more liberal than the latter and given the greater inequality in small districts (a point we establish below), we hypothesized that supporters of right‐leaning parties are overrepresented compared with those supporting left‐leaning parties and more so the smaller the district."
"38","To test the hypothesis, we utilize Benoit and Laver's (2006) expert survey of party placements conducted during the period of 2002–4. The survey includes data on party placements on various policy dimensions, with the general left‐right dimension being most relevant for our purposes. The placements are coded on a 20‐point scale such that high values denote a right‐wing position. Since the elections we analyze are not within that time window but rather one or two cycles later depending on the country (in fact, not all countries held elections during the relevant time frame), we assume that there is no major leapfrogging that changes the order of parties on the left‐right continuum in the relevant period. In terms of coverage, in six of the cases all parliamentary parties are coded in the expert survey, and in an additional five cases almost all are coded.13 Italy has key parties missing a placement coding and is thus removed from this analysis.            "
"39","We estimated an interacted regression model of conversion ratio at the district/party level. On the right‐hand side, we have a party's left‐right placement, district magnitude, and their interaction such that at time t:               "
"40","We ran the model for each of the 12 districted PR cases14 separately as well as pooled. Our key quantity of interest is the association between the ideological placement of a party and the conversion ratio of its votes to seats and how this association is modified by district magnitude (the estimates themselves are reported in the Table A2 in the supporting information.            "
"41","Figure 3 presents substantive effects based on this analysis in each of the 12 countries that vary in their district magnitude. On the vertical axis is the effect of ideological placement on the party's conversion rate in the district, and on the horizontal axis is the (logged) district magnitude (see the discussion in Brambor, Clark, and Golder 2006 as well as Berry, Golder, and Milton 2012). An effect line above zero implies that right‐leaning parties better convert votes to seats than left‐leaning parties do. A positive yet decreasing effect line that approaches zero from above implies that as the district magnitude increases, right‐wing voters lose their relative advantage of having their voice amplified compared to their left‐wing counterparts.            "
"42","Conversion of Votes to Seats: The Effect of Party Ideology"
"43","Note: Countries are organized in ascending order of average district magnitude. Minimum and maximum district magnitudes are reported under country names. The line represents the marginal effect of party ideological placement on CR modified by district magnitude. 95% confidence intervals are marked. Standard errors are clustered by districts. The pooled model includes country fixed effects and clustered standard errors by districts. Estimation results are reported in Table A2 in the supporting information. See the robustness checks for additional estimations.                        "
"44","By and large, the findings support our predictions. The mere correlation between the size of electoral communities and thus the degree to which their rules of the game are proportional and the prevalent preference in those communities tilts the playing ground.15Let us carefully consider the results.            "
"45","In those countries with substantial heterogeneity in electoral regimes, supporters of right‐leaning parties are advantaged, and this advantage dissipates as district magnitude gets larger. This is the case in Greece, with district magnitude spanning from 1 to 42, Spain (1 to 35), Sweden (2 to 42), and Portugal (2 to 47, although in the latter the interaction effect is significant only at 0.09). This is also the case in Denmark, where heterogeneity is somewhat smaller. In these cases, right‐wing parties better convert voter support to seats compared with left‐wing parties in small districts. With the exception of the two largest districts in Sweden, this advantage becomes no different from zero once the district is large enough. In Spain, for instance, it takes place for district magnitude larger than 11.16"
"46","In two countries, Luxembourg and Ireland, the effect is positive, indicating an advantage to right‐leaning parties, but not necessarily declining with magnitude. In Luxembourg, the small number of districts (four) may contribute to the large standard errors. The Irish case is an interesting one from several aspects. The combination of small districts and small variation in magnitude (three to five representatives per district) as well as the fact that left‐right categorization might carry less information there compared with other countries might make the estimation noisier. Additionally, Rodden's (2010) argument about single‐member districts can be extended to this case: If indeed the left wins the district by a large margin and the right by a small margin, right‐leaning parties better convert votes to seats compared with their left counterparts in small districts, as in Ireland. Lastly, in the remaining countries—Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland—the effect is in the expected direction, albeit not statistically significant.            "
"47","Our insights from the within‐country comparisons call for cross‐country analysis of the effect of districting schemes on the overall level of representational inequality. As we show in Figure 2 above, the fact that systems of single‐member districts are characterized by particularly high representational inequality and those of very large districts (in fact, a national district) by a high level of equality is only part of the story. There is a substantial degree of variation in inequality among districted PR cases, and importantly, inequality does not simply decline with average district magnitude.            "
"48","To analyze variation in the overall level of representational inequality across countries, we first examine the districting structure in our districted PR cases.17Figure 4 presents histograms of district magnitudes in 13 countries. Given our findings about the high level of inequality across voters found in small districts, we pay special attention to the proportion of voters casting their ballot in small districts. The dashed line marks the proportion of parliament elected in districts smaller than five.            "
"49","Distributions of District Magnitudes under Districted PR"
"50","Note: The figure presents histograms of district magnitudes in 13 Western European districted PR systems. The black line marks district magnitude of five. In the upper right corner is the percentage of seats in parliament elected in districts smaller than five. Countries are organized in ascending order of average district magnitude.                        "
"51","Most distributions are right‐tailed with the average being greater than the median (not reported here), and some have a considerable number of small districts. Spain is such an example. With an average district magnitude of 6.73 and a median of five, Spain has districts of magnitude 35 (Madrid) and 31 (Barcelona). At the same time, as many as 18% of representatives in the 350‐seat Congress of Deputies are elected via districts whose magnitude is smaller than five. Portugal, Sweden, and Greece are similarly distributed. Yet not all distributions are right‐tailed, as one can see in Ireland or Denmark, among other cases. The districting structure, then, varies across states."
"52","To evaluate the effect of the districting structure on inequality, we shift to analyzing our summary RI index. In particular, Table 1 presents the degree of country‐level inequality captured by the RI index as a function of the proportion of parliament elected via districts with magnitude smaller than three, five, or seven members (see gray column). As above, the analysis in this table includes all 20 states.18We expect a positive coefficient on the fraction of parliament elected via small districts (leading to a greater level of inequality). Importantly, the analysis controls for the magnitude of the central district. We use three different measures of central tendency commonly found in the literature (see the discussion leading to Hypothesis 2 above): the magnitude of the average district, the median district, and the district electing the median legislator.19We also control for ordinal ranking of the proportionality of the electoral formula, as specified in Lijphart (1990; 1 = Hare or Sainte Laguë; 2 = Hagenbach‐Bischoff/Droop, modified Sainte Laguë, or single transferable vote [STV]; 3 = d'Hondt; 4 = single‐member plurality). Lastly, we control for whether a state has STV (Ireland and Malta in this case). The robustness section below reports alternative specifications.            "
"53","The results support our hypothesis. The greater is the share of parliament elected via small districts, the greater is inequality across voters. These results hold for the three alternative magnitudes and for the three alternative central tendency measures.20 Notice further that the coefficient on central tendency (Models 1, 5, and 9) is reduced once the fraction elected via small districts is added to the analysis. These results draw attention to an aspect of districting design and its effect on the quality of representation overlooked by the voluminous literature of electoral systems. How representationally unequal a democracy is is determined not only by how majoritarian is the voting environment of the median or average voter, but also to a large degree by the lower tail: how many legislators are elected in majoritarian or almost majoritarian settings.            "
"54","In addition to our hypotheses, we empirically evaluated the behavior of our concept of representational inequality, conducting two analyses. First, we analyzed the level of representational inequality by district magnitude. To this end, we ran a model at the party/district level within each of the districted PR cases in which we estimated the effect of (logged) district magnitude on the degree to which the conversion ratio is different from one.21 In all cases, we find the relationship as expected—small districts are characterized by greater inequality compared with large districts—and in all but one, this relationship is statistically significant.            "
"55","Second, we analyzed parliamentary representation of supporters of small and large parties. In particular, we expected that voters of electorally large parties have their voice amplified in parliament compared with that of supporters of small parties, and that the effect is stronger where district magnitude is small. We ran an interacted regression model at the district/party level in which we estimated the effect of party vote share in the district on conversion ratio and let that effect be modified by district magnitude. The results support our expectation (see Table A4 and Figure A1 in the supporting materials). In all countries, voters who support large parties are overrepresented in parliament compared with their vote share at the expense of those who support small parties, and in most countries this effect declines with district magnitude.22"
"56","We estimated our models in various ways. The results reported for Hypothesis 1 above are both country‐by‐country and pooled, where the former includes standard errors clustered by districts and the latter standard errors clustered by districts and country fixed effects.23 We also estimated the models with party‐clustered standard errors.24 The results are similar, although the standard errors are larger. Additionally, we estimated hierarchical models with partially crossed random effects. The results are remarkably similar to the original ones reported in Table A2 in the supporting information. The one exception is Denmark, where under the hierarchical model the uncertainty of the interaction term exceeds standard levels of statistical significance. These results are reported in Table A5 in the supporting materials.25 Lastly, in cases for which the Chapel Hill Expert Survey data on party ideological placement are collected in years temporally closer to the election years analyzed than Benoit and Laver's data, we reconducted the analysis using these party placements (Bakker et al. 2015; Hooghe et al. 2010). The two data sets correlate at 0.96, and the results are almost identical to the original ones.            "
"57","We also estimated various versions of our model testing Hypothesis 2 with the third central tendency measure, the magnitude of the median legislator. In particular, we varied inclusion of control variables, inclusion and specifications of the electoral formula ranking, and the cases included in the analysis. In a nutshell: Results hold for districts smaller than five in almost all specifications, and depending on specification for districts smaller than three or seven. What follows is a detailed account."
"58","There is no one agreed‐upon scale of proportionality of electoral formulae, and in fact, nor is there a single criterion by which to evaluate formulae (see Gallagher 1992, 494). Thus, we ran the analysis using three additional alternative rankings: Rae's (1967; consistent with Farrell's 2011 framework), Gallagher's (1992), and Benoit's (2000).26"
"59","Results with control of electoral formula alone hold for districts smaller than three and five given all rankings and for districts smaller than seven depending on the ranking. Results with control for single‐member district hold for districts smaller than five under Lijphart and Gallagher's rankings of formulae. Results with no control variables hold for districts smaller than three and five. When running the analysis controlling for Malta rather than STV, results hold for all three district magnitudes (both with and without formulae). Results with control for single‐member district and STV hold for districts smaller than five depending on the formula coding. When only the 13 districted PR states are included in the analysis, results hold for districts smaller than five, controlling for electoral formula (the four alternative rankings) or STV. This is also the case when both formula and STV are included in the model, although there, they hold only under Lijphart's and Gallagher's formula rankings. Lastly, we ran the analysis on the districted PR cases, omitting Malta. Results hold for districts smaller than five and seven, and once the electoral formula is added, they hold under Lijphart's and Gallagher's rankings."
"60","Lastly, we included malapportionment, a key suspect for causing representational disproportionality (Samuels and Snyder 2001). Our inequality analysis is related to malapportionment but is by no means identical to it. Results including malapportionment hold for magnitudes smaller than three and five for almost all specifications and hold in direction but are not statistically significant for magnitudes smaller than seven. Malapportionment itself is not statistically significant.            "
"61","Above, we contend that copartisans residing in different regions often differ in their interests. In the United States, variation in ideological positions corresponding with districts is established both among legislators (e.g., McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2009) and among voters (Gerber and Lewis 2004).         "
"62","In an analysis conducted on a rich set of policy questions, we show that this is also the case under districted PR. In particular, utilizing data from the 2009 Norwegian Election Surveys, which include multiple policy questions on various dimensions, we compared the positions of supporters of both Labour and the Conservatives residing in the Oslo Metropolitan area with those of their respective copartisans residing in the West, the two most populated regions of the country. We drew on two batteries of questions: the first regarding economic policies, and the second regarding social policies. Answers to these items are on agreement scales."
"63","We find that among Labour supporters, there is no systematic variation in economic policy preferences between those living in the West and their counterparts in the Oslo area. On social issues, however, positions of residents of the Oslo area are more liberal than those of the West, and on most issues substantially so. Among supporters of the Conservatives, we found differences on both dimensions: Those residing in the Oslo area are more liberal compared with their counterparts living in the West on questions of keeping tax revenues, economic inequality, and private schooling. They also hold more liberal positions on social issues. Figure A3 in the supporting information presents the results of this analysis."
"64","This simple analysis suggests that differences correlating with districts among copartisans exist, that some parties are characterized by greater such heterogeneity than others, and that on some issues, party supporters in different parts of the country think alike while on others they do not."
"65","Unequal representation has empirical implications. We briefly reflect on two. Besley and Preston (2007) show that under majoritarian democracy, representational bias has policy implications: Policy pursued by the party enjoying the bias tends to be assertive when the bias is large and tamed when the bias is smaller. In our study, those on the flatter part of the representational inequality curve have a smaller share of parliamentary seats compared with their share in the national vote. Given evidence on districted efforts by parliamentarians discussed above, one might expect that voters whose ratio of seats to votes is low are likely to enjoy fewer services and weaker policy to their benefit compared to their counterparts.         "
"66","Given our finding of representational bias, it is likely that a within‐party bias exists as well. In particular, one might expect that liberal parties in parliament underrepresent their supporters residing in small, conservative districts who constitute a minority there and that conservative parties, on the other hand, overrepresent their supporters residing in small, conservative districts. These two groups are not representative samples of party supporters. The former (underrepresented by their party) are likely closer on average to the center than other supporters of liberal parties, and the latter (overrepresented by their party) are likely further away from the center compared to other supporters of the conservative party. This is likely to create discrepancy between voters and parties’ positions, consistent with the well‐documented regularity in comparative politics whereby parties are more extreme than their voters (e.g., see Adams, Merrill, and Grofman 2005; Iversen 1994).         "
"67","This article offers a new approach to the study of parliamentary representation. We take a bottom‐up strategy whereby we focus on the representation of a single vote and ask how equal it is to that of others under proportional representation. We find a systematic pattern to voter inequality under districted PR—division of the parliamentary pie is often biased in favor of supporters of right‐wing parties in comparison to the electorate. We further demonstrate that districted PR is colored by majoritarianism more than common wisdom suggests, and more so in those countries where the districting structure relies on a few large districts and many small ones. Irrespective of the institutional environment of the average (or median) voter, how many legislators are elected in semi‐majoritarian districts affects the bias in parliament."
"68","The questions we ask about equality in representation and the answers we provide suggest that districted PR, the most prevalent electoral system in the democratic world, does not deliver as well as perceived. Even if representational discrepancies across districts were to cancel out entirely such that no systematic bias for some interests over others would have existed, our analysis challenges the common assumption that representation can be accomplished on average. Few voters would be comforted by the fact that although their own voice is muted, an anonymous supporter at the other end of the country has her own voice amplified."
"69","Our analysis opens the door to new avenues of research on electoral politics. First, our analysis points to the importance of districting under PR. What is often considered to be of key consequence in the Anglo American world of FPTP turns out to be no less central under districted PR. Changing magnitudes of districts even if keeping the median district unchanged is often politically consequential for the representation of various interests. The drawing of district boundaries may also affect minority representation as well as turnout."
"70","On the voters’ side, it extends the definition of strategic voting. Commonly, strategic voting explains why voters shun parties whose viability in obtaining a seat is in question. Our analysis suggests a potentially broader consideration. Voters may desert parties whose ability to convert their votes to parliamentary representation is just hindered (Gunther 1989) and prefer those who amplify their voice. In other words, strategic voting may be not only about getting a seat but also about getting a smaller or larger fraction of a seat for one's vote.         "
"71","Electoral districts are considered an effective democratic instrument that channels local interests into legislative politics. We show that this very same instrument, even under a proportional framework, also compromises a cornerstone of democracy: the equality of votes. It is the association between district magnitude and interests of a district community that biases the playing field: Within one state, different interests are being channeled by different rules of the game. This puts both a normative question and a professional challenge at the doorstep of institutional designers."
