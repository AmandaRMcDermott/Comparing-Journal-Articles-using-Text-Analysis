"1","Miller and Stokes's (1963) classic model of representation suggests that politicians’ perceptions of constituency attitudes may contribute to the observed patterns of partial convergence. In their model, Miller and Stokes (1963) suggest that representatives’ own attitudes and views may mediate the effect of constituents’ attitudes on roll‐call votes by shaping what politicians think of constituents’ preferences. We build on this model and argue that politicians are systematically more likely to discount and dismiss the views of constituents who hold positions they disagree with. We refer to the phenomenon as disagreement discounting.         "
"2","The literatures on representation suggest that disagreement discounting could manifest itself in at least two ways (see also discussion in Butler 2014). First, elected officials might rationalize that these constituents care less about the issue. Constituents’ level of interest is important because politicians have incentives to be more responsive to voters who care deeply about issues (Converse 1964; Dahl 1967; Fenno 1978, 142; Krosnick 1990). As one legislator put it, “There isn't one voter in 20,000 who knows my voting record, except on that one thing that affects him” (Fenno 1978, 142). Consistent with these incentives, legislators prioritize the opinions of constituents who feel strongly about an issue (Wlezien 2004).         "
"3","Kingdon (1981), in his study of what influences how members of Congress vote, highlights constituents’ intensities as a major factor determining how responsive politicians are to public opinion:            "
"4","When the congressman feels strongly [about an issue] and his constituents do not, he will prefer his own feeling, since his constituents, while having an opinion contrary to his, do not feel particularly strongly about the matter. When the congressman does not feel very strongly about the matter but his constituents do, he is likely to go along with them. (Kingdon 1981, 38)               "
"5","Because legislators are more responsive to constituents with intense preferences, politicians will be less responsive to constituents who they think do not feel strongly about the issue."
"6","Second, public officials may assume that the constituents with whom they disagree understand less about the issue. Voters’ knowledge matters because voters recognize that their own expertise varies across policy domains, and this level of confidence affects their willingness to make voting decisions about candidates (Gerber et al. 2011). Consequently, politicians may expect less retribution when they deviate from the preferred policies of voters who are less confident about their own position on the issue. Politicians may also believe they can more easily change these voters’ position. Explaining votes to constituents is an important part of legislative activity (Fenno 1978). This ability to provide an explanation also enables politicians to lead opinion on the issue (Gabel and Scheve 2007). Thus, elected officials may believe that uninformed constituents are more likely to adopt the official's position when they learn more about the issue. We test whether elected officials are using either, or possibly even both, rationalizations.         "
"7","While the literature on representation suggests ways in which disagreement discounting might manifest itself, work in political psychology has identified why disagreement discounting might occur. For example, disagreement discounting may arise because of goal‐oriented motivated reasoning (e.g., Kunda 1990). As Lodge and Taber (2013) explain in their description of this form of motivated reasoning,            "
"8","Citizens are prone to accept those facts and arguments they agree with and discount or actively counterargue those that challenge their preconvictions, where agreement or disagreement is marked by feelings that are automatically triggered in the earliest stages of thinking about the issues. (149)"
"9","Relatedly, discounting may also arise in part because of group dynamics that lead individuals to vilify other groups. Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes (2012) have shown that such motivations can be particularly powerful in today's current political environment. Individuals may assume that people who disagree with them are guided by selfish motives (Doherty 2015), and this may lead them to denigrate the position of those individuals.         "
"10","Further, previous work suggests that any such bias may easily become self‐reinforcing because individuals tend to seek out information that confirms their views (Druckman, Fein, and Leeper 2012; see also Arceneaux and Johnson 2013; Gaines and Kuklinski 2011). The increasingly polarized nature of the news market means that people who seek information that confirms their preexisting views have a much easier time finding such information (Nie et al. 2010).         "
"11","While the existence and influence of motivated reasoning and other cognitive biases have been well established among voters, we know very little about their application to politicians, especially in their assessments of information relevant to their elected positions. On one hand, the election process may minimize the degree to which politicians engage in disagreement discounting. After all, reelection‐minded politicians have incentives to accurately assess and cater to the preferences of the median voter. Dismissing opposing preferences prevents elected officials from knowing what the median voter in their district wants, which would have negative electoral consequences. Further, the election process might lead to the selection of higher‐quality individuals who are less susceptible to the psychological biases that are common among voters. According to this argument, even if politicians engage in disagreement discounting, the ones who exhibit this bias the most should be more likely to lose. As a result, the politicians who win and serve in office for longer may be less likely to engage in disagreement discounting."
"12","On the other hand, politicians may be more likely to discount disagreement than the general populace. First, incumbents’ assessment of their electoral success is likely prone to survivorship bias. They may attribute their success to the positions they took on issues during the campaign, without necessarily considering those who did similar things but failed to win. In other words, they select cases based on the dependent variable, winning, and become victims of their perceived electoral mandate, whether it exists or not (see Kingdon 1967). Information that counters that narrative, then, is perhaps more easily dismissed.         "
"13","Second, the mere act of taking a position and regularly justifying that position to constituents may cause politicians to be more likely to engage in disagreement discounting. Regularly articulating a position may reinforce its superiority in politicians’ minds, causing them to more automatically dismiss any opposing view as a way of avoiding cognitive dissonance (Festinger 1957). As such, it may be cognitively easier to dismiss opinions that counter those positions.         "
"14","We conducted a pair of survey experiments with state legislators and elected municipal officials as the subjects of interest to test whether policy makers engage in disagreement discounting. We also ran a similar experiment on a sample of citizens to assess whether politicians are more susceptible to this bias as a result of having to justify their positions to constituents."
"15","In these experiments, the respondents read a letter that was putatively sent to a public official. The respondents then evaluated whether the writer was informed and cared about the issue. We test whether public officials gave less favorable evaluations to the writers with whom they disagree. To measure the effect of opinion disagreement on public officials’ attitudes toward constituents’ positions, we randomized the letter writer's position on the issue (see Harden 2013 for a similar approach to studying elites’ attitudes).         "
"16","The first experiment was part of a survey that was e‐mailed in March 2012 to the roughly 7,000 state legislators in the United States. In administering the survey, some of the longer questions, including the experiment presented here, were presented to a randomly selected subset of legislators in order to minimize the time burden placed on respondents. Thus, although the overall response rate for the survey was about 15%5 (a total of over 1,000 responses), only about half of those respondents were included in this experiment. In anticipation that legislative staff might take the survey, the first question in the survey asked respondents whether they were a state legislator or a staff member. We present the results using the self‐identified state legislator subsample. Additional details about the survey are presented in the supporting information.         "
"17","The legislators who participated in this experiment read the vignette in Box 1. This vignette was the first of several vignettes that the legislators read in the survey. Because the subsequent vignettes were part of other research projects, we informed respondents in this first vignette that each of the scenarios they would read referred to a different legislator so as to reduce the possibility that they would use information from one vignette to inform their response to another. Respondents then read an e‐mail that was putatively sent by a constituent to another legislator, asking the legislator to advocate for the writer's position (which was randomized) on the issue of raising taxes in order to maintain the current programs in the state.6"

"26","This was a form letter from an interest group"
"27","The writer understands the complexities of this issue"
"28","The writer holds this position strongly"
"29","We chose the issue of taxes versus spending because it is an important, established issue in state legislatures (Carey, Niemi, and Powell 2000). The question measuring legislators’ opinion on this issue was administered at the end of the survey (after distracter questions on orthogonal topics), with the question wording taken from Carey, Niemi, and Powell (2000).7"
"30","For the analysis, we determined whether the letter writer shared or opposed the legislator's position. For example, if the legislator agreed that taxes should be cut (either somewhat or strongly) and the writer in the vignette asked the legislator to support legislation to cut taxes, then the legislator was coded as having received the shared position treatment. If the e‐mail writer opposed tax cuts (either somewhat or strongly) and the legislator supported them (or vice versa), the legislator was coded as having received the opposed position treatment.8"
"31","We measured legislators’ reactions to the writer's opinion by having them indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statements after having read the e‐mail:            "
"32","This letter was likely a form letter sent by an interest group."
"33","The writer likely holds this position strongly."
"34","The writer likely understands the complexities of this issue."
"35","If elected officials rationalize that constituents who agree with them also feel more strongly about the issue, they should be more likely to agree with the statement that the writer likely holds this position strongly. In addition to directly asking elected officials whether the writer likely holds this position strongly, we asked them to rate whether the letter was likely a form letter. Surveys show that the two most common reasons that citizens contact their U.S. senator or representative are that they care deeply about the issue and/or that they were asked to do so by an organization that they trust (Goldschmidt and Ochreiter 2008). Public officials may be more likely to discount form letters by rationalizing that the constituent only sent the letter because he or she was asked to do so (not because he or she personally felt strongly about the issue). Consequently, if elected officials rationalize that constituents who agree with them also feel more strongly about the issue, they might be less likely to agree with the statement that the letter was likely a form letter.         "
"36","Similarly, if elected officials rationalize that constituents who agree with them are better informed about the issue, they should be more likely to agree with the statement that the writer likely understands the complexities of this issue. Understanding the complexities of an issue means that the constituent likely has done more to investigate the issue. The reverse is also true. Constituents who understand less about an issue have probably put less research into the issue.         "
"37","Figure 2, which presents the difference in how many respondents in the shared and opposed position conditions agreed with each statement, shows that legislators exhibited a confirmatory bias in their reaction to the arguments presented in the vignette (Table A4 in the supporting information presents these results in table form). Legislators who agreed with the position taken in the letter were 13 percentage points more likely to agree that the letter writer understood the complexities of the issue (p < .01, two‐tailed). These legislators were also 9 percentage points less likely to think that the letter was a form letter (p = .03, two‐tailed). While they were also 7 percentage points more likely to agree that the letter writer felt strongly about her position, this difference was not statistically significant (p = .12, two‐tailed).            "

"39","Note: This figure shows the differences between the proportion of respondents in the shared and opposed position conditions who agreed with each statement (and the associated 95% confidence interval). The comparisons are based on a sample of 497 to 502 legislators (the number of observations varies because of missing outcomes for a few individuals).                        "
"40","Because legislators are more responsive to constituents who feel strongly about an issue and understand the issue, legislators who learn that their constituents’ preferences differ from their own may not necessarily switch their positions. Significantly, legislators may have full information about their constituents’ preferences but still act in a biased manner because they engage in disagreement discounting by putting more weight on the opinions of those with whom they agree.9"
"41","We designed a second study to test the robustness of this result in two ways. First, we test whether this result only holds on strongly partisan issues (e.g., taxes versus spending cuts) or whether it also holds on less partisan issues. Second, we test whether the bias disappears when officials have information about the letter writer's partisanship and past turnout behavior. One possible explanation for the results of the first experiment is that public officials actually care about a writer's propensity to turn out and support them as opposed to the writer's position. For example, legislators may discount the opinion of a writer with an opposing position because they infer, based on the writer's position, that she identifies with the opposing party and would therefore be unlikely to vote for them."
"42","The second experiment was embedded in the 2012 American Municipal Official Survey. The survey was administered online with an e‐mail invitation that was sent to municipal officials from cities of all sizes across the United States and had a response rate of 20%. The supporting information provides more details about the survey."
"43","Box 2 displays the text of the vignette for the second experiment. We introduced the vignette by noting that each official would be asked about a number of scenarios. We tried to increase the realism of the vignette by using a screen shot of an actual e‐mail (see Figure 3). In the second experiment, we also randomized both the position the letter writer took on the issue and the issue she wrote about. Some officials were randomly selected to receive an e‐mail about efforts to consolidate 911 services with neighboring areas, and others received an e‐mail about providing school vouchers to parents. We chose these two issues because they differ in the degree to which they are established partisan issues.         "

"62","This letter was likely a form letter sent by an interest group"
"63","The writer likely understands the complexities of this issue"
"64","The writer likely holds this position strongly"
"65","The writer likely based his opinions on facts"
"66","The consolidation of 911 services is a nonpartisan issue. Among the policy makers taking this survey, there was no partisan disagreement about this issue:10 87% of Republicans and 84% of Democrats indicated support for efforts to consolidate 911 services to save funds.11 In contrast, the same officials exhibited a strong partisan divide over the issue of school vouchers.12 While 71% of Republicans thought parents should receive school vouchers, only 26% of Democrats felt similarly.         "
"67","Among officials who were assigned to the school vouchers treatment, we also randomized whether the vignette provided information about the partisan affiliation of the letter writer. If the municipal official was randomly assigned to the partisanship treatment, the vignette ended with information from the voter file that indicated the party registration of the e‐mail writer and his recent turnout behavior.13 The party registration was always presented so that it matched the partisanship of the municipal official taking the survey (i.e., Republican officials learned that the writer was a registered Republican, and Democratic officials learned that the writer was a registered Democrat).         "
"68","If the results from the first experiment are being driven by elected officials making inferences about the writer's partisanship or the likelihood that the voter would turn out, then the bias should be present when they are exposed to the vouchers treatment without the partisan information, but it should go away in the vouchers treatment when this information is provided because they no longer need to use the letter writer's position to infer this information."
"69","In summary, municipal officials were randomly assigned to one of three main issue treatments: (a) the consolidation of 911 services, (b) school vouchers with no additional information provided, and (c) school vouchers with partisanship and turnout information provided. Within each of these groups, we randomized whether the officials received a letter that supported their position or opposed it, for a total of six possible treatments."
"70","For the analysis, we compare across these treatments respondents’ answers to the question of whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statements (see Box 2):            "
"71","This letter was likely a form letter sent by an interest group."
"72","The writer likely understands the complexities of this issue."
"73","The writer likely holds this position strongly."
"74","The writer likely based his opinions on facts."
"75","The first three statements were similar to the questions used in the first study (see Box 1)."
"76","The last statement was added to provide another measure of respondents’ perceptions about constituents’ level of information on the issue."
"77","The results of the second experiment show that policy makers are equally likely to engage in disagreement discounting on both established issues and new issues. Figure 4 presents the results for each statement across all three issue treatments14 and provides further evidence of disagreement discounting. Across the different issue conditions, the elected officials who read the e‐mail from a constituent who shared their position were more likely to agree that the letter writer “understands the complexities of this issue” and were also more likely to think that the writer “based his opinions on facts” (with effects ranging from 10 to 18 percentage points).            "
"78","Disagreement Discounting among City Officials"
"79","Note: The figure shows the differences between the proportion of respondents in the shared and opposed position conditions who agreed with each statement (and the associated 95% confidence interval). The results are given for each of the three issue treatments used in the experiment on city officials.                        "
"80","At the same time, the evidence for the intensity bias is weaker in this study. In the first experiment, legislators were about 9 percentage points less likely to think that a writer they agreed with had sent a form letter and 7 percentage points more likely to think that the writer felt strongly about the issue (see Figure 2). In the second study, these differences are smaller in magnitude and generally fail to achieve statistical significance.15"
"81","An alternative explanation for the biases we have observed thus far is that public officials primarily care about how likely a citizen is to turn out and support them. They may simply be using the writer's position on the issue to infer some of this information, believing that individuals who share their issue positions are copartisans who likely support them. This explanation seems unlikely given that politicians exhibit bias on nonpartisan issues (i.e., 911 consolidation efforts), but it may be that public officials think that people who side with them are generally copartisans."
"82","Figure 4 helps evaluate this possibility by presenting the results when the public officials were told that the writer shared their partisanship (see Box 2). In particular, the “Vouchers–Party” treatment results are based on a vignette that also included putative information on the writer from the voter file. If the bias is driven by elected officials using the writer's position to infer his partisanship and likely support, then the bias should disappear when information about the writer's partisanship is provided. The results, however, show that the bias is just as strong when this information is provided. In fact, there is, if anything, more bias. The legislators assigned to this treatment condition were 13 percentage points more likely to think that the writer who shared their position felt strongly about the issue. Bias does not arise from public officials using the letter writer's position to make inferences about her partisanship or likelihood of turning out to vote. Public officials simply discount views that oppose their own. (Tables A12–A14 of the supporting information show that these results are robust to controlling for whether the official is Republican, is female, is a mayor (or equivalent), is white, has an income over $100K, and has a college degree.)16"
"83","Now that we have established that disagreement discounting is prevalent among a broad sample of elected officials and across several types of issues, we turn to examining whether a central part of representatives’ jobs contributes to this bias. As discussed earlier, politicians may engage in disagreement discounting, at least in part, because they have to publicly justify their positions to constituents (Fenno 1978). Regularly articulating a position may reinforce its superiority in politicians’ minds, causing them to more automatically dismiss any opposing view as a way of avoiding cognitive dissonance (Festinger 1957). To test whether this position‐justifying mechanism is at work, we administered a similar survey experiment from Study 1 to a sample of U.S. adults, with the added experimental manipulation that simulates the act of defending one's position on an issue. We find that those who were tasked with defending their position were more likely to discount opinions that countered that position.         "
"84","The survey experiment was administered online in December 2014. We recruited a sample of U.S. adults using Amazon Mechanical Turk.17 The survey was divided into three parts, each a separate page in the survey. The first part measured respondents’ positions on several issues by displaying five statements (in random order) and asking respondents to indicate their level of agreement with each statement on a 5‐point Likert scale. One of the statements was used as an “attention check” to filter out respondents who were not carefully reading each statement.18 Only 3.6% failed the attention check. The other four statements measured respondents’ position on            "
"85","The first statement bears directly on the issue that is the focus of the e‐mail used in the experiment at the end of the survey. This is also the same statement used in Study 1 to measure state legislators’ position on taxes. As with that first study, we determined whether the e‐mail writer shared or opposed the respondent's position. Those in the former situation were coded as having received the shared position treatment, whereas those in the latter were coded as having received the opposed position treatment.19"
"86","The second part of the survey consisted of a writing task that was experimentally manipulated such that respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions. In the first condition, defend tax position, respondents were asked to write for three minutes explaining the position they took on taxes and government spending on the previous page. As part of the instructions, respondents were shown the position they took on the statement and the text of the statement.20 The purpose of this condition is to examine whether the act of defending one's position on an issue leads to disagreement discounting on that same issue. The writing task, then, serves as a simulation that places non‐elites in a scenario that is common for elected officials.         "
"87","The second condition, defend privacy position, was identical to the first except that respondents were asked to defend their position on the statement about privacy and national security. The purpose of this treatment condition is to determine whether disagreement discounting arises simply from the act of defending one's political positions or whether it only occurs within the issue domain that has been defended. In other words, will subjects assigned to this condition engage in disagreement discounting when evaluating a letter on taxes at the same level as those assigned to the defend tax position condition?         "
"88","The final condition, favorite TV show, was used as a control. For this treatment condition, respondents were asked to “spend the next 3 minutes writing about your favorite television show.” This created a baseline across all three conditions so that all respondents spent similar amounts of time writing between indicating their policy positions and evaluating an e‐mail related to one of them. With the writing task in the control condition, we wanted to minimize priming any political considerations. At the same time, we wanted the task to not seem out of place with the rest of the survey. To achieve this, we described the survey to potential respondents as being about “U.S. adults’ opinions on television, political communications, and public policy.” This is also why we included the statement on television consumption in the first part of the survey.         "
"89","In each condition, respondents were informed that in order to go on to the final page of the survey, they had to spend three minutes on the writing task and write at least 150 characters, which is about 35 words or 3 to 5 sentences. A three‐minute timer was provided on the page, and respondents were not given the link to the last page of the survey until the three minutes had expired."
"90","After completing the writing task, respondents went to the third and final page of the survey, which contained a survey experiment similar to the ones from the previous two studies. On this final page, respondents were shown an e‐mail from a constituent to a state legislator and asked to rate it. The text of the letter, which expressed the e‐mail writer's position on taxes and spending, and the question below the e‐mail were identical to what we used in Study 1 (see Box 1). To increase the realism of the treatment, we showed respondents an image of an e‐mail as in Study 2 (see Figure 3).         "
"91","Above the image of the e‐mail, respondents were given the following instructions: “For the final questions, I want you to imagine that you are a state legislator who received the following email. Please read and rate the email.” As in the other studies, the position advocated by the writer in the e‐mail was randomized—in this case, between support for cutting taxes even if it resulted in cuts to programs or opposition to cutting taxes to preserve programs. Thus, respondents saw a letter that either shared their position on taxes (the shared position treatment condition) or opposed it (the opposed position treatment condition).         "
"92","As in Study 1, we measured respondents’ reactions to the writer's opinion by having them indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statements (presented in random order) after having read the e‐mail:            "
"93","The writer likely understands the complexities of this issue."
"94","The writer likely holds this position strongly."
"95","This letter was likely a form letter sent by an interest group."
"96","For the analysis, we compare what percentage of respondents in the shared position and opposed position conditions agreed with each statement. To examine whether defending one's position is a mechanism explaining the results from Studies 1 and 2, we then compare the difference between the shared and opposed position conditions across the three writing task treatments from the previous part of the survey (i.e., defend tax position, defend privacy position, and favorite TV show). If defending one's position on an issue leads to more bias, then respondents assigned to the defend tax position condition should exhibit a higher level of disagreement discounting than respondents assigned to the other conditions. In other words, the differences for those in the defend tax position should be larger than for those in the other conditions. If the bias is simply a result of having to defend one's position generally, then differences in the defend tax position and defend privacy position conditions should be similar in size and larger than the difference from the favorite TV show condition. And finally, if position justifying does not increase bias, then the differences should not vary across the three writing task treatments.         "
"97","The results from Study 3 provide evidence that having to justify one's position exacerbates disagreement discounting in, and only in, the policy domain that one is asked to defend. In Figure 5, we present the differences between the shared and opposed position conditions within each writing task condition (along with the associated 95% confidence interval).21"
"98","The Effect of Opinion Agreement on Letter Ratings among U.S. Adults"
"99","Note: Shows the differences between the shared and opposed positions, along with the associated 95% confidence interval, within each writing task treatment condition for each statement. The comparisons are based on a sample of 494–562 U.S. adults (the number of observations varies because of variation in the number of individuals randomly assigned to each treatment condition).                        "
"100","We begin with respondents’ evaluation of whether “the writer likely understands the complexities of this issue” (see the top statement presented in Figure 5). Across all three writing conditions, respondents who read an e‐mail that shared their position on taxes were much more likely to agree that the writer understood the complexities of the issue. Among respondents in the defend privacy position and favorite TV show writing conditions, the difference between the evaluations of those who shared the writer's position and those who opposed it were equal to 20 percentage points (p < .01, two‐sided) and 21 percentage points (p < .01, two‐sided), respectively. However, as predicted by the position‐justifying mechanism, those assigned to spend three minutes explaining their position on the issue discussed in the vignette (i.e., the defend tax position condition) were even more likely to engage in disagreement discounting than those assigned to the other two writing tasks. Among those in the defend tax position writing condition, there was a 36 percentage point difference between those who shared the writer's position and those who disagreed with the position, an effect that is 15 percentage points larger than what is observed in the other conditions. This 15 percentage point difference, which represents the difference‐in‐differences, is also statistically significant at the .01 level. In other words, the act of defending one's position on a particular issue affects individuals’ evaluations of others’ position only on that same issue. The evaluations of those assigned to defend their position on a different political issue (in this case, privacy and national security) were practically identical to those from respondents assigned to the control writing condition.            "
"101","A similar pattern, though somewhat attenuated, emerges in respondents’ evaluation of whether “the writer likely holds this position strongly” (see the middle statement presented in Figure 5). Although respondents in all three writing conditions were more likely to agree that the writer held the position strongly when she shared the writer's position, the difference between the evaluations of those in the shared position and opposed position conditions is only significant, both statistically and substantively, among respondents who were in the defend tax position writing condition (diff. = 10 percentage points; p < .01, two‐sided). As with the previous statement, the evaluations of those in the defend privacy position condition (diff. = 1.5 percentage points; p = .70, two‐sided) were nearly identical to those in the favorite TV show condition (diff. = 2.2 percentage points; p = .51, two‐sided). The difference‐in‐differences, comparing the difference from the defend tax position condition to the other two conditions pooled together, approaches statistical significance (diff.‐in‐diff. = 8.4 percentage points; p = .053, two‐sided).            "
"102","Turning now to the final statement concerning whether “This letter was likely a form letter sent by an interest group,” we find very small differences between the evaluations of those who shared and those who opposed the writer's position. In each writing condition, those who shared the writer's position on taxes were less likely to believe that the e‐mail was a form letter, but the differences are both substantively and statistically insignificant across all three writing conditions, ranging from 2.5 percentage points (p = .58, two‐sided) for those in the defend privacy position condition to 3.9 percentage points (p = .36, two‐sided) for those in the defend tax position condition.            "
"103","The results from the third study provide substantial evidence that representatives may be particularly susceptible to exhibiting disagreement discounting because of the nature of their job. Elected officials are expected to defend their position to their constituents on a regular basis as part of being a representative (Fenno 1978). However, the very act of having to defend one's position on an issue makes individuals more likely to discount the preferences of those who disagree with their position on that issue.            "
"104","We have argued that an important and overlooked explanation for policy incongruence between voters and their elected officials is that policy makers engage in disagreement discounting, meaning they put less weight on the preferences of constituents with whom they disagree. A series of novel survey experiments in which state legislators and elected municipal officials are the subjects of interest finds that policy makers rationalize this decision by concluding that these constituents do not know as much about the issue.22"
"105","These results speak to important debates about constituency control over elected officials. One ongoing debate is the degree to which elected officials adapt their voting records to changes in constituents’ preferences. While legislators sometimes adapt to midterm changes in constituents’ preferences (Kousser, Lewis, and Masket 2007), they do not do so fully (e.g., the asymmetric updating found in Butler and Nickerson 2011, as discussed in the introduction). Disagreement discounting causes elected officials to put more weight on the opinions of constituents with whom they agree, leading legislators to be slow in adapting their issue stances. This lethargy in position updating explains why ideological change in legislatures occurs primarily through the replacement of members rather than the ideological adaptation of sitting members (Lee, Morretti, and Butler 2004; Poole 2007; Theriault 2006).         "
"106","Because ideological change is most likely to be achieved through selection mechanisms, the quality of representation depends on the ability of voters to punish politicians who are out of step with their preferences. If voters do not monitor public officials and punish them when they fail to represent their preferences, increased ideological congruence is unlikely to be achieved."
"107","The results also provide insights into representation and polarization. Although polarization has been blamed on various electoral and legislative institutions, subsequent analyses tend to show that these institutions have little or no effect on polarization (e.g., McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2009). Institutions alone do not explain the level of polarization because polarization persists, at least in part, from how legislators process constituents’ opinions. Legislators from opposing parties come to different conclusions about the same messages from constituents because each side discounts the opinions of constituents with whom they disagree. Because legislators are not updating their views, compromise is unlikely to be reached and polarization is likely to persist for the foreseeable future.         "
"108","Another significant contribution of this analysis is the proposition and finding that disagreement discounting is exacerbated by an activity central to representative governance—taking and explaining one's policy positions to others. Through a survey experiment of U.S. adults, we find that requiring subjects to explain their position on an issue made them much more likely to discount opinions that opposed their position. This evidence suggests that an activity that elected officials regularly engage in (Fenno 1978; Grimmer 2013) also has negative repercussions for policy makers’ responsiveness to constituents’ preferences. At the same time, this finding presents one positive aspect from candidates’ being ambiguous about their policy positions (Tomz and Van Houweling 2009)—it could make them less susceptible to engaging in disagreement discounting, even if their private policy preference were incongruent with constituents’.         "
"109","Future work should consider other mechanisms that could also lead to disagreement discounting. For example, policy makers, like non‐elites, are likely susceptible to the Dunning‐Krueger effect (Krueger and Dunning 1999). Officials who overestimate their ability to assess constituents’ preferences may be more likely to discount preferences they oppose. Future surveys of elected officials could employ the battery developed by Krueger and Dunning (1999) along with survey experiments similar to the ones we use in this analysis to examine the correlation between these two phenomena.         "
"110","These findings also address a broader question for future work to consider: What other institutions and common political practices exacerbate biases in elected officials’ perceptions and decision making? Here, we identify one common practice, but others are likely at play (e.g., Kingdon 1967). At the same time, other institutions may help reduce biases. Identifying how different institutions affect these biases is important for reformers and policy makers who seek to improve democratic responsiveness.         "
