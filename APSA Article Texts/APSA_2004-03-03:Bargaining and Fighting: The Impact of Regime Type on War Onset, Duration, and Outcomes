"1","Recent research on the consequences of war strongly suggests that the ability to forge a separate peace is only one of many important ways democracy can impact conflict processes.4 Perhaps most significantly, democracies are considerably more likely to win the wars they fight. While success is virtually guaranteed when they initiate the war, democracies that are subject to attack also win more often than other types of defenders (Clark and Reed 2003; Reiter and Stam 1998a, 2002; Stam 1996). The evidence, however, also suggests that this advantage is short‐lived. While democracies are particularly likely to win if the war is short, their advantage declines dramatically as the war endures. Bennett and Stam (1998) and Reiter and Stam (2002) show that after approximately 18 months, democratic initiators are actually less likely to win than their autocratic counterparts. Further, their evidence suggests that democratic initiators are also always less likely to continue the war than their autocratic counterparts and become even less likely to continue the war as time goes on.         "
"2","Why does regime type affect the outcome and duration of war? The explanation offered for why democracies often win is two‐fold. Reiter and Stam argue first that democratic leaders are very cognizant of the electoral risks of “wasting the lives of their citizens in a losing cause” (1998a; 2002, 3) and therefore are particularly careful in the wars they choose to initiate. Democracies thus tend to win the wars they initiate because they select their wars more carefully. Democratic targets, however, tend to win as well. Reiter and Stam argue that this implies that democracy must also provide democratic leaders with a war‐fighting advantage. They suggest that democratic soldiers and officers are more likely to take the initiative on the battlefield because democracy encourages a culture of individual responsibility and rights (Reiter and Stam 1998b, 2002). Other scholars have also suggested that democrats enjoy a war‐fighting advantage. Bueno de Mesquita et al. (1999) maintain that democracies are more likely to win because they mobilize more resources for the war effort. Lake (1992) argues that democracies win because they are more likely to receive aid from fellow democratic states.         "
"3","Stam and his coauthors also explain why democracies are less likely to win and less likely to continue fighting as the war endures. Since democrats must answer to the public and the public is particularly sensitive to the costs of war, the public often withdraws its support from the war as the costs begin to mount (Gartner 1997; Gartner and Segura 1998; Mueller 1973). While autocrats can repress this dissent, democrats are forced to respond to it or face being replaced (Bennett and Stam 1998; Reiter and Stam 2002). As a result, Stam and his coauthors argue that democracies tend to reach their “breaking point” earlier than other types of states. Since democracies reach their breaking points more quickly, they can only achieve victory if the war is short and otherwise must settle for a draw or a loss. For similar reasons, democracies are also less likely to continue the war than are autocracies.         "
"4","These arguments raise several theoretical puzzles. Consider first the argument that democratic initiators tend to win because they are careful to choose wars for which the chances of victory are particularly high. This argument is incomplete because it does not account for the behavior of the targeted state. One might wonder why the targeted state would choose to fight if its chances of prevailing were so low. If targets tend to concede to avoid such one‐sided battles, we would see few democratic victories because these cases would be settled short of war. Reiter and Stam (2002) recognize this possibility but argue that targeted states must fight when attacked and thus cannot avoid the war even though they know they will lose.5 While this is one possible explanation, ideally we would formulate an explanation that accounted for the strong tendency for democracies to win but that did not eliminate the possibility that targeted states also have some range of choice.         "
"5","Consider next the argument that democratic targets are likely to prevail because democracy provides a war‐fighting advantage. While the argument itself is plausible, recent research indicating that democracies are frequently the targets of militarized disputes presents a puzzle (Bennett 2002; Gelpi and Grieco 2001; Grieco 2001, Leeds and Davis 1999; Reiter and Stam 2003; Rousseau et al. 1996). As Gelpi and Grieco ask, “Why do otherwise powerful, formidable democracies disproportionately attract serious political‐military challenges by authoritarian regimes?” (2001, 794).6 If democracies are particularly good at fighting, it might be reasonable to expect that potential opponents would recognize this advantage and tend to avoid democracies. Existing evidence, however, suggests no such aversion. Given this, one might question whether democracies do in fact enjoy a war‐fighting advantage. But if democracies are not better fighters, why do democratic targets tend to win as well? What explanation could reconcile this apparent advantage with the seemingly inconsistent fact that opposing states do not appear to avoid targeting democracies and may even seek them out?         "
"6","Finally, consider the argument that democracy becomes a handicap as the war endures because public discontent with the rising costs of the war forces democratic leaders to sue for peace. While plausible, this argument also does not explicitly consider the strategic nature of war. First, the argument rests on the premise that the vanquished make peace and does not recognize the necessity for mutual consent for a war to end (Goemans 2000). A democracy cannot simply opt out of a war because of rising discontent; it must instead propose terms of settlement acceptable to the opposing side. However, if the opposing side is aware of the public's growing aversion to war, its demands will increase in turn (Wittman 1979). Second, while the argument seems to account for the fact that democracies are unlikely to win long wars, it raises questions as to how a democracy is able to secure victory in short wars. Unless democracies secure these early victories by vanquishing their opponents (as opposed to negotiating a favorable settlement), it is difficult to understand how a democracy obtains concessions from its opponent if both sides know that the democracy becomes increasingly handicapped as time goes on and will reach its breaking point sooner, all else being equal. If expectations about the end of the war condition the settlement that the belligerents are willing to accept (Filson and Werner 2002a; Werner 1998), how can democracies secure early victories given their endurance handicap?         "
"7","Existing empirical research demonstrates convincingly that regime type affects the duration and outcome of war. Current explanations for these empirical regularities, however, leave open many important theoretical questions. Intuition and informal analysis therefore does not appear sufficient to address these questions. To do so, we develop a game theoretic model that explicitly considers the strategic nature of war. While the results from the model correspond nicely with the existing empirical record on war consequences, the explanations for these results differ in important, if often subtle, ways from current explanations."
"8","With slight modifications, we use the model presented in Filson and Werner (2002a) to explore the impact of regime type on the onset, duration, and outcomes of international conflict. The model has one attacker A and one defender D. Initially, A has benefits Ba and military resources Ra and D has benefits Bd and military resources Rd. Each player's objective is to obtain as many benefits as possible while conserving military resources. Assume that benefits are divisible. Initially, A's utility is Ua(Ra, Ba, 0) and D's utility is Ud (Rd, Bd, 0). The third argument in each function is the amount of the other player's benefits the player obtains—initially A has none of Bd and D has none of Ba. Assume that each utility function is increasing, concave, and twice differentiable in its arguments, and that . These assumptions imply that each player always wants more resources and more benefits, that the marginal utilities of resources and benefits are diminishing, and that the marginal utility of benefits is increasing in resources and the marginal utility of resources is increasing in benefits. This last condition implies that a disputant's willingness to risk resources in battle is (weakly) increasing in his amount of resources and decreasing in the size of his benefits.         "
"9","A war consists of an alternating sequence of negotiations and battles. If negotiations succeed, the war ends. If negotiations fail, the disputants fight another battle. In each battle, D defeats A with probability d and loses with probability 1 −d. When the disputants fight they expend resources. The amount of resources lost depends on who wins each battle. Denote the amount of resources available to A if she wins the first battle by Rwa, and the amount available if she loses by Rla, where Rwa > Rla. Similarly, Rwd, and Rld are the resources available to D after winning or losing the first battle. To keep track of multiple wins and losses while allowing the remaining resources to depend on the order of wins and losses we add superscripts as battles are fought. For example, Rwa is A's resources after she wins the first battle and loses the second.         "
"10","While the disputants value resources directly, resources are also important because they enable the disputants to continue fighting. The war ends as soon as one side's resources fall below the minimal amount necessary to continue fighting. If both sides' resources fall below the minimal amount then the status quo is restored. If only one side's resources fall below the minimal amount then that side has to give up its benefits if the other side is still willing to attack."
"11","In order to avoid the large variety of equilibria that exist in bargaining games with two‐sided incomplete information (Fudenberg and Tirole 1992), we assume that uncertainty is one‐sided; D has complete information about A, but A does not have complete information about D. We also assume that A's uncertainty about D is confined to uncertainty about D's military ability d (the probability that D wins each battle). D knows d but A does not. All types of D are assumed to have the same utility function Ud (. , . , .); they differ only by d.         "
"12","In general, war in this game can last for any number of battles, but we focus on a simple example in which there are only two types of D. One has d=dh and the other has d=dl, where dh > dl. Assume also that there are at most two battles.7 Assume that: (1) if A wins both battles she obtains all of D's benefits;8(2) if A loses both battles D obtains all of her benefits; and (3) if A wins one battle and D wins one battle then the status quo is restored.9"
"13","These assumptions limit the extensive form of the game to that described in Figures 1–3. Figure 1 sets up the environment and describes the choices leading up to the first battle. Initially, A is uncertain about D's type and believes that D is type dh with probability λ1 and type dl with probability 1 −λ1. She proposes that D give up a share of his benefits, γBd. Each type of D either accepts or rejects her proposal. If D accepts, he gives γBd to A and the game ends; A's utility is Ua(Ra, Ba, γBd) and D's utility is Ud(Rd, (1 −γ)Bd, 0). If D rejects, then A updates her belief that D is type dh to probability λ2 and either attacks or quits. If she quits, the status quo is maintained and the outcome is the same as if A did not ask for any of Bd.         "

"16","                 Continuation after A Retreats                      "
"17","If A attacks, then Nature determines who wins the first battle. As described above, A wins with probability 1 −d and loses with probability d. After the battle is over A has resources Rwa if she wins and Rla if she loses; D has resources Rwd if he wins and Rld if he loses. The continuations that follow the first battle are similar no matter who wins, but the players start with different resources and beliefs. In what follows we describe the continuation if A wins the first battle. In order to conserve space, we do not show the continuation if A loses the first battle.         "
"18"," Figure 2 describes the choices if A wins the first battle. After observing the battle outcome A updates her beliefs that D is type dh to probability λ3. A then proposes that D give up γwBd (we will attach superscripts to γ to indicate A's battle history prior to the proposal). D faces a situation just like the first stage—he either accepts or rejects the proposal. If D rejects, then A updates her belief that D is type dh to probability λ4 and either attacks or retreats. The game differs between stages 1 and 2 only because A's beliefs are different, both players have suffered some loss of resources from the first battle, and A's “quit” option is now an option to retreat. The assumptions made above ensure that the war ends after the second battle with a redistribution of the benefits if one side won both battles or a return to the status quo if the battle outcomes were divided.         "
"19"," Figure 3 describes the choices if A retreats after winning the first battle. If A retreats then D becomes the aggressor: A offers to give up a share of her benefits, (1 −ψw)Ba, and D either accepts or rejects. If D accepts, he takes (1 −ψw)Ba and the game ends. If he rejects, he attacks. If D attacks then a battle occurs as above; the only difference is that now the players fight over A's benefits. The battle that occurs is decisive: if A wins then D quits and if D wins then A gives up her benefits. If D quits, the players each end up with their initial benefits; the only effect of war is that both players have suffered some loss in resources.         "
"20","The simplest interpretation of the game is that it is a turf war. At the beginning, A can ask for some part of D's turf, and D can either surrender it to A or not. If A attacks then A and D fight over D's turf. If A retreats, then D can choose to carry the fight over to A's turf; the two parties switch roles and D becomes the aggressor. Thus, starting a war is risky for A both because she might lose resources without gaining any of D's territory and because she might end up giving up some of her territory to D.         "
"21","The equilibrium concept is a refined Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE). The PBE requires that both types of D play optimally, that A's beliefs are determined using Bayes' rule whenever possible, and that A's choices are optimal given her beliefs.10 We refine the PBE to eliminate unrealistic off‐the‐path beliefs (see Fudenberg and Tirole 1992; Mas‐Colell, Whinston, and Green 1995). We require that if A believes that type dl rejects with positive probability in a stage then A must believe that type dh rejects with probability 1 in that stage. Type dh is more likely to win battles, so it is reasonable that type dh is more likely to reject any given proposal. The assumption puts a lower bound on λ2, λ3, and λ4 and rules out some perverse PBEs.         "
"22"," Filson and Werner (2002a) analyze the equilibrium of a simple game with two types of defender that is similar to that described above and reach, among others, the following conclusions:         "
"23","                        "
"24"," A learns about D's type from both negotiation outcomes and from battle outcomes. The failure of negotiations and battle losses make A more pessimistic about D's type while battle victories make A more optimistic.                  "
"25"," A never provokes a fight with both types. In each stage, if A is willing to attack after her proposal is refused then A always makes a proposal that at least the weakest remaining type will accept. Denote the most demanding proposals that type di is willing to accept by γi and ψi, where γh≤γl and ψh≤ψl.                  "
"26","If A demands some of Bd but is unwilling to attack if her proposal is refused, the defender looks ahead and realizes this and rejects the proposal.                  "
"27","If A does not strictly prefer attacking in stage 2 after winning the first battle then she is also unwilling to attack in stage 1 and war does not start.                  "
"28","Although the game described here is slightly different from the one analyzed by Filson and Werner (2002a), these general results continue to hold. Given these results and assuming pure strategies are used, there are only four possible equilibrium paths:         "
"29","                        "
"30"," A is unwilling to attack in stage 1 so D rejects every proposal. War does not start. Each player's expected utility in stage 1 is                     "
"31"," A proposes γh in stage 1, D accepts, and war does not start.11 Each player's expected utility in stage 1 is                     "
"32"," A proposes γl in stage 1 and attacks if her proposal is rejected. Type dl accepts her proposal and type dh rejects it. If A wins the battle she proposes γwh; if she loses she proposes γlh. These offers are accepted and the war ends. Each player's expected utility in stage 1 is                     "
"33"," A proposes γl in stage 1 and attacks if her proposal is rejected. Type dl accepts her proposal and type dh rejects it. If A wins the battle she proposes γwh; if she loses she retreats and proposes ψlh. Each player's expected utility in stage 1 is                     "
"34","War in this simple example is very short—at most one battle occurs. Fortunately, considerable intuition about the dynamics of the general game can be gained from examining this simple case. In Filson and Werner (2002b), we use numerical examples to demonstrate the conditions under which longer wars occur.         "
"35","Our primary interest here is to consider how regime type affects the equilibrium strategies of the players. As we discussed in the introduction, while regime type may have a variety of effects, we assume here that the primary effect is to alter the leader's sensitivity to the costs of conflict. In particular, we assume that democratic leaders care more about resource losses than do autocratic leaders. This assumption follows from the familiar institutional argument derived from Kant's political writings (1970) that democracies are particularly sensitive to the costs of war because a democratic leader is accountable to the public that must pay those costs (Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman 1992; Maoz and Russett 1993; Schultz 1999).         "
"36","In order to compare the model's results with existing empirical results and datasets, we distinguish between three types of equilibria. A crisis or dispute occurs when A makes a demand in stage 1 backed by the implicit or explicit threat to use force (equilibrium paths 1, 2, 3, and 4). Back down occurs when A fails to escalate the crisis when her demand is rebuffed (equilibrium path 1). A concession occurs when D accedes to A's demand (equilibrium paths 2, 3, and 4). Finally, a war occurs when a battle occurs (equilibrium paths 3 and 4). A battle occurs when A refuses to back down after D has failed to concede to her demand. We also use several other terms in a formal way: The initiator of a crisis is an attacker A that challenges the status quo distribution of benefits by making a demand. The target of a crisis is a defender D that wants to defend the status quo. War initiation occurs when A uses force against D to enforce its demand. Thus, only A can be a war initiator in the model. A player wins the war if at the end of the war it keeps its own benefits and obtains some of the other player's. A player loses the war if it gives up some of its benefits. Winning and losing disputes are defined similarly. Thus, resource losses do not determine victory or defeat—exchanges of benefits do.         "
"37","How do the defender's and the attacker's incentives and strategies change as the defender becomes more democratic? The model shows that as D becomes more sensitive to the costs of war, his expected utility for fighting another battle falls. This straightforward premise is the cornerstone of the institutional explanation for the democratic peace; democracies do not fight because they are constrained. The model, however, suggests that the story is more complicated. The consequence of the democrat's lower expected utility for fighting another battle is that in each period, the most demanding proposal that type di is willing to accept rather than fight, γi and ψi, increases. For example, the value of γwh (the highest demand acceptable to dh after A has won the first battle) is determined implicitly by the following equation:12"
"38","There are several important implications that follow from this logic. First, this analysis suggests that the distinction often drawn between the normative and institutional explanations for the democratic peace (Maoz and Russett 1993), at least in their simplistic forms, is too stark. If democratic institutions constrain a leader's war‐fighting ability, these constraints are manifested through an increased willingness to make concessions. Since a willingness to make concessions is necessary for a compromise to be reached, institutional constraints may be an important source of democratic norms of nonviolent dispute resolution. While the model makes the connection between a state's lower expected utility for war and its diplomatic strategy obvious, this connection depends on modeling war as an extension of diplomacy rather than an alternative to diplomacy as is more commonly done (Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman 1992; Stam 1996). If disputants choose either to negotiate or to fight, then factors that reduce the disputants' expected utilities for fighting need not impact their value for negotiations.            "
"39","Second, the greater willingness of democratic defenders to make concessions in order to avoid the costs of war suggests that democratic defenders receive less favorable terms of settlement than other types of defenders, holding A's strategy and parameters such as resources, expected losses, benefits, and beliefs constant. Equations (4), (6), (7), (9), and (10) show that when democratic defenders lose, they make greater concessions than when autocratic defenders lose. Similarly, when democratic defenders win battles, the model suggests that the war is more likely to end in a return to the antebellum status quo. As the defender's sensitivity to the costs of war increase, the defender's threat to pursue a retreating attacker becomes less credible. As a result, a defender sensitive to the costs of war is less able to obtain any concessions from the attacker and must settle instead for a return to the status quo.            "
"40","The defender's sensitivity to costs, however, does not just affect his strategy but the strategy of the attacker as well. Significantly, the attacker anticipates how much each type of defender is willing to concede and changes her demands accordingly. In Figure 4, for instance, the attacker can only demand γl,aut if the weaker defender is an autocracy but can increase her demand to γl,dem if the weaker defender is a democracy without increasing her risk that the demand is refused.            "
"41","                 Maximum Acceptable Demand for Democratic and Autocratic Defenders                         "
"42","The ability of the attacker to demand more from a democratic defender at each stage of the game has several important implications. First, we expect that democratic defenders are more likely to be targeted. Anticipating greater concessions at each stage of the game, the attacker's threat to attack becomes more credible. As a result, as the defender becomes more democratic it becomes increasingly likely that the equilibrium will shift away from the A backs down equilibrium.13 Thus, democracies are more likely to be targeted than autocracies because their willingness to make larger concessions can increase an attacker's incentives to attack.14"
"43","Second, although the model suggests that democracies are more likely to be targeted, we do not necessarily expect that they are more likely to be involved as defenders in a war. Note first that in one sense, there is a natural progression from the back down equilibrium to the equilibria where war is possible as the defender becomes more willing to make concessions. Suppose that initially parameter values are such that A is unwilling to attack in stage 1, so that no aggression occurs. Now suppose that D becomes more willing to make concessions at each stage of the game. Note that A's payoff from attacking conditional on both types having rejected her proposal is always greater than A's payoff from attacking conditional on facing only the strongest type because A's belief about the likelihood of winning the battle is higher in the first case. Formally, as D becomes more willing to make concessions, at some point A is willing to attack if λ2=λ1 but not if λ2= 1. This means that A can credibly threaten to attack if the proposal γh is rejected (because she can believe λ2=λ1), but not if the proposal γl is rejected (because then she must believe λ2= 1). Therefore, equilibrium path (2) becomes feasible before (3) or (4) do—a concession can occur, but not a war. As D becomes even more willing to make concessions, eventually A is willing to attack even if λ2= 1, and at that point war is possible.            "
"44","However, the relationship between the defender's regime type and war is more complicated than this simple progression suggests, because conditional on A not backing down, it is not necessarily the case that war becomes more likely as the defender becomes more willing to make concessions in each stage of the game. Suppose the parameters are such that the attacker is willing to attack regardless of the defender's type, so equilibrium paths (2) and (3) are both feasible. Equations (3) and (5) show that as the defender becomes willing to make greater concessions at each stage of the game, the attacker's expected utilities in stage 1 from equilibrium paths (2) and (3) both rise. Thus, whether the attacker chooses to increase her risk of another battle (by aiming her demand at lower types), decrease her risk of another battle (by aiming her demand at higher types), or maintain her risk of another battle (by aiming her demand at the same type), depends on a complicated mix of the parameters and utility functions. An attacker, for instance, may be willing to accept some risk of war when each type of defender is willing to concede little, but may prefer to eliminate her risk of war entirely by aiming her demand at the highest type (and thereby ensuring acceptance by all types) when each type of defender is willing to concede a lot. Whereas previously she could only eliminate the risk of war if she accepted a small concession, now she can eliminate that risk and still get a decent return. Since the attacker may alter which type she aims at in response to changes in the defender's sensitivity to costs, it is not immediately clear whether democracies are more or less likely to be defenders in a war. Importantly, the combination of this result and the last suggests that the impact of regime type on conflict may be different at different phases of the conflict.            "
"45","Finally, the model suggests that the attacker is more likely to lose if the defender is a democracy. This may seem at odds with the model's result that democratic defenders are willing to make greater concessions at every stage of the game, but in fact it is completely consistent with that result. Since an attacker can make higher demands of a democratic target, the attacker can face a lower probability of victory (which is determined by dh) and still be willing to attack. Wars involving a democratic target may then tend to be bigger gambles from the attacker's perspective. The attacker accepts a greater risk that the war will end poorly in order to have a possibility of a larger reward. Formally, equilibrium path (4), which involves a risk of A giving up some benefits, becomes a more attractive option. The model thus suggests that democratic defenders are more likely to win than other types of defenders not because they are better fighters (although this possibility is not precluded by the model) but because of the way they are selected.            "
"46","We summarize the implications suggested by the model for increasing the defender's cost sensitivity below:"
"47","                              "
"48","Democratic defenders receive less favorable terms of settlement when they win than do other types of defenders when they win, holding other factors like resources, expected losses and benefits, and beliefs constant."
"49","Democratic defenders receive less favorable terms of settlement when they lose than do other types of defenders when they lose, holding other factors like resources, expected losses and benefits, and beliefs constant."
"50","Democracies are more likely to be defenders in a crisis than other regime types."
"51","Democracies are not necessarily more likely to be defenders in a war than other regime types."
"52","Democratic defenders are more likely to win than other types of defenders."
"53","Consider now how strategies change if the attacker is a democracy. First, as the attacker becomes more sensitive to the costs of war, it is less likely that her threat to attack is credible. This can be shown by considering A's decision to attack or retreat after losing the first battle and having her second offer rejected. Suppose that A knows that D is type dh. A is willing to attack if               "
"54","Several interesting implications follow. As many have noted, the wars started by democracies are a biased sample of all possible initiations (Gartner and Siverson 1996; Reiter and Stam 1998a; Reiter and Stam 2002). Since a democracy is more sensitive to the costs of war, she only starts a war if the costs are expected to be low, if she is very optimistic about the types of defenders she faces, or if the benefits are expected to be high. Democrats are less likely to initiate disputes if these conditions are not met because they cannot credibly threaten to attack and thus do not expect that the defender will make any concessions. Thus, we expect that when democracies do initiate a war, the democratic initiator will be more likely to win, the costs will tend to be low, and/or the benefits will be great.            "
"55","Further, since it is less likely that a democracy can credibly threaten to attack because she is more sensitive to the costs of war, the model anticipates that democracies initiate crises less often than do autocracies. A related implication of this logic is that democracies are more likely to be status quo powers whereas autocracies are more likely to be revisionist powers. Since democracies are more sensitive to the costs of war, they are less able to challenge the status quo credibly unless the stakes of the conflict are large. We thus expect that democracies will tend to tolerate a greater disparity between the distribution of power and distribution of benefits (Filson and Werner 2002a; Powell 1999; Werner 1999) before they can credibly demand changes.            "
"56","A democracy's greater sensitivity to the costs of war not only undermines the credibility of her threat to attack, it also encourages the democratic attacker to make less demanding proposals that more types of defenders will accept in the crises she does initiate. Suppose that A is willing to attack in stage 1. Consider her choice of whether to propose γh or γl. Assume that if a battle is fought then after the battle A obtains some of D's benefits if she wins but retreats if she loses. Then A compares the utilities in Equations (3) and (8). Since proposing γh involves no risk of resource losses, if A is a democracy, she becomes more likely to make the lower demand that both types of defenders will accept rather than the more demanding proposal that may be refused. More generally, A's choice of demand must strike a balance between her desire for D's benefits and the risk that the dispute continues. As the attacker becomes more sensitive to the costs of war, she trades off the chance at greater concessions from D for a shorter conflict. Note that this logic suggests as before that a democracy's institutional constraints impact her negotiating strategy or that institutions determine the norms. A democracy is more likely to moderate her demands because her execution of the war is constrained, not because she is inherently more willing to make concessions. War serves the ends of diplomacy and a state's diplomacy is driven by what it can accomplish in war.            "
"57","If democratic attackers are more likely to make less‐demanding proposals that more types of defenders accept in the disputes they initiate, several testable hypotheses follow. First, we expect that crises initiated by democracies are less likely to escalate to war. Since democracies are more likely to aim their demands at higher types, it is less likely that their demands will be refused. Second, just as crisis outcomes are more likely to be resolved before a war begins, the model suggests that wars involving a democratic attacker are generally shorter than those initiated by an autocracy. Since a democracy's value for continuing the war is lower, at each negotiating opportunity a democracy is more likely to make a proposal that has a greater chance of being accepted. Sensitive to the costs of the war, a democracy plays a safer negotiating strategy that reduces the risks of the war continuing."
"58","Third, the model suggests that the size of a democracy's victory will generally be smaller than when autocratic attackers win, holding parameters such as resources, expected losses, benefits, and beliefs constant. Targets of democracies get better terms than targets of autocracies because democracies moderate their demands in order to lower the risk of the war continuing. For this reason, we expect that democracies are more likely to fight limited wars. For similar reasons, we also expect that as the war continues, democratic initiators are increasingly likely to accept a draw or a return to the antebellum status quo. While an autocracy may be willing to continue to press her original demands and risk the war continuing, a democracy is more willing to moderate her original demands in order to cut the war short."
"59","Finally, the model suggests that democratic attackers are more likely to win the wars they start, although the size of their victories will tend to be smaller than those realized by autocratic initiators. As suggested above, democracies are more likely to win the wars they start because they are less likely to start a war if they are pessimistic about the defender's type. A democratic initiator's tendency to follow a safer negotiating strategy also increases the chances that she wins. By reducing the risk that the war continues, the democracy also reduces the risk that she loses a battle and is forced to retreat. Since initiators are generally expected to win, democracies reduce the likelihood that the less probable outcome occurs by playing a lower variance strategy.15"
"60","We summarize below the implications of the model from increasing the attacker's sensitivity to costs:"
"61","                              "
"62","Democratic initiators are more likely to win the conflicts they initiate."
"63","Democratic initiators are more likely to be involved in low‐cost and/or high‐stakes wars."
"64","Democracies initiate crises less often than other types of states."
"65","Crises initiated by democracies are less likely to escalate to war."
"66","Wars initiated by democracies are less likely to endure than wars initiated by other types of states."
"67","Democratic initiators receive less favorable terms of settlement when they win than other types of initiators do when they win holding parameters such as resources, expected losses, benefits, and beliefs constant."
"68","Several of the results from the model directly address existing research relating regime type to the outcome and duration of war. In accord with the findings of Bennett and Stam (1998) and Reiter and Stam (1998a, 1998b, 2002), the model anticipates that democracies are more likely to win both when they are the initiators of the conflict and when they are the targets, that wars initiated by democracies will tend to be shorter, and that democracies are less likely to win as the war endures. The logic behind each of these results, however, differs in important ways from that previously posited.            "
"69","Consider first the result that democracies are more likely to win the wars they initiate. Reiter and Stam suggest that democratic initiators are more likely to win because “ … democratic leaders pick only winnable wars” (2002, 6). While our model likewise suggests that the set of wars initiated by democracies is a biased sample, the selection process works slightly differently. Rather than democracies previewing all possible wars and carefully selecting the ones in which they are likely to win, our model suggests that democracies end up in wars in which they have a higher than average chance of winning because they cannot credibly threaten to fight in wars in which the risks are greater (or the costs [benefits] higher [lower]). Democracies here do not select themselves into winnable wars; rather they are selectedout of more risky enterprises because of the credibility constraint created by their sensitivity to costs.            "
"70","This is a subtle but important difference. If democracies can pick among all possible conflicts and choose the ones in which they are most likely to succeed, then democratic constraints present no handicap for the democratic leader. In sharp contrast to the expectations of the pessimists who doubt the ability of democracies to conduct an effective foreign policy, the ability of democracies to pick winners suggests that democracies are actually more effective in the conduct of foreign policy. Democracy not only provides greater freedom, prosperity, and peace, but a fourth virtue as well—victory in wars (Reiter and Stam 2002, 2). However, if democracies are instead selected out of potential conflicts, then democracy can be a handicap. An autocrat, less sensitive to the costs of war, can effectively wield her threat to use force to pursue her political objectives. A democrat, in contrast, may not be able to make a demand in the same circumstances because she knows (and her opponent knows) that her threat to attack if the concession is not granted is incredible. The democrat's sensitivity to costs makes her threat to use force incredible in all but the safest (least risky, least costly) or most important (largest stakes) instances.            "
"71","Our model thus suggests that the optimists focusing on the virtues of democracy and the pessimists focusing on the constraints of democracy are both correct. Since democrats cannot credibly threaten to attack save when they are very confident of victory or when the costs are expected to be very low or the benefits high, democracies will be more likely to win the wars they do initiate. However, their victory in war comes at a price. In comparison to autocrats who are less sensitive to the costs of conflict, democracies will be less able to wield the threat to use force effectively in order to secure concessions short of war. At least in some circumstances, Alexis de Tocqueveille is correct when he writes, “ … in the control of society's foreign affairs democratic governments do appear decidedly inferior to others” (trans. 1969, 228). Of course, any normative assessment of democratic foreign policy would have to evaluate whether the gains from avoiding risky wars are outweighed by the losses from opting out of “good” wars."
"72","These “selection effects” arguments, however, raise the strategic question regarding the target's response. Why does a defender fight back when targeted by a democracy? The fact that the democracy is willing to fight should often suggest that the defender's chances of victory are low. Reiter and Stam (2002) resolve this dilemma by assuming that the targeted state cannot concede once attacked and instead must fight. Even though the target knows he is very likely to lose, he fights back for reasons of honor, reputation, and domestic politics. Others have resolved this dilemma by assuming that the defender significantly misperceives the situation and believes that he can win (Blainey 1988). Our model suggests another explanation for this apparent puzzle. Since the benefits in dispute are divisible, the question for the disputants is not simply whether or not they will lose, but how much they will lose. The targeted state then may agree that the odds are against him winning (i.e., gaining some of A's benefits), but may still be willing to fight because he does not think he will lose as badly as A conjectures. D fights to demonstrate to A that he need not concede as much as A originally demanded. Although potentially obvious, this explanation relies critically on viewing war as an extension of bargaining. Since scholars have traditionally viewed war as an alternative to diplomacy, they have found it very difficult to explain why defenders often fight even when it is clear that they will lose.            "
"73","Consider next the result that democratic defenders are also more likely to win than other types of defenders. Reiter and Stam (1998b, 2002) suggest that this evidence implies that democracies must have a war‐fighting advantage. However, if democracies have such an advantage, their opponents would recognize this advantage and avoid targeting them. In contrast, recent evidence suggests that if anything democracies are particularly likely to be targeted (Bennett 2002; Gelpi and Grieco 2001; Grieco 2001; Rousseau et al. 1996; Leeds and Davis 1999; Reiter and Stam 2003). Our model provides an explanation that accounts for both of these results. Democracies are more likely to be targeted because they are willing to make greater concessions to avoid the costs of fighting. Their willingness to make greater concessions conditional on losing makes them more attractive targets because the attacker's expected benefits conditional on winning rise. However, this increase in the attacker's conditional expected benefits makes the attacker willing to attack even if the probabilityof winning falls. Essentially, because the potential return for challenging a democracy is greater, a challenger can accept a greater risk that she loses and still be willing to attack. Thus, democratic defenders are more likely to be involved in conflicts where attackers accept a high risk of defeat. While democracies may in fact have a war fighting advantage, our model suggests that this need not be the case: “selection effects” not only explain why democratic initiators are more likely to win but why democratic targets do as well.            "
"74","Consider finally the result that the democratic advantage is short‐lived. Although democratic initiators are very likely to win if the war is short, the evidence suggests that they become increasingly less likely to win and more likely to accept a draw as the war drags on. In related fashion, the evidence suggests that democracies are also always less likely to continue fighting than are autocracies. As a result, the wars they initiate tend to be short. Bennett and Stam (1998) explain this finding by arguing that democracies reach their breaking points more quickly than autocracies because of growing public dissent to the rising costs of war. This explanation, however, does not explain why the opponent is willing to allow the democracy to opt out of the war. Nor does it explain why democracies are able to secure victories early on if opponents know that they tend to reach their breaking points more quickly.            "
"75","The logic suggested by our model for these results differs in important ways. Rather than assuming that democracies reach their breaking points earlier, the model suggests that a democrat's aversion to the costs of conflict encourages her to play a safer negotiating strategy throughout the conflict. The model suggests that democracies are always more likely to make demands that more types of defenders are willing to accept than are autocracies. This explains why wars initiated by democracies tend to be shorter and why the empirical evidence suggests that democracies are always less likely to continue fighting. The democrat's tendency to play a safer negotiating strategy also explains why democracies are quicker to eschew gains and to accept a draw as the war drags on. Unlike autocracies that are willing to assume a greater risk of the war continuing by making more demanding proposals that only the weakest types of defenders will accept, a democracy is more likely to reduce the risk that the war continues by making more moderate demands that are acceptable to more types. The length of the war magnifies the democrat's inclination to offer less‐demanding proposals because of the general tendency in the model for the attacker to become more pessimistic about the type of defender she is facing as the war endures (see Filson and Werner 2002a). Democracies thus become increasingly likely to offer very modest settlement terms as the war drags on because they become increasingly convinced that they are in fact facing one of the tougher types of defenders and thus ever more committed to ending the war quickly.            "
"76","It is very encouraging that the existing empirical evidence supports several of the key results from the model. It is also encouraging that the explanations for these findings are based on a single theoretical framework that explicitly incorporates the strategic nature of war onset and termination. The model, however, also suggests several additional hypotheses as well. We consider these in turn and briefly highlight any existing empirical evidence that might cast doubt or provide support for these results. Many existing tests were of course not designed to evaluate our model's predictions and thus should be seen as preliminary. Where possible, we have highlighted ways to test some of the hypotheses more directly."
"77","First, the model suggests that democracies should initiate conflicts less often than other regime types. Since democracies are more sensitive to the costs of conflict, their expected utility for fighting is lower and, as a result, they are more likely to prefer the status quo to initiating a conflict. Note that this expectation is a necessary corollary to the argument that democracies are more likely to win the wars they initiate because the wars they actually do initiate are a biased sample of all possible wars. If it is true that democracies win because they can only fight lower‐risk, lower‐cost wars, then it must also be true that democracies are less likely to initiate than other types of regimes. Existing empirical evidence that democracies initiate conflicts less often is merely suggestive, though we do know that democracies are less likely to send both violent and nonviolent conflictual behavior (Leeds and Davis 1999) and are less likely to initiate militarized international disputes (Bennett 2002; Bennett and Stam 2000; Reiter and Tillman 2002) and international crises (Gelpi and Grieco 2001). This evidence is only suggestive, however, because the state identified as the “initiator” in these studies (with the exception of Gelpi and Grieco 2001) is defined as the state that first militarized the dispute and not as the state that initiated the dispute by making the initial demand to change the status quo. If the state that takes the first militarized action by initiating disputes, crises, and wars often differs from the state that challenges the status quo by making the initial demand, then these results do not provide confirmatory evidence of the hypothesis. Future research should conduct more precise tests about whether democracies are less likely to initiate conflicts. Fortunately, several data sets that include both nonmilitarized and militarized phases of conflict already exist (Hensel 2001; Huth 1996; Huth and Allee 2002; Sherman 1994) and could provide the basis for such tests.            "
"78","Second, the model suggests that crises initiated by a democracy are less likely to escalate to war than crises initiated by another type of regime. This follows the same logic as to why wars initiated by a democracy are expected to be shorter. In order to reduce the risks of fighting a battle and bearing those costs, democracies play a safer negotiating strategy and make demands that more types of defenders are willing to accept. A direct test of this proposition would require one to determine whether demands made by a challenger in a dispute are more likely to be accepted and less likely to be resisted when the challenger is a democracy.16 While such a test has not been conducted, we do know that disputes between two autocracies are the most likely to escalate to war, disputes between two democracies are the least likely to escalate, and disputes between different types of regimes fall in the middle (Morgan and Schwebach 1992). Since Morgan and Schwebach do not differentiate between mixed dyads in which the challenger was a democracy and mixed dyads where the challenger was an autocracy, these results provide only limited support for the hypothesis. We also know that states are less likely to reciprocate a militarized action when the dispute was initiated by a democracy (Schultz 1999). While Schultz argues that targets of democracies tend to make concessions because democratic threats are more credible due to the transparency of their system, our model suggests that this may occur because the demand made by the democracy is more moderate and therefore more likely to be accepted. However, such an interpretation of Schultz's results is only tentative because it is not necessarily the case in his data that the state that first militarized the dispute and the state making the initial demand are the same. Although only speculative, this interpretation of his evidence is particularly interesting because Schultz claims that the institutional perspective does not anticipate that targets of democracies should concede more frequently. However, if you allow leaders to choose their demands strategically as we do, an institutional perspective that focuses on a democrat's sensitivity to costs does in fact anticipate that targets of democracies might concede more often.            "
"79","Third, the model suggests that democracies are more likely to be status quo powers. More specifically, democracies should be willing to bear a greater disparity between the distribution of benefits and the distribution of power (Filson and Werner 2002a; Powell 1999; Werner 1999) before they challenge the status quo. Autocracies, in contrast, should be less willing to tolerate such disparities and should be more likely to use or threaten to use force to rectify the disparity. Evidence that democracy and satisfaction with the status quo (measured by a common alliance portfolio with the hegemon) are correlated (Lemke and Reed 1996) may provide some tangential support for this proposition.            "
"80","Finally, the model generates several expectations about regime type and the terms of settlement. These expectations hold regardless of whether the democracy is the initiator or the target. When democracies win (which is more likely than not), the terms that they are able to secure should generally be less favorable than the terms victorious autocracies obtain. Similarly, when democracies lose, they should tend to make more concessions than autocracies do. Democracies receive less favorable terms of settlement because their sensitivity to the costs of fighting ensure that they are willing to forego gaining additional benefits or concede more of their own benefits in order to avoid fighting another battle. Huth and Allee in fact find that “democratic targets are more than 67% more likely to make concessions in talks over disputed territory than are strongly nondemocratic targets” (2002, 775). They also demonstrate that there appears to be some tendency for democratic challengers to make more concessions as well. It may be difficult, however, to test whether democratic challengers tend to accept less favorable terms of settlement if, as the model suggests, democracies only tend to challenge the status quo when the stakes are large. Thus it may be true that democracies often seem to “crusade” and demand unconditional surrender from their vanquished opponents (Doyle 1983; Kennan 1951; Lippmann 1955; Mearsheimer 1983; but see Werner 1996) because they only challenge when the expected benefits are high, but also true that democracies demand less than an autocracy would in their place. Ultimately, resolving this issue will require a comparison between what a state could get (based primarily on its power) and what it in fact demands.            "
"81","One might legitimately wonder why democracies are so dominant in the current international system if democracies do in fact suffer from some of the weaknesses identified by the model. A cursory perusal of recent history may not immediately engender images of passive democracies that allow opportunities for coercion to pass by or that weakly accept moderate terms of settlement once engaged in battle or that are preyed upon by opportunistic autocracies. Two responses are appropriate. First, the democrat's aversion to costs has both negative and positive effects. For instance, while democracies are less able to challenge opponents credibly and thus may lose some opportunities for coercion, their aversion to costs also encourages them to avoid the most risky enterprises. It is not immediately clear whether the lost opportunities outweigh the lower risks. Similarly, the tendency for democracies to play a safer negotiating strategy ensures that they will not win as much when they do win, but by playing safe they also avoid the most costly imbroglios. The dominance of democracies in the current international system may suggest that over the long term, the benefits from moderation may exceed the costs."
"82","Second, the model highlights that any empirical work on bargaining and war must consider multiple factors other than regime type including, but not limited to, the relative distribution of resources, R. Recall from the model that R is the pool of resources from which the belligerents draw to fight the war. When R is depleted, the belligerent can no longer choose to fight and must concede military defeat. Resources—land, labor, and capital specifically—thus provide a belligerent with considerable bargaining leverage because they give him staying power. The leading democracies of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the United Kingdom and the United States, had much larger economies than other countries, and when these economies focused on producing military resources they out‐produced their competitors. Wide gaps in resources can explain democracies behaving in ways that appear to contradict our model, as when Roosevelt refused to negotiate with the Germans in World War II. As Filson and Werner (2002b) show, large differences in “staying power” lead to extreme demands with all‐or‐nothing outcomes. Further, it could be the case that the marginal effect of regime type on a state's sensitivity to resource losses may be quite small if the state is already sensitive to such losses. This may be true in instances where a state's resources are already low. When resources are low, resource changes have a greater marginal effect on the players' utilities and thus become more important to the decision‐making calculus irrespective of regime type. This may explain in part why the democratic peace is much weaker for poor countries (Mousseau 2000, 2002).17 Since there is a strong correlation between democracy and wealth, any empirical work must be careful to disentangle their effects and to consider carefully how these parameters interact with each other.            "
"83","In this article, we considered how increasing a potential attacker's and potential defender's sensitivity to the costs of conflict affected the onset, duration, and outcome of war. The results from our model were fully consistent with existing empirical evidence that suggests that democracies are more likely to win, but are also more likely to stop fighting and more likely to accept a draw as the war endures. The explanations we suggest for these results, however, differ in important ways from existing explanations. By relying on a strategic rather than a decision‐theoretic logic, the model reconciles seemingly inconsistent results and reveals the gaps in current explanations."
"84","One might think, for instance, that democratic defenders would be less likely to be involved in a conflict because they are more willing to make concessions in order to avoid the costs of war. However, the model demonstrates that this increased willingness to make concessions does not decrease the risks of conflict because the attacker fully anticipates the defender's willingness to make concessions and alters her demands accordingly. As a result, democratic defenders make particularly good targets because their greater sensitivity to costs increases their willingness to make concessions. Given this weakness, one might then expect that democratic targets are particularly likely to lose. However, the model suggests that since attackers expect greater concessions when targeting a democrat, they can attack under riskier conditions. As a result, democratic defenders are more likely to prevail than other types of targeted states because they are often attacked under circumstances less favorable for the initiator."
"85","One might also think that democratic institutions provide a clear advantage to democratic leaders given the empirical evidence that democracies rarely lose the wars they initiate. The model suggests, however, that a democrat's greater sensitivity to the costs of war decreases the democrat's ability to threaten to attack with credibility in all save the safest or most important cases. As a result, though democracies may be more likely to win when they do in fact attack, there are many instances in which they cannot effectively threaten to use force. Anticipating the often‐incredible nature of a democrat's threat, potential targets refuse to concede. Democracies then must often accept erosion in the value of the status quo, not because they are inherently more peace loving, but because they cannot credibly threaten to stop it. Democracies may appear particularly effective because they win when they do fight, but they may actually lose the less obvious battles of everyday politics."
"86","If democracies are in fact more sensitive to the costs of conflict then our model suggests that democracy poses a double‐edged sword. Because they are more willing to make concessions, democracies are more likely to be targeted and less likely to be able to threaten to use force with credibility. Because they are often targeted under the least advantageous circumstances, but attack only under the most advantageous, democracies tend to win when they do fight. While these results are interesting and correspond well with existing empirical results, several implications from the model require additional empirical scrutiny. To test many of these hypotheses, it will be necessary to identify more carefully the demands and counterdemands that can precede and accompany the military aspects of conflict processes. Fortunately, our data collection enterprises are increasingly being guided by our theoretical needs and data sets are emerging that are more sensitive to the phases of conflict and the diplomatic processes. In addition to conducting empirical tests, we look forward to extending the theoretical focus of the model. Democratic leaders may not only be more sensitive to the costs of conflict, but may also be more sensitive to policy outcomes as recent research has suggested. Our future research will address how a democracy's greater sensitivity to costs and to policy outcomes may interact to affect the expected onset, duration, and outcomes of war."
"87","Future work could also attempt to endogenize preferences. As do most other analyses that use the cost sensitivity assumption (and most formal models in general), we assume that preferences are exogenous. We do not explain why democracies are more cost sensitive; we simply assume that this is the case. A more complete explanation would relate these “reduced form” preferences to historical and institutional forces that shape them (Keohane 2001). Doing so would allow us to address how factors such as electoral participation, freedom of the press, and respect for human rights might affect bargaining and war in different ways.         "
