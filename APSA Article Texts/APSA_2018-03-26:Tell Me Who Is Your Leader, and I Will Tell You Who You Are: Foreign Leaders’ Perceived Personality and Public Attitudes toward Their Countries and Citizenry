"1","What affects people's perceptions of and attitudes toward other nations? How do citizens of one nation form stereotypes regarding citizens of other nations? According to social cognition theories, people's beliefs about the characteristics, attributes, and behaviors of members of a distant group are often based on information about one of its prominent members, treated as the exemplar (e.g., Boldry, Gaertner, and Quinn 2007; Mullen, Pizzuto, and Foels 2002). When considering foreign politics, a distant group can be regarded as a nation, and the prominent exemplar is, more often than not, its leader. For example, researchers concerned with political personalization have noted that, at least as of the second half of the twentieth century, media personalization in democracies has increased (for a review, see Adam and Maier 2010; Balmas et al. 2014). As a result, compared to the past, foreign national leaders have gained prominence in the eyes of media audiences (Balmas and Sheafer 2013). It can thus be argued that personal assessments of a foreign nation's leader may be an important element affecting perceptions of his or her nation‐state and people. This connection may seem intuitive. Indeed, it stands to reason that if people elect a particular person for public office, they are likely to be fond of him or her and to approve of his or her behaviors and actions. However, so far, only scant empirical evidence has been documented supporting the existence of a significant relationship between the presentations of foreign leaders in the media, or the way they are perceived, and evaluations of their respective nations and citizenry.         "
"2","This research advances, both theoretically and empirically, the understanding of the causal relationship between perceptions of a national leader and evaluations of his or her nation as a whole. Based on experimental investigation, it is shown that news coverage of a foreign leader's behaviors and characteristics causally relates to (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of the respective country's citizens and (b) emotional perceptions (sentiment and respect) regarding that country. This effect is termed here personal projection, reflecting the assumption that people tend to project their perceptions of a foreign country's leader onto the citizens of that leader's country and the country as a whole. To the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the exemplar effect in the context of foreign politics; neither has any evidence been hitherto published attesting to the abovementioned psychological mechanism of projection or its causal direction.         "
"3","Yet, given political communication's influential role in society, it is vitally important to understand not only the psychological mechanism through which such reports influence human thought and affect, but also its possible ramifications. The evidence presented here has a major bearing on the management of foreign relations and public diplomacy, defined as a nation's efforts to influence the opinion of the public or elites in another nation for its own advantage (Manheim 1994, 4; see also Gilboa 2006). States consider public diplomacy to be necessary in achieving foreign policy objectives (Hayden 2011), and it has a long history as a means of promoting their soft power (Nye 2008). A nation's soft power “tends to be associated with intangible assets such as an attractive personality, culture, political values and institutions, and policies that are seen as legitimate or having moral authority” (Nye 2008, 95). The rationale behind public diplomacy is that, if successful, it improves the country's assessment among foreign publics, and optimally also among foreign policy makers (Sheafer and Gabay 2009). To the extent that Western democracies are susceptible to political personalization (Karvonen 2010), and in light of this study's findings, it is hard to underestimate the centrality of national leaders’ personality or media image in their countries’ foreign relations and diplomacy efforts. Since leaders change rather frequently, particularly in democracies, one may wonder what this may bode for the stability of international relations.         "
"4","As already stated, personal projection is defined here as people's tendency to project their emotions toward a prominent national exemplar, as well as the latter's perceived personal characteristics, onto his or her country and people. The mechanism behind this assumption is in keeping with the basic principles of social psychology. Thus, the contact hypothesis (e.g., Allport 1954; Pettigrew 1998) maintains that humans’ view of outgroups tends to be more simplistic than that of the ingroup (see, e.g., Kraus et al. 1993; Maoz 2000; Maoz and Ellis 2008; Mullen, Rozell, and Johnson 2000). One consequence of such a simplified perspective regarding an outgroup is the evolvement of a stereotype that makes “us” view its members as “all alike” (Boldry, Gaertner, and Quinn 2007) and deduce therefrom that it can be adequately represented by a single member—the exemplar. The most prototypical exemplar of an outgroup is usually taken to be its most prominent member (Bodenhausen et al. 1995). Indeed, based on models of social judgment, it was demonstrated that people's assessment of an outgroup, either as a whole or of some of its members, can be shaped by the attributes of a single exemplar construed as a prototype (Mullen, Pizzuto, and Foels 2002; Schubert and Hafner 2003).         "
"5","In the context of foreign politics, the most prominent figures seem to be national leaders, who are therefore usually construed as the exemplars of their countries. For example, the study of political personalization, whereby politicians become the main anchors of interpretations and evaluations in the political process (Downey and Stanyer 2010; Van Aelst, Sheafer, and Stanyer 2012), has recently been extended to global politics. It was found that over the past 30 years, the media coverage of foreign countries has focused more and more on their leaders at the expense of other aspects of political life (Balmas and Sheafer 2013). Because of their increasing visibility and relevance, prominent national leaders generate cues that might contribute substantially to the structure of mass opinion regarding foreign nations and their citizenry. In fact, research conducted over the course of several decades has consistently demonstrated that associating a prominent political figure with a certain behavior can affect or alter evaluation patterns regarding more general issues (e.g., Borges and Clarke 2008; Bullock 2011; Druckman 2001; Kam 2005; Maoz 2012; Slothuus and De Vreese 2010).         "
"6","Most of the evidence attesting to the relationship between perceptions of a foreign leader and evaluations of his or her country points to a phenomenon commonly dubbed “the Obama effect” (Dragojlovic 2011; Golan and Yang 2013; Goldsmith and Horiuchi 2009; Hayden 2011). It is implied that perceptions of President Obama may be directly related to the favorable international public opinion regarding the United States. This widely held assumption was evidenced following the 2008 U.S. presidential elections when many predicted that the election of Obama as president would bring a new dawn in foreign relations globally (Hayden 2011). Indeed, Goldsmith and Horiuchi (2009) found that a U.S. leader perceived as credible in the eyes of foreign publics (abroad) could have a substantial impact on attitudes about the United States. More recently, Dragojlovic (2013) showed that internationally popular foreign leaders are able to capitalize on their positive image to persuade Canadians to support their preferred policies.         "
"7","The literature cited above provides initial evidence to the significant bearing that evaluations of a foreign leader have on perceptions of his or her nation. The present study seeks to extend this line of inquiry in a quest for a general psychological explanation for the underlying process. This mechanism, which is termed here personal projection, may affect not only the stability of foreign relations and nations’ diplomacy efforts, as outlined above, but also important issues that transcend politics. One possible consequence may have to do with international trade. A product's image has been shown to depend heavily on the image of the country where it was manufactured (Laroche et al. 2005). The finding that consumers construe a product's origin as an extrinsic cue has significant implications for international businesses (Knight and Calantone 2000; Laroche et al. 2005). At the same time, if people tend to project their perceptions of a national leader onto his or her country as a whole, the country's image comes to depend on its leader's image. The upshot is that foreign publics’ perceptions of national leaders may impinge on international businesses. The relevance of leaders’ image abroad becomes even more salient in view of the increasing trend toward free trade and the high pace at which national economies are turning global. Another potential consequence relates to tourism considerations. One criterion for choosing a tourist destination is a positive familiarity with a foreign nation (Baloglu 2001; Beerli and Martin 2004). This study shows that the feeling of familiarity with a nation and its citizens is likely being supplanted by a media‐fostered perceived affinity with that nation's leader.         "
"8","Based on data from experimental studies, this research examines the causal relationship between exposure to news articles (positive vs. negative) regarding behaviors and personal characteristics of certain foreign national leaders and the following outcomes: (a) evaluations of personal characteristics projected on the citizens of these leaders’ nations and (b) emotional perceptions regarding these leaders’ nations. It is expected that participants who read a news article that positively characterizes a foreign leader (a) will rate the characteristics of the citizens of that leader's country more positively than those who are exposed to the negative version of the article and (b) will express positive feelings and respect toward the respective leader's country—and vice versa."
"9","As is elaborated below, two studies were conducted, both analyzing the causal relationships presented above. The first study comprised a robustness test to control for an alternative explanation that any exemplar—not necessarily a national leader—can affect the perceptions of his or her group (i.e., nation). To this end, one of the manipulations involved a fictitious citizen from the respective foreign national leader's country instead of the national leader him‐ or herself. The second study was designed to replicate the results of the first study, but it also added a control condition (an article on nature—no‐news), which enabled us to capture the impact of the two storylines (positive vs. negative) both against each other and against the no‐news article condition. Additionally, by using an imaginary head of a fictitious state (along with real leaders), Study 2 constituted a robustness test designed to isolate the effect of manipulation from other factors such as prior knowledge and perceptions of a foreign leader, country, or citizens."
"10","In addition to the direct causal relationships detailed above, Study 1 also analyzed indirect (mediated) relationships that establish the mechanism of projection statistically. As stated, humans tend to view an outgroup—in this case, a foreign nation—simplistically (see, e.g., Maoz and Ellis 2008; Mullen, Rozell, and Johnson 2000), as homogenous and similar to its most prominent member (Boldry, Gaertner, and Quinn 2007)—as a case in point, a nation's leader. Therefore, when an individual is exposed to either positive or negative information regarding a national leader, he or she may construe it as being relevant to the nation as a whole and form certain perceptions and emotions (positive or negative) regarding that nation and its citizens. Conversely, if such information about a leader is not interpreted as relevant to the nation at large, the individual is not expected to develop either positive or negative perceptions and emotions regarding that nation and its citizens. Hence, it is expected that the relationship between exposure to either a positive or a negative news article describing a foreign national leader, on the one hand, and (a) corresponding evaluations of the citizens of that leader's nation and (b) corresponding emotional perceptions regarding that leader's nation, on the other, will be mediated by participants’ evaluation of the news article's tone as positive or negative, respectively, vis‐à‐vis the leader and, more importantly, the country.         "
"11","As stated, the main goal of this research is to explore the possible influence of public perceptions of national leaders on judgments abroad concerning their nations and people. However, it has been argued that other exemplars besides national leaders may also affect foreign publics’ judgments. Such exemplification mechanisms, whereby ordinary people other than politicians are treated as exemplars, are well established in the field of mass communication (Abraham and Appiah 2006; Hu and Sundar 2010; Lefevere, De Swert, and Walgrave 2012; Zillmann 2002). Thus, Lefevere, De Swert, and Walgrave (2012) argued that people without any specific representative function or expertise may affect public perceptions. Indeed, the use of “men and women on the street” as exemplars in television news reports has become a common journalistic practice (Arpan 2009). Notably, however, this line of research has centered on the national media arena. Nor have the effects of framing either ordinary or prominent citizens as exemplars been tested in the international context. This study, in addition to the analyses of the direct and mediated effects of exposure to the positive and the negative version of an article about a foreign national leader, also analyzes the effects of exposure to an analogous pair of contrasting articles about a citizen from that leader's country.         "
"12","Study 1 included two experiments, one conducted in Israel (Experiment 1) and the other in the United States (Experiment 2). Each experiment comprised four conditions in a posttest‐only, 2 × 2 factorial design (a visualization of the design is presented in Table A1 in the supporting information). Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions and instructed to read a fictitious news article that focuses on the behavior and individual characteristics of one of two potential exemplars: a foreign leader (Angela Merkel in Experiment 1 and Benjamin Netanyahu in Experiment 2) and a fictitious citizen (a German female named Adela Togendrich in Experiment 1 and an Israeli male named Dan Cohen in Experiment 2), both presented as CEOs of high‐tech companies, a German and an Israeli, respectively. The news articles do not refer in any way to German/Israeli people or Germany's/Israel's foreign policy. Two such contrasting fictitious news articles were used for each persona, one with a negative and the other with a positive portrayal of the protagonist. Participants assigned to one of the two positive conditions read the version of the article that describes the protagonist as a strong, ambitious, trustworthy and warm political leader (Merkel/Netanyahu) or CEO (Togendrich/Cohen). He or she is practical, able to compromise when needed, and credible. Participants in the negative conditions read a contrasting, negative article portraying the protagonist in quite a different light: as strong albeit not brave; aggressive; and reluctant to heed others’ opinions, consult, or compromise. He or she is not trustworthy, lacks credibility, and is cold to people (for a more detailed description of the manipulations, please see Tables A2–A5 in the supporting information).            "
"13","Participants in Experiment 1 (N = 271) were Israeli adults (BA students at a major university in Israel). All participants were remunerated for their time. Data collection began on April 12, 2015, and ended on April 14, 2015. Participants in Experiment 2 (N = 557) were American adults, recruited with Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online crowdsourcing marketplace. Our participants were paid $1.50, which is consistent with mainstream rates on MTurk.1 Data collection began on February 15, 2015, and ended on February 19, 2015.            "
"14","In both experiments, each participant filled out a pre‐reading background questionnaire, read a news article with an average length of approximately 400 words, and then answered a post‐reading questionnaire. Table A6 in the supporting information covers both experiments, presenting participants’ demographic indices, and for each of the latter providing an F‐test of mean squares, thus highlighting the differences among the four groups. As can be seen, no significant differences were found among the four groups as concerns gender, age, education, yearly income, or political identity.            "
"15","The posttest included several measures tapping (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of German/Israeli citizens and (b) emotional perceptions regarding Germany/Israel."
"16","Evaluation of personal characteristics of the German/Israeli citizens was based on 11 characteristics, most of them adopted from the National Image Scale (Hurwitz, Peffley, and Seligson 1993; Kurbanov and Robinson 1997). Participants (Israelis/Americans) were asked to rate their evaluation of the foreign country's citizens (Germans/Israelis) with respect to each of the following characteristics, on a scale ranging from 1 (negative pole) to 5 (positive pole): (1) aggressive‐peaceful, (2) not ambitious‐ambitious, (3) not brave‐brave, (4) devious‐not devious, (5) unfriendly‐friendly, (6) dishonest‐honest, (7) not intelligent‐intelligent, (8) not moral‐moral, (9) untrustworthy‐trustworthy, (10) threatening‐not threatening, and (11) cold‐warm. It should be noted that not all of the above characteristics figured into the articles.            "
"17","Emotional perceptions regarding Germany/Israel were measured using two items, the first asking participants to rate their general attitude toward Germany/Israel on a (thermometer) scale ranging from 1 (dislike) to 5 (like). The second item asked participants to rate their respect for Germany/Israel on a scale ranging from 1 (extremely strong) to 5 (not very strong).            "
"18","In addition to various demographic indices, the pre‐reading questionnaire gauged participants’ interest in Israeli/American political issues and foreign relations with other countries. We also asked whether, in the past 2 months, participants had been exposed to a newspaper, Internet, or TV news report about Germany/Israel. The posttest asked whether, in the past, the participants had visited Germany/Israel and whether they were acquainted personally with one or more German/Israeli citizens. Table A7 in the supporting information presents the mean differences among the four groups in each experiment, as well as an F‐test of mean squares. As can be seen, no significant differences emerged among the four groups, in either experiment, in any of the variables discussed in this section.            "
"19","In order to ensure that the manipulations of the content presented to the participants had the intended effect, two questions in the posttest were designed as a manipulation check. In both experiments, participants were specifically asked: “In your opinion, is the attitude towards [Angela Merkel/Adela Togendrich in Experiment 1 or Benjamin Netanyahu/Dan Cohen in Experiment 2] projected in the article positive or negative?” The second question was phrased identically but inquired about the attitude toward Germany/Israel as a country, although—as already stated—the articles do not address Germany/Israel at all. Regarding both questions, respondents were requested to rate their perception on a scale ranging from 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive). Figure A1 in the supporting information confirms that all the manipulations were perceived as intended. Participants exposed to a positive article on either the leader (Merkel/Netanyahu) or the citizen (Togendrich/Cohen) found its tone to be positive, and vice versa. It is also apparent that the processes of evaluating the two exemplars were cognitively similar, as there are no significant differences in the evaluations between those who read the article about the leader and the ones who read the article about the citizen.            "
"20","The main question addressed in the first study is as follows: To what extent do people project their emotions toward an exemplar, as well as his or her perceived personal characteristics, on the respective country and people? At issue here is the causal relationship between exposing participants to a news article emphasizing personal characteristics of a foreign leader and (a) the respondents’ evaluations of personal characteristics typical of that nation's citizens and (b) their emotional perceptions regarding that leader's country (sentiment and respect).            "
"21","Here, I test whether participants who read a positive article about one of the foreign leaders report more positive evaluations of the characteristics typical of that country's citizens that were emphasized in that article, and vice versa. Table 1 reveals that, in both experiments, Israeli/American participants who were exposed to the positive article about Merkel/Netanyahu (a detailed description of the manipulations is laid out in Tables A2–A5 in the supporting information) were significantly more likely to attribute to German/Israeli citizens at large the positive characteristics it ascribes to that leader, and vice versa. Specifically, in Experiment 1, Israeli participants exposed to the positive article assessed German citizens as more ambitious, braver, more honest, friendlier, more trustworthy, and warmer compared to participants exposed to the negative article. The latter group evaluated German citizens as aggressive, less ambitious, less brave, devious, untrustworthy, dishonest, and cold. The same pattern emerged in Experiment 2, where American participants read either a positive or a negative article about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As Table 1 shows, nine out of the 11 characteristics targeted by the posttest were attributed to Israeli citizens.               "
"22","Table 1 also demonstrates that, in both experiments, the assessments of the participants who read the news article about the German CEO Adela Togendrich or about the Israeli CEO Dan Cohen display no significant mean difference, with regard to any of the characteristics, between the negative and the positive condition (a visualization of the interaction effect is presented in Figure A3 in the supporting information).               "
"23","Up to this point, this study has established a direct causal relationship between exposure to news articles regarding behaviors and characteristics of foreign national leaders and evaluations of personal characteristics of citizens of these leaders’ nations. The next analysis reveals an indirect relationship that statistically establishes the mechanism of projection. As outlined in the methodology section, two questions were asked by way of manipulation checks. The first question was phrased as follows: “Does the article convey a positive or a negative attitude towards the exemplar [Angela Merkel/Adela Togendrich in Experiment 1; Benjamin Netanyahu/Dan Cohen in Experiment 2]?” The second question was phrased identically but inquired about the attitude toward Germany/Israel as a country. As has already been stated, the articles do not address Germany/Israel at all. The only occasion on which the name of the country figures into the article is when the leader is first introduced, for example: “The Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu…” Accordingly, participants who perceived the characterization of the exemplar (leader or citizen) in the news article as conveying either a positive or a negative implication regarding the nation have probably been subject to the projection effect: They perceived the group (the nation) in the same light as the group's exemplar (leader or citizen).               "
"24","The mediating role of the above two variables was estimated using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model to probe interactive effects. Figure 1 presents the evaluations of Germans’/Israelis’ characteristics (index) as the dependent variable (DV), exposure to either a negative or a positive article about the leader/citizen as the independent variable (IV), the evaluation of the article's attitude toward the leader as Mediator 1 (M1), and the evaluation of the article's attitude toward the nation as Mediator 2 (M2).               "
"25","The Indirect Effect of Storyline Tone (Positive vs. Negative) on Evaluations of Germans’/Israelis’ Characteristics (Unstandardized OLS Coefficients)"
"26","Note: Models were estimated using PROCESS (Hayes, 2017), an SPSS macro that utilizes an OLS regression to probe interactive effects. The regression models were conducted within control for demographic measures (age, education, income, and gender) and backgrounds measures (interest in domestic political issues, interest in foreign political issues, and previous exposure to news regarding the leader's nation). The only control variable that was found to be significantly related to the dependent variable (when the exemplar is leader) was previous exposure to a news article regarding the leader's nation (b = –25, p < .05). This was evident only in Experiment 2.                           "
"27","*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001.                           "
"28","The results, presented in Figure 1, demonstrate significant mediated effects only among those exposed to the article about the leader (Merkel/Netanyahu). Below I describe the paths displayed in the model: first the direct, and then the indirect. The first outcome tested (M1) is the perception of the article's attitude toward the exemplar (leader or citizen). As can be seen in both experiments and in both conditions of each experiment (leader and citizen), exposure to a positive (coded as 1) versus negative (coded as 0) article about the exemplar (IV) affected positively and significantly participants’ perceptions of the article's attitude toward the exemplar (with higher scores representing positive attitude and vice versa). This result, however, means only that the manipulations were perceived as intended in both conditions (leader vs. citizen). The second outcome tested is perceptions of the article's attitude toward the nation (M2). As shown in both experiments and in both conditions of each, exposure to either the positive or the negative article (IV) did not affect participants’ perceptions of the article's attitude toward the nation (M2). However, perceptions of the article's attitude toward the leader (M1) affected positively and significantly participants’ perceptions of the article's attitude toward the nation (M2). Yet, no significant relation in either experiment was found for participants exposed to the article regarding the citizen. The third outcome tested is the evaluation of Germans’/Israelis’ characteristics (DV). The results obtained show that perceptions of the article's attitude toward the nation (M2) and exposure to the article about the leader (Merkel/Netanyahu; IV) affected positively and significantly participants’ evaluations of Germans’/Israelis’ characteristics. Perceptions of the article's attitude toward the leader (M1) did not emerge as a significant predictor of evaluations of Germans’/Israelis’ characteristics (DV). As for participants exposed to the news article about the citizen, none of the above variables (IV/M1/M2) were found to be significantly related to evaluations of Germans’/Israelis’ characteristics (DV).               "
"29","Figure 1 displays three paths of indirect effects for each experiment. The significant indirect path (Path 2) goes from the manipulation of exposure to the news article (positive vs. negative) about the characteristics of the national leader (IV) to the evaluation of Germans’/Israelis’ characteristics (DV) through perceptions of the article's attitude toward the leader (M1), which leads to perceptions regarding the article's attitude toward the nation (M2). The indirect effects, presented in Paths 1 and 3, are insignificant. For those exposed to the manipulation of the article about the citizen, none of the indirect or direct effects was significant.               "
"30","To test whether exposure to news articles (positive vs. negative) about foreign national leaders affects emotional perceptions regarding these leaders’ nations, we compared the mean levels of two indices obtained in the experimental conditions—sentiment and respect. The results of both experiments, which are presented in Table 2, show a significant effect of positive versus negative portrayals of the leaders: The positive article impelled Israelis/Americans to form a more favorable opinion about Germany/Israel and increased their respect toward that country, whereas the negative portrayals corresponded with lower indices for both affect and respect. However, the responses of those who read the news article regarding the German/Israeli CEO Adela Togendrich/Dan Cohen display no significant mean difference in either of the emotional indicators between the positive and the negative condition (a visualization of the interaction effect is presented in Figure A4 in the supporting information).               "
"31","Mediated regression models, presented in Figure 2, demonstrated significant effects only among those exposed to the news article regarding the leaders (Merkel/Netanyahu). The results of the indirect models show that participants who read the positive article about the leader and who perceived the article's attitude as positive not only toward the leader but also toward that leader's nation are the ones who expressed significantly stronger positive emotions (sentiment and respect) toward that leader's nation, and vice versa. The results presented in the table underneath Figure 2 demonstrate that only the indirect effects, presented in Path 2, are significant. Again, for those exposed to the manipulation of the article about the citizen, none of the indirect or direct effects was significant.               "
"32","The Indirect Effect of Storyline Tone (Positive vs. Negative) on Emotions toward Germany/Israel (Unstandardized OLS Coefficients)"
"33","Note: Models were estimated using PROCESS (Hayes, 2017), an SPSS macro that utilizes an OLS regression to probe interactive effects. The regression models were conducted within control for demographic measures (age, education, income, and gender) and backgrounds measures (interest in domestic political issues, interest in foreign political issues, and previous exposure to news regarding the leader's nation). None of the control variables were found to be significantly related to the dependent variable (when the exemplar was leader).                           "
"34","To sum up, Study 1 provides evidence for the potential impact of exposure to a news article about a national leader's behavior on perceptions regarding that leader's nation and people. It was also demonstrated, however, that no national exemplar presented to a media audience has the potential to affect perceptions regarding his or her nation on par with the national leader. It should be emphasized here that Study 1 was conducted in two different countries, Israel and the United States. This renders the results obtained not culture specific and thus more robust."
"35","As already stated, the second study not only replicated the results of the first, but also added a control condition in which participants were not exposed to a news article about a leader. This allowed us to capture the impact of the two storylines (positive vs. negative) both against each other and against the no‐news article condition. Additionally, in order to isolate the effect of the manipulation from other factors—such as prior knowledge and perceptions of a foreign leader, country, or citizens—by way of a robustness test, this study adds an imaginary head of a fictitious state along with the real leaders."
"36","Study 2 was fielded to an online sample of 1,340 American adults recruited with Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Data collection began on December 3, 2014, and ended on March 23, 2015. A complete description of the sample is available in Tables A8–A9 in the supporting information. The study design involved three experiments (posttest only), each of which included three experimental conditions: In the experimental conditions, one group was exposed to an article ascribing positive characteristics to a leader, whereas the other emphasizing negative characteristics (a visualization of the design is presented in Table A1 in the supporting information). The third group was control group, in which participants read an article about nature. In each of the three experiments, the news article was devoted to a different foreign leader—Experiment 1: Angela Merkel, Experiment 2: Tayyip Erdogan, and Experiment 3: Stephen Turner, an imaginary leader of a fictitious country called Cedria, the latter intended as a robustness check. Parallel to Study 1, the articles in the experimental groups highlighted certain opposite characteristics. A full description of each experimental manipulation is presented in Tables A10‒A12. Figure A2 confirms that all the manipulations were perceived as intended. All variables were measured exactly as specified in Study 1.            "
"37","Study 2 examined the effect of exposing American participants to a news article emphasizing certain behaviors and personal characteristics of one of two foreign national leaders (Angela Merkel, Tayyip Erdogan) on their (a) evaluations of those characteristics in the citizens of that leader's country and (b) emotions toward that leader's country. As already stated, the third experiment, using the fictitious Stephen Turner as the head of an imaginary country named Cedria, was designed as a robustness test."
"38","Unlike participants who read a positive or a negative article about a foreign leader, participants who did not read an article about a leader (the control group) were expected to report mid‐level evaluations of the citizens of a foreign country they were requested to consider. To test this assumption, I compared the means, in the experimental versus control conditions, of participants’ attribution of the characteristics highlighted in the articles assigned to them to the respective foreign country's citizens (see Table 3). In Experiment 1, American participants were exposed to one of the two articles (positive vs. negative) regarding German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Table 3 (first column) shows that participants exposed to the positive article were significantly more likely to attribute the positive characteristics it ascribes to Merkel to German citizens at large, and vice versa. Moreover, the effect size (expressed in eta squared) of attributes such as aggressive/peaceful and untrustworthy/trustworthy (marked in boldface) is stronger than the effect size of the other attributes. The reason is that these attributes were the most salient in the Merkel articles and were therefore projected to a larger extent than the less prominent ones. The same pattern emerged in Experiment 2, in which American participants read either a positive or a negative article about Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan: A larger effect size was obtained for three characteristics: devious/not devious, threatening/not threatening, and not moral/moral (see Table 3, second column). These characteristics were salient in the Erdogan articles (a more detailed description of the Erdogan articles is presented in Table A10 in the supporting information). In Experiment 3, participants read an article about a fictitious leader named Stephen Turner. This study served as a robustness test and was designed to isolate the effect of manipulations from other factors such as prior knowledge and/or perceptions regarding the country and its citizens. The most salient characteristics in the Turner articles were intelligence (as he is allegedly “one of the smartest people in the world”) and responsibility (or lack thereof). The results show that participants indeed attributed these two characteristics to the putative citizens of Cedria (Table 3, third column). However, the effect size of other characteristics such as not brave/brave, dishonest/honest, untrustworthy/trustworthy, and cold/warm was very strong as well. This is not surprising: As participants of Experiment 3 could not have had prior knowledge about the citizens of Cedria, this group evaluated Cedrians based only on their evaluation of its leader, which could have been derived only from the content of the article.               "
"39","In all three experiments, participants in control conditions, who did not read an article about a leader, tended to report mid‐level evaluations regarding characteristics of the citizens of the country they were asked to consider."
"40","Notably, participants in the experimental groups also projected positive or negative evaluations based on characteristics that were not specifically mentioned in the text. For example, Angela Merkel was not described as devious in the negative article; in fact, deviousness was not mentioned at all. Yet, participants who read the negative article about Merkel were significantly more likely to rate Germans as devious compared to those who read the positive article or to the control group. Similarly, none of the leaders were described as friendly or unfriendly: The attribute of friendliness did not figure at all into any of the articles. Yet, in all three experiments of Study 2, as well as in the two experiments of Study 1, participants who read the positive article were significantly more likely to rate the citizens of the respective leader's country as more friendly compared to those who read the negative version or to the control group.               "
"41","To test the causal relationship between exposure to news articles (positive vs. negative) about foreign national leaders and emotional perceptions regarding these foreign leaders’ nations, for each of the foreign countries targeted (Germany and Turkey), we compared the mean levels obtained in the experimental conditions for two indices—sentiment and respect. The results, which are presented in Table 4, show a significant effect of positive versus negative portrayals of foreign leaders in the case of Turkey (but not Germany): The positive article impelled people to form a more favorable opinion about Turkey, whereas the negative portrayals corresponded with lower indices of affect. As expected, for the fictitious Cedria, the results are also significant and parallel to those for Turkey. In all studies, the attitude of participants who did not read an article about a leader (the control group) toward the country they were asked to assess was consistently mid‐level.               "
"42","The second emotional response analyzed was respect toward the foreign country. As shown in Table 4, in each one of the three experiments, exposure to the positive article on the foreign leader increased participants’ respect for that leader's country, whereas exposure to the negative article corresponded with lower levels of respect. Likewise, as anticipated, participants in the control groups reported mid‐level respect toward the country they were asked to assess.               "
"43","Two kinds of projection from the exemplar (i.e., national leader) to his or her group (i.e., nation) were examined. The first focuses on the projection of a leader's perceived personal characteristics on his or her nation's citizens. It was assumed that participants who read a positive article about a leader would project the positive characteristics emphasized in it on the citizens of that leader's nation. Conversely, a focus on a leader's negative qualities would lead participants to evaluate the citizens of that leader's nation unfavorably. This expectation was based on social psychology theories (see Boldry, Gaertner, and Quinn 2007) whereby humans’ view of outgroup members (case in point, foreign citizens) tends to be reductionist and stereotypical, causing the latter to be seen as “all alike” and similar to the group's most salient member (case in point, the country's leader). The present research has confirmed that people's judgments concerning a foreign country's citizens are indeed likely to be shaped by the perceived attributes of its leader. This psychological mechanism, whereby a national leader's personal characteristics are projected to his or her people by a foreign public, is demonstrated here for the first time.         "
"44","The next investigations concerns emotional projection, namely, a causal relationship between the affective tone of news content describing a national leader and participants’ emotional perception of the leader's nation as a whole. The results show that a positive description of a national leader led participants to express positive sentiment and high respect toward the leader's country, whereas a negative description prompted negative sentiment and low respect. Previous research on international public opinion has discussed and analyzed the correlative relationship between evaluations of a national leader and those of his or her nation (e.g., Dragojlovic 2011; Golan and Yang 2013). However, to the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate a causal mechanism behind the correlative evidence obtained hitherto, thus extending and strengthening previous findings.         "
"45","An impressive body of literature in political science and political communication has focused on mediated political personalization, that is, a change in the presentation of politics in the media expressed in a heightened focus on individual politicians (prime minister, president, party leader) and a diminished focus on nations, political parties, organizations, and institutions (Downey and Stanyer 2010). Many of the debates and studies on political personalization have revolved around the idea that such processes create human pseudo‐events and downplay the larger sociopolitical picture in favor of human triumphs and tragedies. The main concern that has been raised in this connection is that democracy is being undercut, as the complexity of political processes is reduced to achievements and standpoints of individual politicians, and the importance of rational opinion building and decision making is discounted (Adam and Maier 2010). The results of the current study provide the first empirical evidence to account for the misgivings about possible effects of personalized political information on media audiences. The findings show that the media portrayal of behaviors and standpoints of foreign leaders not only provides rationale for opinion building regarding that leader's nation but also contributes to the stereotyping of its citizens.         "
"46","Social psychology literature, and specifically the contact hypothesis and the conception of cognitive processing of source cues, suggests that humans’ view of outgroups (e.g., foreign nations) tends to be simplistic. As stated in the introduction and subsequently, people tend to believe that an outgroup can be adequately represented by a single member, who serves as a source cue and is perceived as the exemplar. However, the present study is the first to analyze these effects in the context of foreign politics and provide evidence for the causal relationship between the public's perception of a leader and evaluation of his or her nation and citizenry.         "
"47","It is important to point out the limitations of this study. The first has to do with the weaknesses of the experimental design in general, which resorts to artificial stimuli that do not mirror accurately people's everyday world (Lodge, McGraw, and Stroh 1989). While controlling and manipulating the independent variables allow researchers to isolate precisely the effects investigated, this is accomplished at the expense of real‐life experiences. Thus, the process employed in the present study may differ from the ones by which people actually acquire information about foreign leaders or countries. Second, our dependent measures are limited to tapping short‐term influences, which could be stronger than effects in the long term (Mutz and Nir 2010). Indeed, it is possible that effects emerging from experimental analysis may not endure as stereotypes. This point could be clarified through further study. Third, a nonprobability‐based recruitment method may have a bearing on the warrant to generalize the results presented here. It is true that MTurk samples are considered less representative than the highest‐quality national samples. Yet, despite the differences from the general population, subject populations recruited via the Internet tend to be closer to the U.S. population as a whole than subjects obtained from traditional university pools (Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012; Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling 2011; Paolacci et al. 2010).         "
"48","Notwithstanding the weaknesses inherent in the experimental design, the importance of the findings regarding the personal projection effect presented here cannot be denied: The presentation of national leaders in the media can give rise to new stereotypes or alter the perceptions of their countries and people. Arguably, this attests to an enormous power wielded by a single individual, and the possible implications can be far‐reaching. For one, this could impact a country's soft power and public diplomacy efforts, which, in part, derive from the appeal of its perceived values (Nye 2008). Today, most people around the world get their information about foreign countries from the media. Since media tend to zoom in on state leaders, often neglecting the state itself (Balmas and Sheafer 2013), the values perceived as a country's most prominent are those professed or represented by its leader. If a national leader is presented in the international media in a positive light, this can improve his or her country's assessment among foreign publics, and likely also among foreign policy makers. The flip side of this process, however, is less innocuous, especially since media contents today tend to be more and more negative, and in particular when political figures are concerned (e.g., Balmas 2017). The research here indicates that foreign nations’ assessments have come to depend on their respective leaders’ assessments. As a result, a country might be impelled to adjust its diplomacy efforts to a professionalized political environment, which may discount the larger sociopolitical picture in favor of achievements and standpoints of national political leaders. This could compromise rational opinion‐building and decision‐making processes. Future research will no doubt explore this and other global ramifications of the personal projection effect proposed in this article.         "
