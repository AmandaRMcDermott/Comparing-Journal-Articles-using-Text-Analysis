"1","Our work builds on the pioneering agenda‐setting model of Romer and Rosenthal (1978), in which a proposer with fixed identity makes a proposal that is pitted against a default alternative in an up‐or‐down vote. In our setting, however, decision making does not end when a proposal is approved: A policy persists only until it is replaced with a new policy. Baron (1996) introduces an endogenous status quo to a spatial legislative bargaining setting with a fixed distribution of agent preferences. He recovers a “dynamic median voter theorem”: Policies may move to the left or right in any period, but they gradually converge to the median voter's ideal policy. In our model, by contrast, the preferences of both the proposer and veto player may evolve over time in ways that cannot be perfectly anticipated. We show that convergence to either the present or to the anticipated future veto player's ideal policy need not occur.2 Chen and Eraslan (2015) allow an initial proposer to choose from one of several issues, but once an issue is addressed it cannot be revisited.         "
"2","In Penn (2009), a proposal is randomly (nonstrategically) drawn at each date and pitted against the status quo. Voters are “farsighted,” taking into account both the immediate and long‐term consequences of the immediate policy outcome. Penn highlights how static and dynamic voting considerations may diverge. We extend her work by modeling a strategic agenda setter, capturing the fact that in many real‐world settings, agendas are chosen by strategic agents who trade off current and future policy outcomes.         "
"3","Dynamic linkages may arise through other channels. Callander and Hummel (2014) explore an information channel: An incumbent's policy choice reveals information to her successor, changing her preferences over policies.3 Callander and Raiha (2014) explore a technological channel: They assume that policy investments (infrastructure) persist across periods. Agenda manipulation arises because a successor's preference over subsequent investments depends on past investments.         "
"4","Our work also relates to a literature on the political economy of the timing and scope of reform. A long‐standing puzzle is why parties with an avowed opposition to reforms such as market liberalization are more likely to implement these policies (Alesina, Ardagna, and Trebbi 2006; Roland 2008). Cukierman and Tommasi (1998) claim that these parties' relative hostility to such policies ensures that only they can credibly claim that they are necessary. Our explanation is instead based on a fear that a failure to implement reform now will make the inevitable actions of a successor even more drastic.         "
"5","We consider a two‐date economy, with Dates 1 and 2. The policy space is . There are two agents: a decisive veto player (“the veto player”) and a legislative proposer (“the proposer”), whose Date t ideal policies are  and , respectively. The legislative proposer may be interpreted as the executive or a senior legislative officeholder. The veto player could be the median legislator or the “effective” pivotal legislator in cases where a supermajority requirement applies. In other settings, the veto player could be the median legislator in a governing party or coalition.         "
"6","The Date t payoff of an agent with ideal policy i from a Date t policy  is . There is an initial status quo , inherited from a previous legislative cycle. The proposer is either a reactionary or a radical, with ideal policies e and , respectively, where . Initially, the veto player is a centrist, with an ideal policy that we normalize to zero. Symmetry of agents' ideal policies eases analysis, but it is not needed for our results.         "
"7","The timing is as follows. At Date 1, the proposer first chooses a policy  that the veto player may accept or reject. If accepted, the proposal is implemented; otherwise, the status quo s1 prevails. The policy implemented at Date 1 serves as the status quo s2 at Date 2.         "
"8","Between Dates 1 and 2, an election occurs that may change the identities of the proposer, the veto player, or both. For example, in a parliamentary system, both agents may change in the same election; in a presidential system in which election timing is staggered, one agent may remain in office for sure while the other faces potential replacement. In settings where proposals originate in the legislature, a change in veto player could reflect a change in president."
"9","At Date 2, the veto player may remain a centrist or be replaced by a conservative veto player with ideal policy  or by a progressive veto player with ideal policy .  denotes the probability of a type r2 veto player at Date 2. Likewise, the proposer may remain a reactionary (radical) or be replaced by a radical (reactionary). We let α denote the probability of a radical Date 2 proposer and let  denote the probability of a reactionary proposer. For simplicity, we assume that the probability distributions over these transitions are independent.         "
"10","At Date 2, the proposer chooses a policy , which the veto player may accept or reject. If accepted, the proposal is implemented; otherwise, the Date 2 status quo s2 is implemented. The game then ends.         "
"11","In real‐world settings, proposers and veto players are often imperfectly aligned (i.e., ). In the United States, it is rare for a single party to control the House, Senate, and presidency; and even when the same party controls each branch, a supermajority may be required in the Senate. Moreover, preferences may vary across the three branches, for example, if agents face different electoral constituencies. In parliamentary systems where a single party is likely to hold both a legislative majority and the executive, a party leader who acts as a proposer must still win the support of a majority within the governing party. This problem can be especially severe when parties must work together in a coalition government. Institutional rules may also render the “effective” veto player different from the median of the legislative chamber in which the party holds a majority. This would be the case if proposals are initiated in a lower chamber, but are subject to veto by an upper chamber.         "
"12","We do not initially order the ideologies of the proposers and the relatively polarized veto players, e and m. However, dynamic trade‐offs arise almost exclusively in settings where at least one proposer is more ideologically extreme than the corresponding veto player. Thus, most of our analysis focuses on settings in which the proposer is relatively more “extreme” than her most closely aligned veto player, that is, when .4"
"13","The payoff of an agent with ideal policy i is . The weight  captures the degree to which agents value policy made in the next term relative to the current term. A policy maker may place less emphasis on the current term (δ close to 1) if an election will soon take place, since there will be an imminent opportunity to revise policy after the election. The most natural interpretation of our two‐date model is that the policy in place at the end of the second term is subsequently locked in over a sufficiently long horizon that future opportunities to change it are largely discounted by relatively impatient politicians. In practice, it is often politically and practically infeasible for lawmakers to implement frequent major innovations to a policy area (e.g., health insurance).         "
"14","Throughout, we assume that the proposer is “dynamically sophisticated”: She recognizes that political competition is not a one‐shot game and fully accounts for the future consequences of her proposal. To simplify exposition, our benchmark setting assumes that the veto player evaluates policy solely according to her status quo payoff. This lets us focus on the dynamic concerns of the proposer. Later, we consider a veto player who is also dynamically sophisticated."
"15","We assume that the distributions over the future holders of proposal and veto power are independent and exogenous. Positive correlation strengthens incentives for an agent to hold back from initially moving policy toward her ideal policy, whereas negative correlation weakens those incentives. Positive correlation is likely in a parliamentary system, where the forces that make a reactionary proposer more likely also make a conservative veto player from the same party more likely. In contrast, negative correlation may be likely in an American context where the president faces a midterm election in which her party typically performs badly. In that case, the veto player's ideology is likely to move away from the proposer's."
"16","We also assume the exogeneity of the distributions over future proposal and veto power. Policy reforms have indirect effects on preferences—given agents' tastes, they affect their induced preference trade‐offs over future reforms vis‐à‐vis the induced status quo. Our analysis focuses on this effect. Policy reforms may also change agents' underlying primitive preferences. For example, allowing occupants of state housing to purchase their homes may alter their preferences over redistributive policies.5 Translated into our framework, there are settings in which the distribution over proposal and veto power varies with today's policy choices. We make two observations. First, our framework lets us avoid conflating the two channels while uncovering a bevy of subtle trade‐offs. Second, the underlying demographics of a society typically change slowly, taking several legislative cycles to evolve.6"
"17","We first identify settings in which politicians always want to move policy toward their ideal policies, past the policy preferred by a centrist veto player. These include the following: (1) a static setting where there are no future opportunities to revise policies; (2) the veto player is always a centrist; or (3) veto players have more extreme ideologies than proposers (i.e., ).         "
"18","A static setting is strategically equivalent to Date 2 of a dynamic environment, so we drop time subscripts and refer to the status quo as s, and the ideal points of the proposer and veto player as p and r. When future opportunities to change policy are absent or fully discounted, a proposer wants to move policy as close as possible to her ideal point, subject to receiving approval from the veto player (Romer and Rosenthal 1978).            "
"19","The veto player will accept any policy that is closer to her ideal policy r than the status quo s. Suppose that a radical with ideal policy  holds proposal power.               "
"20","                     "
"21","If a radical proposer's ideal policy is sufficiently palatable to the veto player relative to the status quo (i.e., if ), then the radical proposes her own ideal policy (see Figure 2). Otherwise, she can do no better than . Therefore, the radical's static optimal proposal is               "
"22","A proposer's ability to move policy rises with the distance between the status quo s and the veto player's ideal policy r. This is particularly relevant when a radical proposer and veto player are partially aligned relative to the status quo, so that , but not so much that the veto player would let the radical implement her ideal policy, . In this case, the radical fully exploits the veto player's desire for reform, jumping policy past r by .            "
"23","Similarly, the optimal proposal of a reactionary with ideology  is               "
"24","This solution has implications for the dynamic setting. When a proposer and veto player are only partially aligned relative to the status quo, a proposer's ability to move policy rises with the distance  between the status quo and the veto player's ideal policy. When the status quo arises from a previous proposal, this feature provides a proposer with incentives to refrain from maximizing her static payoff in order to increase her future advantage.            "
"25","Suppose now that today's proposer is uncertain about the identity of tomorrow's proposer, but the veto player is sure to remain a centrist. This could reflect a setting in which a legislative chamber is the proposer, the president is the veto player, and only the legislative chamber faces an imminent midterm election."
"26","At Date 1, a centrist veto player accepts any proposal that is closer to her ideal policy than the status quo. This is not a consequence of our assumption that a veto player evaluates proposals according to her immediate payoff. In fact, if a veto player is certain to retain veto power, her acceptance strategy is the same when she is dynamically sophisticated, and therefore internalizes the long‐run consequences of her acceptance decisions.               "
"27","Result 1.Suppose that a centrist is certain to hold veto power at both dates. Then at Date 1, a radical proposes , whereas a reactionary proposes .                  "
"28","Result 1 follows directly from the observation that for any Date 2 status quo  or , a radical will implement  and a reactionary will implement y1.            "
"29","This result does not mean that a proposer moves policy as close as possible to her ideal point. In fact, her proposal trades off between static and dynamic incentives. Catering to her immediate payoff also improves future outcomes if she is again realized as a proposer. This is because she can do no better than lock in her gains at Date 2 by maintaining the induced status quo, . However, as she moves policy closer to her ideal, the penalty from losing proposal power grows increasingly severe. Thus:               "
"30","Proposition 1.If a centrist veto player always holds veto power at both dates, then an interior solution for a proposer with ideal policy  satisfies                     "
"31","A radical's proposal  induces future misalignment between herself and a centrist, and it raises the threat of a hostile alignment between a reactionary proposer and a centrist. When a hostile alignment is more likely, a radical proposes less reform to avoid antagonizing a centrist, who will be easier for a future reactionary to exploit. A reactionary proposer who proposes  faces similar considerations.            "
"32","When the veto player is always a centrist, each proposer's concern for the long run always induces policy moderation. Nonetheless, dynamic incentives need not induce policy moderation when the identity of the veto player can also change between dates."
"33","Result 1 extends when (1) the veto player's identity may change between periods, but (2) , so that the ideologies of non‐centrist veto players are more extreme than those of proposers. When , a radical who faces a progressive at Date 2 can achieve her ideal outcome  regardless of the location of the status quo . The same holds for a reactionary‐conservative pairing at Date 2 when . Since the precise location of the Date 1 policy only affects the Date 2 outcome if the veto player is a centrist, Result 1 extends: A radical at Date 1 selects , whereas a reactionary proposer prefers .            "
"34","Thus, the strategically interesting setting is where proposers are more extreme than veto players, that is, where  (see Figure 1). In what follows, to ease presentation, we assume an even greater degree of imperfect alignment between proposers and veto players:               "
"35","A1 ensures that for any Date 2 status quo resulting from Date 1 interactions, each proposer wants to move policy closer to her ideal point than any veto player would accept.7"
"36","We now study optimal proposals at Date 1 when the identities of the proposer and veto player may change over time, and proposers are more extreme than veto players."
"37","When the veto player is always a centrist, the optimal Date 1 proposal renders the centrist veto player exploitable only by the opposing proposer, at Date 2. When the veto player can change over time, by contrast, each proposer faces a nontrivial decision about which types of veto players she wants to be partially aligned with at Date 2. When the veto player is not dynamically sophisticated, she weakly prefers any policy  to s1. This means that a proposer faces an initial decision about which side of a centrist's ideal policy to place her Date 1 proposal.         "
"38","A proposer's continuation payoff from a policy y1 that becomes the Date 2 status quo s2 is            "
"39","The Date 2 proposer will be a radical with probability α. If the radical holds proposal power and , then the radical will exploit her friendly alignment to shift policy to . If, instead, , the radical and veto player are misaligned, so she can do no better than maintain the status quo. With probability β, the proposer will be a reactionary. If , then a reactionary will exploit her own friendly alignment with a veto player to move policy to . If, instead,  then she and the veto player will be misaligned and maintain the status quo. Notice that friendly alignment from one proposer's perspective represents hostile alignment from the other's.         "
"40","Substituting these possible Date 2 policy outcomes into  and recalling the quadratic structure of preferences yields            "
"41","Here,  is the Date 2 status quo policy  that would let a proposer with ideology i move policy all the way to i if she faced an aligned veto player with ideal policy r2. From Assumption A1, , so a proposer will never move Date 1 policy this far.         "
"42","The optimal policy of an agent with ideology i solves            "
"43","Lemma 1.If the optimal policy of a proposer with ideal point i is interior, then it satisfies                  "
"44","where , or .               "
"45","There are at most two solutions satisfying Expression 7—one on each side of the centrist veto player's ideal policy—reflecting that whether the centrist veto player is aligned with one proposer or the other changes as y1 switches from one side of a centrist's ideal point to the other. Dynamic incentives are determined by two competing channels, an alignment channel,            "
"46","and a misalignment channel,         "
"47","            "
"48","In equilibrium, the initial proposal  becomes the Date 2 status quo. With probability α, the Date 2 proposer is a radical. If , the radical is aligned with a veto player. With complementary probability , the Date 2 proposer is a reactionary. If , the reactionary is aligned with the veto player. The absolute magnitude of  captures ideological conflicts of interest between a proposer and a partially aligned veto player.               "
"49","For a radical, the first term in Expression 8 reflects future friendly alignment, and the second term reflects hostile alignment. For a reactionary, the terms are reversed. Both friendly and hostile alignment encourage a proposer to refrain from moving Date 1 policy toward her ideal. However, a risk‐averse proposer weighs hostile alignment more heavily than friendly alignment. So, unless she is likely to retain proposal power, a proposer holds back largely to prevent future policy moves away from her ideal.               "
"50","At Date 2, the ideologies of the proposer and veto player may admit no mutually acceptable alternative to the induced status quo. This occurs if a proposer holds power but faces a veto player whose ideal point lies on the opposite side of the status quo from her own ideal point. When this happens,  will once again be implemented.               "
"51","As the prospect of this policy inertia rises, a Date 1 proposer prefers either to front‐load reform (if she is a radical) or to hold the line against reform (if she is a reactionary). Future gridlock limits both the value of holding subsequent proposal power and the cost of losing it. Misalignment thus constitutes a form of insurance for a proposer against the adverse consequences of initially accelerating her own agenda."
"52","A proposer's immediate interest is to move Date 1 policy toward her ideal policy. However, the future consequences of a proposal present conflicting imperatives. We first focus on “local” comparative statics that change the location of an interior solution  or  within each interval. We then identify forces that lead to “jumps” in y1 from one side of the centrist veto player's ideal point to the other.         "
"53","A Date 1 proposer has a short‐run incentive to exploit a centrist as much as possible. However, any prospect of a Date 2 proposer–veto player alignment—be it friendly or hostile—consitutes a dynamic force for restraint. Thus, we have the following:               "
"54","Proposition 2.If a proposer becomes more concerned about future payoffs (i.e., if δ rises), then she always holds back more from moving her initial proposal toward her ideal point.                  "
"55","Short‐run incentives yield no trade‐offs for a proposer. By contrast, a future prospect of either a friendly or hostile alignment gives a Date 1 proposer a dynamic incentive to refrain from unfettered exploitation of the centrist. Since dynamic incentives always urge more restraint than static incentives, raising a proposer's concern for future outcomes gives her a stronger incentive to hold back at Date 1."
"56","Proposition 2 implies that proposers will allocate major policy initiatives that depart most significantly from the status quo to the start of a legislative cycle. For example, George W. Bush proposed No Child Left Behind within 3 days of taking office, and his first major tax reform was passed within 5 months of the start of his presidency. Likewise, the Conservative‐led UK Coalition government introduced one of its most controversial reforms—the Academies Act 2010—within 14 days of its commencement. By contrast, critics contended that its final year was stymied by a lack of policy initiatives, serving merely as a “long anteroom” to the next election.8 Our explanation for front‐loading major initiatives is distinct from “honeymoon” arguments that emphasize a legislature's deference to an executive just after his or her election (McCarty 1997). Instead, we emphasize the relative imminence of subsequent opportunities to change policy in the future.9"
"57","We next characterize the possibly paradoxical effects of a probabilistic shift toward a more reform‐minded veto player: Under plausible circumstances, both a radical and a reactionary proposer respond by accelerating reform.               "
"58","Proposition 3.Consider a shift in the distribution over Date 2 veto players that redistributes probability mass from a conservative to a progressive. Regardless of whether a proposer is a radical or a reactionary, she responds by offering less reform if and only if the probability she holds future proposal power exceeds .                  "
"59","To illustrate, suppose the Date 1 proposer is a radical. When a probability mass of  is taken from the future prospect of a conservative and redistributed to a progressive, the local change in a Date 1 radical's proposal is               "
"60","The other two terms in Expression 10 come from the alignment channel. A radical's prospect of a future friendly alignment with a progressive rises by , and the prospect of a hostile alignment between a reactionary proposer and a conservative falls by . Expression 10 reflects that these two terms are not weighted equally: A risk‐averse proposer cares more about policies that result from hostile alignment.            "
"61","If the probability of misalignment rises (i.e., if ), then a radical always accelerates reform. What if, instead, a radical is more likely to hold proposal power in the future? Holding back more allows a radical to better exploit a future friendly alignment. However, unless she is very likely to retain proposal power, the first‐order effect of a more “reform‐friendly” distribution of veto power is to lower her risk‐adjusted alignment consideration via the reduced risk of a future hostile alignment. This leads her to bring reform forward. The impact of risk aversion is clearest when the distribution over future proposal power is balanced, that is, : The radical moves policy closer to her ideal point by a distance . Combining the misalignment and alignment channels, a radical holds back more if and only if               "
"62","A symmetric logic implies that a reactionary responds with less reform only if she is very likely to hold proposal power, that is,               "
"63","To place the proposition in context, consider a president facing a midterm election who is sure to remain in office, but is uncertain about the election's consequences for the ideology of the pivotal legislator in the lower chamber. The proposition implies that if a president anticipates a favorable shift in the preferences of the pivotal legislator, it is better to hold off on executing her agenda. If, instead, the president anticipates an unfavorable shift, then the next legislative session yields less scope for reversing initial concessions, so she prefers to accelerate her agenda prior to the midterm election. Finally, if the president also faces election and there is sufficient uncertainty about whether she will retain office, the proposition reveals that regardless of her ideological preferences, she moves the initial policy toward the anticipated location of the new pivotal legislator's ideal policy.            "
"64","Changes in the ideological conflict between proposers and veto players affect the Date 1 trade‐offs a proposer faces to (1) increase friendly alignment with future veto players, (2) lower hostile alignment of an opposing proposer with veto players, and (3) accelerate her agenda in anticipation of future misalignment.            "
"65","The effect of greater polarization of veto players on Date 1 proposals hinges solely on the probability of a future alignment.               "
"66","Proposition 4.Regardless of whether the Date 1 proposer is a radical or a reactionary, more polarized veto players (increased m) induce the proposer to offer more reform if and only if                     "
"67","When a friendly alignment is more likely than a hostile alignment, raising m reduces the imperative to raise the value of future friendly alignment by holding back, since a proposer can achieve more with the now more‐aligned veto player for any Date 2 status quo. The proposer responds by moving policy in the direction of her ideal point. In contrast, when a hostile alignment is more likely, if a hostile veto player moves closer to a hostile proposer, it raises the imperative to mitigate future hostile alignment.            "
"68","To place Proposition 4 in context, suppose there is a right‐wing status quo, and an imminent election is expected to bring both the presidency and legislature under the control of the Left. This could arise from a “coattail” effect, in which legislators who are politically aligned with the winning presidential candidate benefit from their candidate's popular support (Ferejohn and Calvert 1984), and which Halberstam and Montagnes (2015) show leads to the election of more ideologically extreme senators who support the president. When the legislature is expected to become more ideologically polarized, the initial incumbent proposer—regardless of her ideology—offers more reform. A reactionary makes concessions to avert more drastic future policy shifts. By contrast, a radical initiates more reform today since she can already achieve more in the future with a more ideologically polarized aligned veto player regardless of her initial proposal.            "
"69","Greater polarization of proposers affects both static and dynamic trade‐offs. It raises a proposer's immediate incentive to move policy toward her ideal, since more extreme ideological preferences raise the direct cost of holding back. Greater polarization of proposers also affects both the alignment and misalignment channels, by raising a proposer's conflict of interest with both aligned and misaligned veto players.               "
"70","Proposition 5.Suppose the polarization e of proposers rises. Then if misaligned proposer–veto player pairings are more likely than aligned pairings, each proposer moves her Date 1 proposal closer to her ideal policy. If, instead, aligned pairings are more likely, then there exists a  such that if and only if , each proposer moves her Date 1 proposal further from her ideal policy.                  "
"71","A more extreme proposer suffers a higher Date 1 cost from failing to move policy toward her ideal. She also suffers a higher cost of Date 2 misalignment, since the status quo will be implemented. If the net likelihood of future misalignment exceeds that of alignment, static and dynamic considerations both lead a more extreme proposer to accelerate her agenda."
"72","However, a more extreme proposer also has greater intrinsic conflicts of interest with all veto players. This raises her incentive to hold back to raise future friendly alignment and reduce hostile alignment. By holding back, she lowers her conflict with aligned friendly veto players, and she reduces an opposing proposer's ability to exploit aligned hostile veto players."
"73","If aligned proposer–veto player pairings are more likely than misaligned pairings, static and dynamic incentives oppose each other. Then, if and only if a Date 1 proposer cares enough about future outcomes—for example, due to an imminent election—she will respond by holding back. As the prospects of aligned pairings rise, the requisite size of δ falls since the initial proposer is more certain about the need to hold back from exploiting the centrist for the sake of her Date 2 payoff."
"74","To place Proposition 5 in context, suppose that the next election may change the identity of both the president and legislative majority. If control of the two branches is likely to fall to different political parties, a more ideological president will accelerate her agenda before the election. If, instead, the same party is likely to control both branches, the impact of more extreme proposer preferences depends on the imminence δ of the election. If an election is imminent and there will be an opportunity to revisit the issue in the next legislative session, the president holds off working on the issue. This may be due to (1) a fear of losing power to an opposing aligned proposer–veto player pairing or (2) an attempt to create even more favorable conditions for aggressive reform. Otherwise, despite the likely prospect of either favorable or unfavorable unified government, a more extreme proposer accelerates her agenda.            "
"75","Changes in tastes, uncertainty, and concern for the future affect local comparative statics through the alignment and misalignment channels. They also affect the discrete trade‐offs associated with whether a proposer wishes to (partially) align herself with a centrist veto player whenever there is uncertainty about whether the centrist will hold future veto power. If the centrist will never hold future veto power, the alignment of future veto players and proposers is unaffected by initial policy outcomes, and the local solutions characterized in Lemma 1 coincide. If the centrist always holds veto power, Result 1 implies that each proposer always prefers a Date 1 outcome that lies between her own ideal point and the centrist's.            "
"76","Suppose, therefore, that the probability tomorrow's proposer faces a centrist veto player is strictly positive, but less than 1. Jumps in optimal policies require that there exist multiple interior solutions  and . In turn, multiple interior solutions require that the Date 1 proposer be more likely than not to retain proposal power. To see why, recognize that Lemma 1 implies that for a Date 1 proposer,               "
"77","We explore how changes in the uncertainty associated with future proposal power affect an initial radical proposer's preference for aligning herself with a future centrist veto player. Suppose, then, that . When is it worthwhile for the radical to refrain from exploiting the centrist at Date 1, (1) in the hopes of retaining proposal power and facing a progressive veto player, and (2) inoculating herself against a future reactionary‐conservative pairing? Let  denote a radical's globally optimal interior solution. We have the following:               "
"78","Proposition 6.Suppose a radical is more likely to hold future proposal power, that is, .                     "
"79","               "
"80","When , a conservative veto player is much less likely than a progressive. Then when proposal power is fairly balanced—that is, when , but the difference is small—a Date 1 radical proposer is largely concerned about the risk of a future misalignment between a reactionary and a progressive. This implies that future policy is likely to remain “stuck” at the new status quo, so an initial radical proposer prefers to exploit the centrist veto player immediately.                     "
"81","As the radical's prospects α for retaining proposal power rise, so does the relative value to her of holding back, since she is more likely to benefit from a friendly alignment with a progressive. There exists a threshold  at which the radical switches from exploiting the centrist to holding back in the hope of extracting more from a future progressive veto player. This is the point at which it is better to “step back in order to leap forward more vigorously.” The threshold declines in δ since a greater concern for the future raises a radical's willingness to hold back with even less favorable prospects of holding proposal power.               "
"82","As the prospect that a radical retains proposal power rises, the value of forestalling a reactionary falls. There exists an  at which a radical switches to accelerating reform, in anticipation of future gridlock. At , the need to hold back from exploiting the centrist for fear of a future reactionary‐conservative pairing is trumped by a desire to accelerate reform in anticipation of future gridlock. The threshold rises in δ since a more patient proposer is more willing to hold back from exploiting the centrist to inoculate herself against a future reactionary‐conservative pairing.            "
"83","The asymmetry in the thresholds for  reflects risk aversion, since a radical proposer's Date 2 payoff is most strongly affected by hostile alignment or misalignment. The ratio  reflects the intrinsic alignment between the progressive and radical. As m rises, the urgency of holding back at Date 1 to raise her future alignment with a progressive falls. This raises the bar for a radical to forego early exploitation of the centrist.            "
"84","Figure 3 illustrates a radical's globally optimal proposal. In the online appendix, we extend the example to compare with a reactionary's proposal. Note the non‐monotonicity in the third panel: Here, the Date 2 veto player is most likely to be a centrist, but a conservative veto player is far more likely than a progressive. When an initial radical proposer is unlikely to retain proposal power (), she foregoes her ability to exploit the centrist in order to reduce the damage from a future hostile alignment between a reactionary proposer and conservative veto player. As a result, a radical proposer will be aligned with a centrist at Date 2. As her prospect α of retaining proposal power rises, a radical initially holds back even more, but not out of fear of a conservative veto player. Instead, she holds back to raise her alignment with the centrist. The radical's decision not to exploit the centrist initially leaves open the possibility of exploiting her in the future, and a centrist veto player is relatively likely to arise at that date.

"85","Illustration of How a Radical's Optimal Date 1 Proposal Varies with Her Prospects of Holding Future Proposal Power"
"86","Note: Parameters: , , , and . In (a) , in (b) , and in (c) .                        "
"87","At , the fear of a hostile aligned reactionary‐conservative pairing is trumped by the prospect of a misaligned radical‐conservative pairing. If the radical holds future proposal power, she is most likely to face either a centrist with whom she can achieve no more than she could today or a conservative with whom she can achieve no reform at all. So, further increases in proposal power lead the radical to accelerate reform as much as possible, as if she had based her initial proposal solely on static considerations.            "
"88","We highlight conditions under which a paradoxical “reversal” occurs: A reactionary proposer moves policy further from her ideal and closer to the radical's ideal than would the radical herself.               "
"89","Proposition 7.If, at Date 2, the radical proposer is likely to hold power () and the veto player is likely to be a progressive (), then there exists a  such that if , a reactionary proposer proposes more reform at Date 1 than a radical.                  "
"90","If agents who favor reform are likely to enjoy future proposal and veto power, a radical proposer “steps back” in order to “leap forward more vigorously” in the future. For the same reason, a reactionary offers incremental reform to forestall a wave of even more potent future reform. Risk aversion plays no role in this result. Rather, the key force is a net present value calculation, which trades off a Date 1 proposer's prospective future policy gains from holding back, relative to the immediate policy loss from failing to exploit the centrist."
"91","This result can illuminate historical examples in which politicians advocate or oppose policies that do not cater to their contemporaneous interests. We earlier highlighted an attempt in 1969 to reform the House of Lords by the British Labour government that was vanquished, in part, by opposition from within the Labour party. Strikingly, an earlier Conservative government implemented the Life Peerages Act of 1958. This act allowed individuals who did not hold hereditary peerages to be appointed to the House of Lords,10 and it allowed female peers to sit in the House of Lords. It was bitterly opposed by the Labour Party, embodied in Hugh Gaitskell's accusation during the bill's debate:               "
"92","The Bill is not really a reform Bill.… It leaves the present powers of the House of Lords unchanged and it gives, conveniently, an apparently slightly more respectable appearance to the House of Lords. We are opposed to a cloak of respectability put upon a person when the reality is quite unchanged.11"
"93","Subsequent retrospection by Conservatives supports Gaitskell's concerns. In a 1998 policy briefing, Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Tyrie argued: “It was Conservative reforms of the late 1950s and early 1960s which … modernised the Lords enough to protect it from those who wanted it abolished” (Tyrie 1998, ii). In this policy context, the forces identified in Proposition 7 appear to be relevant.            "
"94","We have focused on the strategic considerations of a proposer given a veto player who evaluates proposals solely according to her period payoffs. However, a veto player who is a pivotal legislator may have the same dynamic sophistication as the proposer—that is, she evaluates Date 1 proposals based on current and future payoffs.         "
"95","In general, there may be policies that a Date 1 dynamically sophisticated veto player rejects that a myopic veto player would accept, or policies that a Date 1 dynamically sophisticated centrist veto player accepts but a myopic veto player would not. For example, if a future reactionary‐conservative pairing is likely, a dynamically sophisticated centrist veto player may accept proposals that move Date 1 policy past the status quo toward the reactionary's ideal point, since they forestall more extreme future outcomes. A Date 1 radical proposer likewise may exploit this opportunity to propose a policy that she likes even less than the status quo, but which nonetheless reduces the risk of an even more reactionary policy in the future.12 This is consistent with the well‐documented phenomenon that left‐wing governments are as likely as right‐wing governments to privatize state‐owned industries, or to engage in deficit‐cutting and other pro‐market reforms Alesina, Ardagna, and Trebbi (2006), Roland (2008). Our explanation is closest to Schroeder's defense of ‘Agenda 2010’: “Either we modernize ourselves, and by that I mean as a social market economy, or others will modernize us, and by that I mean unchecked market forces which will simply brush aside the social element”.13"
"96","Indeed, a proposer may be able to exploit a Date 1 dynamically sophisticated veto player to achieve more extreme Date 1 policy outcomes than would be feasible with a myopic veto player. If, for example, a future radical‐progressive pairing is likely, a dynamically sophisticated centrist veto player may accept proposals that move Date 1 policy toward the radical's ideal point, past the progressive veto player's ideal, thereby precluding a future radical's ability to effect further policy change. A Date 1 radical may exploit the centrist veto player's fear of a future radical‐progressive pairing to obtain relatively extreme Date 1 policy outcomes. A centrist veto player may be worse off for her dynamic sophistication: In contrast with the myopic setting, she cannot commit to rejecting relatively extreme proposals.         "
"97","Knowing when to “step back”—whether primarily to leap forward or instead to keep back—is a strategic imperative for political agents seeking not only to make short‐run gains, but also to achieve long‐term policy goals. We show that the prospect of losing or retaining political power yields two distinct rationales for agents to refrain from moving policy fully toward their ideal points. We characterize when radical reform advocates prefer less short‐run reform, and we illuminate our results with examples in which politicians advocate or oppose policies that do not cater to their contemporaneous interests.         "
"98","The dynamic trade‐offs that we uncover have more general significance. Gupta (2009) argues that incremental victories can have unintended consequences for social movements' ability to mobilize resources in the future. She finds “movements seek to make incremental gains in advancing their larger policy agenda; [but] this success … [can] enervate programmatic activity as continued gains potentially diminish the urgency of the issue or the demonstrable need for greater activism” (Gupta 2009, 406). Thus, “success can be a bit of a poisoned chalice to groups if their demonstrated ability to achieve good outcomes leads to subsequent attrition in support levels” (Gupta 2009, 408).         "
"99","Similar issues arise in legal contexts. Bell (1976) assesses the trade‐offs faced by the NAACP in pursuing legal attacks on racial segregation in U.S. schools. After Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954), civil rights lawyers who prosecuted local cases faced a tension between “serving two masters”: their local clients and the NAACP, which sought “to develop a broad scale attack on Jim Crow institutions” (Schraub 2013, 1288). In particular, “civil rights lawyers would not settle for anything less than a desegregated system,” even when local plaintiffs might have settled litigation in return for promises of better segregated schools. As a counsel to the NAACP in Mississippi, Bell advised a community whose segregated school had been closed by local authorities. He warned that they would not receive support if they just attempted to reopen the school, but that they would receive support if they pursued a full‐scale desegregation suit, inducing them to file one of the first desegregation suits in the state (Bell 1976, 476–77).
