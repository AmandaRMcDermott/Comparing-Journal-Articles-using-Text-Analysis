"1","Capitol Hill is a busy place. Congressional institutions are overworked by a sizeable existing agenda, the budget process, bureaucratic oversight activities, and constituent casework (Aberbach 1990; Hall 1996; Jones 1994; Walker 1977). Therefore, the amount of institutional attention available for new initiatives is quite scarce. Indeed, formal consideration is given to only a small fraction of the thousands of bills introduced. This reality makes understanding this first cut of the process—“deciding what to decide on” in the lexicon of Bauer, Pool, and Dexter (1964)—undeniably essential. Winnowing is an agenda‐setting process and, as such, impacts subsequent stages of legislative policymaking. As Kingdon aptly states: “The patterns of public policy, after all, are determined not only by such final decisions as votes in legislatures, or initiatives and vetoes by presidents, but also by the fact that some subjects and proposals emerge in the first place and others are never seriously considered” (1995, 2).         "
"2","Data demonstrate quite clearly that winnowing influences subsequent stages in the legislative process. Figure 1 shows the paring down of bills by stage for the 102nd Congress (chambers combined in the CRS report). The most dramatic reduction in the population of bills is in the winnowing stage, as decisions are made to consider some bills and to neglect entirely the remainder. The survival rate, or the percentage of bills that progress from the previous stage, is by far the lowest here. In the House, only 16% of bills introduced gain any attention after referral to committee. In the Senate, it is 23%.2 Moreover, of the bills that survive the winnowing stage, two out of three are eventually passed by at least one chamber of Congress. Hence, by definition, the latter stages are biased by this first “cut” of the process.         "

"5","Despite its importance, our systematic understanding of winnowing is, at best, nascent. The winnowing stage in a systematic sense tends to be overlooked by congressional scholars, who typically study subsequent stages of lawmaking and have said little about the initial stage of the process in terms of systematic outcomes.3 Important strides have been made in understanding related topics in the pre‐floor legislative process, such as the referral of bills to committees (King 1997) and member behavior early in the legislative process, including the level of legislative entrepreneurship displayed by Senators (Schiller 1995) and House members (Krehbiel 1995; Wawro 2000), and the level of member participation in committee activities (Hall 1996). The studies of member behavior are helpful for considering potential explanatory variables of winnowing, but the authors have left to others the development of a specific test of the legislative effects of such activities.4"
"6","The few studies of lawmaking that do feature a bill (Bailey 1950; Berman 1966; Eidenberg and Morey 1969; Fenno 2003; Jones 1975; Light 1985, 1992; Peabody et al. 1972) or bills (DeGregorio 1997; Jones 1994) as the unit of analysis typically consider successful bills, looking backward into the process to see how they came to be successful. The case studies of one bill highlight the use of legislative strategy and the importance of being on the right committee. The scholarship that addresses multiple bills builds in a role for the governing context. Still other research examines why some bills that make it far in the process ultimately fail while others pass (e.g., Bond and Fleisher 1990; Edwards, Barrett, and Peake 1997; Sinclair 1997). Yet, the institutional process that produces these seriously considered bills is interesting and important to understand in a democratic legislative institution. It is critical to explain the variation between the failed bills and those that progress from the winnowing stage.            "
"7","Legislative process textbooks are the only existing sources that directly address the winnowing question. These sources note the steep drop‐off in bills early in the process and emphasize as well the importance of sponsors and committee chairs in deciding which legislation will move forward (Jones 1982; Mikva and Saris 1983; Oleszek 1996; Rieselbach 1995; Schneier and Gross 1993). In summary, systematic analysis of winnowing is nascent, but the legislative literature nonetheless suggests several factors that likely affect the broader process and which ought to be incorporated into a theoretical framework: committee chairs, sponsor strategy and institutional position, and governing context.            "
"8","Given the steep drop‐off in bills involved in the winnowing stage, one would expect scholars to have studied this process years ago. Why haven't we studied it systematically? The fact is that there are certain myths and assumptions about the winnowing stage, which may help explain why this question has not received careful scrutiny. One assumption is that most bills are introduced by members for symbolic purposes and are not intended to go anywhere. Another myth is that most bills are concerned with a local area or district rather than the nation as a whole (Oleszek 1996). Introducing a bill is a relatively costless way for a member to take a position on an issue or claim credit for having tried it (Mayhew 1974).            "
"9","A third myth is that the political parties are not as involved in this stage of the process as the subsequent stages because they consider it mundane (perhaps then so should we). Instead, constituency interests and policy subsystems dominate. The parties exert influence in subsequent and more important stages. In his study of member behavior in the House Agriculture Committee, Jones explains: “Party allegiance is an important modifying factor … (but) representatives, whether or not affected by the legislation, tend to support their party's position more as the action moves beyond the basic working level, and most at the final vote” (1961, 367). Finally, scholars may look at the sheer numbers of bills involved (several thousand every two‐year cycle) and say, “it's just too large a process to study.”"
"10","In recent decades, scholars of American politics have demonstrated why myths should be tested empirically. Such received wisdom can simply be wrong or, at a minimum, be open to refinement and conditional effects. For example, strongly held conventional wisdom underpinned societal and scholarly views on such topics as the influence of moneyed interests on roll‐call votes (Hall and Wayman 1990), the impact of divided government on legislative productivity and budgetary conflict (Mayhew 1991), the influence of public approval on presidential success in Congress (Bond and Fleisher 1990; Edwards 1989), and the power of parties in the legislature (Kingdon 1989; Krehbiel 1993). In each of these areas, the conventional wisdom was successfully challenged or modified with political science research and our understanding of American politics was advanced considerably. Similarly, the assumptions about winnowing should not lead us away from its study, but rather make us gravitate toward a careful examination of it.            "
"11","Evidence from my project dispels each of the aforementioned myths. First, the sponsor provides a significant push on the vast majority of bills.5 Second, 80% of bills introduced in Congress are not applicable to just a local area; they are nationally oriented (see also Anderson, Box‐Steffensmeier, and Sinclair‐Chapman 2003, 361). Third, the majority party is charged with the task of the processing of legislation. My in‐depth interviews with practitioners on Capitol Hill suggest that party leaders take it seriously. Finally, with regard to the final reason given above for why scholars have shied away from studying winnowing, the size of an institutional process should not determine whether or not it is studied. It is possible to examine a representative piece of the winnowing stage and generalize to the larger process.            "
"12","In summary, winnowing is an important agenda‐setting process that influences subsequent stages of the legislative process and which is subject to numerous untested assumptions. It is a process that merits systematic scholarly inquiry."
"13","While the enormity of a process should not determine whether or not we study it, the sheer size of winnowing provides an important clue for theorizing. Namely, the huge amount of bill introductions (6,000–8,000 per two‐year cycle), together with the fact that the congressional policy agenda is saturated with existing issues and programs, suggests that the winnowing process is not likely to be fully rational. All bills introduced in a policy area are not carefully compared to one another to determine which ones will move forward. Indeed, my interviews with staff produced many anecdotes along these lines. One committee staffer said: “There is no completely careful, rational process used to decide which bills move forward.” Another offered: “There is no process used to take a look at every bill introduced and decide what to do with it. It just does not work that way” (Staff Interviews 2000).         "
"14","Yet, important political processes are rarely random. To the extent that winnowing is orderly, I posit that it is likely of the “boundedly rational” variety (Simon 1985). Bounded rationality incorporates some traditional rational choice assumptions from economics. For instance, it assumes that political actors are purposive and self‐interested (i.e., sponsors want their bills to move forward). However, the model relaxes a key rational choice assumption—that of actors possessing full information—to allow decision making to reflect the limits of human cognition. The bounded rationality model assumes that decision makers will have limited information because there is not enough time to gather it. Rational decisions are still possible if decision makers use informational shortcuts or “cues” in making decisions.6"
"15","Along these lines, I posit that congressional winnowing is likely a cue‐based decision‐making process, in which the existence of certain cues surrounding bills determines which few will gain attention and consideration. My interviews on Capitol Hill corroborate this assumption. For example, one committee staffer said: “We (the committee leader's staff) look for clues that suggest a bill deserves the committee's attention” (Staff Interviews 2000). The authority to decide on which bills will progress very early in the process is delegated to committee chairs, who are members of the majority party. The key questions are “which cues do committee leaders use and why?”         "
"16","To bring some theoretical clarity to the question, I developed a framework that incorporates the two groups of stakeholders—committee leaders and bill sponsors. Committee leaders, who are agents of their party, fulfill an institutional role and are charged with deciding which few bills will receive attention out of the hundreds introduced in their jurisdictions. The bill sponsors fulfill a representative role and wish to gain attention for their bills in a busy legislative system."
"17","If the majority party drives the process, we expect winnowing decisions to favor the majority party, which controls the institutional levers of power in the committee system (Cox and McCubbins 1993; Rohde 1991). A logical cue in determining bill movement would be the party affiliation of the sponsor. Bills sponsored by majority members would be more likely to move forward than bills sponsored by minority members.7 Member and staff interviews suggest that this is the case. For example, a Republican Senate committee staff director put it this way: “Democratic bills are going nowhere when we have the gavel.” A personal staff member for a powerful Democratic Senator corroborated that comment by saying, “We introduce our bills, but they get entirely ignored.” Along similar lines, a House committee staffer said that: “ Congressional committees can be a lonely place for minority members” (Staff Interviews 2000).8"
"18","As they make decisions about which bills will receive committee attention, committee leaders also look to the activities of sponsors as they push their bills forward. That is, sponsor intensity provides yet another cue for deciding which bills will survive the winnowing process. As one committee staffer put it: “we look for telltale signs, such as how hard the member and staff are working on the bill.” Sponsor activities include calling—or having their staff call—the committee, circulating “Dear Colleague” letters,9 gathering cosponsors, and giving a floor speech about the bill. These all take time and effort. And, sponsors—busy people with too much to do (Hall 1996; Kingdon 1989)—vary widely in the intensity with which they push bills.10"
"19","In an environment where considerably more bills are introduced than congressional institutions can realistically process, every bill introduced in Congress faces a presumption of failure (Krutz, Fleisher, and Bond 1998). The bill sponsor must work hard to overcome this presumption. To be successful, according to one committee staffer, “you have to make a case for your bill and make noise. If you don't, your bill will go unnoticed” (Staff Interviews 2000). In the case examples at the front of the paper above, Congressman Brady appeared to push his bill with more intensity than Congressman Ackerman.         "
"20","Unfortunately, it is not possible to track systematically the issuance of “Dear Colleague” letters on particular bills. Similarly, it is impossible to determine for a large number of bills whether or not member staff contacted the committee. On a more positive note, however, online sources like Congressional Information Service, Inc.'s Congressional Universe and Library of Congress' Thomas include the number of cosponsors gathered for each bill and whether or not the member gave a speech on the floor about the bill. Existing literature on the effects of cosponsorship yields mixed results. Wilson and Young (1997) present evidence that cosponsoring matters little in bill success in the later stages of the process such as floor passage or final passage. Likewise, in their study of stages subsequent to winnowing, Anderson, Box‐Steffensmeier, and Sinclair‐Chapman “find that cosponsorship levels have little to do with whether or not legislators get their bills passed” (2003, 373). However, the Wilson and Young (1997) analysis does suggest a significant effect early in the legislative process by getting a bill noticed in the first place.         "
"21","In summary, when a sponsor pushes with intensity for a bill, the bill is more likely to move forward. More specifically, the more cosponsors gathered by the sponsor of a bill, the more likely the bill is to move forward. Also, the more bipartisan the group of cosponsors for the bill, the more likely it is to move forward. Further, when the sponsor gives remarks about the bill on the chamber floor, the bill is more likely to move forward than if the sponsor does not give remarks.11"
"22","In addition to their intensity, sponsors vary in terms of institutional position, which might have a bearing on whether their bills progress. One such factor is whether or not a sponsor sits on the committee to which a bill is referred. Sponsors who sit on the committee to which the bill is referred stand a better chance of seeing movement than other bills. Committee chairs must build coalitions within their committee regularly to move major pieces of legislation. Hence, as a means of fostering good will, they may be more likely to move the bills sponsored by members from that committee than bills sponsored by other members."
"23","Members also vary in their experience. The length of congressional service may have a positive effect on the likelihood that a bill will emerge. New members are not accustomed to the folkways of the institution and the strategy necessary to move bills (Hall 1996; Mathews 1960; Schiller 1995). As members gain valuable experience, they learn these things and make various contacts on whom to call when later moving their legislation. Therefore, the greater the seniority of the sponsor, the more likely the bill is to move forward.         "
"24","The final element of my framework, which is displayed in Figure 2, is the policy area context. Other legislative decision‐making processes have shown important differences across issue areas. For example, Kingdon (1989) found that House members used a different approach in deciding how to cast a roll‐call vote based on whether the issue was highly salient or off the agenda. With regard to winnowing, the issue area context varies from more consistently salient policy areas (e.g., environmental policy) to subsystem areas that are less consistently salient (e.g., agriculture).12 Additionally, more salient areas tend to have shared issue jurisdictions among congressional committees, whereas subsystems tend to process issues in one committee.         "
"25","                 Winnowing Framework                      "
"26","This issue area context may impact the importance of the cues used in deciding which bills will move forward. For instance, the public policy literature suggests that political parties tend to concentrate more in salient issue areas, such as health care and environmental policy (Bader 1997; Redford 1969). Perhaps, then, the majority party controls winnowing more in these areas than in policy subsystems (like agriculture and reclamation policy). Hence, the sponsor's party affiliation may be a stronger determinant of bill movement in those areas than in subsystem areas. Interviews offer suggestive evidence that this might be the case. A committee staffer offered: “Agriculture issues are not as partisan as many others in the House, but what party you're in can still be a consideration in deciding on bills. But if the ranking minority member asks the chairman to have a hearing on a bill, he'll do it. He wants their votes on other bills. You just don't see that happening in more partisan areas like health care” (Staff Interviews 2000).         "
"27"," Table 1 gives a summary of the independent variables from this framework and their hypothesized direction from the discussions above.         "
"28","The unit of analysis is the bill, and I examine all bills introduced in the House and Senate from 1991 to 1998 in the following issue areas: agriculture, education, environment, health care, and telecommunications. In selecting which policy areas to follow in the study of a particular political phenomenon, it is important to achieve a degree of representativeness. To select issue areas, I utilized a new dataset constructed by Baumgartner and Jones and publicly available online (Center for American Politics and Public Policy, University of Washington 1999). It contains all congressional hearings in the post‐World War II period. Each hearing in the dataset is assigned a specific topic code. In addition to having the number of hearings per issue area (an indicator of salience), Baumgartner and Jones have computed an index of jurisdictional spread for each issue area, which involves determining across how many different committees an issue is considered (Baumgartner, Jones, and MacLeod 2000, 335).            "
"29","The five issue areas were chosen to constitute a representative mix of substantive issue types, saliencies, and jurisdictional arrangements. Agriculture and education feature lower saliency on Capitol Hill (fewer hearings) and activity within mostly one committee. In contrast, environmental and health care policy are of higher saliency (many more hearings), and both issues span the jurisdiction of numerous committees. Telecommunications policy holds a middle position in this continuum.13"
"30","I obtained all of the bills introduced in these five issue areas from 1991 to 1998 from the online service CIS Congressional Universe (Congressional Information Service, Inc. 1999–2000).14 This process yielded 2,658 bills in the House and 1,254 in the Senate. In the House, the bills were referred to a total of 25 different committees. In the Senate, the bills were referred to 18 different committees.            "
"31","The dependent variable is the fate of a bill after referral (formally considered = 1, ignored = 0). Of the 2,658 bills introduced in the House in these five issue areas, about 16% received consideration. Of the 1,254 bills introduced in the Senate, about 23% received consideration. These rates remain at similar levels across the four Congresses and are similar to those reported elsewhere (Oleszek 1996; Ornstein, Mann, and Malbin 2000). In summary, the biggest cut in the legislative process (by far) occurs in this early stage.            "
"32","Party Factors I utilize two variables to tap into institutional factors. The Majority Party Sponsor variable is coded 1 if the sponsor of the bill is a member of the majority party and 0 if a member of the minority party from the CIS website (Congressional Information Service 1999–2000). The Majority Party Leader variable is coded 1 if the bill sponsor is a party leader in the majority party and 0 otherwise.15 Both leader variables were coded from the Almanac of American Politics (Barone and Ujifusa 1991–98). Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for these and all other independent variables.               "
"33","For empirical rigor, I control for preferences. I developed an independent variable from Poole and Rosenthal's dataset (Poole and Rosenthal 2000). These scholars use a nominal three‐step estimation procedure, called NOMINATE, to produce a measure of each member's general political orientation based on individual positions in a spatial dimension (Poole and Rosenthal 1997). NOMINATE data have certain advantages over other proxies for preferences. While interest group ideology scores are based on a few observations selected by a biased group, NOMINATE data are based on all nonunanimous roll calls, which explains more variance than the other scores and contains no political bias. However, one challenge of using these measures as proxies for ideological preferences is the fact that they are based on public roll‐call behavior. Hence, other factors besides ideology might affect roll‐call voting, including constituency and partisanship. This scenario makes it even harder to find party effects independent from preferences. If such party effects are supported, they will be all the more robust.               "
"34","There are choices of NOMINATE data based on whether one is comparing Members of Congress with one another in space (W NOMINATE) or across time (DW‐NOMINATE). My preference variables all tap into the distance between the sponsor and other members in the particular Congress where a bill is considered. Hence, I use W NOMINATE scores, which provide scores for each member per Congress and thus provide more variance.16 Like other analysts (e.g., Hager and Talbert 2000; Schickler 2000), I use the member coordinates from the first dimension (additional dimensions are available but explain little variance). These member coordinates are on a metric scale from −1 to 1. The Distance from Sponsor to Committee Chair is the absolute value of the distance from the bill sponsor to the chair of the committee to which the bill is referred. For the 35% of House bills and 2% of Senate bills that are multiply referred, I use the first committee. Wilson and Young similarly used the first committee in their study of cosponsorship (1997). I coded the committee of referral from the CIS website (Congressional Information Service, Inc. 1999–2000) and determined the chair from the Almanac of American Politics (Barone and Ujifusa 1991–98).               "
"35","The activities and characteristics of the sponsor may affect the fate of legislation. I developed such five variables. In addition to the Number of Cosponsors variable, I created a variable that taps into the partisan diversity of the cosponsors on a given bill. Both of these variables were coded from the CIS website. The Percentage of Cosponsors in One Party variable ranges from 50 (half of cosponsors from each party) to 100 (all cosponsors from one party). The means for these variables are 17.73 cosponsors and 87.9% of cosponsors in one party in the House and 5.5 and 88.2 in the Senate, respectively. For bills on which there were no cosponsors, the case takes a value of 100 because only one party (the sponsor's) has formally signed onto the bill.17 The Floor Speech variable is a dummy variable coded 1 if a speech was given by the sponsor on the floor and 0 otherwise (from the CIS website). In cases where the bill received attention, the bill was coded a 1 only if a speech was given prior to formal consideration in committee. Sponsors gave a floor speech on 33% of the House bills and 81% of the Senate bills. This disparity in floor speeches makes some sense given the challenging nature of gaining floor access in the House compared to the Senate.               "
"36","The Sponsor on Committee variable measures whether (coded 1) or not (coded 0) the sponsor sits on the committee where the bill is referred, which I coded from the Almanac of American Politics (Barone and Ujifusa 1991–98). In cases where the bill was referred to more than one committee (35% of bills in the House, 2% of Senate bills), I followed Wilson and Young (1997) in coding the variable to show whether the sponsor sits on the first committee. The sponsor occupied the committee on 37% of House bills and 47% of Senate bills. The Seniority in Chamber variable is the number of years the member has served in their chamber since their first election year (Barone and Ujifusa 1991–98). The mean seniority for House sponsors is 9.7 years and for Senate sponsors, about 11 years.               "
"37","I also feature a control for whether (coded 1) or not (coded 0) the bill was a presidential draft.18 The president is the country's most visible legislative entrepreneur, with many resources to call on in pushing bills. These include a legislative liaison staff and the opportunity to focus attention on proposals. Hence, the expectation is that presidential bills have a better chance of surviving the winnowing process than other bills. However, Peterson's (1990) study of the fate of presidential proposals in Congress demonstrates that a sizeable proportion is entirely ignored, especially in times of divided party control of the presidency and Congress. I coded this variable by examining legislative summaries in annual editions of Congressional Quarterly Almanac (Congressional Quarterly, Inc. 1992–99) and presidential addresses in the Presidential Papers (U.S. Government Printing Office 1992–99).               "
"38","In addition to the variables above, I added a control for timing. In a two‐year Congress, sponsors may be more likely successfully to push bills in some periods of time than in others. There is a consistent pattern to congressional business. More hearings are conducted in the first session of a Congress (Baumgartner, Jones, and Rosenstiehl 1996) and more statute making occurs in the second year (Jones et al. 1995). The last few weeks of the second session constitute a legislative free‐for‐all. Thus, legislation introduced earlier in a Congress may stand a better chance of moving forward than legislation introduced later. In an examination of the Kansas legislature, Loomis (1994) found that there were periods of time advantageous for pushing legislation; the worst time to push bills was near the end. Therefore, the earlier a bill is introduced in a Congress, the more likely it is to move forward. The Timing variable measures the point in time when the bill is introduced, specifically consisting of the number of days left in the two‐year Congress (Library of Congress 1999–2000). The mean for this variable is 257 days in the House and 256 days in the Senate.               "
"39","In terms of a multivariate technique, I wanted to have the tightest fit possible between the substantive model and the statistical model. The basic winnowing decision (attention or not) is a binary choice, which suggests that an MLE technique such as logit or probit is appropriate. But there is more to it than that. My theoretical framework shown in Figure 2 implicitly suggests heteroskedasticity. The basic model of winnowing is a combination of leader and sponsor factors. I overlay the issue area context with this basic model. The issue context predicts how well the leader and sponsor factors work. In salient areas of nationally oriented policy, partisan cues will be stronger. In quieter milieus (i.e., agriculture) and on localistic policy, the partisan cues will be weaker, a point supported by interview evidence. In statistical terms, there will be a tighter fit for the core variables (less error variance) in former areas and a looser fit (more error variance) in the latter. In summary, there will be heteroskedastic error variance in the winnowing model due to the differing influence of the factors owing to issue context.            "
"40","It is especially important to address heteroskedasticity in binary choice models because if present, it can lead to inconsistent and inefficient estimates. Therefore, if heteroskedasticity is suspected in a probit model, it must be tested for and modeled if we expect to obtain consistent estimates. Hence, I test the winnowing expectations using the heteroskedastic probit technique, which is like a standard probit model except that, in addition to the basic model, there is a separate equation to model the error variance (that is, the errors in prediction). The technique also provides a direct test for the existence of heteroskedasticity. By using the attributes of the issue area (i.e., the salience) to help model the error variance, I can produce unbiased estimates and improve my ability to explain winnowing. I utilize three variables in the error variance model—one that captures whether the bill is local or national in scope,19 a second for the salience of the issue area, and a third for the jurisdictional spread of the issue area.            "
"41","One other statistical issue is important to mention. My data are time‐series cross‐sectional—one big data‐set with observations from all of the four Congresses “pooled” together. It is, however, cross‐sectionally dominant. The probit technique I use assumes temporal independence. As recommended by Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998), I “took time seriously” to make sure that my findings were not the spurious result of hidden time variation. I checked for this by introducing a dummy variable for each Congress. I found that no one Congress of the four was significantly independent from the others.            "
"42"," Table 3 presents the results of the heteroskedastic probit model of winnowing in the House from 1991 to 1998. First, the goodness‐of‐fit test examines the null hypothesis that the coefficients in the model are equal to zero. We see the heteroskedastic probit model is statistically significantly better than the null model. More interesting, the heteroskedasticity test examines the zero restrictions on the error variance coefficients imposed by the probit model compared to the heteroskedastic probit model. The probit model assumes no heteroskedasticity; the heteroskedastic probit model allows the researcher to model the variance. There is a statistically significant improvement. So, the heteroskedastic probit model is preferred, specifically its treatment of the variance.         "
"43","The winnowing choice model is presented in the upper part of the table. The results generally support the expectations of my theoretical framework. There is an effect of party factors, even in the presence of a strong control for preferences. Majority party members and especially leaders are more likely to see their bills move forward than minority members. There is also an effect of sponsor factors, both in terms of sponsor intensity and sponsor position in the institution. The harder the sponsor pushes, the more likely a bill is to progress. More senior members are more likely to successfully push bills forward than junior members. And, a sponsor is significantly more likely to see their bill progress if they sit on the committee to which it is referred."
"44","However, the control for presidential bills falls well short of standard levels of statistical significance. This finding is counter to what I expected, given the resources at a president's disposal for pushing legislation, and lends tentative support to Peterson's (1990) finding that many presidential proposals don't see the light of day on Capitol Hill in eras of divided party control (three of the four Congresses under study featured divided government). The controls for ideological proximity of the sponsor to the committee chair and timing are also significant in the anticipated direction.         "
"45","The second part of the heteroskedastic probit model estimates the error variance in the winnowing choice portion of the model. Considering the national scope variable first, we see that the error variance increases for locally oriented bills. That is, the winnowing outcomes of local bills are harder to explain (there is a larger error variance) due to the fact that many of the factors involved in the winnowing model (i.e., partisanship) work better on nationally oriented legislation. Likewise, at the context level, the variance model also shows that the quieter is the issue area (i.e., subsystems), the larger is the error variance. In other words, winnowing outcomes are harder to explain in subsystem areas than in more salient issue areas. The issue area fragmentation variable suggests that error variance is larger in issue areas that span multiple committees than in issue areas with a more concentrated jurisdiction. This finding makes some sense because the more jurisdictions involved, the larger the number of potential factors in determining any one winnowing outcome."
"46"," Table 4 presents the results of the Senate analysis. The model again works well overall and the method is appropriate given the existence of heteroskedasticity as indicated by the test statistic. The results largely mirror the House results, with the exception of a few caveats. First of all, whether or not one is a majority party leader matters in the House, but falls short of significance in the Senate. Given the individualistic nature of the Senate, this finding is commonsensical. A majority of members can run things in the House. The Senate, in contrast, is a place where individual members can call the shots at times. The importance of a floor speech to legislative progression appears less robust in the Senate than the House. This finding suggests that a floor speech, perhaps owing to the limited floor access available to House members, is a more important commodity in the House than in the Senate. Finally, the ideological control (distance from sponsor to committee chair) falls well short of significance in the Senate, while proving more helpful in a statistical sense in the House analysis above.         "
"47"," Table 5 shows substantive impact of the significant variables, since coefficients are difficult to interpret and compare in probit analysis. These figures allow further demarcation between the chambers and more precise valuation of which factors drive the process. Leader factors and sponsor intensity and position impact the likelihood of bill progression. Cosponsoring is important in both chambers, though more so in the Senate. This finding for cosponsorship is consistent with Wilson and Young's analysis of committee attention (1997). However, it runs counter to their analysis of subsequent legislative stages and to recent work by Anderson, Box‐Steffensmeier, and Sinclair‐Chapman (2003) on stages subsequent to winnowing.         "
"48","We also see more evidence that a floor speech by the sponsor about the bill has more substantive impact in the House than the Senate. Giving a speech improves the odds of legislative progression by 16% in the House, while the same strategy in the Senate improves the odds only 8% (half as much). When the sponsor sits on the committee where the bill is referred, this improves the odds of the bill moving forward by 22% in the House and 23% in the Senate. Finally, seniority has a substantive impact in both chambers, though the influence is much greater in the House. Still, seniority does matter in the Senate, consistent with recent findings by Schiller (1995) and Hall (1996), and contrary to Sinclair's argument that seniority matters little in the contemporary Senate (1989).         "
"49","In concluding, I shall focus on three main points. First, winnowing is an important decision process that we need to understand. It is where the biggest cut is made in the population of bills. Moreover, the players (that is, the sponsors and leaders and their staff) care about it. My project provides one of the first systematic looks at this process. Second, my theoretical framework and supporting evidence provide clarity to an otherwise gigantic and enormously complex process—a black box of sorts. By examining the two groups of stakeholders (leaders and sponsors) and their varying issue contexts, we gain a better understanding of why some bills emerge while most do not. There appears to be a degree of order, which many would say is a good thing, but it is not entirely rational either—it appears to be based on cues or signals à la Simon's bounded rationality. The analysis also produced some interesting and surprising findings. For example, seniority matters in the Senate, a chamber that many have argued has become a highly individualized institution where freshman no longer respect their elders (Sinclair 1989). And, presidential bills don't receive the deference we might expect given the resources available to the executive. Several other factors appear to matter more in the winnowing process than whether or not the bill is from the president.         "
"50","Third, my study suggests certain normative implications. For instance, this analysis supports the idea that effort matters. The degree of intensity of a sponsor in pushing their bill is important in determining which bills move forward. In other words, if you work hard, you can get results. It is not just who you know. The activities of strategic politicians breathe life into representative institutions; hence, this finding was encouraging from the standpoint of democratic theory. There is some order, which helps achieve responsiveness on the part of the institution, yet individual members are allowed some room to be effective in their representative roles. In summary, the findings suggest that the grand legislative tradeoff appears at first glance to be in balance in this institutional process (Shepsle 1988).         "
"51","And finally, this research is but a first step in explaining the logic of winnowing and, as such, many questions remain unanswered. A logical next step is to test more directly which of the currently prominent theories of legislative organization (partisan based, distributive, informational) best explain why the small percentage of bills move onto committee consideration and the others do not. We need to examine with even more zeal questions such as this about the earlier stages of the legislative process to gain a fuller understanding of how policy is made in Congress."
