"1","The policy space is a compact, convex subset of the real line, X⊂R1. The game has three stages and 2 +n players. The first mover is a proposer. The second mover is a confirmer. The third movers are members of an n‐person majority‐rule collective choice body, n≥ 3 and odd‐numbered. Players' preferences are Euclidean, hence single peaked. Ideal points of players are mnemonic: p for the proposer, c for the confirmer, and a for a potential appointee (i.e., a nominee) to the collective choice body. Let Ao={a1, … ,an} represent an ordered set of active appointees' ideal points such that ∀i, j, (i < j) → (ai < aj). Let v=ai denote a specific vacancy created by the ith member's exit from the voting body. Note that when a vacancy v exists—that is, after an exit from Ao occurs—the size of the resulting collective choice body is even‐numbered. The median then becomes an interval , where m̄=a(n−1)/2 and  in the reindexed set of the post‐vacancy body Ae.5 For concreteness, the collective choice body may be either an agency or a court. Anticipating the empirical application, I henceforth refer to the collective choice body as the court and call its members justices.         "
"2","Summarized in Figure 1, the game begins with two exogenous events. First, a status quo q is determined. By assumption, q=a(n+1)/2, the ideal point of the median voter from Ao. I interpret this as the policy inherited from the last‐acting court and assume that it remains in effect until a majority of justices votes to change it. Second, an appointment opportunity arises when a justice i exits the court and thereby causes a vacancy v=ai. Although possible causes of vacancies vary in terms of their endogeneity—e.g., retirement, expiration of staggered terms (for agencies), impeachment, or death—for modeling purposes the vacancy is considered exogenous. Let Ae≡Ao\{v} and note that a vacancy always changes the size of the court from odd to even.         "
"3"," The Appointment Game                      "
"4","The three stages of strategic moves are as follows. The proposer begins by nominating a new justice, a(q, c, p) ∈X. The confirmer makes a binary decision whether to consent to the nomination, k(a; q, c) ∈{0, 1}. Finally, the court—with or without a new appointee—plays a majority‐rule voting game Γ(A; q). If a majority fails to form, the status quo q remains intact. The equilibrium to the game is subgame perfect Nash, following the usual best‐response properties, complicated only slightly by the feature that the third stage is a simple nested game.         "
"5","Because the central intuition can be conveyed most accessibly via examples, I opt for a relatively casual presentation in the main body. The appendix presents formalizations and proofs."
"6","Any vacancy reduces the court's size from an odd to an even number, so the politics of majority rule in an even‐numbered body is an important reference point for players. As illustrated in Figure 2, suppose an n= 5 court has uniformly distributed ideal points over the interval [1, 5]. By assumption, the status quo is q=a3= 3. To begin the game, suppose justice 2 resigns. Now the size of the court is even‐numbered and, therefore, the new median is an interval  bounded by renumbered ideal points a2= and a3=. In such situations, Snyder and Weingast, and Moraski and Shipan, assume that , presumably because if no appointment were successful, players anticipate that the even‐numbered court will negotiate to an outcome that splits the difference between the endpoints of the median interval.6 There are at least two reasons to deviate from this convention, however. First, when regulatory agencies or courts, for whatever reason, change from odd to even status, such changes in size do not trigger automatic policy adjustments. On the contrary, regulatory agencies' rules stay in effect and the body of case law and precedents remains intact until regulators or judges take positive majority actions. Second, splitting the difference may be—but is not in general—the outcome of a future bargaining game among an even number of members.7 More to the point, the split‐the‐difference outcome is not in general the equilibrium outcome of a future voting game. In fact, under conditions of the median voter theory (which hold not only here but also in previous similar models), a simple majority cannot form to enact or enforce any q > = 3. Rather, when q is inherited and when a vacancy such as a2 occurs, q is also the unique outcome of the corresponding voting game with n‐even (see the Lemma in the appendix).         "
"7"," Assumptions about the Status Quo                      "
"8","Benefits in both consistency and simplicity are gained by embedding explicit collective choice. The nonuniqueness of medians in even‐sized courts ceases to be a complicating factor because, for any , all such policies are gridlock points. Consequently, for any vacancy v∈Ao, the inherited status quo q will be the endpoint of the median interval nearest to the vacancy and exactly coincident with q prior to the vacancy. In other words, the inherited status quo point from Ao and the reversion point from Ae are one and the same. This observation is a powerful simplifying device, because now necessary and sufficient conditions for moving the median can be stated simply in terms of the preferences of the proposer and confirmer relative to the status quo, that is, in terms of c, p, and q.         "
"9","Definitions  Using the proposer as a reference point, define a vacancy as proximal if the vacating member's ideal point v lies strictly on the proposer's side of the court's median, and define a vacancy as distal if it is not proximal. Define the confirmer's ideal point c analogously.             "
"10","With these definitions, two short steps lead to the main result."
"11","The opportunity condition  A necessary condition for a policy change is that the vacancy on the court is distal.             "
"12","The logic of the opportunity condition is implicit in Figure 2. If p > q, then the vacancy shown (v= 2) is distal. This implies that there is an opportunity for the proposer to make an appointment a > q who will either become the new median or who will render the renumbered a3= 4 the new median. The same observation holds for v= 1 and v= 3. However, if p < q, the vacancy v= 2 is proximal, so even if the proposer obtains the consent of the confirmer, a new appointee a < q will not change the court's median; it merely reinstates the uniqueness of the original median q= 3.            "
"13","The mutual consent condition  A necessary condition for policy change is that the confirmer's ideal point be proximal.             "
"14","The mutual consent condition is closely related to the classic setter model (Romer and Rosenthal 1978). The proposer is the setter; the appointee is the proposal; the confirmer makes a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it decision on the appointee based on how the appointee's addition to the court affects the court's collective choice. Clearly, if the status quo lies between the confirmer's and proposer's ideal points, and therefore the confirmer is distal, the confirmer rejects any appointee a > q the proposer may wish to make. However, if c is proximal, then the two players have a mutual interest in the direction of policy change, and the degree of change depends on their positions relative to the status quo.            "
"15","Result  The opportunity and mutual consent conditions together are necessary and sufficient for policy change, but the magnitude of such change is constrained by                (ifp < q) or  (ifp > q) as defined by the vacancy‐induced courtAe.            "
"16","The result is illustrated in two figures that differ in only one respect: the first shows a distal vacancy and therefore satisfies the opportunity condition; the second shows a proximal vacancy and therefore does not satisfy the opportunity condition. Each figure fixes p and q with p > q, constrains v≤q or v > q (together covering all possible vacancies), and allows c to vary freely in X. The figures then show the best‐response strategies (a* and k*) and the equilibrium policy outcomes as a function of the confirmer's ideal point c.            "
"17"," Figure 3 (plus its mirror image with p < q) covers all distal vacancies. Four different kinds of strategic interaction may occur. For distal values of c—i.e., when the mutual consent condition fails—an opportunity to move the median does not exist. To make a proposal acceptable to the confirmer, the proposer must compromise with a*=q, which leaves policy unchanged even though the seat is filled. When c crosses the mutual consent threshold in Interval IIa, a new median is appointed and policy correspondingly changes in increments proportional to the distance between the status quo and the confirmer. To be precise, a*= 2c−q is the new median justice and outcome. This is similar to the well‐known solution to the Romer‐Rosenthal model. The stringency of this condition for elasticity of policy with respect to appointees bears emphasis. It would seem to be rare that the pivotal Senator (the counterpart to the confirmer in the model) lies within the narrow gap between the median justice and midpoint between the median and his immediate neighbor.8 Thereafter, in Intervals IIb and III, a change in the confirmer's preferences affects the optimal appointee a* but has only a fixed (in c) and incremental effect, shifting policy up by only .            "
"18","Situations are simpler when vacancies are proximal as in Figure 4. In Interval I when the confirmer is distal, equilibrium behavior is exactly as shown in Figure 3 and described above. The proposer accommodates, and the confirmer consents. In Intervals II and III, behavior is also analytically identical in Figures 3 and 4, but in the latter case the behavior ceases to have policy consequences, because the opportunity condition is no longer met. A proximal vacancy at best allows the proposer to maintain the status of the existing median, not to move it. Therefore, the graph of outcomes is flat.            "
"19"," Equilibrium When a Vacancy Is Proximal (v > q)                         "
"20","The overall substantive implication of the result is striking, particularly when compared to the dire protestations of recent appointees' opponents among Senators, op‐ed columnists, and legal scholars.9 Suppose, conservatively, that proximal and distal vacancies are equally likely, and that, independently, proximal confirmers are twice as likely as distal confirmers (so that conditions are, if anything, biased in favor of consent or congressional deference to the president). Then the analysis implies that two times out of three , presidential appointees will have no immediate policy consequences.            "
"21","In principle, the model can be used to help understand any multistage collective choice setting in which the final policy maker is a voting body. The U.S. Supreme Court surely meets these qualifications, but there are several reasons to be skeptical about applying this model of appointments to the Court. Social science and legal research on the Court is unresolved on many of the model's assumptions. Do justices have ideal points? Are they individualistic and ideological utility maximizers in the way researchers tend to portray presidents and legislators? Or, might they instead be more inclined to pursue arguably less crass objectives, such as the consistent application of normative legal theories (e.g., justice, rights, social welfare maximization)? To what extent is it sensible to depict Court decision making as transpiring under an open rule via majority voting? Is it not the case that bargaining, as much as voting, plays a role in Court decision making, if not in a case‐by‐case manner, then at least over time? These are all questions worth more attention than can be devoted to them here. I simply note that, to the extent that they are valid causes for criticism of a Supreme Court application, we should not expect much from empirical analysis. On the other hand, if the model has merit, it should be possible to find some support for the following hypotheses."
"22","                        "
"23"," Systematic pro‐president changes in the Court's median will be confined to appointment years and, within appointment years, to appointments in which vacancies are distal.                   "
"24"," Changes in the Court's median in distal‐vacancy years should be incremental, as calibrated by the average distance between median and median‐adjacent ideal points.                   "
"25"," Because distal but not proximal vacancies induce policy change contrary to prospective retirees' preferences, and to the extent that retirements are strategic, proximal vacancies should be more common than distal vacancies.                   "
"26","To test the hypotheses, I use estimates of U.S. Supreme Court justices' ideal points developed by Martin and Quinn (2002).10 Measurement of justices' preferences and changes in Supreme Court policy is neither straightforward nor without controversy, so I begin with some simple face‐validity checks. Figure 5 plots Courts' estimated medians from 1953 to 1994. Partisan swings are evident; the Court's pivotal member is typically more conservative during Republican administrations than during Democratic administrations. This finding is broadly consistent with Segal, Timpone, and Howard's (2000) hypothesis of presidential‐Court concordance, for which they find support using separate measures for civil liberties and economic preferences.11"
"27"," Supreme Court Medians and Presidential Regimes, 1953–1994                      "
"28","Although Figure 5 provides a modicum of reassurance that the Martin‐Quinn measure is valid, a noteworthy feature of this preliminary finding is that all years are graphed—not just years in which vacancies occurred and appointments were made. Carter, for example, had no opportunities for appointments, yet the Court became consistently, albeit incrementally, less conservative throughout his administration. If, more generally, changes in Court preferences are as likely to track presidential preferences in nonappointment years as in appointment years, then there may be good reasons to question the model. Another validity check, therefore, consists of assessing whether the responsiveness to presidential preferences is greater in years with appointments than in years without appointments. To do this, I define a variable ▵M as the Court median at time t minus the Court median at t− 1, reversing the sign of the variable for Democratic administrations so that the measure reflects the Court's ideological drift toward the president.12 A simple comparison of means of ▵M indicates whether president‐favored changes in medians are larger than in appointment years than in nonappointment years.13 This is indeed the finding. The average shift in the Court median toward the president in nonvacancy years is a negligible .034, while in appointment years it is somewhat larger: .098. This difference is not statistically significant (p= .344), however, and as such suggests that either the move‐the‐median variable is noisy and/or that presidential influence on the Court is negligible both through appointments and otherwise.         "
"29","The critical question, therefore, is whether the refinement in regimes suggested by the move‐the‐median model clarifies otherwise turbid patterns in the data. Two of the three hypotheses provide opportunities to inspect unique and perhaps nonobvious predictions of the move‐the‐median game, while the third hypothesis is less subtle, may be observationally equivalent with other models, and is compatible with casual intuitions about the Court."
"30","Hypothesis 1 gives rise to the most discriminating test. Prior formal theories of appointments imply that successful appointments are policy‐consequential independent of vacancy type. In contrast, my move‐the‐median game predicts that in distal‐vacancy years ▵M will be positive, while in proximal‐vacancy years and in nonappointment years ▵M will be indistinguishable from zero. To test this hypothesis, I define two dummy variables according to whether a Distal or Proximal vacancy occurred. As illustrated above, classification is a simple function of whether the president is a Democrat or Republican and whether the expiring or retiring justice is left or right of the current Court median (including equal to the median in the case of distal vacancies). After such classification, the following regression equation is estimated:            "
"31","Equations 2 and 3 reinforce this key finding. Equation 2 has the same form as Equation 1 except that it allows for fixed effects of presidential regimes. The differences are negligible. Equation 3 excludes nonappointment years and thereby affirms and accentuates the differences in average move‐the‐median effects between proximal‐ (implicitly the constant) and distal‐year appointments.14"
"32","Hypothesis 2 points to a somewhat more subtle test: assessing whether the coefficient β for Distal is approximately of the right magnitude. Recall that the model implies that a distal vacancy is a necessary condition for change but that such change is expected to be incremental because of the ceiling effect imposed by the former median justice's ideological neighbor . But what is meant by incremental? In terms of the theory, incremental is quantified as the distance between the 5th and 6th justices (prior to a vacancy) under Republican presidents, or between the 4th and 5th justices under Democratic presidents. In other words, the model not only implies that changes in the Court's median will be confined to distal‐vacancy years (confirmed in hypothesis 1) but also that the average magnitude of such changes will approach but not exceed this policy distance (hypothesis 2). The average such distance for the 1953–94 period is .389, which, in effect, operationalizes the upper bound of incremental change.15 Finally, the estimates of β= .27 in Table 1 indeed approximate but do not exceed this upper bound and, therefore, are consistent with hypothesis 2.16"
"33","Hypothesis 3 pursues the question of whether justices systematically engage in strategic retirements in a manner consistent with the model. If retirements were not strategic and/or were uncorrelated with factors in the model, we would expect that fewer than half (4/9) of retiring justices would be proximal. If, however, retirements were strategic, then we would expect proximal vacancies to be more common than distal vacancies. That is, distal prospective retirees will tend to defer their resignation until the presidential regime changes, after which their departure from the Court (as newly designated proximal justices) ceases to have immediate policy consequences, while proximal prospective retirees will be inclined to exit when an ideologically like‐minded replacement is possible. The data depart from the random null model in the expected way: somewhat over half (12 of 21) retirees are proximal. This difference in probabilities  is substantively small and not statistically significant, however, so the support for the strategic‐retirements hypothesis is weak.         "
"34","The overwhelming consensus of observers of the Supreme Court is that appointments have important consequences for public policy, at least in the aggregate and over the long term. Consensus is not to be found, however, about the consequences of individual appointments in the short term. Some theories almost surely overstate the elasticity of policy to appointees by neglecting to account for the fact that any given appointee is but one of several downstream policy makers, or by implying that a change in policy coincides with any appointment opportunity. Other theories almost surely overstate policy gridlock, suggesting that failed appointments are much more likely than two centuries of U.S. history suggests. This article has attempted to address the need for a more refined, tractable, and testable theory that focuses on conditions under which individual appointees are and are not confirmed, and on conditions under which successful appointments do and do not have immediate policy consequences."
"35","The move‐the‐median model of appointments specifies two intuitive conditions for policy change. First, the vacancy on the collective choice body must be distal from the proposer's most preferred policy; this condition creates an opportunity for a policy‐changing appointment. Second, the pivotal confirmer's ideal point must be proximal to the proposer's ideal point; this condition defines the mutual consent required for seizing the opportunity. The somewhat less intuitive insight that emerges from the model is that the average appointment opportunity is likely not to be of great consequence for immediate policy outcomes. The reasons are that most of the time at least one necessary condition for moving the median fails, and, even when both conditions are met, the magnitude of change is tightly constrained by the median voter's nearest ideological neighbor.         "
"36","Data on approximately four decades of U.S. Supreme Court appointments weakly support the strategic retirements hypothesis and strongly corroborate both of the unique and less obvious predictions of the model. Some appointments matter, but not all of them do. The ones that theoretically should matter tend to be the ones that empirically do matter. Finally, when the proper conditions for moving the median are met, the degree to which such movement occurs is approximately what theory suggests it ought to be: not much."
"37","An important qualification is this: not much immediately. The simple one‐period move‐the‐median model of appointments speaks most directly to incremental, short‐term variation, but it would be a mistake to reason that, because the average appointment has a small bearing on policy, the overall long‐term effects of such appointments are likewise small. Viewed dynamically, the move‐the‐median framework also illustrates how an equilibrium appointment to fill a proximal vacancy, which is not immediately policy‐consequential, nevertheless sets up larger‐than‐otherwise‐possible change when the next distal vacancy occurs. History has a way of producing medium‐term partisan presidential regimes that confer opportunities for multiple consecutive appointments for one party's presidents. Democrats Roosevelt and Truman, for example, made 13 consecutive appointments; Republicans Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and the elder Bush made 10 consecutive appointments. Consequently, the model not only clarifies the short‐term ramifications of the politics of appointments but also squares with the consensus that Supreme Court appointments have important long‐term consequences for public policy.
