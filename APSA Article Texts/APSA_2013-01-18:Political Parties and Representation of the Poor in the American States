"1","To test these hypotheses, we capitalize on the variation in party positioning and income‐based political characteristics across the states. We combine new data on state parties’ ideological positioning with estimates of income‐group opinion for 47 states, excluding Nebraska because of its nonpartisan legislature and both Alaska and Hawaii due to their exclusion from the survey data used to estimate mass opinion and behavior."
"2","To estimate opinion across income groups, we use the National Annenberg Election Survey (see Romer et al. 2006); its large sample of the 2000 presidential electorate consists of 58,373 respondents, including a substantial number from each of the 48 continental states. A drawback to the Annenberg survey data is that respondents were interviewed via a set of rolling, cross‐sectional surveys in which different sets of questions were asked of each cross‐section. To generate measures of policy preferences across these surveys, we pooled the cross‐sectional surveys for 2000 into one dataset and identified 13 common policy items in the survey—each asking for respondents’ preferences across a range of policy areas (for items, see online Appendix A).            "
"3","Three of these 13 items were asked on all the surveys, while the other 10 were asked in approximately half of the surveys. As a result, we used respondents’ answers on the questions they were asked to estimate their responses to other policy items. We imputed these missing data using multiple chained equations (see Royston 2005), which maximized similarities in responses across items. As a result, these data are best suited to capturing a latent construct (e.g., social policy liberalism) rather than precise views on a particular issue (i.e., the death penalty or abortion). In fact, simulations designed to assess the accuracy of these imputations (described in online Appendix B) indicate that the scales created using imputed values correlate very highly with measures based on full information (r = .97 for economic issues and .96 for social issues).            "
"4","To generate the opinion scales used in these analyses, we factor analyzed two subsets of items. The first was a set of seven items related to economic policy issues (e.g., tax policy, health care, and social welfare programs). Then, we factor analyzed six items tapping social policy issues (e.g., abortion, death penalty, gay rights, and school prayer). Information on these items and their factor loadings are presented in online Appendix A. Most critical to this analysis, both factor models explained the vast majority (>97%) of the variance among items, with eigenvalues well above 1 (and eigenvalues for both of the second factors below .50). Both scales are coded so that higher values indicate more liberal policy positions."
"5","To estimate the policy preferences of different income groups across states, we needed to collapse the nine‐category income variable used by the Annenberg survey into fewer categories. We classified respondents based on their relative income within the state, dividing each state electorate into thirds. Adopting a method used by Bhatti and Erikson (2011), when an income category spanned one of the percentile thresholds (the 33rd or 66th percentile), we assigned those respondents the mean opinion score for that income response category in that state. We then assigned that group's mean opinion score proportionally to the low, middle, or high third. For example, in Missouri there were 319 respondents who reported income between $50,000 and $75,000. This group spanned the 66 percentile cut‐off between the middle and upper third—ranging from the 59.4 to 78.4 percentile of Missouri's income distribution. Therefore, we assigned 34.7% of this group's respondents (and mean opinion score) to Missouri's middle‐income third and 65.3% to the state's high‐income third.            "
"6","Equally sized groups within each state were an important component of our modeling strategy because we wanted to test a proportional notion of equality of representation in which each income group is influential in proportion to its size, rather than resources. This measurement strategy also allowed us to take a simple average of the policy preferences of each third in each state rather than requiring the use of weights to adjust for varying sizes of each group in each state. However, we acknowledge that there are other ways to divide state electorates by income. Online Appendix C provides a comparison of our measures with those generated using two alternative methods: scaled scores (as employed by Bartels 2008) and predicted values (as used by Gilens 2005, 2012). As shown in the appendix, these approaches generate estimates of states’ low‐, middle‐, and income‐third opinion that are highly correlated (r > .95 across each method) with those generated from the pooled‐thirds approach we employ.            "
"7","These aggregated preference measures (N = 47 states) are presented in Figure 1, which displays the distribution of preferences of low‐, middle‐, and income‐third constituents across the states. Consistent with previous work, we find different distributions of preferences for the economic (top panel) and social (bottom panel) policy preferences even though both measures are standardized on the same scale (M = 0, sd = 1) at the individual level. In particular, we see a larger income gap in economic policy preferences—with the low‐income group most liberal (M = .16, sd = .12) on these issues, followed by the middle‐income group (M = −.03, sd = .11), and then the relatively more conservative higher‐income group (M = −.18, sd = .12). For social issues, we find the opposite pattern, with the income‐third group being more liberal (M = .03, sd = .22), followed by the middle‐income (M = −.03, sd = .20), and then the more socially conservative low‐income group (M = −.08, sd = .17). Further, the gap between income groups is smaller for social issues than for economic issues; however, the variation across states is larger for social issues than economic issues (consistent with other research; see Ansolabehere, Rodden, and Snyder 2006; Gilens 2009; Rigby & Wright 2011).            "
"8","We define state party ideology as the ideology that emerges from the collective issue stances of the states’ Democratic and Republican candidates. This approach captures the policy positions candidates present to the electorate during the campaigns, which likely carry more force than the seldom‐read official platforms. Further, by using electoral positions—rather than legislative votes—we capture party positions on the same scale across states and chambers, while avoiding state differences in patterns of party control, agenda control, and legislative procedures that could distort ideology measured through roll‐call votes across 94 chambers."
"9","We pooled data gathered by Project Vote Smart, a nonpartisan voter education service that administers the National Political Awareness Test (NPATs) to candidates for federal and state office. We used responses from 18,467 surveys completed by Democratic or Republican candidates for the state legislature, Congress, or governor. By pooling across years, we achieved adequate state samples, which average 373 (sd = 182) and range from 115 in Louisiana to 968 in New Hampshire. Project Vote Smart adapts its surveys for each election cycle, office, and state. Therefore, we needed to extract the overlapping questions across the 255 distinct surveys fielded from 1996 to 2005. We identified 87 items asked to at least half of the party candidates during this time. Missing items were imputed using a process parallel to that used for the public opinion data described above (multiple imputations by chained equations; see online Appendix B for more information on imputation strategy). As with the public opinion measures, a set of simulations found this imputation approach to yield measures that are highly correlated with scales developed from full information (r = .99 for both issue scales)."
"10","To generate measures of candidates’ economic and social policy preferences, we followed the same procedure as undertaken for the public opinion data and factor analyzed subsets of items capturing economic policy issues (25 items related to redistributive tax and spending policies and the social safety net) and social policy issues (20 items related to abortion, gun control, civil rights, and school prayer). The specific items are listed in online Appendix A, along with information on the raw (versus imputed) number of cases and factor loadings. Beginning with the economic policy items, we factor analyzed the 25 items and extracted the first factor, which explained 78% of the variance (eigenvalue = 7.03). Predicted values were generated for each candidate‐year and rescaled so that higher values indicated greater liberalism on economic policy issues. Candidates varied from −3.42 to 1.92 on this scale; not surprisingly, Democrats had higher scores (M = .65, sd = .61) than did Republicans (M = −.66, sd = .81). We then factor analyzed the 20 social policy items and extracted the first factor, which explained 65% of the variance (eigenvalue = 4.53), and coded the scores so that higher values indicated more liberal positions on social policy issues. The individual scores varied from −2.01 to 1.89, with Democratic candidates more liberal (M = .55, sd = .77) than Republicans (M = −.57, sd = .74). From these individual‐level scores, we estimated each state party's liberalism by taking the mean response of candidates for each party in the state. However, we also generated weighted scores that adjusted individual‐level responses for patterns of nonresponse in the Project Vote Smart data.1"
"11","Our approach to assessing policy responsiveness is in the correlation tradition established by Miller and Stokes (1963) and adapted in many studies of representation since. We measure how well the relative liberalism‐conservatism of the public, or income groups within the public, covary with the economic and social issue stances of the state Democratic and Republican parties. While this approach has known limitations (Achen 1977; Erikson, Wright, and McIver 1993), it is also the case that given reasonable variance in public preferences, congruence is a necessary condition for policy responsiveness. That is, at a minimum if the parties are responsive to citizen preferences, then more liberal state electorates should also have more liberal parties. Thus, while it is arguably preferable to measure the parties’ stances and the public's preference on the same metric, a great deal can still be learned by assessing patterns of relative congruence. Most importantly, we are able to detect whether parties’ positions vary systematically with the preferences of each income group. If parties are especially sensitive to the preferences of a particular income group, then we would expect cross‐state differences in party positions to most closely track cross‐state differences in that group's policy preferences.2"
"12","Before moving into testing our hypotheses, we examine the positioning of state parties in terms of the average opinion in each state (the mean of all state respondents). These basic relationships are presented in Figure 2. The top scatterplot shows the relationship between parties’ economic policy liberalism and the average public opinion on economic issues. There is little relationship between the two parties on these issues (r = .24), which is primarily due to the absence of a relationship between Democratic party liberalism and public opinion (r = .04). In contrast, Republican parties are more liberal on economic issues when they represent a public more liberal on economic issues (r = .40). The bottom panel presents the same relationships for our measures of social policy liberalism. Here we see a positive relationship between public preferences and both Democratic (r = .83) and Republican (.67) parties’ social policy liberalism. The two parties are correlated at .60 as well.            "
"13","We test for two distinct notions of responsiveness as commonly operationalized in the literature, which we call alignment and influence. Representation as alignment asks, how well do the state parties’ stances on economic and social issues covary with the preferences of each income group? To answer this question, we look at the simple bivariate relationships between each income group's preferences and state party positions. This is the measurement strategy used by Soroka and Wlezien (2008) and others, who tend to find less evidence of differential responsiveness across income groups—concluding that the overlap in preferences among the rich and poor provides a “natural limit” on the level of political inequality that can occur. In contrast, conceptualizing representation as influence raises the bar, asking: whose preferences are responded to on issues in which lower‐, middle‐, and high‐income constituents disagree? We test for influence with the partial association between each income group's opinion and each party's position, controlling for the preferences of the other two income groups in the state. It is this second notion of responsiveness employed by Bartels (2008) and most others who have identified unequal responsiveness to various groups.         "
"14","Rather than choosing between these two modeling approaches, we compare the results from models using each operationalization. This allows us to capture a potential midlevel of responsiveness in which a group's preferences are included in party positions (alignment) even if their preferences are ignored when these preferences diverge from those of the other income groups in the state (influence). Teasing apart these distinct notions of responsiveness is particularly important for contextualizing differential responsiveness within our current public opinion landscape, in which the preference gap between the rich and poor varies in size across specific policy issues, as well as across and within states (Gelman et al. 2008; Gilens 2009; Rigby and Wright 2011; Soroka and Wlezien 2008). Rather than attributing parties’ responsiveness to overlapping preferences as evidence of equality in responsiveness (as did Soroka and Wlezien 2008) or excluding this alignment from an assessment of differential responsiveness (as did Bartels 2008), we wish to explore and identify these alternative forms of responsiveness to the rich versus the poor.         "
"15","We tested our hypotheses in cross‐sectional OLS models that regressed the policy liberalism of each party (separately) on the preferences of each income‐third in the state. We adopt a reduced‐form model since our aim is not to maximize the explained variance in party positions but rather to assess the fit between the preferences of different income groups and how the parties align. Including a range of state‐level economic, demographic, and political variables to these models would add to our ability to explain party positions but would seriously limit our ability to assess the relative alignment and influence of income groups."
"16","Table 1 presents the results of these OLS models for both economic policy positions (top) and social policy positions (bottom). Beginning with Democratic parties, we find little alignment between party positions and the opinion of either low‐income or middle‐income citizens in the state. Instead, the economic platforms of Democratic parties are only aligned with the preferences of those in the top income third in the state (b = .53, se = .21). Not surprisingly, this result persists in Model 4 (b = .80, se = .28), which tests for the independent influence of each group's preferences on the issues in which income groups disagree.         "
"17","In contrast, Republican parties’ economic positions exhibit almost parallel associations for both the middle‐income (b = .80, se = .29) and income‐third (b = .82, se = .27) groups—but again, no bivariate association for the low‐income group. These alignment models provide some insight into why we find no independent influence in Model 4, where we test for the independent influence of each group's opinion over and above the other two groups. Since the economic campaign appeals made by Republican parties vary with both the opinion of the middle‐ and upper‐income groups, neither of these two coefficients is significant in Model 4. However, the joint significance of these two coefficients is significant (F = 3.79, p < .05), as are individual coefficients for middle‐ and income‐third opinion (but never low income) in models that omit either middle‐ or income‐third opinion."
"18","We see a different pattern for social policy issues. Both parties exhibit alignment with the preferences of all three income groups when considered alone (coefficients ranging from .84 to 1.52). However, in Model 4, which tests for the independent influence of each income group, we see clear evidence of differential responsiveness in which one income group exhibits greater influence. As expected, when the income groups disagree on social issues, Democratic parties are most responsive to the distinct preferences of the high‐income group (b = 1.19, se = .29), while Republican parties are most aligned with the distinct preferences of the middle‐income group (b = 1.09, se = .38)."
"19","These findings are brought together in Figure 3, which presents the predicted first difference for a one‐unit change in each group's opinion. It illustrates how, for economic policy issues (top panel), party positions are aligned with the preferences of their more advantaged constituents—with Democrats exhibiting differential responsiveness skewed toward the wealthy and Republicans aligned jointly with the preferences held by the middle‐ and high‐income thirds. In contrast, for social issues, both parties align with the preferences all three income groups; this is largely a function of the greater agreement on social issues among those in the same state (see Figure 1). Yet, even for social issues, we see that when the social policy preferences of income groups diverge, it is only the more advantaged constituents who exert independent influence (high‐income group for Democrats and middle‐income group for Republicans). In terms of the poor, their preferences align only on social issues—and only when they overlap with the preferences of the middle‐ or high‐income groups to whom parties are more likely to attend.         "
"20","As shown in online Appendix C, we reestimated these models using different methods of dividing respondents into income thirds within the state. We found quite consistent results for all patterns of alignment, as well as the influence of the middle‐income group on Republicans’ social policy liberalism and the high‐income group on Democratic economic policy liberalism. What differed was only the relative influence of the middle‐ versus high‐income group for Republican economic positions (jointly significant in two of the three models) and for Democratic social policy liberalism (skew toward the rich in two of the three models). Under no specification did the lower‐income third exert influence on either party."
"21","We now turn to examining our third hypothesis: that income inequality would serve to further skew responsiveness toward the wealthy in states with more concentrated wealth. We ask whether responsiveness to the wealthy is greater in states with more unequal income distributions. We use a cross‐sectional measure of income inequality based on market‐income, pretax, and transfer family income drawn from the 1997–2005 March Current Population Surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This takes the form of a gini coefficient (M = .50, sd = .03) capturing how far the state's income distribution deviates from equality."
"22","Table 2 presents the estimated models, which add the measure of income inequality along with three interaction terms (income inequality X each group's opinion). For both economic and social policy issues, the responsiveness of Democratic parties did vary by the level of income inequality in the states, with greater income inequality associated with even more of a skew in responsiveness toward the upper‐income third. But, the responsiveness of Republican parties did not vary by income inequality for economic issues or for social issues. These findings were robust to the alternative measures of income groups (see Appendix C). To illustrate the role of income inequality in moderating the responsiveness of Democratic parties, we used the models in Table 2 to estimate Democratic party liberalism on both economic and social policy issues in a state with low (one standard deviation below the mean) versus high (one standard deviation above) income inequality. These predicted values are presented in Figure 4. The pattern indicates there may well be a basis for concerns that heightened economic inequality exacerbates representational inequalities among the state Democratic parties. Importantly, in states with more equal distributions of income, we find no evidence of differential responsiveness across income groups. However, in states with higher levels of income inequality, Democratic party positions were even more highly skewed toward the rich.         "
"23","Before concluding, we undertook a set of sensitivity analyses to address two common rationales for differential responsiveness at this early electoral stage of the policymaking process. First, it may be that our focus on both winning and losing candidates exacerbated differential responsiveness since winners may be more aligned with constituent opinion than those who lose their election. Second, parties may simply be paying more attention to voters, rather than nonvoters in their state; and since we know that voters are not a random subset of the population but tend to be wealthier and better educated (Leighley and Nagler 2007; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993), greater attention to voters may explain responsiveness to high‐income constituents.            "
"24","To conduct these sensitivity tests, we restricted the data used to (a) only those candidates who won their election and (b) only those respondents to the Annenberg survey who reported voting “always” or “often.” We then created parallel measures of Democratic and Republican Party positions, as well as the average policy liberalism for those in the bottom, middle, and top third of income among voters in the state. Online Appendix D presents the results of these models, which are consistent with the earlier results, leading us to conclude that neither patterns of electoral success nor income bias in voting explains the differential responsiveness we identify. Yet, we note two consistent patterns in terms of the magnitude of coefficients across models, which suggest potential mechanisms. First, we found larger coefficients when considering only candidates who won their election, indicating even greater skew in responsiveness among successful candidates. Second, when we considered parties’ responsiveness to the opinion of the lowest, middle, and highest third of voters, we found smaller coefficients, suggesting that a portion of the differential responsiveness we identified stems from parties overlooking low‐income constituents who are unlikely to vote. These findings are only suggestive, but do highlight areas for future study."
"25","Motivated by recent research that has found skewed responsiveness among the policy outcomes of our political process, this article asked whether a similar bias shapes the policy positions taken by political parties much earlier in the policymaking process. Since parties serve to aggregate diverse interests and function as mechanisms linking public opinion and policy outputs, any income‐based bias in this process would raise both empirical and normative concerns, as well as identify a likely source of political inequality in the later, and more consequential, policy formation stage."
"26","In assessing the equality of this process, we distinguished between two forms of responsiveness: alignment and influence, with alignment simply capturing whether parties align with the preferences of each income group (considered alone) and influence requiring a higher bar in which parties respond to the preferences of one income group even when their preferences diverge from those of the other two groups. However, on economic policy issues, this distinction was unnecessary since neither party even aligned with the preferences of their low‐income constituents. More responsiveness to the poor was identified on social policy issues—with both parties aligned with their social policy preferences. Yet, once we accounted for the social policy preferences of those in the top two‐thirds of the income distribution, we found no independent influence of the social policy preferences of the poor. As a result, the representation of low‐income citizens only occurs when their preferences happen to concur with the preferences of their economic betters. When their preferences diverge, those preferences seem to be left off of the active agenda—even this early in the policymaking process.         "
"27","We are limited here in our ability to explain why or how the preferences of the poor are overlooked. This is clearly an important question for future work. In particular, we hope to tease apart the degree to which party elites are aware of the preferences of the poor—intentionally overlooking them in favor of wealthier constituents—or whether these patterns can be explained by less stable attitude formation and fewer efforts to communicate those preferences among the poor. Indeed, we found slightly lower reliabilities among the poor in the individual‐level data we used to estimate each group's policy preferences. Yet, it is not clear whether this reflects measurement errors, which may be cancelled out via the aggregation process, or a true difference in preference stability that could shape the process of representation.3 The lack of responsiveness to the poor does not necessarily mean that both parties cater to the narrow self‐interests of the rich. Indeed, when we examine differences between the state parties, it is clear that the Democrats are a good deal more liberal and many of their policies favor redistribution and regulations that would improve the material circumstances of those with lower incomes. So while the Democratic parties in the states do tend to stand for economic policies benefiting the “have nots,” the extent of that stance tends to be sharply circumscribed by preferences among more affluent citizens.         "
"28","Does this make any difference? Normatively, it is less than satisfying to find that the least fortunate in society have no independent voice in the formulation of party platforms. Materially, while there is overlap across the states in the preferences of income groups, it is also clear (see Figure 1) that the poor (and even the middle‐income group) prefer more liberal economic policies than do those in the upper‐income third. Therefore, we suspect that if the preferences of each income group were accorded equal weight, both parties’ stances on economic issues would shift to the left. And accordingly, although to a smaller degree, Democratic parties’ stances on social issues would shift rightward.         "
"29","Our findings also shed light on our general understanding of political representation. These patterns are consistent with our notion of resource constraints on parties. With Republicans enjoying a wealthier constituency base, they have more leeway to make broader campaign appeals aligned with the preferences of the middle‐income group, which includes the median voter. As expected, this appeal to the middle is evident for Republican parties on social issues, while Republican economic positions are skewed toward the middle‐ and high‐income groups. In contrast, the resource demands of today's campaigns do more to constrain Democratic parties, whose natural constituencies are less affluent; thus, Democrats must find a way to appeal to the policy priorities of potential donors. Indeed, we find that Democratic parties are most aligned with the preferences of the top third of the income distribution on both economic and social issues. This responsiveness to the affluent is most pronounced in states with greater income inequality where, by definition, economic resources (including those that can be used to finance campaigns) are most concentrated in the fewest hands—serving to exacerbate any income bias in representation at this early, formative stage of the policymaking process."
