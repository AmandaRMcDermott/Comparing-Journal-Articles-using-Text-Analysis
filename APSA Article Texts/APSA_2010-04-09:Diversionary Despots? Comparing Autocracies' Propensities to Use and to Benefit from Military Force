"1","Two decades ago, Levy (1989) argued that we must use reciprocal analyses to provide a full rendering of states' diversionary behavior. Few, however, have heeded Levy's call. To date, only three articles have employed reciprocal estimates of diversionary force and its domestic causes, and each focuses solely on the United States (DeRouen 2000; DeRouen and Peake 2002; Wood 2009). This reluctance to adopt reciprocal methods has, unfortunately, seriously limited the explanatory power of diversionary studies.         "
"2","Reciprocal analyses are important because they provide an answer to one of the most vexing criticisms of large N research on diversionary force. Detractors have long held that large N studies can never prove that domestic political or economic considerations are foremost in leaders' minds when they dispatch troops overseas. Leaders may be responding to a range of external stimuli that we cannot fully account for with control variables in large N studies, and, of course, we will never be able to read decision makers' minds (see Hendrickson 2002, 31; Levy 1989). If a proportion of the military operations we presume to be diversionary are actually taken for legitimate strategic or geopolitical reasons, our statistical results may be both spurious and misleading.         "
"3","Reciprocal models begin the process of resolving this theoretical and methodological quandary by determining whether or not the use of interstate military force generates domestic political and economic benefits for actors. If reciprocal estimates show that leaders reap domestic rewards from using military force abroad, they provide greater confidence that any statistical correlations discovered between domestic explanatory variables and the dependent variable external military force represent diversionary behavior. If using military force overseas creates or exacerbates domestic problems, doubt is cast on the contention that many, if not most, of these military operations were initiated for diversionary reasons. Decision makers may certainly miscalculate and implement policies that aggravate rather than mollify domestic problems, but for them to do so consistently with the same policy option—interstate military force—across the wide range of countries and the long time spans typical of large N, cross‐national research seems highly improbable. Reciprocal models thus not only have commonly acknowledged methodological advantages, but they can provide well‐defined, concrete advances to theory as well."
"4","We refer to an autocracy as “the rule of a person or a group of persons who arrogate to themselves and monopolize power in the state, exercising it without restraint” (Neumann 1957, 161). This definition envisages a number of autocratic subtypes. The most widely used subtype classification has been advanced by Geddes (1999). Geddes (1999) distinguishes among three types of autocratic regimes: single‐party regimes, military regimes, and personalist regimes (see also Brooker 2000; Peceny, Beer, and Sanchez‐Terry 2002). She defines single‐party regimes as “regimes in which the party has some influence over policy, controls most access to political power and government jobs, and has functioning local level organizations” (1999, 20). In single‐party regimes, the party basically defines political life in the country by controlling access to decision‐making authority and providing essential services. Although there are exceptions like Mexico, Senegal, and Taiwan, most single‐party states have been socialist regimes. Military regimes are governed by “an officer or retired officer, with the support of the military establishment and some routine mechanism for high‐level officers to influence policy choice and appointments” (20). Geddes does not consider states that have experienced military rule for fewer than three years to be military regimes, but rather views these countries to be going through indeterminate periods “… of holding customary rules in temporary abeyance … or transition from one set of rules to the next” (18). Finally, personalist regimes are characterized by leaders who “have consolidated control over policy and recruitment in [their] own hands” (20). These leaders often begin their rule as chief executives in military or single‐party regimes, but at some point they sweep challengers within these organizations aside (Geddes 2006, 138). Of course, not all autocracies fit neatly into Geddes's three‐part classification, as she recognizes. She terms regimes with traits from two or more categories hybrids. Examples include General Zia's Pakistan that exhibited characteristics of both institutionalized military rule and personalism and Egypt and Burundi during different periods. Hybrids constitute slightly less than 25% of her sample.         "
"5"," Lai and Slater (2006) offer a different classification scheme for authoritarian governments.1 Their infrastructural power perspective maintains that authoritarian systems should be distinguished by the instruments of power that autocrats use to retain office rather than the number and the professions of the individuals who participate in the decision‐making process. According to Lai and Slater, authoritarian governments ultimately rely on one of two instruments of power to rule their societies: the military or a single, cohesive political party that penetrates important segments of society. They consequently code most of Geddes's personalist regimes as military regimes, since more often than not personalist leaders rely on the repressive capacity of the military to remain in office (Lai and Slater 2006, 120, footnote 9). Although Lai and Slater's infrastructural power formulation has merit, we use Geddes's trichotomous framework when crafting our theory to provide a more nuanced understanding of autocratic diversionary behavior. Geddes's typology also has the advantage of being used in the majority of the studies of comparative autocratic conflict behavior to date, making our findings more broadly comparable to extant research.2"
"6"," Lai and Slater's (2006) analysis is also the only study in the comparative autocratic conflict literature grounded in diversionary logic. Lai and Slater maintain that single‐party regimes use external military force significantly less often than military regimes because they have more stable governments. Single‐party regimes tend to develop an all‐encompassing ideology to legitimize their rule, which rests on public acceptance or at least acquiescence rather than brute force. They are typically governed by cohesive political elites who operate within broadly accepted hierarchies. Importantly, the military's subservient status within the hierarchy is almost always well established.3 In fact, the party is usually intricately connected to nearly all important societal organizations in single‐party regimes, and it often proves adept at mobilizing the population to further the goals of the regime with mass political organizations (see Kasza 1995). This stability and broad legitimacy has important implications for the foreign policy of single‐party regimes. It tends to allow their leaders to take foreign policy decisions on their merits, not because they need to win over domestic groups.         "
"7","In contrast, military regimes “rarely elaborate full‐blown regime ideologies to justify long‐term authoritarian rule …[and, as a result] they tend to enjoy less of a cushion of ideological legitimacy to help them weather … tough times” (Lai and Slater 2006, 116–17). The type of strong‐armed rule and repression that military governments rely on frequently produces brittle regimes. Splintering at the elite level is not uncommon in these states, with different sets of military officers attempting to wrest power away from competitors (Danopoulos 1988; Wintrobe 1990). According to the infrastructural power perspective, it is the inherent frailty of military governments that compels the officers in charge to “… use foreign policy to secure loyalty and bolster legitimacy” (Lai and Slater 2006, 117). One way they can do this is by dispatching troops across borders for diversionary purposes. Argentina's occupation of the Falklands/Malvinas islands offers a classic example of a military regime using interstate military force for reasons of domestic political survival (Levy and Vakili 1992).         "
"8","Although diversionary arguments are not advanced in other empirical studies comparing autocratic regimes' conflict behavior, these studies produce empirical results consistent with Lai and Slater's outcomes.4 Single‐party regimes are found to be less prone to use military force than other autocratic regime types, particularly personalist regimes (Peceny, Beer, and Sanchez‐Terry 2002; Peceny and Beer 2003; Peceny and Butler 2004).5 Political incentive theory suggests that when it comes to diversionary force, the opposite pattern should hold. Single‐party regimes should be more prone to use diversionary force than personalist regimes or military regimes, though expectations for the latter are less certain. The following section details political incentive theory's perspective.         "
"9","The benchmark assumption of political incentive theory is that political leaders want above all else to stay in office (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003). They thus continually strive to satisfy the domestic constituencies that help to keep them in power. To facilitate cross‐national generalization, the political incentive approach separates these core domestic constituencies into two groups: selectorates and winning coalitions. Selectorates are individuals who can theoretically be part of the leadership selection process. They are “roughly the citizenry” of a country, all of whom stand some chance, albeit sometimes a relatively small chance, of influencing the choice of a new leader (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 40). Winning coalitions are the subset of the selectorate “who control enough … instruments of power to keep the leader in office” (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 8). The selectorate thus matches conventional conceptions of a country's mass population reasonably well, while winning coalitions are consistent with common ideas about ruling coalitions and other elites in society. For reasons of parsimony, we focus on variations in winning‐coalition size when discussing political incentive theory and autocratic diversion.         "
"10","Political incentive theory postulates that as winning coalitions grow larger, the delivery of public goods becomes more important for leaders' survival in office. As a consequence, leaders who rely on large winning coalitions must perform in office. They must implement successful policies and deliver public goods to members of the winning coalition, which often includes large segments of the country's population. The same does not hold for leaders who preside over small winning coalitions. These actors often have little reason to propose policies that deliver public goods. They can retain office simply by ensuring that a steady flow of private goods placates members of the winning coalition. Leaders who rely on small coalitions can consequently oversee disastrous policies like sharp economic downturns and war defeats without excessive fear of losing office (see Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 440). So long as a disproportionate share of the country's wealth is being channeled to elites in the ruling coalition, they will continue to hold power.         "
"11","Of the three types of autocracies included in Geddes's (1999) classification, single‐party regimes tend to have the largest winning coalitions (Geddes 2006, 16; Peceny and Butler 2004, 574). In these regimes, leaders' tenure depends in one way or another on party members, in particular party elites (Purcell 1973). Personalist regimes should have the smallest winning coalitions, typically a tiny cadre of fiercely loyal cronies. Autocrats in military regimes, who depend to varying degrees on the military high command, often have winning coalitions of mixed sizes. Given Geddes's (1999) categorization scheme, though, they are unlikely to be either as small as those found in personalist regimes or as large as in most single‐party states.         "
"12","If this characterization is correct, one should anticipate a much higher quality and quantity of public goods provided by single‐party regimes than personalist regimes, with the performance of military regimes resting somewhere in the middle. There is a good deal of evidence suggesting that this is the case. Even a casual glance at the basic public infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and transportation systems provided by single‐party regimes in Vietnam, China, Singapore, and PRI Mexico in comparison to Mobutu's Zaire, Somoza's Nicaragua, Niyazov's Turkmenistan, or Mugabe's Zimbabwe underscores the point. It is also not a stretch to claim that, in general, the health care and educational services provided by single‐party regimes also tend to be superior to those found in personalist regimes (Wintrobe 1990, 866).         "
"13","Of course, our interest is not in autocracies' provision of public goods. It is the propensities different types of autocratic regimes have for using diversionary force. Political incentive theory puts forth a simple calculation that explains why single‐party regimes should have the greatest proclivity to divert among autocratic regimes. The argument centers on the amount of domestic political and economic resources leaders have to help them retain office, R, and the amount they routinely need to spend to maintain the support of their winning coalitions, M. The greater the difference between R and M, the easier it is for leaders to weather difficult political or economic times. Consequently, leaders who operate with only a slight margin of difference between R and M—and thus have relatively few spare domestic resources readily available for political survival—will inevitably look to foreign policy for options that might help them maintain power when domestic political or economic challenges arise. As the policy availability argument common in diversionary literature (Brulé 2006; Pickering and Kisangani 2005) contends, diversionary military force may often be one of the options they consider.         "
"14","In political incentive theory, the key consideration determining the difference between R and M, (R‐M), is the size of the state's winning coalition. When the winning coalition is relatively large, leaders must spend a significant proportion of their available resources to retain their supporters' loyalty (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 277–80). The provision of public goods does not come cheap, and leaders with comparatively large winning coalitions must do everything in their power to “deliver the goods” to the widest possible cross‐sections of their winning coalitions by implementing successful policies. Leaders with small winning coalitions have a much smaller outlay of M, since they only need to line the pockets of a small cadre of sycophants.         "
"15","Following this logic, one can expect personalist leaders to accumulate much larger stockpiles of the resources necessary for political survival than leaders in single‐party states. When times turn tough because of economic or policy failure, personalist leaders should consequently have greater ability to weather the storm without fear of losing office than their counterparts in single‐party regimes (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 280). They can tap their presumably massive public and private accounts to increase the flow of private goods to winning‐coalition members and to fund increased repression of elite or public dissidents.6 Since leaders of single‐party states will have comparatively fewer extra resources (M) for either of these survival strategies, buying off cronies or repression, they should be more likely to contemplate the use of diversionary force to rally the winning coalition behind them. This is why Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003, 219) conclude that “large coalition systems … provide incentives for leaders to pick on much smaller rival states …[and] to be bullies.”7"
"16","Of course, in making comparisons across autocratic regimes, we should not minimize the resources that leaders in single‐party states have for political survival. Among a large number of potential examples, Tiananmen Square should serve as a cautionary tale for those peddling ideas about the weakness of single‐party regimes. We have no doubt that the leaderships of single‐party governments will do everything in their power to hold on to office during times of domestic difficulty. They will hide or alter economic statistics (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003), restrict media freedom, flood the media with misleading propaganda (Purcell 1973), and redouble their efforts to win over key elites with private goods. Although we are not aware of any systematic studies of leadership survival rates in single‐party autocracies during times of domestic difficulty, we would be surprised if they were low.         "
"17","Even if this is true, however, we have to remember that the contribution of political incentive theory is its ability to highlight how institutional differences across regimes present leaders with different sets of policy options. Leaders in personalist and single‐party regimes may both have a high probability of withstanding domestic challenges to their leadership, but they may rely on a completely different array of survival tools. While personalist leaders can easily crack down on or buy off dissidents, single‐party leaders may have to search for major policy successes to boost their support within their large winning coalitions. A limited, diversionary use of military force abroad may provide just such a boost."
"18","Since winning coalitions in military regimes vary in size, the officers leading military governments can be expected to employ blends of the survival tools employed by personalist and single‐party leaders. Our first hypothesis is thus:"
"19","                        "
"20"," H1. Single‐party regimes are more prone to use diversionary force than military regimes and especially personalist regimes.                  "
"21"," Table 1 summarizes how our first hypothesis based on political incentive theory differs from the expectations of the infrastructural power approach. Political incentive theory also goes beyond extant theory on autocratic diversion in one additional, empirically testable way. It implies that diversionary force will “pay off” for single‐party regimes more often than it does for other autocracies, providing another layer of explanation of autocratic diversionary proclivities.         "
"22","The political incentive approach implies that positive or negative feedback loops may emerge when diversionary force either helps to ameliorate domestic problems or fails to do so, respectively. Leaders may thus be more prone to use diversionary force if it “worked” for their predecessors, allowing them to retain office in bad domestic times by blunting elite dissent and/or stimulating the economy. The past success of military force may even create an ingrained policy prescription that leaders instinctively turn to when they face domestic dissent.8 Similarly, if diversionary force does not work, or even makes the domestic political situation worse, leaders may be hesitant to consider this survival tool.         "
"23","Political incentive theory suggests that leaders in single‐party regimes stand a good chance of achieving the domestic outcomes they seek from diversion because they tend to select the timing and the targets for diversionary military action carefully (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 215–72). Given the large size of their winning coalitions, single‐party leaders must implement policies that have a reasonably high probability of success to ensure that their winning coalitions remain loyal. This will be especially the case for policy as visible as the use of external military force.9 Single‐party leaders know that few things will cause support within their winning coalitions to erode as rapidly as a failed military mission abroad (see Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 273–326). They can thus be expected to be extremely cautious when contemplating the use of diversionary military force. They can also be expected to do everything in their power to ensure that military missions succeed once they are launched. As Bueno de Mesquita et al. observe, “all else being equal, the larger the Wi[winning coalition], the harder nation i tries…” (2003, 237) to prevail in military operations abroad.         "
"24","Since personalist leaders' political fates are rarely tied to the outcomes of military missions, they have less incentive to be careful when selecting the targets or the timing of their military operations. They also have less reason to try hard to ensure that military missions succeed. They thus tend to adopt a more risk‐acceptant approach to the use of interstate military force than counterparts in single‐party states.10 High levels of risk acceptance do not necessarily mean that personalist military ventures will produce bad outcomes, however. Risky military operations may succeed spectacularly in some instances but fail miserably in others. Such wide variance stands in contrast to the generally positive outcomes that should be generated by cautious, determined single‐party leaders.11"
"25","Military regimes, again, can be expected to have mixed records of producing positive domestic outcomes when they use military force abroad because the size of their winning coalitions vary. Considering the role that winning‐coalition size may play in the domestic success or failure of diversionary operations, our second hypothesis is:"
"26","                        "
"27"," H2. Single‐party regimes are more likely than military regimes and especially personalist regimes to achieve positive domestic outcomes, such as decreased political unrest and improved economic performance, from the use of external military force.                  "
"28","The unit of analysis in our TSCS data of 140 autocracies from 1950 to 2005 is the state‐year. Our reciprocal framework requires that we analyze a number of different dependent variables that also serve as independent variables in subsequent estimates. Each dependent variable requires a distinct set of control variables as well."
"29"," Foreign Military Force. The International Military Intervention (IMI) data collection is used to operationalize foreign military force. IMI records all verifiable cases when national “troops or forces … move into the territory … of another country” to pursue political, economic, strategic, or humanitarian objectives (Kisangani and Pickering 2008; Pearson and Baumann 1993, 5). In essence, it catalogs episodes when national military personnel are purposefully dispatched into other sovereign states, no matter how large or small the mission. IMI thus considers foreign military intervention to be first and foremost a policy tool, which is the result of a policy decision by national leaders (among others, see Krain 2005). We create the variable military intervention with IMI to enumerate the number of times that a state unilaterally intervenes abroad in a calendar year.12Fordham and Sarver (2001), among others, emphasize the importance of using state‐level data such as IMI to test state‐level theories like diversionary theory.            "
"30","Our sample includes 392 military interventions launched by autocracies from 1950 to 2005, a number comparable to the 417 interventions initiated by democracies over that time period. Unlike the data on democracies, however, autocratic interventionary behavior is not skewed to a small number of powerful states. While Britain, France, and the United States account for nearly 30% of democratic interventions, no single state is responsible for more than 6% of autocratic interventions."
"31"," Domestic Political Unrest. Most past research on popular support and diversionary force focuses on advanced industrial democracies and uses public opinion polling data to operationalize both mass (selectorate) and elite (winning coalition) support for the government. Since our study concentrates on autocracies where polls are seldom taken, we use the five forms of overt political dissatisfaction cataloged by Banks (2007) to operationalize mass and elite unrest. Government crises and purges are combined to produce our measure of elite unrest. General strikes, antigovernment demonstrations, and riots are combined to create mass unrest.13 The correlation between these two forms of domestic protest is low (.22) and is not statistically significant at the .10 level. We assume that since elites in winning coalitions are autocratic leaders' most important constituency, rising levels of elite unrest should be more likely to lead to diversionary force in single‐party and perhaps military regimes than rising levels of mass unrest.            "
"32"," Domestic Economic Performance. Many empirical studies of diversion utilize a “misery index” that combines unemployment and inflation to operationalize domestic economic difficulty, while others use economic growth as measured by annual changes in real GDP. Since reliable unemployment data are not available for most of the states in our sample, we rely on the other two measures. For economic growth, we use the real annual percentage change in GDP using data from Heston, Summers, and Aten (2006). Inflation is operationally defined as annual changes in the price index using data from the International Monetary Fund (1983, 2006).            "
"33"," Military Intervention as the Dependent Variable. Our “Military Intervention Model” includes three control variables found in the literature to be positively correlated with military intervention: strategic rivalry, subsystem crisis, and bad neighborhood. Each provides a measure of opportunities that arise in the international environment for leaders to use foreign military force. Colaresi, Rasler, and Thompson (2007) define strategic rivals as states that are sufficiently threatening competitors to qualify as enemies. Strategic rivalry counts the number of strategic rivalries a state is involved in during a given year. A prominent alternative to the strategic rivalry collection, the enduring rivalry data, was substituted for the Colaresi, Rasler, and Thompson (2007) data in supplemental analyses.14 The outcomes were substantively similar. Subsystem crisis counts the total number of crises in an actor's local subsystem annually using data from the International Crisis Behavior Project (2008) data collection. Bad neighborhood measures a similar but statistically uncorrelated phenomenon (see Sambanis 2001). It counts the number of armed conflicts ongoing in neighboring states using Major Episodes of Political Violence Project data (2009).            "
"34"," Political Unrest as the Dependent Variable. Our estimates of elite and mass unrest include economic growth, inflation, and ethnic fractionalization as control variables. Following extant literature, we expect that economic growth will be negatively correlated with political unrest, while inflation and ethnic fractionalization will be positively correlated with it (Ellingsen 2000; Przeworski et al. 2000).15 Ethnic fractionalization data are from an update of Fearon and Laitin (2003).            "
"35"," Economic Growth and Inflation as Dependent Variables. Our estimates of economic growth include the most prominent control variable in the economic literature on the subject. Investment as a percentage of GDP (a measure of capital) should be positively correlated with economic growth (Barro and Sala‐I‐Martin 1995).16 Data on investment are from Heston, Summers, and Aten (2006). In our estimate of inflation, economic growth is our lone control variable because of the mitigating impact it is presumed to have on prices.            "
"36","We use a set of three simultaneous equations to estimate the reciprocal relationships that exist among diversionary force and its domestic consequences. The first is our military intervention model, in which military intervention is the dependent variable. The second is our political unrest model. It encompasses estimates for both elite unrest and mass unrest. The third is our economic performance model. It again has two sets of estimates, one for economic growth and another for inflation. The models can be summarized as follows:               "
"37","This system can be reformulated in matrix format as follows:                "
"38","Two methodological issues must be addressed before we begin our empirical analysis. The first issue is multicollinearity, which is of special concern given our use of two variables to measure domestic unrest (elite and mass unrest) and domestic economic performance (economic growth and inflation). Variance inflation factor (VIF) tests were performed to determine if multicollinearity was a problem in our estimates. No single model had a mean VIF approaching 10, the standard threshold indicating the presence of multicollinearity. In fact, the largest mean VIF recorded in an estimate was 1.11 (in the intervention model estimate of all autocracies). Individual explanatory variables also had VIFs well below 2 in all of our models, offering further evidence that multicollinearity does not have a pernicious effect on our estimates."
"39","The second issue concerns the stationarity of our dependent variables, an important subject in time‐series models. Following Oh (1996), Wu (1996), and others, we use panel‐data unit root tests to determine whether the variables in our three models are stationary. Since our data are unbalanced, the best such test is the IPS test (Im, Pesaran, and Shin 2003).17 Although IPS results across our three autocratic regime types are somewhat mixed, the null hypothesis of unit roots could not be rejected for most of our dependent variables at the .05 level of significance.18 This suggests that many of our dependent variables are not stationary and that standard regression estimates using raw or level data may produce spurious results. One method is particularly well suited to overcome this problem in simultaneous models, the GMM.            "
"40","We use dynamic panel GMM (see Arellano and Bond 1991; Hansen 1982; Ogaki 1993) to exploit the linear moment restrictions implied when using nonstationary panel data.19 The advantage of the GMM estimator (Π matrix estimator) is that it allows the transformation of the variables to achieve orthogonality between the country fixed effects and the regressors. Thus, in the absence of autocorrelation, the Π matrix GMM estimator is efficient and consistent (Baltagi 2005). This method requires that the variables be measured as deviations from their period means and equations be estimated in differenced form. Equation (4) summarizing our model can thus be rewritten:               "
"41","The consistency of our estimation depends on the stochastic properties of the error term ω given in Equation (5) or ωit=ϕi+λt+ξit, especially if they are correlated with the regressors or if the error terms are serially correlated. If our independent variables (variables on the right hand of our system of equations) are orthogonal to ωit, a generalized least‐squares estimator will be consistent. If, on the other hand, these variables are strictly exogenous with respect to λt but not to ϕi, a within‐group estimator (or fixed effects) will be consistent.            "
"42","Given the nature of our three models, we do not believe that orthogonality with ωit and either weak or strong exogeneity hold. Besides the endogeneity of our dependent variables political (i.e., elite and mass) unrest, economic growth, and military intervention, the need to include lagged dependent variables in our models ensures that the orthogonality condition will not be satisfied even for the fixed‐effect estimator, whether it is estimated in levels or in differences. Measuring the variables as deviations from their period means and first differencing them removes ϕi and λt from the error term. Serial correlation is also removed by differencing and by lagging our endogenous variables.            "
"43","GMM also has a number of advantages over other estimators. First, for reciprocal estimates, GMM is a dynamic, instrumental variable estimator equivalent to an efficient three‐stage least squares (3SLQ) estimator (Baltagi 2005). Second, one does not have to specify distributional assumptions, such as normal errors, with GMM. GMM thus provides a unifying framework for reciprocal analyses of most common dependent variables, continuous, dichotomous, or count (see note 19 and Windmeijer 2008). Third, GMM allows researchers to specify a set of moments that they believe will be robust to any misspecifications of the statistical model (Baltagi 2005, 150–61). This is especially beneficial because, as Hansen (1982) has shown, all instrumental variable estimators with TSCS data can be cast as GMM estimators, no matter whether the models are linear or nonlinear.            "
"44","To cross‐check our results, we estimate single equation estimates of our non‐differenced (i.e., level) data measuring our variables as deviations from their means, a procedure that is equivalent to a GMM model without first‐differencing. By definition, these models suffer from autocorrelated errors and provide inefficient estimates. They nonetheless produce results that are substantively the same as our GMM models, thereby lending greater confidence to our outcomes.20 Note also that because we first difference variables and include lagged values for some endogenous variables, three years are dropped from our sample. We end up with usable observations from 1953 to 2005 for our 140 autocracies.            "
"45"," Table 2 and subsequent tables show that all the statistical models fit the data well as indicated by highly significant Wald χ2s. Table 2 also provides first‐ and second‐order correlations (m1 and m2) suggesting that our estimates are consistent. Although m1 shows the presence of first‐order serial correlation, the test statistic for second‐order serial correlation (m2) based on residuals from the first‐differenced equation is not statistically significant. It thus fails to reject the null hypothesis of no second‐order autocorrelation. As Arellano and Bond (1991) point out, only the presence of second‐order serial correlation in the differenced residuals implies that the estimates are inconsistent; the existence of first‐order serial correlation does not.21 Sargan tests for overidentifying restrictions, not reported for space constraints, indicate that these restrictions are correct and that the set of instruments used to estimate the equation is the correct one.         "
"46"," Table 2 displays the results for the dependent variable military intervention (equation 1). The first column provides results for all autocracies included in Geddes's (1999) collection, both pure forms and hybrids. The outcomes correspond with conventional views of autocratic diversion as well as political incentive theory. Autocratic leaders, like their democratic counterparts, are more prone to use force abroad when unrest emerges among elites than when it surfaces among the masses (see Morgan and Bickers 1992). Given that elites in winning coalitions are the single most important constituency sustaining an autocrat's rule, this is not surprising. In contrast, variations in economic growth rates do not seem to influence autocrats' propensity to use force abroad. Perhaps this is because declining growth rates are not a political challenge to many autocrats, who can continue to line the pockets of cronies even as the overall economy slows. However, rising inflation reduces the probability they will dispatch troops overseas. Inflation may thus cause some level of dissent within the elite, particularly if it constricts their purchasing power. Our control variables show that autocrats tend to respond to the external stimuli of strategic rivalry and subsystem crises, but living in a bad neighborhood does not appear to increase their propensity to use interstate force.

"47","While our general model of autocracies matches the expectations of the political incentive approach, our estimates of specific autocratic types in columns 2, 3, and 4 of Table 2 do not. Column 2 indicates that single‐party regimes use diversionary force a short time after elite unrest begins to rise, while column 3 suggests that contemporaneous elite unrest compels personalist regimes to use military force. Military regimes seem to dispatch troops abroad when they encounter elite unrest as well, although this estimate is barely statistically significant at the .10 level in column 4.22 Military regimes are also the only government type that seems to divert in response to economic troubles, in this case rising inflation. These outcomes challenge H1, which presumes that single‐party regimes are more prone to use diversionary force than either personalist or military regimes. One of the main benefits of reciprocal estimates, however, is their ability to shed new light on relationships in subsequent models. We must consequently turn to our reciprocal estimates before rendering a verdict on H1 and political incentive theory.         "
"48","Our control variables are consistent across the three regime types in Table 2. The opportunities to use force provided by subsystemic crises and by living in a bad neighborhood do not appear to compel the three types of autocracies examined here to use interstate military force. All three types are, however, highly prone to use military force against strategic rivals.         "
"49"," Table 3 presents findings for our domestic unrest models (equation 2). It thus provides our first empirical cut at H2, which states that single‐party regimes will be more likely to garner positive domestic outcomes from the use of military force abroad than other autocracies. Column 1 in Table 3, however, indicates that external military intervention generates no positive benefits within single‐party leaders' most important constituency, elites in their winning coalitions. They nonetheless fare considerably better than counterparts in personalist regimes. As column 2 shows, elite unrest increases significantly both contemporaneously and the year after a military intervention in personalist regimes. Column 3 indicates that military intervention has no impact on elite unrest in military regimes.         "
"50","The negative ramifications that follow personalist uses of force are not unanticipated. They underscore the risk‐acceptant behavior political incentive theory ascribes to personalist leaders. This type of dictator seems to use military force in diversionary situations (Table 2, column 3) despite the fact that it clearly has not “worked” for their predecessors or perhaps even for themselves. In fact, their domestic positions are made significantly worse by the use of force abroad since it generates substantial unrest within their core constituency. This raises the question of whether personalist uses of force can properly be called diversionary. The use of diversionary force usually implies that a relatively sophisticated political calculation has been made to dispatch troops abroad with the goal of holding on to political power. In autocratic regimes, this means launching military operations with the hope that they will quell dissent within the autocrat's ruling coalition (see Table 2). Given the results in Table 3, it is hard to argue that personalist leaders make such calculations when they send troops abroad. If they do, they consistently do so poorly.         "
"51"," Table 3 also provides results for mass unrest. Military intervention does not improve mass support in either single‐party or personalist regimes, and it tends to spark increased mass unrest in military regimes. Again, this result casts some initial doubt on Table 2's finding that military regimes use diversionary force. If military operations abroad consistently increase domestic unrest instead of acting as a salve that helps to heal domestic political wounds, it may be necessary to reexamine claims that these missions were launched for diversionary purposes.         "
"52","Control variables largely behave as expected in Table 3. Economic growth suppresses elite unrest while inflation increases both elite and mass unrest. We presumed that ethnic fractionalization would tend to foster domestic unrest, but the direction of this estimate is negative in five of six models. It does not, however, reach statistical significance.         "
"53"," Table 4 presents outcomes for our economic performance models (equation 3). Only one independent variable is statistically significant in the table. Contemporaneous military intervention has a negative impact on economic growth in military regimes, a finding that calls the correlation between domestic problems and the initiation of external intervention by military regimes further into question. Our single control variable in the growth model, investment, is positive and statistically significant as expected. In the price model, economic growth is in the correct direction in two of the three models, and it is statistically significant in one.         "
"54","In this article, we analyze the diversionary proclivities of leaders in different types of authoritarian regimes. We do so by examining the reciprocal relationships that exist between the external use of force and its domestic causes in three distinct types of autocracies. Using the GMM method, we present properly identified models that reveal some interdependent causal relationships among political unrest, economic difficulties, and the use of military force. Our results suggest that the consensus that has emerged in recent comparative studies of autocratic conflict behavior on the relative peacefulness of single‐party regimes may require modification for the 1950–2005 time period (Lai and Slater 2006; Peceny, Beer, and Sanchez‐Terry 2002; Peceny and Butler 2004). At the same time, our findings do not provide unequivocal support for hypotheses generated from political incentive theory.23"
"55","As political incentive theory suggests, leaders in single‐party regimes seem prone to use external military force when they face the type of domestic political challenge that most threatens their rule, rising levels of elite unrest. Contrary to political incentive theory and Hypothesis 1, we also find that personalist and military regimes use military force overseas when elite unrest increases. Such results from the unidirectional components of our analyses are best understood in the context of our full reciprocal models, however. Leaders in single‐party regimes do not reap domestic political rewards in the form of reduced levels of elite unrest when they use military force abroad. They nonetheless fare considerably better than their counterparts in personalist and military regimes. External military force used by personalist regimes significantly increases levels of elite unrest in these countries, while military regimes' military operations generate substantial levels of mass unrest and dampen economic growth. These outcomes raise questions about how many of the military missions in our sample of personalist and military regimes truly were motivated by diversionary goals."
"56","We thus find that a more nuanced understanding of the diversionary proclivities of different autocratic regimes emerges when reciprocal models are employed. The best evidence of diversionary behavior found in our reciprocal models is that for single‐party regimes, the actors that political incentive theory suggests should have the greatest penchant for diversion. Political incentive theory's contention that single‐party regimes' diversionary activities will tend to pay off domestically requires modification, however. Perhaps even leaders who rule over large winning coalitions and hence must perform in office may not be able to control all of the uncertainties involved when military force is used abroad. Despite their best efforts, they may not be able to select operations and targets that ensure success and a high probability of accruing domestic political rewards."
"57","The limits of political incentive theory have to be placed in the context of the infrastructural power perspective's performance. When the more complete information provided by reciprocal models is examined, the infrastructural perspective's contention that personalist and military regimes are the autocratic states most prone to divert rings hollow. Even more importantly, our results challenge the basic premise of the infrastructural power approach. The infrastructural approach argues that personalist and military regimes should be analyzed as a single category, since they both tend to rely on the power of the military to retain office. We find, however, that both the propensity to divert and to benefit domestically from the use of military force varies significantly across personalist and military regimes. The conceptual distinctions that Geddes (1999) and others make between personalist and military regimes thus appear to have merit when it comes to diversionary behavior.         "
"58","While political incentive theory fits our results best, we believe that one relatively straightforward enhancement will improve its explanatory power. Geddes (2006), Purcell (1973), and others demonstrate that autocratic governments progress through different stages as their tenure lengthens. Early stages are characterized by jockeying for power among elites that dream of building their own personalist regimes. Further volatility may be introduced soon afterward if certain elites try to “decompress” the regime by gradually initiating policies that include broader segments of society (Geddes 2006). An autocratic regime's grip on power, and its institutional contours, are firmly established only when these phases have been successfully navigated. Since these changes have considerable potential to impact a government's propensity to use diversionary force, it seems wise to incorporate the additional theoretical layer of regime age into political incentive theory. This addition should cost little in terms of parsimony, and it holds the potential to expand political incentive theory's explanatory power significantly.         "
"59","Further research on autocratic diversion is obviously necessary. Our findings suggest that future studies should be careful to analytically separate the three forms of autocratic regimes commonly demarcated in the literature. They also demonstrate that future work on the subject would benefit greatly from the use of reciprocal estimates. This study consequently underscores an argument that Levy (1989) advanced two decades ago, but which has received little attention since. Reciprocal models are crucial for diversionary studies for two interrelated reasons. They provide properly specified statistical models, and they significantly improve our ability to comprehend different actors' diversionary behavior in large N studies. Future research should also attempt to expand the temporal scope of studies on autocratic diversion. Our analysis focuses on a period of time when the international system was first bipolar and then briefly unipolar. Studies using different data collections may be able to extend temporal coverage back to the nineteenth century, giving us a better sense of the generalizability of our findings to multipolar and other system settings.24"
"60","Finally, political incentive theory not only appears to provide the most useful theoretical platform for future research on autocratic diversion, but it also may offer the best explanation of autocratic conflict behavior in general. The key insights of the theory largely hold across previous analyses of dyadic autocratic force (see, for example, Peceny and Butler 2004) and our study of autocratic diversion. Because single‐party regimes have comparatively large winning coalitions among authoritarian states, they seem to be the one autocratic regime type that exhibits conflict behavior similar to democracies. This is not only because dyadic relations among single‐party regimes are relatively pacific, as previous research has shown. It is also because leaders in this particular autocratic regime type, like those in democracies (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 236–41), have a proclivity for diversionary force.         "
