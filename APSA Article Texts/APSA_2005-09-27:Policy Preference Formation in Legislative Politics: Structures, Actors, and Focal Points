"1","Two strands of research on the European Parliament have been particularly prominent in the recent past. One focuses on the structure of the political dimensions constitutive of the European Union's political space, the second on voting patterns and voting behavior in the European Parliament."
"2","The first strand is concerned with the question of whether political contestation in the European Union (EU) is based on one, two, or more underlying dimensions (Gabel and Hix 2002; Hix 1999b; Hix and Lord 1997; Hooghe and Marks 1999, 2001; Hooghe, Marks, and Wilson 2002; Marks and Steenbergen 2002; Marks and Wilson 2000). It identifies, emphasizes, and debates the significance and relationship of two: the sovereignty‐integration dimension and the ideological Left‐Right dimension. The sovereignty‐integration dimension implies that the European integration process creates a center‐periphery divide between those actors or groups who see their identity and interests as threatened by the integration process and those whose identity and interests are protected (Hix 1999b). Actors on the first dimension are located on a continuum ranging from less to more integration. The Left‐Right dimension is a summary of two sociopolitical or socioeconomic value dimensions (Finer 1987; Hix 1999b; Inglehart and Flanagan 1987). First, it refers to how far there should be intervention in individual social and political relations for a collective good; second, it refers to how far there should be intervention in individual economic relations. The existence of these two dimensions of EU politics has been confirmed empirically in the positions national parties take toward Europe (Aspinwall 2002; Marks, Wilson, and Ray 2001), in the election manifestos of the European party federations' (Gabel and Hix 2002; Hix 1999b), and in mass attitudes on Europe (Gabel and Anderson 2002).         "
"3","The second strand of literature highlights the increase in ideology‐based party competition in the EP on the basis of these dimensions. While previous research had already suggested that MEPs are more likely to vote along transnational party lines than national lines (Attinà 1990; Brzinski 1995; Hix and Lord 1997; Raunio 1997), recent and more comprehensive roll‐call vote analyses demonstrate that the economic Left‐Right dimension constitutes the primary dimension of politics in the EP. A second dimension is evident to a lesser degree and resembles the sovereignty‐integration dimension (Hix 2001, 2002; Hix, Noury, and Roland 2005; Noury 2002; Noury and Roland 2002). The main conclusion drawn from these analyses is that voting in the parliament is structured primarily along the left‐right dimension of politics and that there is very little variation in this over time or across issue areas.         "
"4","This literature implies that the policy choices made on the basis of the dimensional positions of individual parliamentarians are fixed: ideological positions translate automatically into choices and outcomes. This assumption may be justifiable on the grounds of theoretical parsimony. We should, however, specify under what conditions ideology structures policy choice, and how other structural variables—most importantly constituency interests—factor into this process."
"5","As a theoretical starting point, the decision‐making model advanced here assumes that parliamentarians' normative and cognitive positions are fixed, while their policy positions are latent. In this view, positions on the dominant ideological dimensions become operational only through the process of political contestation (Jones 1994). This approach differentiates between a low‐dimensional ideology and multidimensional policy space (Hinich and Munger 1997), where long‐standing and consistent ideological preferences do not automatically translate into more immediate and inconsistent policy preferences.2 While the former are exogenous to the policymaking process, the latter are endogenous.         "
"6","Matching policy with ideological preferences requires a placement of a given policy issue in the existing ideology space by interpreting the content and perceived consequences of a proposal in reference to its dominant dimensions. Yet, legislators may be confronted with circumstances in which they face a trade‐off between competing ideological preferences (Hinich and Munger 1997, 200), since most political issues are multidimensional in nature (Baumgartner, Jones, and MacLeod 2000, 325). Moreover, any political issue may pitch ideological preferences against the interests of key constituencies, thereby complicating the translation of ideological into policy preferences further. For our understanding of decision making in legislative politics it is, therefore, imperative to identify what determines the formation of policy preferences in the face of this contextual ambiguity. Moreover, it is critical to ask if the interpretation of how a given issue relates to competing ideology dimensions is exogenous or endogenous to the political process.         "
"7","Assuming a dynamic agent‐structure relationship, I introduce a model of policy preference formation in legislative decision making. This model acknowledges that ideology shapes legislative voting, but suggests that this structuring is mediated by factors endogenous to the policy process: ideology impacts voting to the extent that legislative entrepreneurs link general ideological predispositions to specific policy issues through the provision of focal points.3 These focal points are ideas or images that communicate information about the consequences of a given legislative proposal with regard to an individual parliamentary actor's set of cognitive and normative values on the dominant ideology dimensions, or the concerns of key constituencies.         "
"8","Focal points serve as simplifying labels for legislators faced with a large number of decisions on highly specialized and varied subjects. They help resolve conflict between potentially divergent normative and political considerations by emphasizing, classifying, and evaluating specific aspects of the proposal. As concise and memorable decision‐making shortcuts, they reduce the complexity of a given decision‐making process. Focal points thus do not change preferences as such, but shift attention toward specific parts or interpretations of a given policy proposal (Jones 1994). This process may entail a reconsideration of policy preferences at the level of the individual, which may, in turn, become aggregated through the formation of policy coalitions.         "
"9","The idea of strategically providing focal points to affect policy preferences is an example of what Riker (1986, 1990) has termed “heresthetic,” i.e., the attempt to structure the political context in such a way as to move the process of contestation from one to another dimension. According to Riker, actors can introduce new issue dimensions, or dismiss or reinterpret existing ones by “displaying the relevance of a dimension, recalling it from latent storage to the center of psychic attention” (1990, 54). This process restructures the political space from a model where equilibrium is likely to exist to one where it is not (1990, 51). While the concept of heresthetics is quite broad and includes various forms of strategic voting and agenda manipulation (1990, 50–54), the provision of focal points should be conceived of as a very specific mechanism of heresthetics: by shifting attention toward particular aspects of a policy proposal, focal points influence policy makers' perceptions of the relevance and salience of the dominant ideology dimensions. Hence, their introduction structures the political context by affecting the dimensional location of political deliberation and contestation.         "
"10","Moreover, rather than focusing on a policy‐ or issue‐space, the focal‐point model places this process in a lower‐dimensional ideology space. This difference is important because Riker's model has been criticized for failing to identify the constraints on the introduction of new issue dimensions. If each actor has to simply introduce an additional dimension in order to “win,” then why do we not observe the introduction of an infinite number of dimensions on any given issue (Mackie 2003)? Placing the manipulation process in a low‐dimensional ideology space puts a distinct limit on actors' ability to manipulate the dimensional placement of an issue, because focal points must reflect the other legislators' (exogenous) sets of norms and values in order to have an appeal in the first place. Otherwise, they will be rejected by the “receiver.” In this sense, the provision of focal points reflects and is constrained by the existing ideology space: focal points are not “free‐floating.”         "
"11","Nonetheless, the concept of focal points assumes a distinctly strategic element. After all, shifting attention means emphasizing and evaluating particular aspects of a legislative proposal, even within certain constraints. This is likely to be achieved through the use of rhetoric, symbols, policy analysis, and lobbying (Edelman 1989; Kingdon 1984; Riker 1986; Stone 1989). Accordingly, the providers of focal points should have a great deal of influence over decision‐making processes and outcomes. Within a context of incomplete and asymmetric information, however, the institutional structure of a legislative arena is critical in positioning some actors in advantageous positions as providers of focal points and de facto agenda setters. Depending on who this structure favors as the provider of information and expertise, the likely sources of focal points are either strong parties or strong legislative committees.         "
"12","A permanent committee structure provides members with the opportunity to acquire expertise in specific policy areas, which makes it possible for legislators to exercise significant, long‐term policy influence (Olsen and Mezey 1991, 60). The EP is more like the U.S. Congress than most European parliaments in this regard. The role of EP committees is more active and powerful than that of their counterparts in other national parliaments: they propose amendments to legislation in the form of a report and a draft resolution, which are then submitted to the EP plenary in an almost “take‐it‐or‐leave‐it” form (Hix 1999a, 78). In this sense, the EP's committee system is indeed its “legislative backbone” (Westlake 1994, 191).         "
"13","This reality is striking in Europe's primarily parliamentary context based on strong party organizations and leadership, where expertise tends to lie with Cabinet Ministries or specialists from party factions. After all, there is some evidence that the strength of legislative parties varies inversely with the strength of committees (Olsen and Mezey 1991, 15). Committees “operate as potential power bases outside the party structures” (Bowler and Farrell 1995, 223; emphasis added) and have “the effect of creating within the same legislature an alternative centre of information, expertise, prestige, and power” (Smith 1989, 207). Much like the permanent committees with fixed jurisdictions in the U.S. Congress, the jurisdictional organization of EP committees is based on the need to specialize, and its committees have considerable influence on the legislative agenda.         "
"14","For this reason, the sources of focal points in the EP are most likely not the party group or national party delegation leaderships, as it is the committee responsible for a given legislative proposal that plays the key informational role in legislative decision making (Bowler and Farrell 1995, 242).4 Individual committee members or the committee as a collective should be expected to serve as the primary provider of focal points. One actor in particular assumes a special role even among committee specialists, namely the rapporteur responsible for drafting the committee's report to the plenary. Her influence is more universal than that of other committee members or even the party leadership, since her report sets the stage for the interpretation and deliberation of the proposal in the committee, as well as the plenary.         "
"15","The focal‐point model is a deductive, generalizable theory specifying the conditions under which ideology translates into policy choice. If this theory were to find support in the empirical analysis, it would highlight an important anomaly to the findings of large‐N roll‐call vote analyses by demonstrating that this translation is neither automatic nor direct. Support for the predictions of the focal‐point model would indicate that context, actors, and process need to be taken into account when seeking to understand policy decisions in legislative politics."
"16","The article tests the propositions of the focal‐point model on a preliminary basis by analyzing the decision‐making process and outcome of the EU's “13th directive on company law: takeover bids, protection of shareholders, workers rights to information” (COD/1995/0341).5 This legislative proposal constitutes a particularly useful case, because it involves elements that relate to both the ideological Left‐Right continuum and the sovereignty‐integration dimension. First, it is a matter of market regulation, where distinct ideological positions between Left and Right ought to be observable; second, market regulation at the EU level directly infringes upon national sovereignty. As a result, we can expect to find the variance necessary for our analysis. Moreover, the takeover directive constitutes a useful case because it is apparent, prima facie, that policy preferences must have shifted throughout the process of deliberation. As Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate, support for the directive was broad during the first reading stage, while the proposal was defeated in a tied vote in the third parliamentary reading.         "
"17","Different models of decision making suggest divergent explanations for this preference shift. Some theoretical approaches discount the role of the decision‐making process as a potential factor driving preference shifts a priori. For example, the standard model of MEP voting behavior implies that policy preferences mirror ideological ideal‐points (Hix, Noury, and Roland 2005), while Moravcsik's (1998) theory of liberal intergovernmentalism highlights the role of national economic interest. According to both approaches, policy preferences reflecting these structural factors only change as the result of:         "
"18","                        "
"19"," A major event inside or outside the legislative arena (which exogenously shifts the policy preferences of large numbers of parliamentarians).                   "
"20"," A critical change in the policy proposal itself (as the proposal evolves over time, previously privileged groups find themselves to be disadvantaged).                   "
"21","Other approaches emphasize the possibility, or even the likelihood, that preferences may change endogenously as a function of the policymaking process. The new‐institutionalist “garbage‐can” theory (Cohen, March, and Olsen 1972), for example, assumes that policy outcomes result from an unpredictable confluence of (problematic) preferences, opportunities, individuals and ideas. This model suggests that the policy preferences tend to shift during a decision‐making process, as controversial issues are incrementally resolved:         "
"22","                        "
"23"," As previously contested aspects of the proposal are gradually resolved, policy preferences reflect newly controversial issues.                   "
"24","Finally, the focal‐point model stresses the role of both structural factors and political processes as the basis of policy preferences, as well as their interaction. It recognizes that stable ideological and constituency‐based preferences exogenous to the policy process constitute the basis of policy preferences, while acknowledging that these preferences may evolve throughout a single policymaking process:"
"25","                        "
"26"," Strategically deployed focal points focus attention on specific parts of a policy proposal, thus shifting policy preferences.                   "
"27","This set of hypotheses relates to the decision‐making process and will be evaluated in the next section, which considers the process of deliberation and contestation concerning the takeover directive. This detailed qualitative analysis is central to the testing of the focal‐point model, which emphasizes not only policy outcomes, but also the decision‐making process leading to these outcomes. Subsequently, I will quantitatively analyze the two roll‐call votes in the first and third parliamentary reading stages to evaluate the accuracy of competing hypotheses relating to the decision‐making outcome."
"28","In order to evaluate the accuracy of the process‐related hypotheses, this analysis must address three issues. First, it has to establish to what degree changes in the proposal itself warrant a shift in preferences, either directly (H2) or as a result of a changing policy focus (H3). Second, it has to consider if shifts in policy preferences can be attributed to an exogenous event capable of directly changing the policy preferences of substantial numbers of parliamentarians (H1). Finally, it has to determine if we can identify a set of exogenously provided focal points that shifted both policy focus and preferences throughout the process of parliamentary deliberation (H4)."
"29","Concerning the first question, it is evident that the evolution of the directive's content over time was quite limited. As Skog (2002, 304) points out, the Commission's initial 1996 proposal was in essence very similar to both the amended initial proposal of November 1997 and the Council's Common Position of June 2000. This similarity in the content of the proposal contradicts H2 and H3, since the evolving content of the proposal does not seem to have driven any significant preference shifts, either directly or indirectly. While the proposals were not identical, the few existing differences were not substantial enough to reverse either the policy focus or perceptions of comparative gains from the proposal between the different reading stages.6"
"30","Moreover, both H2 and H3 assume that MEPs are well‐informed about the content and consequences of a proposal. Yet, the majority of parliamentarians were quite uninformed about the highly complex and technical takeover directive.7 This reality makes it even more unlikely that the subtle changes in the proposal itself would entail major collective shifts in preferences.         "
"31","Concerning the second question, neither the analysis of policy documents, nor 20 interviews with key policy makers identify an exogenous event significant enough to warrant the expectation of a dramatic collective preference reversal. The most likely candidates for such an exogenous event would be some of the highly publicized hostile cross‐border takeover bids of the time, such as British Vodafone's bid for German rival Mannesmann in November 1999. These “scare stories,” however, do not automatically translate into opposition to the proposed directive. In fact, they could have easily been interpreted as reminders of the dire need for cross‐border takeover regulations in an increasingly integrated market. Accordingly, H1 does not find confirmation in this qualitative analysis."
"32","This leaves us to consider H4, which argues that shifts in focus and policy preferences are a function of strategically deployed focal points. This hypothesis is supported by the analysis, which suggests that three focal points shaped the process of contention surrounding the 13th directive, but took prominence at different points in time. In the early stages of the deliberation process, a focal point relating to the sovereignty‐integration dimension was particularly pronounced. This focal point stressed the significance of completing the European single market in the realm of company law and was particularly notable during the first reading stage. It was gradually replaced, however, by two alternative focal points in the second and third reading stages, namely the issue of workers' rights and the notion of creating a “level playing‐field” across the EU. The first of these two elements relates to the Left‐Right divide by emphasizing the question of employee information and consultation in the case of a takeover or merger. The second raises concerns about the impact of the proposal on businesses in the different member states, a core constituency of all MEPs, by suggesting that the takeover directive would favor businesses in certain countries while putting others at a comparative disadvantage.         "
"33","These focal points were introduced strategically at different stages of the proposal's life‐cycle by the primary legislative actors in the European Parliament, who framed the political process in ways advantageous to their objectives. These actors were in principal members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and especially the two rapporteurs handling the dossier."
"34","In the early stages of the legislative process, the proposal was considered by the 4th European Parliament (1994–99) and treated by rapporteur Nicole Fontaine, a French member of the European People's Party group (EPP). Ms. Fontaine was strongly in favor of the directive. Upon presenting her report to the plenary on June 25, 1997, she declared that she hoped “with all my heart” that the EP would vote in favor of the proposal.8 She presented the dossier as a necessary step toward the completion of the European single market with due consideration to the principle of subsidiarity. Accordingly, and as the focal‐point model would predict, deliberation in the Parliament under her rapporteurship was dominated by the issues of harmonization and subsidiarity, with a particular focus on the question of what type of directive would best ensure an appropriate balance between the two. A content analysis of the parliamentary debate in the first reading stage reveals that seven of eight speakers during the debate made a total of 33 references to this particular topic (see Table 3).99"
"35","Following the EP election in June 1999, Ms. Fontaine became the President of the 5th European Parliament and passed the rapporteurship of the 13th Directive to her German EPP colleague Klaus‐Heiner Lehne. The new rapporteur, however, assumed a position in the second reading that was “180 degrees opposite to the first reading,” according to a Commission official involved in the dossier. While the essence of the proposal had not changed since the first reading stage, Mr. Lehne presented it to the incoming parliament in a dramatically different fashion: he portrayed the issue as being about the creation of a “level playing‐field” across the EU, rather than about completing the single market. Thus simplifying the technical content of the proposal for his fellow parliamentarians, he shifted attention toward imbalances with regard to defensive measures that companies could take to protect themselves against hostile takeovers.10 While the takeover directive required shareholders to approve any defensive measures enacted by managerial boards, the position of the rapporteur stressed the German corporate tradition giving the board of the target company substantial autonomy and authority to frustrate a takeover attempt. Mr. Lehne maintained that the directive, as proposed by the Commission, would put certain national companies at a disadvantage both relative to companies from other European countries and from the United States, allowing some corporations to initiate cross‐border takeovers while being protected against hostile takeover bids themselves.1011"
"36","The second issue gaining prominence throughout the political process was that of employee information and consultation in takeover and merger activities. The discussion revolved around11 the specific question of employee consultation and information in the event of mergers and takeovers, but also featured an ever more prominent discussion about the desirability of mergers, and the question of shareholder versus stakeholder value. Once again, the complex repercussions of the legislative proposal were simplified, this time in terms of “workers' rights.” The issue continuously gained in visibility throughout the legislative process,12 which was somewhat surprising from the Commission's point of view, since12 the issue had been discussed early on in the informal trialogue meetings between Commission, Council, and Parliament. According to a senior Commission official, a member of the Socialist group in the EP had been invited to the meetings specifically to ensure the coverage of issues relating to the consultation and information of employees.13 In these meetings, the issue was thought13 to be taken care of by means of cross‐references to existing legislation, to which the Socialist EP representative did not object.1414"
"37","Rather than driven by major exogenous events or changes in the policy proposal, individual‐level perceptions of the takeover directive changed as a result of deliberate lobbying. Rapporteur Lehne and the Socialist shadow rapporteur in the Legal Affairs Committee, Willy Rothley, played critical roles in this regard. According to Mr. Rothley, he and Mr. Lehne put a lot of energy into finding a majority against the proposal.15 Their efforts were aimed in two directions: the workers' right focal point explicitly targeted the Left, while the level playing‐field focal point was emphasized for the political Right, which was thought to be more concerned with national businesses.16 While Mr. Lehne stressed the level playing‐field argument, Mr. Rothley emphasized the workers' protection side of the story in the Socialist group—despite his conviction that the directive, in reality, did not infringe on workers' rights.17"
"38","As the focal‐point model would suggest, the shift in focus toward the level playing‐field and workers' rights topics is evident in the debates preceding the second and third readings in the European Parliament on December 12, 2000, and July 3, 2001, as Table 3 shows. While there had not been a single mention of the “level playing‐field” problem in the first reading debate in 1997, it was referred to 13 times by five of 12 speakers in the December 2000 debate. In the June 2001 debate, the matter further gained in prominence, as 11 of 12 speakers made a total of 38 references to the issue. The workers' rights question was referred to merely eight times by four of eight speakers in the first reading phase, while the number of references increased to 13 in the 2000 debate, when five of 12 speakers addressed the issue in the debate preceding the second reading. Finally, in 2001, nine of 12 speakers made a total of 28 references before the final vote on the dossier. At the same time, the single market focal point became increasingly marginalized: in the December 2000 debate, it was mentioned only six times by three of 12 speakers, and only three of 12 speakers made a total of four references to the issue in 2001.         "
"39","The findings of this qualitative analysis also confirm that focal points were not created from thin air, but reflected existing ideological preferences. The increasing discussion about “workers' rights” shifted attention toward an aspect of the proposal that could prominently place the issue on the Left‐Right divide. It also emphasized to the Left that the proposal might negatively affect their core constituencies across the continent. At the same time, the “level playing‐field” issue emphasized the repercussions of the directive for national businesses, another core constituency of most MEPs."
"40","It is, moreover, evident that the focal points observable in the case of the takeover directive were indeed decision‐making shortcuts, making a complex and technical proposal more tangible. With opinion being “all over the place” initially,18 MEPs had to rely on the few people who could evaluate the implications of the directive to lead them through the process, according to a Commission official.         "
"41","Hence, focal points appear to have a mediating impact on already existing ideological preferences. While ideological preferences and constituency concerns did not change, opposition to the directive emerged as the policy process progressed.19 Following the suggestions of the dominant focal points, everybody started to discover that they had something to protect,20 be it “the pearls of their national industries,”21 or the employees of target companies.22"
"42","On the basis of the qualitative analysis above, it is possible to formulate a series of hypotheses concerning the expected outcome of the decision‐making process in the case of the takeover directive. To evaluate these outcome‐related hypotheses, this section quantitatively analyzes MEP voting behavior in the first and third reading stages of the takeover directive case using a logit regression framework.23"
"43","Three of the four models of decision making that provided the basis for the process‐related hypotheses also entail expectations about MEP voting behavior.24 The standard model of EP voting behavior and a liberal intergovernmentalist approach would predict, respectively, that:         "
"44","                        "
"45"," Ideological positions on the two dominant dimensions of contestation are substantively and statistically significant predictors of voting patterns.                   "
"46"," Voting patterns reflect national economic interests.                   "
"47","Yet, since the preceding section identified neither a major exogenous event, nor a critical change in the policy proposal as the source of a preference shift (see H1 and H2):"
"48","                        "
"49"," Ideology‐ and constituency‐based policy preferences should be stable across the first and third reading stages.                   "
"50","The focal‐point model, in contrast, suggests that:"
"51","                        "
"52"," Voting patterns should be predictable on the basis of the dominant focal points in a given deliberation process, since focal points shape policy preferences.                   "
"53","The identification of the three critical focal points of the political contestation process in the previous section allows us to formulate specific hypotheses concerning this potential shift and, consequently, the expected voting outcomes in the case of the takeover directive."
"54","In the first reading stage, the single market issue was most prominent in the debate about the takeover directive. Accordingly, we should find that pro‐/anti‐integration positions should be significant predictors of voting behavior, with pro‐European MEPs voting in favor of the directive (H8a). As established above, however, the focal point revolving around the completion of the single market became increasingly marginalized throughout the political process and was replaced by concerns about the level playing‐field and workers' protection. I therefore hypothesize that pro‐/anti‐integration positions should not be significant predictors of voting behavior in the third reading stage (H8b)."
"55","Following Hooghe and Marks (1999, 2001), we may hypothesize that the political Left was initially in favor of the takeover directive, as it constituted a matter of market regulation at the EU level in the area of corporate governance. The political Right, on the other hand, wishing to combine a continent‐wide market with minimal regulation at the EU level, should be more hesitant in its support for the directive. I thus hypothesize that more Leftist positions on the Left‐Right dimension should increase the probability of support for the directive in the first reading stage (H8c). Given the rising focus on the workers' rights issue in later stages of the discussion, these tendencies should be reversed in the third reading stage: in the 2001 vote, more Leftist positions should decrease the probability of support for the directive (H8d)."
"56","Finally, since the level playing‐field focal point was entirely absent from the debate in the first reading stage, constituency interests related to the comparative gains of national businesses should not constitute a significant predictor of voting behavior in the first reading stage (H8e). As a result of the rise of the issue throughout the process, however, we should expect to find that in the third reading stage, national considerations had a substantial impact on voting patterns (H8f)."
"57","Specifically, we should find that parliamentarians from member states with liberal market economies supported the directive (H8g), since their equity‐based systems already placed the shareholder at the center of regulatory and legal protections against hostile takeover bids (Berglöf and Burkart 2003). For these MEPs, the level playing‐field argument actually highlighted perceived gains from the takeover directive. MEPs from countries with national coordinated market economies should also be expected to favor the directive (H8h), for similar reasons. In Sweden, for example, regulations dating back to the early 1970s already required defensive actions to have shareholder approval. Moreover, the most widespread defensive practice in the Scandinavian countries is a system of dual class shares (Bennedsen and Nielsen 2004), which the takeover directive did not actually prohibit. Finally, we should observe that parliamentarians from sectoral market economies should largely opposed the directive on the basis of the level playing‐field argument (H8i), which was perceived as a threat to established neo‐corporatist traditions at the national, sectoral, and firm levels.         "
"58","The dependent variables in this analysis are the votes in the first and third readings (VOTE). These variables are dichotomous, where a value of zero equals a vote against directive and a value of one means a vote in favor.25"
"59","To account for individual‐level positions on the Left‐Right and sovereignty‐integration dimensions, I use MEP NOMINATE coordinates on Dimensions 1 (NOM_D1) and 2 (NOM_D2) of the European political space. These coordinates represent, respectively, the classic economic Left‐Right dimension and pro‐/anti‐integration divisions in the European Parliament (Hix, Noury, and Roland 2005). The variables range from −1 to 1, where −1 indicates an extreme leftist position on the NOM_D1 dimension and an anti‐EU position on the NOM_D2 dimension."
"60","To account for national economic interests as a measurement for both the constituency‐based model and the level playing‐field focal point, I include dichotomous variables for type of capitalism (Kitschelt et al. 1999; Rhodes and Van Apeldoorn 1997). These variables fall into four categories: CAP1—Liberal market economy (Ireland and the United Kingdom); CAP2—Partial or family‐oriented coordinated market economy (France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal);26 CAP3—Sectoral coordinated market economy (Germany, Austria and Benelux countries); CAP4—National coordinated market economy (Scandinavian countries). I also interact this variable with the Left‐Right NOMINATE variable to see whether the effect of ideology varies according to type of capitalism.            "
"61","To determine if representation in the Council of Ministers or national‐level Government‐Opposition dynamics affected voting behavior in the case of the takeover directive, I include a dichotomous variable based on the national government or opposition status of particular national party delegations, where a value of 1 means that a party was part of the national government (GOV_OPP).27"
"62","I test two models: a baseline model consisting of the two ideology variables plus the Government‐Opposition variable and the complete model including the type of capitalism indicators and the interaction terms. This differentiation allows us to distinguish between the impact of the ideology variables (while controlling for the representation in the Council), and the added effect of national economic interests."
"63","The results in Table 4 show that, as predicted on the basis of the dominant focal point in the first reading stage, positions on the sovereignty‐integration dimension constitute a highly statistically significant predictor of voting behavior in the roll‐call vote of the first parliamentary reading. Moreover, the sign of the coefficient indicates that a more pro‐European attitude correlates positively with the probability of a Yes vote. This finding confirms H8a, and is particularly evident in Model 1, where positions on the sovereignty‐integration constitute the only statistically significant predictor. With the inclusion of the types of capitalism variables in Model 2, however, the Left‐Right variable and all three types of capitalism indicators also achieve statistical significance.            "

"66","The results of Model 2 also support H8c, as positions on the Left‐Right dimension are statistically significant and negatively related to the dependent variable: leftists were more likely to vote in favor of the directive. This finding is evident in Figure 2, which presents the mean predicted probabilities of a Yes vote given positions on the Left‐Right dimension, again differentiating between the three different types of capitalism.

"68","Finally, and contrary to the expectation of the focal‐point model (H8e), national economic considerations are highly statistically significant predictors of voting behavior, as all three types of capitalism variables are significant and their coefficients quite substantial. Interestingly, all three coefficients are negative, meaning that MEPs from different types of market economies were all concerned about the impact of the proposal at this early stage of the decision‐making process."
"69","Given that positions on both ideology dimensions and national economic interests constitute significant predictors of voting patterns, H5 and H6 are supported in this analysis. Yet, in order for the ideology‐ or constituency‐based model to find support, H7 also requires confirmation. Table 4, however, critically undermines both models, since neither ideological nor constituency‐based preferences were stable across both votes in the case of the takeover directive: the ideology variables and two type of capitalism variables switch signs. Only the sectoral coordinated market economy variable retains its negative sign, while being a parliamentarian from either a liberal market economy or a national coordinated market economy now entails a greater probability of voting in favor of the directive. Finally, the government‐opposition variable is statistically significant and indicates that government parties were more likely to support the directive.            "
"70","These results are consistent with the expectations of the focal‐point model, which can account for these switches in the signs of the coefficients. The sign of the sovereignty‐integration variable, for example, switches from positive to negative: while pro‐Europeans strongly supported the directive in the first reading stage, the relationship between support for the EU and support for the takeover directive is now reversed (compare Figures 1 and 3).

"72","One possible interpretation of this curious finding is that pro‐European MEPs actually began to consider the directive to be harmful to the integration process as the level playing‐field argument began to dominate the discussion. Accordingly, H8b is not confirmed as stated above: positions on the dimension did not become insignificant during the decision‐making process. Yet, as the single market focal point was marginalized in the third reading stage, the coefficient in the complete regression model dropped from 3.03 to .79, indicating the decreasing importance of positions on the sovereignty‐integration dimension."
"73","The simultaneous rise of the workers' right focal point also entails a switch in the direction of the Left‐Right variable, as predicted by the focal‐point model (H8d) and illustrated in Figures 2 and 4: while left‐leaning MEPs had a greater probability of voting in favor of the directive in the first reading vote, they now show a greater probability to vote against. As Figure 4 shows, the mean predicted probability of a vote in favor of the directive increases as values on the Left‐Right divide shift toward the Right.            "

"75","As H8f suggested, it is indeed the case that considerations about the impact of the proposal on national economic interests are statistically significant in predicting voting behavior. Moreover, the analysis shows that in the third‐reading stage, when the level playing‐field issue was emphasized, the inclusion of the type of capitalism variables increases the number of cases predicted correctly by more than 10% compared to the baseline model. Even including a simple dichotomous variable for Germany demonstrates this impact: as the additional Model 3 shows, a Germany variable increases the number of cases predicted correctly by 5%.30"
"76","The focal‐point model also correctly predicts the direction of all three types of capitalism variables. As H8g proposed, members of parliament from liberal market economies had a greater probability of voting in favor of the directive. In accordance with H8h, the proposal was also supported by MEPs from countries with national coordinated market economies. Finally, parliamentarians from sectoral coordinated market economies were very unlikely to support the proposal, which confirms H8i."
"77","This article provides preliminary empirical support for the propositions of the focal‐point model, while contradicting a number of alternative explanations for policy choice. The qualitative analysis of the takeover directive establishes that the interpretation of what constitutes the dominant aspect of a given legislative proposal can be traced back to one (or more) exogenously provided focal point(s). The analysis identified three competing focal points that took prominence at different points in time. Appealing to existing ideological predispositions, these strategically deployed focal points influenced the variable interpretation of what the issue at hand “was all about,” thus shifting policy preferences during the process of parliamentary deliberation. Subsequently, the quantitative analysis of voting behavior established that the strategically deployed focal points significantly shaped voting outcomes in the case of the EU takeover directive."
"78","Accordingly, I demonstrate that the two‐dimensional structure of the European ideology space notably influences political behavior in the European Parliament, but that it does so in a dynamic agent‐structure relationship. While the political choices of European parliamentarians are indeed critically influenced by their locations on both the sovereignty‐integration and the Left‐Right dimensions, these locations become activated only as a result of political contestation. Therefore, even this single‐case analysis indicates that prevalent views about voting in the European Parliament generated from large number of roll‐call votes need to be reconsidered, as they fail to identify when established voting patterns break down."
"79","The focal‐point model thus makes a more general contribution to the study of legislative decision making by specifying the conditions under which ideology structures policy choice. It emphasizes the importance of cognitive or ideational dimensions of collective action, while stressing the conscious interaction of these structural elements with distinctly strategic considerations in the legislative process: the strategic provision of focal points is constrained by the cognitive, normative, and political context within which the provider operates. Within these constraints, however, strategically provided focal points serve as intervening variables linking general ideological predispositions with specific policy proposals. Therefore, the translation of ideology into policy choices is not direct, as some theoretical approaches assume, and as the conventional wisdom about voting in the European Parliament suggests. Context, actors, and process need to be taken into account when seeking to understand policy decisions in legislative politics."
"80","At a time when we have gained significant insights into the broad patterns of behavior of European parliamentarians, as a result of valuable cumulative research efforts in the recent past, it is evident that we have to start paying attention to more detailed behavioral patterns. Identifying the factors that determine the initial interpretation of an issue as being either about national sovereignty and European integration, about Left and Right attitudes, or touching upon constituency interests constitutes one aspect of this “fine‐tuning” effort. For researchers interested in EP politics, as well as for those concerned with decision making in other legislative settings, this demands an increased focus on the interaction between structures, agents, and decision‐making processes."
