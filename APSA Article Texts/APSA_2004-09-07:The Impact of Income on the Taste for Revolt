"1","Our data come from the Combined World Values Survey (asked in three waves between 1981 and 1995) and Euro‐Barometer Survey Series (asked every year from 1976 to 1990) questions which ask: “On this card are three basic kinds of attitudes vis‐a‐vis the society in which we live in. Please choose the one which best describes your own opinion.” The three relevant response categories are: “The entire way our society is organised must be radically changed by revolutionary action,”“Our society must be gradually improved by reforms,” and “Our present society must be valiantly defended against all subversive forces” (The “Don't know” and “Not asked in this survey” categories are not included in our data set). Appendix 1 provides a description of both surveys.         "
"2"," Table 1a shows the overall proportions of people in the world who desire a revolution conditioning by employment and marital status, sex, and income quintile. The patterns across different regions of the world are also reported. These data come from 94,215 people who were randomly sampled over a cross‐section of 61 nations as part of the World Values survey. Of the full sample, 10.1% had a preference for revolt. A rise from the bottom to the top income quintile is associated with a monotonically decreasing proportion of people wanting revolution. Of those individuals in the bottom, second, third, fourth, and top income quintiles, 10.8%, 10.4%, 10.2%, 9.3%, and 6.9%, respectively, support revolt. Of the unemployed, 14.1% support one. Married people had a lower level of revolutionary support at 9.4% compared to single people at 12.3%. More men than women favor revolt. The region with the highest level of support for revolutionary action was in Africa at 20.1%, compared to the OECD average of 5.1%. For the United States, 5.4% of people supported revolution. The proportion falls monotonically as one goes up the income groups: in the bottom, middle, and top quintiles, 7.8%, 5.4%, and 2.9% of Americans want one, respectively. The highest level of revolutionary support in any particular country in the world was equal to 44.9% in Czechoslovakia around 1990, coinciding with the velvet revolution at the end of 1989.         "
"3"," Table 1b reports corresponding figures for the Euro‐Barometer survey that randomly sampled 201,940 people living in 12 nations between 1976 and 1990. Of this total, 5.9% had a taste for revolt and of the unemployed people, 9.9% supported one. A higher proportion of single respondents were in favor of revolt, compared to married people, and more men than women favor revolt. As we rise up from the lowest to the highest income quartile, there is a monotonically decreasing proportion of responses in favor of revolution. Within Europe, the highest level of revolutionary support was in Portugal, equal to 14.3% in 1985 and falling to 6.0% in 1986. After the “ Revolution of the Carnations” on 25 April 1974, Portugal experienced extreme political swings and strikes until entry into the European Community in 1986 secured a measure of stability. The lowest average level of revolutionary support was in Denmark where just 2.3% were in favor.         "
"4","One possible disadvantage with these data is that the responses may contain a lot of noise and even be untruthful. For example, in formulating their responses, subjects may be influenced by what they believe to be the socially desirable response. Since the first studies in the area, psychologists have found evidence that points to this concern being exaggerated (e.g., Rorer 1965).7 In this section we also present four pieces of evidence that lend support for taking these data seriously. First, the effect of personal characteristics on revolutionary tastes in our regression equations has a very similar empirical structure across nations. For example, in each of the 12 Euro‐Barometer nations, dropping down the income quartiles is associated with a monotonically increasing chance of supporting revolt. Men are also more likely and married people less likely to desire revolt in every nation.8 Similar effects are found in the vast majority of nations from the World Values survey.         "
"5","It is also possible to show that surveyed preferences for revolt are correlated with observable measures of conflict. This second piece of evidence comes from correlating actions that each person has undertaken to rebel with their declared taste for revolt, both obtained from the World Values Survey.9 The rebellious actions include: “Signing a petition,”“Joining in boycotts,”“Attending lawful demonstrations,”“Joining unofficial strikes,” and “Occupying buildings or factories.” These variables are measured at the individual level, yielding 94,215 independent observations. Let each of these actions be represented by a dummy variable equal to 1 if the respondent answers “Have done” and 0 if they say “Might/Would Never Do.” The correlation coefficients between Taste for Revolt? and (a) Joined in boycotts is 0.07, (b) Lawfully demonstrated is 0.08, (c) Unofficial strikes is 0.07, and (d) Occupied buildings or factories is 0.06. These coefficients are all positive and significant at the 1% level. The mapping from tastes into the above four actions is significantly less than one‐to‐one, an effect that could be due to the collective action problem. In contrast, signing a petition shows a small, insignificant correlation. The indicators of actual protest are more highly correlated with each other than with the declared preference for revolt. For example, the correlation coefficient between Unofficial strikes and Occupied buildings or factories is 0.32.         "
"6","Each of the four indicators (Joined in boycotts, Lawfully demonstrated, Unofficial strikes, and Occupied buildings or factories) were also regressed on each individual's taste for revolt, controlling for country and year effects. Probits were used where the base category occurs when the person replies that she has not previously done the action. A taste for revolt is found to be a significant positive factor in determining subversive actions, at the 1% level, across all these four measures. A person with a revolutionary taste has a 9 percentage point higher probability of joining in boycotts, 12 percentage point higher probability of demonstrating, 7 percentage point higher probability of joining unofficial strikes, and a 4 percentage point higher probability of occupying buildings.         "
"7","Further evidence suggestive of a correlation between surveyed revolutionary preferences and actual conflict can also be obtained using a data set of all civil wars in the world occurring during the time of our surveys (from Doyle and Sambanis (2000) which defines a civil war as a conflict between a government and a nongovernment claimant that has resulted in at least 1,000 deaths per year). There are 20 observations corresponding to countries and years in which both civil wars occurred and contemporaneous data on revolutionary tastes also exists. On average, 14% of people support revolt in these places, compared to 9% in the remaining sample. The partial correlation coefficient between support for revolt and civil war occurring in that country in the corresponding time period, controlling for a complete set of country and year fixed effects, equals 0.12. When the level of GDP per capita is also controlled for, the partial correlation coefficient equals 0.13.         "
"8","In order to identify the effects of income on the support for revolt, the following probit regression is estimated:            "
"9","The main source of variation using the World Values survey that can be exploited to identify the coefficients in Equation (1) exists in the cross‐section of 61 nations, since the majority of these have only been surveyed for one or two of the three waves of the survey. On the other hand, the Euro‐Barometer surveys contain a much smaller number of countries in the cross‐section but since each one has been surveyed for every year between 1976 and 1990, this gives a long time‐series dimension to exploit. We do so by including a set of time‐varying aggregate‐level variables and fixed‐effect controls in the regressions using the Euro‐Barometer data. The vector, Macro controlsct refers to a set of variables aggregated at the country level, such as the Unemployment rate, Inflation rate, Benefit Replacement Rate and Government Consumption that may also affect revolutionary tastes. (These are unavailable for most countries in the World Values survey). The generosity of the unemployment benefit system is measured as a proportion of wages. Government consumption is final consumption expenditures of government as a proportion of GDP. Countryc refers to a vector of country fixed effects. Each country dummy has its own coefficient that make up the elements of the vector, e. Similarly Yeart refers to a vector of year fixed effects where h contains the corresponding set of coefficients. Country Specific Time Trendc is a vector of country‐specific time trends and ɛict is an (i.i.d) error term. Appendix 2 contains variable definitions. We compute robust standard errors, correcting for potential heteroskedasticity and correlation of the error term across observations that are contained within a country in any given year (see Moulton 1986). Summary statistics are reported in Appendix 3.         "
"10","The possibility of omitted variables and endogeneity biasing our results may exist. For example, a caveat on the results is the possibility of an omitted variable for which we have no good proxy in our data set, like an incompetent State, producing both low income and high levels of dissatisfaction, which may explain some of the effects that we are claiming to identify. To some extent, this problem has been reduced by including country and year dummies, and also country‐specific time trends, in our regressions. For example, if incompetent management had been a fixed quality of the State over our entire sample period then the inclusion of country dummy variables should capture this effect. They should also help control for cultural and language differences that may affect how different nationalities respond to our survey question. Year‐fixed effects are able to take account of sudden shifts in public tastes caused by “revolutionary bandwagons.”"
"11","The problem of endogeneity should also be reduced by using surveyed tastes as the dependent variable instead of the actual observation of a revolt, since in the latter case we may observe negative correlations with income simply due to the direct impact of conflict on the economy. However, even with our survey data, biases could still arise. For example, say people in one country have a more optimistic belief that they will benefit from a revolution compared to people in another country. If this perception leads to a loss of confidence in the economy due to the threat of civil conflict, a negative relationship between Taste for Revolt? and GDP per capita could arise in our equations. Consequently we instrument for GDP per capita with indices of Foreign Demand and Oil Import Price in two‐stage least‐squares regressions. The first instrument is calculated for each nation, n, by averaging GDP across all nations for each year, but excluding nation n, and then weighting this number by the share of exports in GDP for nation n. The idea is to capture the level of foreign demand for each country's exports. Oil Import Price is measured by the nominal price of oil in local currency divided by the corresponding nation's GDP deflator and is designed to measure supply side shocks to the economy. To the extent that these two variables are correlated with movements in GDP, they may be able to affect revolutionary support via this channel.10"
"12"," Table 2 shows the results from our probit regressions using the World Values Survey. The sample consists of 94,215 individuals, and we report marginal probabilities. The effect of both GDP per capita and each person's income rank within their country, as proxied by the income quintile, on revolutionary tastes can be estimated across the nations included in this survey. In column (1) a higher level of GDP per capita is associated with a lower level of revolutionary support in the world, significant at the 1% level. The coefficient on GDP, equal to −0.078, indicates that an increase in average incomes of $US 1,000 in 1985 values (=$1,600 in 2001 values) is expected to decrease the probability of a person supporting a revolt by 0.8 percentage points. Equivalently, the proportion of people supporting revolutionary change is expected to drop by 7.9% for an increase in income of this magnitude (=0.8/10.1 where the denominator is the percentage of people in the world who, on average, support revolt). A jump from the bottom to the top income quintile within an individual's country decreases the probability of them supporting revolt by 2.3 percentage points.            "
"13","Column (2) includes both the level and lag of national income, GDP per capita and GDP per capita (−1). These are both significant at the 1% level and indicate that the change in GDP could be an important variable that helps to explain variations in revolutionary support. Column (3) restricts attention to only the change in GDP, which is significant at the 1% level. The size of the effect corresponds to a $US 1,000 (1985 values) positive change in GDP reducing the support for revolt by 4.4 percentage points. Equivalently, the proportion of people supporting revolutionary change is expected to drop by 43.6% for a positive change in income of this magnitude (=4.4/10.1). Column (3) also predicts that for a person who rises from the bottom to the top of the income distribution, their probability of supporting revolt drops by 5.0 percentage points.11 For the other personal characteristics, the most robust effect is being male. Across all specifications men are significantly more likely to support revolt. The size of the effect varies between 2.0 and 2.2 percentage points.            "
"14","The relatively low explanatory power in these regressions indicates that there is substantial individual‐level variability in responses, possibly due to personality factors, that is not being captured by our set of available personal characteristics. However, if we take the mean level of revolutionary support across all people in a given country and year (i.e., over 1,300 people which is the average cell size) then much of this variability disappears. Using observations averaged at the country‐year level in Ordinary Least Squares regressions, the coefficient on GDP in the column (1) specification equals −0.03, significant at the 1% level and the adjusted R2 equals 0.70. If the column (2) specification is estimated using country‐year means and OLS, then the coefficients on the level and lag of GDP equal −0.92 and 0.89, both significant at the 1% level (adjusted R2= 0.75). If the specification in column (3) is used then the coefficient on the change in GDP equals −0.89, at the 1% level (adjusted R2= 0.74).            "
"15"," Table 3a–d show probit regression results but now using the Euro‐Barometer survey series. The sample becomes much larger, equal to 201,940 people. Although the number of countries in the cross‐section is much smaller than before, each nation is now surveyed for every year between 1976 and 1990, giving an extensive time‐series dimension to exploit that was not a feature of the previous data set. Marginal probabilities are reported. We begin in column (1) of Table 3a by again showing the results when we try to explain the cross‐sectional patterns in the data, which makes the specification directly comparable to the one in the first column of Table 2 that used World Values. The coefficient on GDP per capita remains significant at the 1% level and is of similar size to before. The effect of a rise up from the bottom to the top of the income distribution for an individual within each country is predicted to reduce revolutionary support by 2.6 percentage points.            "
"16","Column (2) includes country and year dummies. The level of income now has a more negative coefficient than in the previous column so an increase in GDP per capita equal to $US 1,000 (in 1985 values) is predicted to decrease revolutionary support by 1.3 percentage points. Equivalently, the proportion of people supporting revolutionary change is expected to drop by 22% for an increase in income of this magnitude (=1.3/5.9 where the denominator is the percentage of people in Europe who, on average, support revolt). Put another way, a one standard deviation increase in GDP per capita leads to a drop in revolutionary support of 1.7 standard deviations of the latter variable.12 Column (3) includes a lagged value of average income. It is insignificant but its positive sign indicates that the change in income may also play a role in shaping revolutionary tastes. If we restrict the specification to only include ΔGDP per capita then its coefficient equals −0.175, significant at the 10% level.13"
"17","Columns (4) and (5) repeat the specifications in columns (2) and (3) but now also add country‐specific time trends. In column (5) the level of GDP has a negative and significant effect at the 1% level. Either a rise in an individual's income of $US 1,000 (1985 values) or a jump up from the bottom to the top portion of the national income distribution both have similar sized impacts on reducing revolutionary tastes. Given that a random person taken from the bottom income quartile has, on average, a 6.7% probability of having a taste for revolt, these changes are enough to reduce this probability to approximately 4.2%. The coefficients and standard errors of the country and year dummies, as well as country‐specific time trends are also reported for this specification in Table A3 in the appendix. The country dummies show that France and Spain have relatively high (unexplained) levels of revolutionary support. The year dummies are jointly significant at the 1% level and indicate that revolutionary support was significantly lower in 1983–84 and higher in 1989–90 across all these nations in Europe (in comparison to 1985, the base year). The country‐specific time trends show Greece was on an upward trend and Spain on a downward trend.14"
"18","In Table 3b a set of macroeconomic control variables is included. The size of the personal effects on revolutionary tastes remains almost identical so these coefficients are now no longer reported. Columns (1) to (3) include both country and year fixed effects. Four macrocontrols have been added. They are Unemployment rate, Inflation rate, as well as Benefit Replacement Rate and Government Consumption. In column (1) a one standard deviation increase in GDP per capita leads to a drop in revolutionary support of 2.8 standard deviations of the latter variable. Higher unemployment and inflation both have positive, but insignificant effects on the taste for revolt. More generous unemployment benefits and a larger share of government consumption have negative effects. A one standard deviation rise in unemployment benefits is expected to reduce the probability of supporting revolt by 1.4 standard deviations (=0.17 * 0.15/0.018).            "
"19","Columns (2) and (3) estimate the effect of lags and changes in GDP per capita. The first lag on GDP per capita in column (2) has an insignificant effect on revolutionary tastes. Column (3) includes the level and change of GDP per capita in the same regression. Both have negative effects on revolutionary tastes, although only the level is significant at the 1% level. Columns (4) to (6) add a full set of country‐specific time trends, as well as country and year fixed effects. The results remain similar to the corresponding specifications in the previous three columns, with the exception of Government Consumption, which becomes insignificant. The significance level of GDP per capita in column (6) falls to 10%. The two variables with the most robust effects in shaping revolutionary tastes across all of these regressions are the level of GDP per capita and the generosity of unemployment benefits.            "
"20"," Table A4 in Appendix 3 summarizes the effects of a drop from the 90th to 10th percentile of the distribution of GDP, unemployment, inflation, benefits, and government consumption on the proportion of people who support revolt using the coefficients from the column (1) specification in Table 3b. For example, a drop in the benefit replacement rate from 0.53 to 0.03 leads to an increase in the proportion of people wanting a revolt of 8 percentage points.            "
"21","To provide a further check on the results, we also run Two‐Stage Least‐Squares regressions to control for endogeneity that could arise if, for example, political instability leads to a reluctance to invest and a contraction in the economy. This could explain part of the negative correlation between revolutionary support and GDP per capita that we have been observing. Government policy may also be endogenous. For example, political elites may extend voting rights to prevent revolt (see Acemoglu and Robinson 2000) and welfare roles may have been expanded during the 1960's U.S. civil rights movement to reduce protests (see Fording 1997). An historical example occurs after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, when the winners (Whigs) sought to redesign government institutions to control “the exercise of arbitrary and confiscatory power by the Crown” (North and Weingast 1989).            "
"22","Consequently we instrument GDP per capita with indices of Foreign Demand and Oil Import Price, both measured at the country‐year level that may be able to affect revolutionary support in a country via their impact on per capita incomes. To maintain the same level of aggregation on both sides of our 2SLS regression equations, the dependent variable must also be measured at the country‐year level.15 It represents the average level of revolutionary support that cannot be explained by personal characteristics which is obtained by estimating regressions of the form, Taste for Revolt?ict=a.Personal Characteristicsict+b.Yeart, for each country and then taking the coefficients on the year dummies (contained in the vector, b.) These average residual measures of revolutionary support can then be used in 2SLS regressions to check whether they are being exogenously affected by GDP per capita.16"
"23","Column (1) in Table 3c includes country and year fixed effects and column (2) adds country‐specific time trends in OLS regressions. Columns (3) and (4) report the 2SLS results in which GDP per capita is instrumented with Foreign Demand and Oil Import Price. The coefficient on GDP per capita is negative and significant at the 10% level in column (3). The last column adds country‐specific time trends. GDP per capita becomes more negative and significant (at the 5% level). Since the number of instruments is greater than the number of endogenous regressors, our equation is overidentified which allows us to test for the exogeneity of the extra instruments. For both regressions (3) and (4) exogeneity of the overidentifying restrictions cannot be rejected at the 10% level.17"
"24"," Table 3d shows the first‐stage regressions. We may expect that a higher level of Foreign Demand would increase a nation's GDP per capita whereas a higher Oil Import Price, being an adverse supply shock, decreases it. This is what we find in columns (1) and (2). The former reports the results with country and year fixed effects, while the latter adds country‐specific time trends.            "
"25","A fundamental question in the conflict literature is whether higher GDP can buy off threats to property claims. This article focuses on individual preferences for revolution. Its aim is to study the origins of conflict by measuring to what extent low incomes lead people to experience such high levels of frustration that, if acted upon, could overturn the entire political organization of their nation. The article uses microlevel data sets derived from surveys of revolutionary tastes taken across one‐quarter‐of‐a‐million individuals. This approach makes it possible to differentiate between the effects of the average level of national income and also the income ranking of an individual within a country."
"26","We find negative significant effects of GDP on revolutionary tastes. An increase in GDP per capita of $US 1,600 (in 2001 values) decreases the probability of supporting revolt by 2.4 percentage points, representing a 41% drop in support (i.e., from 5.9% to 3.5% of the European population). This is the average size of effect measured across all our specifications. For a person who jumps from the bottom to the top of the income distribution within their country, the probability of them having a taste for revolt declines by 2.5 percentage points. These results are robust to controlling for a large set of personal characteristics, country‐fixed effects, year‐fixed effects, country‐specific time trends, and also accounting for the potential endogeneity of GDP."
