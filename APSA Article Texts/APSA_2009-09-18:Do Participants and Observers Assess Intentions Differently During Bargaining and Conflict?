"1","The experiments were carried out at the Center for Experimental Social Science (CESS) at New York University. Subjects signed up for the experiment via a web‐based recruitment system that draws from a broad pool of potential participants, almost all of whom are undergraduates. Subjects were not recruited from the author's courses, and all subjects gave informed consent according to standard human subjects protocols. Subjects interacted anonymously via networked computers; the experiments were programmed and conducted with the software z‐Tree (Fischbacher 1999).         "
"2","In every experimental session, the number of subjects taking part was equal to a multiple of three. Each of the subjects present at a given session was randomly assigned by the experimental software to one of three roles. In the experimental instructions and protocol, these roles were given the neutral labels of “Role 1,”“Role 2,” and “Role 3.” An equal number of subjects was assigned to each of these roles, and the role assignments remained fixed through the duration of an experimental session, so that each individual subject had experience of only one role. In both the ultimatum and dictator game variations, subjects in “Role 1” acted as “proposers”; subjects in “Role 2” acted as “recipients”; and subjects in “Role 3” served as “observers.”2"
"3","Once roles had been assigned, a common set of instructions describing the structure of the experimental game was read aloud from a text that was also distributed in hard copy form to all subjects. As such, subjects in all three roles were informed about the experiment in precisely the same way. The instructions for different treatments within a given experiment differed only in the most minimal respects necessary. Subjects completed a brief on‐screen quiz about the instructions and received feedback about the correct answers, before participating in the experiment."
"4","Each session consisted of a number of periods (that was not announced to subjects in advance). Each period consisted of two parts: first, a play of the relevant experimental game, and second, a postplay “question” in which recipients (Role 2) and observers (Role 3) had an opportunity to increase their earnings by giving their best guesses about the proposer's (Role 1) choice. At the beginning of each period, subjects were randomly rematched into a new “group” consisting of one proposer, one recipient, and one observer."
"5","Subjects' payoffs were demarcated in experimental “tokens” that were subsequently converted into currency at the rate of 100 tokens to US$1. Subjects' total earnings consisted of the sum of their payoffs in each period, plus a showup fee of US$7."
"6","In the eight sessions that comprised Experiment 1, 156 subjects took part. Four sessions each were devoted to imperfect‐information versions of the ultimatum game (78 subjects) and of the dictator game (78 subjects)."
"7","Both the ultimatum and dictator games began with each group's proposer (Role 1) choosing a potential allocation of 100 tokens, offering x tokens to the recipient (Role 2) in her group while proposing to keep 100 − x tokens for herself. Proposers were allowed to choose any integer value of x between 0 and 100 (inclusive).            "
"8","A key feature of the ultimatum and dictator game settings in this experiment is that recipients (and observers) were not told the value of the offer x.3 Instead, for a particular offer x, the recipient and the observer in the proposer's group were given identical values xmin and xmax and told simply that xmin ≤ x ≤ xmax—that is, that x fell within the “range”[xmin, xmax ]. The instructions to subjects did not contain any specific information about the ways in which the “range” was generated from any particular offer x. Ultimately, this feature of the experimental design allows for comparisons of how participants (recipients) and observers assess proposers' intentions when, as in most real‐world settings, the underlying structure of uncertainty is not generally understood.4 The “widths” of these “ranges” (e.g., the value xwidth = |xmax − xmin |), which always took on a value from the set {15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}, were randomly generated, as was the location of the range midpoint  relative to x, subject to a constraint that xmin ≥ 0 and xmax ≤ 100 (so that the ranges never included offers that were infeasible for the proposer to make).5 Both xmin and xmax were always equal to a multiple of 5.            "
"9","In the ultimatum game sessions, once xmin and xmax were known both to recipient and observer, recipients chose to accept or to reject the offer, based on this imperfect information. If a recipient accepted an offer whose actual value had been x, he received a payoff of x tokens for the game, while the proposer received 100 − x tokens. If, on the other hand, a recipient rejected an offer whose actual value had been x, both recipient and proposer received 0 tokens.            "
"10","In the dictator game sessions, on the other hand, both recipient and observer received information about the offer in the form of xmin and xmax, but the recipient did not have the ability to accept or reject offers. Instead, each proposer's allocation was automatically adopted, leaving the recipient with x tokens and the proposer with 100 − x tokens as game payoffs. Thus, proposers' offers are relevant to recipients' payoffs in both the ultimatum and dictator games, but recipients have an ability to react to these offers only in the ultimatum game. This aspect of difference between the ultimatum and dictator games, along with their other structural similarities, will be useful in interpreting patterns of recipient‐observer differences in the two games.            "
"11","Observers (Role 3) did not make choices in either the ultimatum or dictator game, and their payoffs were not affected by the outcomes of the games. Observers simply received a flat payoff of 40 tokens as a game payoff in each period of play."
"12","Once play of the ultimatum or dictator game in a given period was complete, subjects answered a postplay “question” offering an additional opportunity to earn payoffs. Subjects received no feedback about the outcome of game play before proceeding to the postplay questions."
"13","Specifically, recipients and observers were asked to provide their best guess as to the value of x—that is, the amount that had actually been offered to the recipient by the proposer. As a way of motivating subjects to pay attention and make the most accurate assessments possible, recipients and observers were paid for guesses that were sufficiently accurate. If a recipient or an observer entered a guess of y when the actual offer had been x, he received a payoff (in tokens) of max(100 − 10|x − y|, 0). That is, a correct guess yielded a payoff of 100 tokens; a guess that was incorrect but which deviated from the true answer by no more than nine “units” received a payoff of 100 tokens minus 10 tokens for each “unit” between their guess and the true value of x; and any incorrect guess deviating from the true answer by 10 or more “units” received 0 tokens.6"
"14","The assessments y that recipients and observers make about proposers' offers are the key objects of interest in the experimental design. In particular, the central research question involves any differences that may exist in how recipients and observers perceive identical information about proposers' intended behavior, and how such differences may vary across different strategic settings. Several aspects of the experimental design strengthen the inferences that can be drawn from comparing recipients' and observers' assessments y. After a proposer decision in either game, the recipient and the observer receive the same information about x in the form of xmin and xmax. This control for access to information, along with the random assignment of subjects to the roles of recipient and observer, allows for the possibility of causal inference about the effects of an individual's strategic role on that individual's perceptions of proposers' intentions, as measured by the assessments y.            "
"15","As the experimental sessions consisted of multiple periods,7 it is important to describe the feedback received by subjects from period to period in order to account for the possibility of learning by subjects and any time trends that might appear in the data. The feedback that subjects received in the experiment was quite limited. Subjects were not given any information as to their payoffs, either for the play of the games or for the postplay questions, until after their participation in the experiment was complete. In particular, recipients and observers did not receive any direct feedback as to what the true value of x had been, either through their payoffs in the game (recipients) or through the accuracy of their guesses (both recipients and observers). Proposers were similarly not told whether their offers had been accepted or rejected by recipients. While subjects did not receive direct information about their payoffs, subjects did observe values of xmin and xmax during every period. These observations made it unavoidable that recipients and observers did receive some indirect feedback about the distribution of proposers' offers, and that subjects in all roles received indirect feedback about the way in which ranges were generated.            "
"16","As motivated above, Experiment 1 was designed to explore any causal effect of actors' strategic roles on perception formation in a context of ambiguity about how agents' actions map onto observable consequences. The decision to offer subjects only limited feedback was intended to further this objective. As recipients and observers learn more about the distribution of proposers' behavior, and learn more about the structure of uncertainty in the experimental scenario, any inherent tendency towards differences in participant and observer cognition is increasingly likely to be washed out."
"17","The left half of Table 1 presents the distribution of offers x made by proposers during the four ultimatum game sessions. The mean offer x over all periods was 26.1 (standard deviation = 20.9). Offers decreased modestly over time; the mean offer x during the first eight periods was 29.5 (standard deviation = 21.2), while the mean offer x during the last seven periods was 22.2 (standard deviation = 19.8). Proposers' offers in this imperfect‐information version of the ultimatum game are somewhat lower on average than the offers typically observed in ultimatum game experiments that do not involve imperfect information, where mean offers of between 30% and 40% of the amount available for distribution are more typical (Camerer 2003, 49). This finding, consistent with existing imperfect‐information studies (e.g., Rapoport, Sundali, and Seale 1996), naturally suggests that proposers exploit recipients' uncertainty in choosing offers.            "
"18","A high degree of heterogeneity in proposer behavior is evident in the left half of Table 1. While the modal offer was 0 (48 times, or 12.3% of all offers), the next‐most‐common offers were 40 and 50 (39 times each, 10.0%). Many other offers took on intermediate values spread broadly between 0 and 50; fully 95.1% of the offers were less than or equal to 50. The heterogeneity in proposer behavior, along with random rematching of subjects into new groups in every period, helped to ensure that recipients and observers were shown substantially varying ranges in x across periods; 38.7% of the ranges revealed to recipients and observers had 0 as the lower bound, while 40.0% of the revealed ranges included 50. The presence of such variation is an important precondition for the experiment's aim of measuring differences, if any, between recipient and observer perceptions of proposers' behavior in the context of the repeated‐trials experimental design. In an environment characterized by minimal variation, the distribution of proposers' behavior might well become obvious right away, reducing recipients' and observers' uncertainty to very low levels, and thereby minimizing the potential for uncovering any systematic differences that might exist in how participants and observers tend to form beliefs.            "
"19","The behavior of recipients in the imperfect‐information ultimatum game sessions suggests that, as in standard ultimatum game experiments, recipients are willing to reject offers on grounds of fairness—even though such rejections can be costly, and even though subjects are randomly rematched into new groups from one period to the next. In the aggregate, 64 of the 390 offers made during the four ultimatum game sessions were rejected. This 16.4% rejection rate is within the range observed in the literature on standard ultimatum game experiments (Camerer 2003, 53–55). When xmin = 0, the rejection rate is quite large, at 36.4% (55 rejections out of 151 offers). When xmin takes on a greater value—that is, when the range reported to recipients and observers does not include zero—rejections are in contrast extremely rare, occurring only 3.8% of the time (nine rejections out of 239 offers).            "
"20","The distribution of offers x made by proposers during the four dictator game sessions is presented in the right half of Table 1. The mean offer x over all periods was 23.0 (standard deviation = 22.3), strikingly similar to the mean offer value in the ultimatum game sessions. The mean offer x during the first eight periods was 24.4 (standard deviation = 21.8), while the mean offer x during the last seven periods was 21.3 (standard deviation = 22.9), suggesting, as in the ultimatum game, a modest tendency towards decreasing offers over time. These values are quite typical of proposers' offers in standard dictator game experiments, which typically average about 20% of the amount available for distribution (Camerer 2003, 56–58), suggesting that proposers' offers were not greatly affected by the imperfect‐information nature of the dictator game treatments.            "
"21","As in the ultimatum game sessions, there is considerable heterogeneity in proposers' offers in the dictator game. The modal offer in the dictator game was again 0 (77 times, or 21.1% of all offers), while the second most common offer was again 50 (45 times, 12.3%). Many other offers took on values spread broadly between 0 and 50; fully 94.3% of the offers were less than or equal to 50. As a result, a diverse set of ranges was revealed to recipients and observers; 49.9% of the announced ranges had 0 as the lower bound, while 27.9% of the announced ranges included 50."
"22","Taken together, these descriptive statistics suggest a distribution of proposer behavior in the dictator game that is strikingly similar to the distribution of proposers' ultimatum game offers, in terms not only of mean values, but also of other distributional properties including the modal values and the overall level of variance (heterogeneity in offers). These similarities between proposer behavior in the ultimatum and dictator games offer a set of useful “controls” in the analyses to be described shortly.            "
"23","The core empirical strategy for comparing recipients' and observers' assessments of the proposers' actions in the ultimatum and dictator games employs regression analysis. The basic regression specification, employed separately for the ultimatum game and for the dictator game, is:                "
"24","Any given play of either game contributes two data points to the corresponding regression—one corresponding to the recipient's assessment of the size of the offer, and one corresponding to the observer's assessment. These assessments of x are represented by the dependent variable ASSESS in the regression equation. The first independent variable, RANGEMEAN, corresponds to the midpoint (mean) of the possible range of offers communicated to the recipient and the observer, that is, . If subjects respond at all to the information described by the ranges, a positive relationship between ASSESS and RANGEMEAN would be expected. The second independent variable, OBSERVER, is a dummy variable equal to 1 for subjects in the observer role and 0 for subjects in the recipient role. This term allows the estimation of a direct effect of a subject's strategic role on belief formation. Finally, the third dependent variable is an interaction term, RANGEMEAN * OBSERVER, which allows the effect of OBSERVER to vary depending on the value of RANGEMEAN. For example, it allows the effect of OBSERVER to be different for offers more likely to be poor (those with a lower value of RANGEMEAN) than it is for offers more likely to be good (those with a higher value of RANGEMEAN). All of the regression analyses in the article were carried out using ordinary least squares (OLS), with standard errors clustered at the level of individual subjects. Exposure to different communicated ranges of offers is automatically balanced between recipients and observers at the aggregate level, since in each play of either game, any given range is communicated to one recipient and to one observer.            "
"25","This regression specification offers an estimation strategy that is simple, but that nonetheless goes to the heart of the research question. However, this specification does not take into account two structural factors of the experimental setting that may affect the way in which participants and observers formulate assessments: the varying degree of ambiguity in the information provided to the subjects (i.e., varying xwidth), and the fact that the experimental sessions are carried out over a number of periods.            "
"26","The central question motivating this research concerns the extent to which individuals' strategic roles may affect the way in which they come to perceive others' intentions. If individuals' roles do causally affect their perceptions, controlling for the information to which they have access, it stands to reason that the nature and magnitude of such effects will depend on what kind of information they are exposed to. Information that conveys another actor's intentions with little ambiguity and little room for alternative interpretations may be unlikely to lead different kinds of actors to differing conclusions, even if more ambiguous information may have the potential to do so. The choice to expose subjects to differing degrees of ambiguity in the form of range widths varying between 15 and 40 was influenced by the lack of guidance in the literature as to “how much” ambiguity, in a quantitative sense, might be required to observe any role differences that may exist. The first analysis carried out below estimates the basic regression specification separately for ultimatum‐game data corresponding to each of the range width values. These results, along with follow‐up analyses, suggest that it is appropriate to split the data sample into two halves, corresponding to settings of “Low Uncertainty” (range widths of 15, 20, and 25) and settings of “High Uncertainty” (range widths of 30, 35, and 40), because the estimations pool statistically within these categories but not across them. Thereafter, recipient and observer assessments are analyzed under each of these two regimes separately.            "
"27","A related issue is that the experimental sessions unfold over time. While recipients and observers received only indirect feedback as described above, nonetheless they did have some opportunity to learn about the nature of uncertainty in the experiment (and the distribution of proposers' behavior) from period to period. Such learning would of course decrease subjects' effective level of uncertainty over the course of an experimental session; therefore in the context of this study it is to be expected that any recipient‐observer differences would likely decrease over time.8 The analyses below track this intuition first using interaction terms that allow for time trends in recipient‐observer differences, but also using split‐sample analyses and graphical depictions of how behavior evolves period‐by‐period.            "
"28","Finally, in comparing recipients' and observers' assessments of proposers' intentions, it is crucial to ensure that any pattern of differences that is discovered is the result of a robust psychological phenomenon rather than being driven by a small number of outlying data points. This issue is particularly important given the between‐subjects experimental design. If a given subject fails to engage or understand the experimental tasks, then he or she may make nonsensical, outlying choices that could potentially induce differences in the data between recipients and observers where no meaningful difference exists. Perhaps the most intuitive method of scanning the data with such concerns in mind is to flag any assessments about the offer x that do not fall within the range announced to recipients and observers (that is, assessments y < xmin or y > xmax). Such “out‐of‐range” assessments are likely to have been the result of misunderstanding, misreading, or a typographical error by a subject in entering an assessment; “out‐of‐range” assessments not only correspond to infeasible values of the offer x, but from a payoff standpoint, are weakly dominated choices as well. In the ultimatum game sessions, subjects made a total of only 17 “out‐of‐range” assessments (out of 390, or 4.4%). Two subjects made “out‐of‐range” assessments in multiple periods (five and 10 times, respectively), suggesting that these subjects either failed to understand the experimental task or were motivated by factors other than accuracy in reporting assessments. In the dictator game sessions, subjects made a total of only five “out‐of‐range” assessments (out of 365, or 1.4%); no subject made such assessments in multiple periods.            "
"29"," Tables 2–4b below describe regression analyses carried out using a dataset from which all “out‐of‐range” assessments, as well as all assessments from the two “repeat‐offender” ultimatum‐game subjects described above, have been dropped. Such analyses are arguably appropriate because the dropped assessments are likely either to have been entered mistakenly, or to have been entered by subjects who did not understand the most basic features of the experimental setting. Further, because both “repeat‐offender” subjects happened to be randomly assigned to the observer rather than the recipient role, the potential exists for these two subjects' outlying behavior to induce recipient‐observer differences where no meaningful differences exist. Because experimental data points should never be dropped lightly, it is worth noting explicitly that the exclusions described above actually bias against the main experimental results. Because the null hypothesis is that there should be no difference between recipients' and observers' assessments, dropping outlying points that increase estimates of such differences is arguably the more conservative estimation strategy when demonstrating such differences.9"
"30","As noted above, from a theoretical perspective it is natural to suppose that the magnitude of any differences between recipients' and observers' assessments may vary depending on the degree of uncertainty present in a given situation. Table 2 therefore begins the analysis by carrying out the basic regression specification separately for each subsample corresponding to one possible value of xwidth = |xmax − xmin |—that is, {15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}. Keeping in mind that estimations within these subsamples are imprecise because of the limited amount of data within each, a clear pattern nonetheless emerges. The estimated coefficients for OBSERVER are of varying sign and small magnitude for the lower values of xwidth ={15, 20, 25}, but the estimated coefficients are of uniformly positive sign and of much larger, roughly comparable magnitudes for the higher values of xwidth ={30, 35, 40}, offering a preliminary suggestion that observers may make higher assessments of proposers' intentions than recipients do under these conditions. Table 2 therefore suggests a natural split‐sample estimation strategy, in which the data are divided into “Low Uncertainty”(xwidth ={15, 20, 25}) and “High Uncertainty”(xwidth ={30, 35, 40}) situations.10"
"31","The results of this split‐sample strategy are displayed in Tables 3a and 3b. Column (1) in both tables carries out the same basic estimation as in Table 2, pooling the data within each uncertainty category. As foreshadowed, the results suggest no statistically significant differences between observers and recipients in Low Uncertainty ultimatum games, but a striking relationship between subjects' randomly assigned strategic roles and their assessments of proposers' intentions in High Uncertainty ultimatum games. Across all periods of the ultimatum game sessions, the positive coefficient for OBSERVER indicates that, ceteris paribus, observers' assessments of proposers' offers are significantly higher than recipients' assessments are (p < 0.05) for low values of RANGEMEAN. The marginally significant negative coefficient for the interaction term RANGEMEAN * OBSERVER (p < 0.08), in contrast, offers an indication that this gap between observers' and recipients' assessments may decrease as RANGEMEAN increases—that is, as proposers' offers appear to be more generous.            "
"32","As described above, intuitions that subjects may learn over time about the structure of uncertainty in the experiment, thereby reducing the effective level of uncertainty, call for analyses in which any evolution in recipient‐observer differences can be discerned. Tables 3a and 3b approach this question in two distinct ways. Column (2) of both tables details a specification allowing the effects of OBSERVER and RANGEMEAN * OBSERVER to vary over TIME, using interaction terms (where TIME is simply the period number minus one). The overall marginal effect of OBSERVER remains statistically insignificant over time under Low Uncertainty (Table 3a).11 However, a strongly significant, and time‐varying, pattern of recipient‐observer differences emerges under High Uncertainty (Table 3b). As before, the coefficient of OBSERVER is strongly positive (p < 0.005), indicating that observers make higher assessments of proposer offers than recipients do; and, more strongly than before, it is apparent that the recipient‐observer gap declines as offers appear likely to have been more generous (p < 0.005). The negative coefficient of TIME * OBSERVER (p < 0.02) as well as the positive coefficient of TIME * RANGEMEAN * OBSERVER (p < 0.03) indicate that this pattern is, however, mitigated over time, consistent with the original intuitions. A further window on the time evolution of recipient‐observer differences is offered by Column (3), which estimates the basic regression specification for the first halves of the experimental sessions only (Periods 1–8), and column (4), which displays results for second‐half data (Periods 9–15). Consistent with expectations derived from Column (2), Table 3b demonstrates strong recipient‐observer differences in the first halves of experimental sessions, but no statistically significant effect in later periods.12 A more nuanced period‐by‐period analysis demonstrates that the measured recipient‐observer differences are not due only to anomalous behavior in one or two periods. The observed pattern of temporal decrease in recipient‐observer differences is consistent with the original intuition that, despite receiving limited feedback, subjects would nonetheless learn over time about the structure of uncertainty in the experiment.            "
"33","Panel (a) of Figure 1 offers a graphical depiction of the overall marginal effect of being an observer, as opposed to a recipient, on assessments of proposers' intentions as the mean of the observed range varies, based on the Table 3b High Uncertainty estimates for the first halves of ultimatum game sessions. The smallest possible value of RANGEMEAN under High Uncertainty is 15 (when xmin = 0 and xwidth = 30); when RANGEMEAN is at this minimum value, observers' assessments of proposers' offers exceed recipients' by about eight tokens. This gap is substantively quite large, constituting roughly a quarter of the range of possibilities communicated to recipients and observers. As indicated by the negative coefficient for RANGEMEAN * OBSERVER, this gap decreases as RANGEMEAN increases—that is, as the offer appears likelier to have been larger. Taking into account both the direct effect of OBSERVER and the interaction term RANGEMEAN * OBSERVER, the positive overall marginal effect of OBSERVER is significant at the p < 0.05 level when RANGEMEAN <37 and at the p < 0.10 level when RANGEMEAN <40. As depicted in the figure, the gap declines to statistical insignificance as RANGEMEAN increases beyond this point.            "
"34","                 Recipients' and Observers' Assessments in Experiment 1                         "
"35","Several additional estimations indicate that this distinctive pattern for High Uncertainty, early period ultimatum games is quite robust in several specific senses. First, observers' assessments were higher than recipients' for apparently low offers—but not for offers that appeared likely to be more generous—in all four ultimatum game sessions when these were analyzed separately. Second, this pattern also remains intact under plausible alternative regression specifications. For example, in principle subjects may have inferred that the randomly generated ranges were adjusted to avoid reporting negative values, potentially making subjects' responses qualitatively different when xmin = 0. However, regression specifications explicitly modeling this possibility return no statistically significant difference in assessments based on whether or not xmin = 0. Third, as noted above, approximately 5% of the ultimatum game offers were “exotic” or “hyper‐fair” offers exceeding 50. Data points corresponding to such atypical, extreme values of an independent variable can sometimes bias estimates of how subjects behave when the independent variable takes on more typical values, given OLS linearity assumptions; however, none of a variety of cut rules excluding abnormally high offers make a noticeable difference in the results.            "
"36","The regression results in Tables 3a and 3b, along with Figure 1a, provide information about the average effect of strategic role on subjects' assessments of proposers' intentions. Panel (b) of Figure 1 provides a finer‐grained picture by plotting the cumulative distributions of recipients' and observers' assessments when they were presented with the range [xmin, xmax ]=[0, 30]—the most commonly observed range during ultimatum game play (44 times in 390 periods, or fully 11.3% of the dataset). The cumulative distribution rises more swiftly for recipients than it does for observers, illustrating that recipients exhibit markedly lower assessments of proposers' offers than observers do. However, the panel also illustrates the high level of heterogeneity in the assessments made both by recipients and by observers. This heterogeneity is quite typical of the data overall.            "
"37","These results are striking. When uncertainty is sufficiently high, ultimatum game recipients and observers make systematically different assessments of proposers' intentions—even though subjects were randomly assigned to these roles and even though the experimental design explicitly controlled for the information to which recipients and observers had access.            "
"38","Data from the four dictator game sessions were analyzed using the same regression specifications employed in the previous section. The results, contained in Table 4, do not indicate any meaningful pattern of significant relationships between subjects' strategic roles and their assessments of proposers' intentions. The estimated overall marginal effect of being an observer as opposed to a recipient, depicted in panel (c) of Figure 1 under conditions equivalent to panel (a) for the ultimatum game, is consistently both substantively small and statistically insignificant, both for Low and High Uncertainty situations. Examination of period‐by‐period regression analyses also uncovers no clear pattern; about as many dictator game periods exhibit a negative as a positive recipient‐observer gap, there are no obvious time trends in the data, and most of the fitted values are substantively small. Panel (d) of Figure 1 offers further intuition about recipients' and observers' assessment behavior by plotting the cumulative distributions of subjects' assessments given the same range [xmin, xmax ]=[0, 30] depicted in ultimatum‐game Figure 1(b)—also a commonly observed range during dictator game play (44 times in 365 periods, 12.1%). While Figure 1b showed a substantial gap between the distributions of recipients' and observers' assessments, Figure 1d displays a much closer correspondence between recipients' and observers' estimates, reflecting the lack of a statistically significant difference. However, Figure 1d resembles Figure 1b in one very important regard: the graph indicates a substantial degree of heterogeneity in the assessments made both by recipients and by observers. This high degree of heterogeneity suggests that in the dictator game, as in the ultimatum game, it was far from obvious to recipients and observers how proposers were behaving; the absence of role effects in the dictator game is not due merely to all recipients and observers having made identical, very low assessments.            "
"39","The context of assessment formation in the ultimatum and dictator game sessions was strikingly similar in several key respects. The form of proposers' offer decisions, the structure of uncertainty, and the language used to describe the setting to subjects were all identical in both games, as was the method by which recipients' and observers' assessments were elicited. Further, the distributions of proposers' offers were extremely similar in the ultimatum and dictator games in terms of mean behavior, modal behavior, and the variance in behavior. The structural commonalities, along with proposers' behavioral similarities, suggest that recipients and observers faced highly similar levels of uncertainty in making their assessments in both games. Indeed, subjects' payoffs from the postplay question eliciting assessments were very similar in the two games (averaging 32.8 tokens per period out of a possible 100 for all recipients, and 34.4 for all observers in the ultimatum game; 38.8 for all recipients, and 36.4 for all observers in the dictator game). Notably, the payoff difference across games for observers, whose task is identical in both games, is statistically insignificant (p < 0.46). Further, the overall variance in recipients' and observers' assessments as a function of xwidth was also remarkably stable across the two games. These observations offer compelling evidence that proposers' behavior was no more predictable for subjects in the dictator game than it was in the ultimatum game, and that recipients and observers faced similar levels of uncertainty in making assessments in both contexts. As depicted in Figures 1b and 1d, subjects receiving identical information made widely distributed assessments, both in the ultimatum game and in the dictator game. Thus, it is not the case that no recipient‐observer differences are measured in the dictator game merely because, for example, all subjects in both roles make extremely low assessments all of the time.            "
"40","Why, then, do recipients make lower assessments of proposers' offers than observers do in the ultimatum game—but not in the dictator game? In the ultimatum game, recipients and observers receive the same information about proposers' offers, but their roles differ in essentially two respects. Recipients have the opportunity to respond to proposers' offers, while observers do not; and recipients' payoffs are affected by proposers' choices, while observers' are not. This observation suggests two interesting hypotheses about why recipients' and observers' assessments differ in the ultimatum game. First, recipients' assessments may be lower than observers' because of recipients' opportunity to accept or reject offers. Second, recipients' assessments may be lower because proposers' choices are payoff‐relevant for recipients, but not for observers."
"41","Because recipients and observers differ from one another in two key respects in the ultimatum game, it is not possible to make well‐supported inferences about the independent effects of each using ultimatum‐game data alone. Because recipients and observers differ in only one of these respects in the dictator game, a comparison between ultimatum and dictator game assessments can provide inferential leverage. If dictator game assessments were to exhibit a similar pattern of recipient‐observer differences to that of ultimatum game assessments, such a result would implicate the payoff‐relevance of offers to recipients (but not observers) as the key causal factor. If, on the other hand, dictator game assessments were to exhibit no role effects, this would offer evidence that individuals' assessments can be influenced directly by the set of strategic options they possess, controlling for information. The results described earlier therefore lend weight to the latter interpretation.            "
"42","In order to defend and strengthen this inference, it is important to consider potential alternative explanations for the observed patterns of assessments. As a starting point, it is useful to reflect on the nature of the “assessments” that recipients and observers make. These assessments are not a direct measure of recipients' and observers' beliefs about what proposers had intended to do. The information these actors receive comes in the form of a range [xmin, xmax ] into which the true offer, x, fell. Recipients' and observers' beliefs about x would therefore take the form of a probability distribution over [xmin, xmax ]. To reliably elicit a meaningful estimate of such a distribution from experimental subjects would be difficult, if not impossible. As such, the approach adopted was to elicit a single integer‐valued “assessment” y, and to reward subjects based on the accuracy of these assessments. As such, subjects' assessments reflect, but do not directly measure, their distributions of beliefs about proposers' offers. Different individuals may map beliefs onto assessments differently, based on such factors as their degrees of risk aversion; however, the random assignment of subjects to the recipient and observer roles means that these two groups can be expected to share similar distributions of these factors. The practice of random assignment, along with rewards for accurate assessments, makes these values y reasonable proxies for subjects' beliefs about proposers' intentions, particularly for the purpose of comparing recipient‐observer differences across different settings.            "
"43","While random assignment is, in this way, powerful, it is important to ensure that features of the recipient and observer roles do not themselves greatly affect individual attitudes towards risk aversion. For example, in the ultimatum game, observers receive a fixed game payment of 40 tokens per period, while recipients received, on average, 24.8 tokens per period (standard deviation = 21.7). In the context of the ultimatum game itself, it is imaginable that this difference in game payoffs might induce differential incentives in attempting to secure assessment payoffs. For example, a recipient might think, “If the offer was poor, I can at least ensure a decent payoff by entering a low assessment. If the offer then turned out to be good, then my assessment may have been wrong, but in that case at least my game payoff was good.” That is, the ultimatum game results in isolation could potentially be explained, at least in part, by differential monetary incentives in making assessments, based on induced differences in risk aversion or wealth effects across roles. However, comparison of the ultimatum and dictator game results suggests strongly that such an account does not provide a compelling explanation of the ultimatum game results. Observers' game payments were fixed at 40 tokens per round in both games; dictator‐game recipients received, on average, 23.0 tokens per period (standard deviation = 22.3), practically identical to the ultimatum‐game values. Thus, if risk aversion or wealth effects like those described above were the correct account of recipient‐observer differences in the ultimatum game, such differences should also be observed in the dictator game. The absence of role differences in the dictator game therefore casts considerable doubt on such accounts of the gap in the ultimatum game.13"
"44","Another reasonable concern about the measurement of assessments in the ultimatum game is that recipients' assessments may be affected not by the general fact of having to respond to offers—the priming argument advanced above—but rather by the particular choice to accept or reject that they have just made. Psychologically, subjects who reject an offer may in theory subsequently find it more comfortable to believe that the payoff they have foregone is smaller, either to minimize the potential for regret or to downplay the possibility that they may have punished a proposer whose offer had actually been reasonably generous. Similarly, subjects who accept an offer may find it preferable to believe that the payoff they have accepted is larger, either because this prospect is more pleasant to contemplate, or because it may be unpleasant to imagine having been duped into accepting a very poor offer. If such effects exist, then depending on their relative sizes, they might induce systematic differences in how recipients and observers formulate assessments from ambiguous evidence. More clearly, such effects should induce a significant correlation between recipients' assessments and the decisions to accept (rather than reject) offers. The data, however, indicate no such correlation. Recall that almost all ultimatum game rejections took place when xmin = 0; although the range widths varied, different recipients nonetheless had roughly comparable information about proposers' offers in the 151 periods involving xmin = 0. Yet within this universe of cases, the correlation between recipients' assessments and the decision to accept was −0.028. The absence of any positive relationship between these two variables suggests that the recipient‐observer gap in the ultimatum game is not merely an artifact of recipients' reactions to their own specific decisions to accept or reject offers.14"
"45","That these potential alternative explanations fail to gather empirical support adds strength to the inference that recipients' ability to accept or reject offers causes the systematic difference between recipients' and observers' assessments of proposers' intentions in the ultimatum game. At the same time, several key questions remain unanswered. Experiment 1 was carried out in a context of ambiguity, in which subjects were not informed of the underlying structure of uncertainty. While such a context describes many real‐world settings, it also prevents the definition of a clear Bayesian benchmark for judgment formation. The absence of such a benchmark blurs the interpretation of the recipient‐observer gap. Experiment 2 was carried out as a means of addressing these issues.            "
"46","In the six sessions that comprised Experiment 2, 126 subjects took part. Two sessions each were devoted to the Negative‐Active, Negative‐Passive, and Positive‐Active Treatments (42 subjects in each treatment)."
"47","Each period, the computer randomly assigned the proposer to be one of two types, which will be referred to here as Good and Bad (the experimental protocol used the more neutral labels “Green” and “Red,” respectively). At the beginning of each period, proposer, recipient, and observer alike were all informed of the probability (p%) that the proposer would be Good for the period. The proposer was then informed of her type, but the recipient and observer observed only the prior probability p%.            "
"48","After learning her type, the proposer chose either High or Low. A proposer of the Good type received 50 tokens from choosing High but 25 from choosing Low; a proposer of the Bad type instead received 25 tokens from choosing High but 50 from choosing Low. The recipient received 10 tokens if the proposer chose High, but 0 tokens if the proposer chose Low.            "
"49","The recipient and observer then observed an identical “message” about the proposer's choice. In the two “Negative” treatments, a choice of High resulted in a message “High” with probability q%, but a message “Low” with probability (100 − q)%; a choice of Low always resulted in a message “Low.” Thus, in the Negative treatments, information was biased in the direction of indicating a message “Low,” the choice unfavorable to the recipient, and recipients and observers could not be certain what choice the proposer actually had made upon receiving a message “Low.” In contrast, in the “Positive” Treatment, a choice of Low resulted in a message “Low” with probability r%, but a message “High” with probability (100 − r)%; a choice of High always resulted in a message “High.” Thus, in the Positive treatment, information was biased in the direction of indicating a message “High,” the choice favorable to the recipient, and recipients and observers could not be certain what choice the proposer actually had made upon receiving a message “High.” All aspects of this structure of information were explicitly described to subjects. In the Negative (Positive) treatments, the values of p and q (p and r) were independently and randomly drawn, for every group in every period, from the uniform distribution {20%, 21%, …, 79%, 80%}. Proposer, recipient, and observer were informed of these values at the beginning of each period.            "
"50","In the two “Active” treatments, the recipient then decided whether or not to “sign a contract” with the proposer. A recipient choosing “sign contract” received 40 tokens if the proposer was Good, but 0 tokens if the proposer was Bad. A recipient choosing “decline contract” instead received 20 tokens, regardless of the proposer's type. In the “Passive” treatment, the recipient's ultimate payoffs also depended on the proposer's type, but the recipient had no opportunity to decide whether to sign a contract with the proposer. Instead, the recipient simply received 40 tokens if the proposer was Good, but 10 tokens if the proposer was Bad (an amount that was chosen with an eye towards balancing recipients' expected payoffs across Active and Passive treatments). In both Active and Passive treatments, Proposers of either type received 10 tokens if the recipient chose “sign contract,” but 0 tokens if the recipient chose “decline contract.”            "
"51","In the Active treatments, recipients are best off choosing “sign contract” if the proposer is Good, but “decline contract” if the proposer is Bad. Recipients can attempt to discern how likely it is that the proposer actually is Good by observing the noisy message about the proposer's action; Good proposers are best off choosing High, but Bad proposers are best off choosing Low. This game captures, in a simple form, a challenge commonly faced by actors who are uncertain about their counterpart's intentions in bargaining and negotiations. In the Passive treatment, recipients are directly affected by the proposer's type and do not have the ability to choose “sign contract” or “decline contract.” As such, the relationship between Active and Passive treatments is highly analogous to the relationship between the ultimatum and dictator games."
"52","Once play of the relevant game in a given period was complete, subjects answered a postplay “question” offering an additional opportunity to earn payoffs. Subjects received no feedback about the outcome of game play before proceeding to the postplay questions."
"53","Recipients and observers were asked to assess the likelihood that the proposer was of the Good type, on a 0 to 100 percentage point scale. Recipients and observers were paid for their assessments according to a “proper scoring rule,” a commonly employed mechanism that induces (financial) incentives to reveal beliefs as accurately as possible.15"
"54","As in Experiment 1, subjects remained in the same role throughout any given session, but were randomly rematched into new groups at the beginning of each period.16 Also as in Experiment 1, subjects received only limited feedback from period to period. Proposers were informed what “message” had been observed about their choice, but were not informed of recipients' or observers' choices or assessments; recipients and observers received no information about proposers' types or choices aside from any information implicit in the message they observed.            "
"55","The payoffs for proposers in the games above were chosen to ensure that a proposer of either type would have a strictly dominant strategy (High for Good proposers, Low for Bad proposers). This allows for the definition of an unambiguous Bayesian benchmark for beliefs about the proposer's type in each game, because a proposer of either type must play her strictly dominant strategy in any Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium. In the Negative treatments, given proposers' dominant strategies, Bayes' Rule implies posterior beliefs Prob (Good | message = High) = 1 and . In the Positive treatment, given proposers' dominant strategies, Bayes' Rule implies posterior beliefs  and Prob (Good | message = Low) = 0. Thus, certain messages were partially informative to recipients and observers: specifically, a message “Low” in the Negative treatments, and a message “High” in the Positive treatment.            "
"56","Variation across periods in the probability parameters (p and q in the Negative treatments; p and r in the Positive treatment) ensured that these partially informative messages should induce different posterior beliefs from one period to the next, in a way described by the Bayesian benchmark. The analyses below relate recipients' and observers' actual belief assessments to the values prescribed by the Bayesian benchmark when partially informative messages are received.            "
"57","Before proceeding to these analyses, it is important to note that in all three treatments, proposers of each type chose their dominant action at extremely high rates; averaging across treatments, Good proposers chose “High” 91.0% of the time (201/221), while Bad proposers chose “Low” 92.5% of the time (184/199), with no significant differences across treatments. The high correspondence between proposers' dominant strategies and proposers' actual choices offers important support for the assumptions underlying the Bayesian benchmarks that were calculated above."
"58","The analysis of recipients' and observers' beliefs employs a regression specification of the same form used in Experiment 1:                "
"59","The results from the Negative treatments are strongly reminiscent of those in Experiment 1. In the Negative‐Active Treatment—the “analogue” of the ultimatum game—the recipient and observer reveal posterior beliefs that are statistically different from one another. In contrast, in the Negative‐Passive Treatment—the analogue of the dictator game—the recipient and observer reveal posterior beliefs that are statistically indistinguishable from one another. These results are described in columns (1)–(2) of Table 5, as well as panels (a)–(d) of Figure 2. In Figure 2, the beliefs implied by the Bayesian benchmark upon receipt of a partially informative message lie along the horizontal axes; in each panel, the minimum and maximum values plotted along this axis correspond to the minimum and maximum values of BAYESBELIEF actually experienced in the relevant treatment, given the realized draws of p, q, and r.            "
"60","                 Recipients' and Observers' Beliefs in Experiment 2                         "
"61","The leftmost panels in Figure 2 offer a graphical representation of the regression results. They depict the best‐fit regression lines summarizing recipients' and observers' beliefs, as well as the relationship between these best‐fit lines and Bayesian benchmark beliefs. In each of these panels, beliefs perfectly consistent with the Bayesian benchmark would fall along the diagonal. In the Negative‐Passive Treatment, recipients' and observers' posterior beliefs are statistically indistinguishable from one another (regression (2)); as a result, their best‐fit lines are strikingly similar (panel (c)). Both recipients and observers deviate from the (perfectly diagonal) Bayesian benchmark, although the extent of this deviation is relatively modest. In the Negative‐Active Treatment, recipients' and observers' posterior beliefs differ in a statistically significant manner (regression (1)); as a result, their best‐fit lines differ considerably (panel (a)). Observers' best‐fit line strongly resembles the best‐fit line for observers in the Negative‐Passive Treatment, deviating in a similar modest way from the Bayesian benchmark. Recipients' best‐fit line, however, deviates to a much greater extent; the slope of this line is 0.38, far lower than the slope for observers (0.85) and far from the value corresponding to the Bayesian benchmark (1.00). The slope can be thought of as a measure of the extent to which actors are responsive to “changing conditions”—variation in the values of p and q that determine the “correct” Bayesian posterior beliefs. The result here indicates that recipients in the Negative‐Active Treatment are in this sense much less responsive to changing conditions than are observers in the Negative‐Active Treatment—or recipients in the Negative‐Passive Treatment.            "
"62","The recipient‐observer difference in the Negative‐Active Treatment, and the lack of such a difference in the Negative‐Passive Treatment, strongly recall the ultimatum and dictator game results and offer further evidence that the strategic ability to respond to the proposer's action has a direct effect on judgment formation. This inference is heightened by the existence of the Bayesian benchmark in Experiment 2; recipients update their beliefs less accurately when they have the ability to respond to a counterpart.            "
"63","This finding is robust in a few important senses. First, for the Negative‐Active Treatment, the slope of the observer best‐fit line exceeds the slope of the recipient best‐fit line by 0.47 when the estimation is restricted to Periods 1–5, and by 0.45 when the estimation is restricted to Periods 6–10, indicating a recipient‐observer difference that remains quite stable over the course of the experimental sessions. Second, in the Negative‐Active Treatment, best‐fit lines are significantly flatter both for recipients who “signed” and for recipients who “declined,” relative to the best‐fit line for observers.            "
"64","The rightmost panels in Figure 2 visually represent the overall marginal effects of being an observer rather than a recipient in the different treatments. Panel (d) shows that there is no statistically significant difference between recipients and observers in the Negative‐Passive Treatment, consistent with the intuition from panel (c). Panel (b), however, shows that observers' posterior beliefs that the proposer is Good are significantly higher than recipients' at higher values of BAYESBELIEF, but there is no significant difference at lower values of BAYESBELIEF.17 When it is quite likely, from a Bayesian perspective, that the Proposer is Bad, recipients' and observers' beliefs are statistically indistinguishable; as it becomes more likely that the Proposer may, in spite of a Low signal, actually be Good, recipients' and observers' beliefs appear to diverge.            "
"65","In the ultimatum game, recipients' and observers' assessments differed when the proposer's offer appeared likely to have been low, but not when the proposer's offer appeared likely to have been high. In the Experiment 2 Negative treatments, of course, ex post uncertainty about the proposer's type is induced only by a Low signal—and recipients' beliefs about the proposer were accordingly found to be more critical when it was sufficiently uncertain that the proposer was of the Bad type. The Positive‐Active Treatment addresses how recipients and observers form beliefs in a setting where ex post uncertainty is instead induced only by a High signal.            "
"66","The results can be found in column (3) of Table 5, along with panels (e) and (f) of Figure 2. Interestingly, in contrast to the Negative‐Active Treatment, there is no statistically significant difference between the ways in which recipients and observers form beliefs in the Positive‐Active Treatment. The best‐fit line for recipients, shown in panel (e), is estimated to be slightly flatter (slope 0.71) than the best‐fit line for observers (slope 0.88), but this difference is not significant; consistent with this, panel (f) shows that the marginal effects of role are always insignificant as well. These findings add further weight to the Experiment 1 result that recipient‐observer differences are small or nonexistent when these agents receive more “positive” signals about the proposer's behavior—in the Experiment 1 context, ranges suggesting that the proposer's offer was likely to have been fair.            "
"67","Do participants in bargaining and conflict form beliefs about one another in systematically different ways than a disinterested observer would, even controlling for the information to which actors have access? More generally, are actors' assessments of others' intentions colored by the strategic situations in which the evaluators find themselves? The laboratory experiments described in this article suggest that the answer to these questions is yes. By randomly assigning subjects to different roles in experimental games and controlling for the information to which these subjects had access, it was demonstrated that participants and observers do, under some circumstances, formulate systematically different assessments of another actor's intentions. Comparing patterns of participant and observer assessments across different experimental games offered more nuanced evidence as to the potential causes of such strategic role effects on perceptions of others. Both of the experiments reported here point towards the same basic conclusions, despite considerable differences in context; in Experiment 1, recipients and observers made assessments of a proposer's action, elicited by a reward window, in a setting of ambiguity, while in Experiment 2, recipients and observers made assessments of a proposer's type, elicited by a proper scoring rule, in a setting of uncertainty."
"68","Of course, extrapolating even from a set of laboratory experiments to real‐world settings is an uncertain endeavor. Nonetheless, stylized experiments such as the ones described here can reasonably be thought of as posing “tough tests” for biases in belief formation: subjects are given financial incentives for accuracy, are randomly assigned to experimental roles in which they have little or no emotional investment, and receive clearly specified information. Behavioral research suggests that all of these factors are likely more conducive to “rational” judgment formation than corresponding features of real‐world settings, in which actors do not have direct financial incentives for accuracy, may be more profoundly invested in their roles, or may receive information that is more poorly specified or more difficult to interpret. While external validity concerns nonetheless remain, stylized experiments can offer a high degree of internal validity, based on the ability to randomly assign subjects to different roles while controlling for the information to which they have access. As such, stylized experiments are conducive to making clean causal inferences about the effects of strategic role on belief formation that could not reasonably be demanded of observational data or case studies. As always, a broad and deep understanding of political processes is best pursued using multiple methodological approaches; laboratory experimentation, survey research, and the qualitative study of empirical cases can, in tandem, through and in spite of their diverse strengths and weaknesses, teach us more than any one approach could on its own.         "
"69","The experimental results have important implications for our understanding of conflict processes. Many existing models of conflict emphasize actors' ex ante uncertainty about each others' intentions—and the fact that successful conflict resolution can require this uncertainty to be resolved in a positive way.18 At the same time, such models often assume that actors' choices are perfectly observable to one another, even if their underlying motives are not. The experimental results here suggest, first, that explicitly modeling this kind of imperfect information may be necessary to understand important features of judgment formation during conflicts, and second, that models assuming fully Bayesian‐rational agency may not always be the right ones. Further, building more psychologically accurate theories of judgment formation in conflicts can be expected to offer novel insights into optimal mechanisms for conflict resolution. For example, in a setting where “negative” signals about a counterpart are sometimes unavoidable even when that counterpart is on her best behavior, the results here suggest that a mechanism attempting to build trust through the exchange of reciprocal “small” gestures may inadvertently help to entrench negative preconceptions in a previously unanticipated way. Mediators or other actors who structure conflict resolution may find that such psychological insights can inform when actors should be placed in more responsive or more passive positions in terms of what steps are asked of them in different stages of negotiations. Further research into the psychology of interactive judgment formation may ultimately aid not only in our understanding of conflicts, but also in finding their solutions.         "
