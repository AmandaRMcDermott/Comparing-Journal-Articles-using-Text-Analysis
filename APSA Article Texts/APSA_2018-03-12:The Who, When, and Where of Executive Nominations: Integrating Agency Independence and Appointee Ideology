"1","On April 29, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated MIT economist and Nobel Prize winner Peter A. Diamond to a vacancy on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the Fed). Despite a favorable report by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on July 28, the nomination was returned to the president due to filibuster threats from the Republican minority. Not to be deterred, on September 19, Obama renominated Diamond, who received another favorable committee report but saw his nomination returned that December. This dance was repeated one last time in 2011: Diamond was renominated in January, there was a favorable report, but Republican filibuster threats stymied efforts. Diamond ultimately removed himself from consideration on June 5, ending the saga after more than a year.1"
"2","While the reasons for Diamond's inability to be confirmed are numerous, it appears both his ideology and the nature of the Fed itself were proximate causes. Reflecting this, Senator Richard Shelby—then the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs—argued Diamond's ideology was “not the economic philosophy the Fed should be embracing at this point in our economic history” and suggested the nature of the position itself invited higher levels of scrutiny and opposition.2 Expanding on the latter point, he maintained the position required additional due diligence by the Senate, as the Fed's independence made it “the least accountable agency in our government, [as] Fed Governors exercise immense power with very little oversight.”3 Thus, he asserted Dr. Diamond “might be fit for some cabinet job, but not to be a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.”4"
"3","In many respects, this story is unsurprising: A nominee with strong qualifications, prima facie, is rejected by a Senate whose key members are ideologically opposed to the president. Yet, for scholars interested in empirical models of executive appointments, two features of the failed nomination are not fully incorporated into the literature: (1) nominee ideology and (2) the independence of the position in question given the agency involved."
"4","In terms of ideology, empirical analyses of executive nominations typically focus on the ideological and/or partisan differences between the president and key senators, with the standard result being that divergence between the president and the Senate results in longer confirmation periods and higher rejection rates (Chiou and Rothenberg 2014; McCarty and Razaghian 1999; Ostrander 2016). To the extent nominees’ ideologies are considered, they are often proxied by the president's ideology or estimated using application‐specific methods and data lacking generalizability to larger pools of nominees.5 In contrast, theorists pay great attention to nominee ideology, with many treatments applying variants of the Romer and Rosenthal (1978) setter model. Senates typically are assumed to be less willing to confirm nominees whose preferences diverge from their own (or, rather, from a key Senate actor, such as the filibuster pivot or, in the post‐filibuster world, the median). Presidents respond by moderating nominee choices, or withholding them altogether, resulting in an equilibrium where greater president–Senate ideological divergence results in more moderate nominees where they exist (Asmussen 2011; Chiou and Rothenberg 2014; Hollibaugh 2015a, 2015b; Nokken and Sala 2000).         "
"5","Beyond ideology, other factors, such as the nature of the agency in question and the independence it provides for decision makers, may be at play. Fed commissioners, for example, are important not only because the Fed is structured so new members can significantly affect the agency median, but also because of the insulation created by the position's longevity and other features. Unlike many other presidentially nominated bureaucrats, whom the president can replace (perhaps given pressure from, or in coordination with, Congress) and routinely turn over with administration change, Fed commissioners receive 14‐year terms and do not resign when those nominating them depart office. They are more independent, possess specialized knowledge, and are less subject to ex post control or removal by political principals.6,7"
"6","Yet, the empirical literature on executive nominations rarely accounts for the nature of the agency in question and its potential interaction with the preferences of nominees. To the extent that studies of the appointments process focus on structural characteristics, they typically examine where in the agency hierarchy a position lies as well as whether the target agency is a commission, and often simply by employing dichotomous control variables (but see Chiou and Rothenberg 2014). Distinctions of influence, longevity, and insulation are rarely considered (but see Nixon 2001). This omission is intriguing, since much research shows concerns about policy outcomes are relevant to agency design (e.g., Bawn 1995, 1997; D. Epstein and O'Halloran 1999; McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1987) and, therefore, to the level of independence allotted to agency appointees. Somewhat more relevant are studies of bureaucratic politics that shed some light on the importance of agency structure and appointee independence. For example, previous research suggests agencies with more independent heads produce policies less in line with the appointing president's preferences and are less likely to be delegated authority via executive orders (Arel‐Bundock, Atkinson, and Potter 2015; Kennedy 2016).         "
"7","Moreover, nominee ideologies and structural characteristics have proven relevant for judicial appointments. Judicial nominees perceived as extreme face higher rejection rates and longer delays (Asmussen 2011; Bailey 2007; Binder and Maltzman 2002; Cameron, Cover, and Segal 1990; Shipan and Shannon 2003), and nominations for higher positions (notably chief justice of the Supreme Court; see Ruckman 1993; Segal 1987; Shipan and Shannon 2003) and higher courts have lower confirmation rates and/or longer confirmation periods (L. Epstein and Segal 2005; Hartley and Holmes 1997; Nixon and Goss 2001; Martinek, Kemper, and Van Winkle 2002; Stratmann and Garner 2004).         "
"8","However, until recent years, there existed a distinction between judicial and bureaucratic scholarship, with the former more often incorporating measures of appointee ideology and independence.8 This is not due to different beliefs about what is relevant, but rather to the latter's long‐standing lack of appropriate data. Judicial scholars have opinion data to estimate judicial preferences in the same space as other political actors, allowing them to incorporate nominee/appointee ideology directly into empirical models (e.g., Bailey 2007; Bailey and Chang 2001; L. Epstein et al. 2006). And the hierarchical structure and relative importance of different roles and aspects of the judiciary make integrating structure easier compared to the bureaucratic analogue.         "
"9","That said, recent innovations in both political methodology and data collection now enable scholars to estimate both the political preferences of many—if not of all—executive nominees and agency executives in the same ideological space as other political actors (Bonica 2014) and the extent to which federal agencies and departments are independent (Selin 2015). Leveraging these advances, we incorporate nominee ideology and what we will label decision maker independence into empirical models of the appointment process, examining a series of theoretically motivated hypotheses.         "
"10","Our findings enrich our understanding of the nominations process and suggest future research directions. Political stakes rise when agency decision makers are less vulnerable to ex post removal and/or monitoring. In these cases, presidents put forth nominees whose preferences are more to the Senate's liking; however, even with these concessions, the Senate responds with additional scrutiny, elongating confirmation battles and rejecting more nominees. Additionally, since the Senate defers more to the president when the two have similar preferences, presidents propose nominees whom they find more ideologically compatible in such instances. Finally, reflecting the interaction of time, ideology, and differences in independence, the distributions of nominee types and appointment targets change over a president's tenure, with those more in tune with—and subject to greater control by—the chief executive appointed earlier in presidential terms.         "
"11","Incorporating nominee ideology and appointee independence into empirical models of the appointments process is complicated because of the myriad contrasting features and the numerous assumptions required. Obviously, preferences differ between and among nominees, Senate pivots, and presidents. But, as implied above, the positions also vary by decision maker independence, as well as other factors (e.g., mission, the pool of potential nominees, the position's importance). Additionally, there are timing considerations, as strategic contexts can diverge a great deal depending on when a nomination occurs. Beyond this, assumptions must be made about, among other things, how presidents and senators trade off time and ideology and how they value appointments to one agency relative to others."
"12","Rather than formally modeling this situation, we sketch multiple hypotheses drawn on deductive logic and the extant literature, focusing on how nominee ideology and decision maker independence should affect the appointments process. We start with four assumptions:            "
"13","Subject to constraints, presidents and senators attempt to maximize policy returns from appointments;"
"14","Neither presidents nor senators are risk seeking, and they weakly prefer uncertainty‐reducing processes, such as vetting (Hollibaugh 2015b; Sen and Spaniel 2017);                  "
"15","Presidents are strategic, basing their nominations on expected Senate decisions; and"
"16","Appointees to some agencies have more individual independence than others."
"17","Given these assumptions and our survey of previous research, we develop six empirical hypotheses. The first three flow directly from theoretical work on appointments generally and empirical results on judicial appointees specifically; the remaining three, by integrating decision maker independence, extend such logic with the caveat that no existing work on appointments factors in independence."
"18","Our first hypothesis stems from the relationship between Senate and nominee ideology and is consistent with the standard logic of legislative voting and studies of judicial confirmations (Bailey 2007; L. Epstein et al. 2006; Shipan 2008). All else equal, the Senate should be less likely to confirm nominees ideologically distant from its pivotal member, as such appointees should be less likely to steer agency policies in the direction of Senate preferences.9 Operationalizing the Senate's ideological preferences as those of the filibuster pivot leads to our first hypothesis:10                        "
"19","Our second hypothesis also focuses on the interaction of Senate and nominee ideology but builds in risk avoidance. Simply put, we follow existing claims that longer confirmation processes reduce uncertainty and can make nominees who are not immediately confirmable acceptable after a prolonged vetting (Hollibaugh 2015b; Sen and Spaniel 2017), either because senators learn more about the nominee in question and/or about the depth or shallowness of the potential nominees pool.11 Indeed, research on judicial nominations finds confirming more ideologically extreme nominees takes longer (Basinger and Mak 2010; Cameron, Cover, and Segal 1990). Moreover, increasing time until confirmation decreases the length of time nominees will serve, on average, since many will leave at the end of the president's administration, providing an additional rationale for delay by wary senators. These factors produce a second hypothesis:            "
"20","Our third hypothesis flows from the first two and applies a similar logic to the president. Anticipating senatorial response, presidents should not sit idly by. Rather, knowing senators are less likely to confirm ideologically distant nominees, and that those they do confirm will take more time, presidents should moderate their choices to increase the likelihood of successful and quicker confirmation, offering candidates less ideologically compatible with themselves but closer to the Senate pivot:            "
"21","Turning to the previously undeveloped impact of decision maker independence, we begin with the relationship between the Senate and nominee and then turn to the presidential response. Per the former, given the greater costs of confirming bad appointees when the ability to remove appointees or otherwise alter appointment terms is less, nominations to agencies such as the Fed should face higher hurdles. Appointees to the Fed—and other agencies with similar appointee rights—are protected by features such as fixed terms, reduced abilities of political principals to remove them without cause, the freedom of not having direct oversight by the Executive Office of the President, and the like. From the perspective of politicians, not only are nominations for these more insulated positions less frequent, they typically are subject to lower turnover so that the cost of a bad choice is high. However, even with such low turnover, the pools of possible appointees tend to be restricted due to factors like expertise requirements, party balancing obligations, and statutorily prescribed numbers of members. The latter heightens the difficulty of identifying qualified nominees, since finding those who are qualified and ideologically compatible to all relevant actors will be more difficult than for other positions. Presidents will want friendly appointees who meet the criteria for office, but the Senate will be warier since confirming unfriendly nominees who will likely remain beyond the administration's end and will be otherwise difficult to remove will be more costly than would otherwise be the case. Anticipating the high price of making a poor choice, while recognizing the possibility that rejecting a nominee from an already shallow pool might result in the position ultimately going unfilled, will induce the Senate to spend more time vetting nominees to ensure that they are acceptable (when it does not reject them outright). In sum, given the higher expected costs to the Senate of a bad decision, we expect, all else equal, that nominations to agencies where decision makers are more independent should be less likely to be confirmed and, if voted up, to have to wait longer due to Senate vetting:13                        "
"22","Finally, strategic presidents should preempt senatorial recalcitrance and higher levels of scrutiny of those nominees to more independent agencies by nominating individuals more palatable to the filibuster pivot. Presumably, this would assuage senatorial concerns about reduced abilities to control nominees ex post, and yields our final hypothesis:            "
"23","We examine our hypotheses using data on all executive (e.g., nonjudicial and nonmilitary) nominations from the 100th–111th Congresses.14 Given our hypotheses, we focus on confirmation success, length of Senate deliberations, and presidents’ ideological choices of nominees. To explain these outcomes, we concentrate on ideologies of nominating presidents, Senate filibuster pivots, and nominees, as well as the decision‐making independence of potential appointees.         "
"24","Before estimating fully specified models of Senate decisions (which we expect will contextualize presidential decisions), we present Kaplan‐Meier (1958) plots of the relationships between time and our key variables: decision maker independence and nominee ideology. Our dependent variable is always Time with Senate, measured by the number of days between the date a nomination was sent to the Senate and the last date the nomination was pending (sample mean = 109.4 days, including for the 22.5% who were never confirmed). Each independent variable is discretized into “Low” and “High” categories, corresponding to whether an observation is above or below the variable's median. Figure 1 presents our plots, oriented to highlight the cumulative probability of confirmation, and each curve displays the bivariate relationship between the independent variable and the Senate's decisions during a congress.15"
"25","Kaplan‐Meier Plots of Confirmation Success and Duration (Agency Decision Maker Independence and Appointee Ideology)"
"26","Note: Agency Decision Maker Independence is measured using the first factor of Selin's (2015) agency independence scores; Nominee–Filibuster Divergence is measured with Bonica's (2014) CFscores. The 95% confidence intervals are shown for each relationship.                     "
"27","Figure 1’s left panel shows the relationship between decision maker independence and Senate decisions. We measure Agency Decision Maker Independence using the first dimension of Selin's (2015) agency independence scores (what she labels Independence of Decision Makers). This measure is generated from a Bayesian latent factor model (Quinn 2004) based on 50 structural features of 321 federal agencies and bureaus.16 The first factor (M = 0.204, SD = 0.871) corresponds to how agency structure affects the political independence of decision makers, whereas the second (M = 0.333, SD = 0.896) taps the relationship between agency structure and political independence of the policy process. The former is positively correlated with structural features such as fixed and longer‐term lengths, staggered terms (limiting the ability to change a board or commission's entire membership at once), constraints on the president or other political principals to remove appointees except for cause, expertise and/or partisan balancing requirements, quorum requirements, limits on the number of members, and features that otherwise enhance decision maker independence or potential appointee pools; conversely, this factor is negatively correlated with features that limit decision maker independence via removal powers such as whether an agency or a department is located within the Executive Office of the President or the cabinet, whether it has a bureau structure, and whether the relevant statute explicitly specifies that service is at the president's pleasure. As such, the estimated score seemingly captures the decision‐making independence that we posit is key for the appointments process.17 Indeed, Figure 1 shows that higher confirmation rates and shorter confirmation periods are associated with nominees who will have less independence, supporting Hypotheses 4 and 5.18 The right panel examines how nominee ideology affects the Senate's choices. We use Bonica's (2014) CFscores to measure Nominee–Filibuster Divergence as the absolute difference between the ideologies of the nominee and the filibuster pivot (M = 1.183, SD = 0.435). CFscores are ideological estimates based on campaign finance records whose appeal compared to alternative ideology measures is that nearly all individuals who either made or received campaign contributions between early 1979 and mid‐2012 are placed on a common ideological scale (though some donors may not be in the data set, as reporting requirements might suppress publication of names of individuals donating small amounts). Thus, we have preference estimates in a common space for the elected political actors of interest (presidents and senators) and most (about 64%) appointees.19 The results are less dramatic than for decision maker independence, but they show the posited relationship between nominee and filibuster pivot ideologies for duration and confirmation, in line with Hypotheses 1 and 2.         "
"28","As Figure 1 is only illustrative, we now estimate fully specified models of senatorial decisions. We begin with the end of the appointments process and examine the Senate's decision, which will provide context for our analysis of presidential choices. As decisions regarding when and whether to confirm are related, we utilize a split‐population model that simultaneously estimates the likelihood of, and time until, confirmation (Schmidt and Witte 1989).20 While standard duration models assume all subjects will eventually “fail”—which here means get confirmed—given infinite time, this model likely fits reality better because it allows for some nominees to never be confirmed regardless of Senate deliberation length (Box‐Steffensmeier and Jones 2004). Additionally, we use a log‐logistic hazard function to permit a nonmonotonic hazard rate.21"
"29","As before, our dependent variable is Time with Senate, and the key independent variables are Agency Decision Maker Independence and Nominee–Filibuster Divergence. We incorporate these variables into a base model (Model 1) and add control variables previously shown to affect the likelihood of, or duration until, Senate confirmation (Model 2). These include agency ideology, agency hierarchy, the role of time, the level of independence in an agency's policy process, and presidential political capital.         "
"30","In incorporating agency ideology, we define President–Agency Convergence and Senate–Agency Convergence, both calculated using Clinton and Lewis's (2008, 5) estimates of whether agencies have “policy views [that] due to law, practice, culture, or tradition … can be characterized as liberal or conservative”; negative (positive) estimates correspond to more liberal (conservative) agencies.22 For President–(Senate–)Agency Convergence, we multiply the scores by –1 if the president (Senate median) is a Democrat, and by 1 if the president (Senate median) is a Republican.23 If the relevant principal is a Democrat (Republican), higher values mean that the agency is more liberal (conservative), which should correspond to the strength of policy convergence between the two. We then construct Joint President–Senate Agency Convergence, which equals 1 (–1) if President–Agency Convergence and Senate–Agency Convergence have the same (opposite) sign, indicating both branches see the agency similarly (differently). Importantly, we interact President–Agency Convergence and Joint President–Senate Agency Convergence to capture cases where the president and the Senate either do or do not agree on agency policy.         "
"31","Top Tier and Middle Tier capture a position's location in the agency's hierarchy, which has been shown to influence confirmation duration and success (Bonica, Chen, and Johnson 2015; Chiou and Rothenberg 2014; McCarty and Razaghian 1999; Ostrander 2016). Top Tier equals 1 if the nomination is at the level of secretary, attorney general, administrator, or equivalent, and 0 otherwise; Middle Tier equals 1 if the nomination is at the assistant or undersecretary levels (or equivalent), and 0 otherwise.         "
"32","As studies have suggested time plays a role in the Senate's decision (Bonica, Chen, and Johnson 2015; McCarty and Razaghian 1999; Ostrander 2016), we include Year in Term, First Term, and First 100 Days as control variables. Year in Term is the number of days that have passed since the day the present term started, divided by 365. First Term equals 1 if the president was serving his first term at the time of nomination, and 0 otherwise. First 100 Days equals 1 if the nomination was made during the first 100 days of the president's first term, and 0 otherwise.         "
"33","We also add Policy Independence, the other latent trait recovered from Selin's (2015) model, to account for the degree of policymaking independence delegated to each agency. This variable, which is positively correlated with factors such as “provisions that remove an agency from OMB review, allow the agency to litigate on its own, and remove an agency from the congressional appropriations process” (Selin 2015, 978), proxies for the extent to which an agency is insulated from political influence (as opposed to the independence of individual appointees). We include it since higher levels may affect the strategies of both presidents and Senates.         "
"34","Finally, we incorporate a president's political capital, since it has been found to affect judicial nominations (Johnson and Roberts 2004, 2005). Specifically, we define Presidential Approval as the net presidential approval per the most recent Gallup Poll available at the time of nomination.         "
"35","Table 1 displays our results for both models, and Figure 2 provides graphical depictions, using Model 2's estimates, for our key covariates: Agency Decision Maker Independence and Nominee–Filibuster Divergence.24,25 Note the mean estimated probability of eventual confirmation (based on Model 2) is about 84.2%, and 90.4% of observations have an estimated probability of eventual confirmation greater than one‐half. This suggests some nominees are not confirmable even given infinite time before the Senate, validating the split‐population model's choice over more conventional alternatives.26"
"36","Determinants of the Likelihood of and Length of Time Until Successful Confirmation"
"37","Note: Agency Decision Maker Independence is measured using the first factor of Selin's (2015) agency independence scores; Nominee–Filibuster Divergence is measured with Bonica's (2014) CFscores. All continuous covariates are set to their means, and all dichotomous variables are set to zero. The 95% confidence intervals are shown.                     "
"38","The results also highlight the relevance of decision maker independence. As seen in Table 1, in both models, Agency Decision Maker Independence is significant in both the risk (likelihood of confirmation) and duration equations. Moreover, the left panels of Figure 2 suggest the substantive effects are meaningful, as moving Agency Decision Maker Independence from two standard deviations below its sample mean to two above decreases confirmation likelihood by about 14 percentage points and increases the time between nomination and confirmation by about 44 days. Both findings support Hypotheses 4 and 5.         "
"39","Nominee ideology is also important. Greater divergence between the nominee and the filibuster pivot produces longer waits until confirmation, and it slightly reduces the overall success rate. Thus, Hypotheses 1 and 2 receive support. As the bottom‐right panel of Figure 2 demonstrates, the impact on duration is substantial, as moving Nominee–Filibuster Divergence from two standard deviations below its sample mean to two above increases the time between nomination and confirmation by about 40 days. The effect on confirmation risk is minimal in comparison, though statistically significant, as moving Nominee–Filibuster Divergence from two standard deviations below its sample mean to two above reduces the probability of confirmation by about 4 percentage points.         "
"40","As for the control variables, there are a number of interesting results. Intriguingly, in contrast to the independence of decision makers, the second independence dimension—Policy Independence—is insignificant. This suggests that the ability of other political principals to affect agency policy, as opposed to agency principals, is not relevant to the Senate's decisions. While we do not hypothesize about the relevance of this measure, its unimportance may be because Senates anticipate being able to redirect agency policy ex post, which makes ensuring appointment of ideologically friendly individuals in the first place a greater concern, relatively speaking.         "
"41","Also notable are the contrasting effects of Top Tier and Middle Tier in the duration equation. Nominations to the highest positions are confirmed more quickly than the lowest posts, but there is no effect for nominees to the intermediate posts. While this pattern might seem surprising, it is consistent with previous findings and is often attributed to senatorial unwillingness to be seen as obstructive by delaying action on high‐profile appointments, coupled with a high presidential ability to “go public” with claims of Senate obstructionism for these nominations (Chiou and Rothenberg 2014; Ostrander 2016). Findings regarding the target agency's ideology add to the inference that ideological dynamics are nuanced. When the president and Senate disagree (i.e., when Joint President–Senate Agency Convergence is low), agency ideology is irrelevant. Presumably, the Senate provides the president with little flexibility regarding nominees.27 However, when the president and the Senate see eye‐to‐eye, agency ideology matters for duration, though not so much for confirmation. That said, it is curious that nominations to agencies where Joint President–Senate Agency Convergence is low tend to be confirmed more quickly than those to agencies where this variable is high. Although this is presumably due in part to these nominees’ being somewhat more moderate on average, a dynamic we discuss in the next section, it is nonetheless worthy of further investigation.         "
"42","Finally, time plays a role, with the Senate deferring more to the president early on with faster confirmations. Moreover, these effects are found despite controlling for presidential approval (generally highest shortly after elections), so these variables do not proxy for approval. Instead, our results are consistent with presidents putting forth different kinds of nominees at these times, underscoring the need to examine presidents’ initial decisions."
"43","Having started with the Senate's choices, we now move back in the timeline to the presidents’ decisions, which are presumably conditioned by expectations of Senate response. Given the importance of the independence of agency decision makers and nominee ideology to the Senate's decisions, we begin by examining which positions, in terms of decision maker independence, the president deals with initially, and the ideological orientations of those whom the president puts forth at different times."
"44","For assessing the bivariate relationships between time in a congress and decision maker independence and nominee ideology (this time relative to the president), we again use our Agency Decision Maker Independence measure, but for ideology we define Nominee–President Divergence as the (logged) absolute difference between the CFscores of the nominee and the president (M = –1.660 SD = 1.453).28 Figure 3 displays data both for all sessions pooled and for individual congresses (with the presidential administration noted). Overall, besides providing a first glimpse into presidential choices, the results furnish additional insights into the results produced by our previous analysis.         "
"45","Ideology and Independence of Presidential Nominees over Congressional Sessions"
"46","Note: Nominee–President Divergence is measured using Bonica's (2014) CFscores; Agency Decision Maker Independence is measured using the first factor of Selin's (2015) agency independence scores. The 95% confidence intervals are shown.                     "
"47","For example, the top row indicates early nominations—especially within an administration's first 2 years—tend to be to less independent agencies, which are typically those more involved in policymaking, as well as those in cabinet departments, with nominations to more independent agencies occurring later.29 This pattern may explain why Senate deference to the president is higher during these earlier times. Interestingly, these results may be a function of the president having larger candidate pools at an administration's onset for these agencies. The president can move more quickly on these appointments, even if they are not priorities.         "
"48","The bottom row of Figure 3 suggests nominees are more in line with presidents’ preferences right after an initial inauguration, as well as after reelection, compared to other times. This comports with several explanations of the nomination process, including a desire to politicize the bureaucracy immediately with ideological allies, an ability to quickly place such allies because of more information about their preferences and abilities, staff turnover during an administration, and experiential learning driven by evolving managerial strategies (Krause and O'Connell 2016). It also would help explain why the ideological results for senatorial choices are so nuanced.         "
"49","Having established some basic patterns about how the president seemingly anticipates congressional actions, we now examine our remaining hypotheses. We again estimate models with only independent variables central to our hypotheses and with control variables added. As before, Nominee–President Divergence is our dependent variable. Agency Decision Maker Independence is again a main covariate of interest, as is President–Filibuster Divergence, the difference between the CFscores of the president and the filibuster pivot (M = 1.382, SD = 0.160). We use the same controls as in our analysis of Senate choices. We estimate two ordinary least squares (OLS) models. Results are in Table 2, and predicted outcomes are illustrated in Figure 4 using Model 4's estimates.30"
"50","Determinants of Nominees’ Ideological Divergence from Nominating Presidents"
"51","Note: Agency Decision Maker Independence is measured using the first factor of Selin's (2015) agency independence scores; President–Filibuster Divergence is measured with Bonica's (2014) CFscores. Estimates of expected divergence use estimates from Table 2, Model 4, with all other variables set to their means if continuous and to zero if dichotomous. The 95% confidence intervals are shown.                     "
"52","Table 2’s findings supplement our Senate results by suggesting nominations are conditioned by expectations about the upper chamber's reactions. Consistent with standard models and Hypothesis 3, greater ideological divergence between the president and the filibuster pivot is associated with heightened divergence between the president and the nominee. These results mesh well with our finding that the length of time until confirmation (if not the actual likelihood of confirmation) increases with Nominee–Filibuster Divergence, in the sense of suggesting the president observes the Senate's makeup and nominates accordingly.31"
"53","Supporting Hypothesis 6, we uncover additional evidence for the importance of decision maker independence, as higher levels of Agency Decision Maker Independence are associated with greater ideological divergence between presidents and nominees.         "
"54","As for control variables, there are again some interesting results. Agency hierarchy matters, as presidents can place ideological allies into high‐ and mid‐ranking positions. In contrast to the previous analysis of the confirmation decision, Policy Independence is now significant, with higher levels correlated with lower levels of ideological divergence between nominees and presidents. Although this could be due to the president's wanting to ensure ideological fealty when agency policy will be more difficult to redirect ex post, it is unclear why the Senate should be accommodating, suggesting that examining how policy independence affects decisions is a fertile area for future research.         "
"55","Agency ideology also appears important, though effects are conditioned by whether the president and the Senate agree about agency policy. When Joint President–Senate Agency Convergence is low, and the president and the Senate disagree on agency policy, agency ideology does not factor into the president's decision. In these instances, interbranch disagreement forces the president to nominate more moderate nominees in most cases, and any marginal variance explained by the targeted agency's ideology is minimized due to the lack of presidential flexibility. Conversely, agency ideology matters when the president and the Senate agree, with the president nominating more moderate individuals to agencies with whom they are less convergent and more ideologically compatible appointees to other agencies. This may be a function of candidate supply, where the pool of potential nominees with policy expertise consists of those with more ideologically compatible policy preferences for those policy areas for which the president's party is viewed as “owning” the issues (Lewis 2008, 2009; Weko 1995).         "
"56","Finally, time is again important. Consistent with Figure 3, there is a positive effect for Year in Term, suggesting presidents put forth more ideologically divergent nominees as their terms progress. Interestingly, there is no support for term‐specific effects or a “honeymoon” period during the first 100 days, despite evidence that the Senate processes these nominations more quickly. More broadly, results are consistent with a dynamic where presidents, fresh off successful (re)election bids, offer more ideologically convergent nominees at the beginning of their terms to leverage newfound political capital.         "
"57","In a world of gridlock and polarization, where conflict between branches is routine and much policy operates in the realm of bureaucratic discretion, fully understanding the appointments process is essential. However, while scholars have made progress, until now we have lacked a full empirical accounting of what drives observed outcomes."
"58","In integrating two traditionally difficult‐to‐measure features—nominee ideology and agency decision maker independence—into studying the complex web that is the presidential appointments process, we provide considerable insight into how the confirmation machine functions. While we began by stating that modeling the appointments process is extremely complex given the number of players, the number of factors, and the importance of time, our analysis lends much clarity to processes of interest, with all of our posited hypotheses receiving support, though the ideological distance between the nominee and filibuster pivot—while extending duration—has a modest effect on the confirmation rate."
"59","As social scientists studying political choice behavior, our first intuition was to focus on ideology; in doing so, we find that ideologies—those of presidents, senators, and nominees—matter, even if they are by no means the only concern. As noted above, we show higher levels of ideological divergence between the nominee's ideology and the Senate pivot prolong the confirmation process and have modest effects on the ultimate likelihood of confirmation. Furthermore, anticipating how the Senate will respond, strategic presidents moderate their nominees accordingly. Although these findings may be intuitive, we go beyond past analyses by integrating nominee ideology into a well‐specified model of the confirmation process to demonstrate they indeed are realized."
"60","But we also establish that moving beyond ideology by considering the independence of decision makers (should they be approved) is of great importance. While features determining independence have been recognized, it has never been integrated into analyses of appointments. Yet, we demonstrate that stakes rise when decision makers are provided greater independence. Anticipating how these considerations will impact the Senate, presidents nominate candidates more to the Senate's liking. However, even with this concession, the Senate responds with additional scrutiny, elongating confirmation battles and rejecting more nominees. Strikingly, the Senate's more adversarial decisions occur not because the chief executive is playing hardball, but despite presidential concessions.         "
"61","Going forth, we see several directions for research. Scholars of the appointments process might explicitly incorporate decision maker independence into extant models. This would furnish a more complete and balanced understanding of the appointments process and, given the association between expertise requirements and independence, might provide additional insight into the “loyalty‐competence trade‐off” presidents are claimed to make (Edwards 2001; Hollibaugh, Horton, and Lewis 2014; Lewis 2008). Further, researchers could examine the relationship between agency and department structure and patronage. Though existing analyses of the role of patronage have overlooked such structure, our analysis leads us to posit that patronage appointees, who typically have less experience, should have a greater likelihood of placement in agencies and departments where decision makers are less independent.         "
"62","Also, in light of our results, scholars would be well advised to disentangle the reasons behind Krause and O'Connell's (2016) finding that the relative prevalence of appointee loyalty versus appointee competence tends to decrease over the course of a presidential administration. Though they proffer several reasons for this dynamic, they focus on appointee‐level dynamics, within‐agency (hierarchical) factors, and institutional conflict with the Senate. We argue that the mix of agencies to which nominations are made also varies over time (as do differences across agencies) and that, in addition to the other dynamics they mention, the pattern they observe could be a product of presidents’ nominating to more independent agencies later in their terms as well as the relationship between expertise requirements and decision maker independence (Selin 2015). Parsing out to what extent either the president's acting differently or the mix of what offices are being considered is changing could help explain later appointees’ greater competence, or whether another completely different set of factors are at work, and would add considerably to our understanding of nomination and confirmation.
