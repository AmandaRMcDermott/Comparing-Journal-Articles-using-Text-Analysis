"1","According to the classical tradition, Socrates transformed philosophy by compelling it to turn away from “the heavens” and by directing it toward those things that human beings take most seriously: politics, morality, and providential gods (Cicero Tusculan Disputations 5.10–11; also Aristotle Metaphysics 987b1–2; Xenophon Memorabilia 1.1.11–16).2 But the remaining, fragmentary writings of pre‐Socratic philosophers such as Antiphon, Empedocles, and Heraclitus show that Socrates was not the first philosopher to investigate political, moral, and religious matters.3 Writings such as these support the report in Plato's Laws that the pre‐Socratic, natural philosophers looked into the nonphilosophers’ beliefs about politics, morality, and the gods and concluded that their beliefs about these things are based on convention rather than nature. According to such thinkers, it is natural that the strong should wish to dominate the weak: consequently, the strong always make laws that compel the weak to serve their selfish interests. But because the strong wish to conceal how they use law to dominate the weak, they call their exploitation “justice” and assert that the weak have a moral obligation to obey every law. Because different factions are strong in different places, the laws and what the laws establish as just vary from place to place and are always disputable (Plato Laws 889e–90a; Republic 358c, 359c; also Antiphon fragment 44; Aristophanes Clouds 94–101, 1399–1400, 1420–24; Heraclitus fragments 33, 102; Xenophanes fragment 33; also Kelly 1992, 14). Similarly, what most citizens call “noble” or “moral” is noble only by convention and does not reflect what is truly noble by nature (e.g., Plato Gorgias 483a). In addition, the early natural philosophers are said to have reached one of three conclusions regarding the gods: some believed that there are no gods at all, some believed that the gods are indifferent to human affairs altogether, and some believe that the gods are indifferent to justice and injustice (Plato Laws 885b, 889c; Republic 362c, 364d–65a; also Heraclitus fragment 128; Thrasymachus fragment 8; Thucydides 5: 105; Xenophanes fragment 23). Whatever their disagreements regarding the gods may be, many taught that the justice, nobility, and providential gods in whom most citizens believed are products not of nature but of a political art that tends to conceal and distort what is natural (Plato Laws 889d–90a).         "
"2","The same classical tradition also tells us that Socrates breaks with his philosophic predecessors by inquiring into politics, morality, and the gods in a new way and with a new seriousness. According to Plato's Phaedo, Socrates’ new interest in the study of justice, the noble, and the providential gods in whom the citizen believes came as a result of certain problems that emerged from his youthful pursuit of natural philosophy.4 He says that when he was young he had a great passion for the study of nature and that he thought it was a great thing to know the causes of all the beings (Plato Phaedo 96a6–10). But he found that he could not find a single, comprehensive account of the causes of everything that comes into being, persists, and passes away (Plato Phaedo 96b5–c2; 97b1–7, 99c1–d2). Having failed to find such a decisive account, he says that he sought to learn about a different kind of cause, namely, the “look” or the “form” (idea) of the beings (Plato Phaedo 100b3–c6, 101c2–5).5 Instead of inquiring into nature by studying atoms or elements or other causes that are ordinarily unobserved by nonphilosophers, Socrates inquires into nature by considering how the beings present themselves in everyday life and what is said about them in everyday speech. Socrates examines speeches (logoi) because speeches reflect something of what each of the beings is (Plato Phaedo 99e4–100a3).6"
"3","Having turned away from natural philosophy in order to examine the beings through speeches, Socrates recognizes that he does not have at his disposal a comprehensive account of the whole and thus that he cannot dismiss out‐of‐hand what the nonphilosopher says about the beings, especially about beings such as justice, nobility, and the gods (Plato Apology 21b–c). In order to examine these things more carefully, he asks nonphilosophers questions such as “what is virtue?” and “what is piety?” Socrates’ interest in these questions is not merely theoretical; in taking these matters seriously, he finds that he must give new weight to claims that he, like all human beings, has serious civic, moral, and sacred responsibilities to other people and to the gods. This is especially important because he must answer the charge that the philosophic attempt to know the causes of the beings is intrinsically impious, base, and unjust (Plato Apology 18b–c; Laws, 821a; Aristophanes Clouds 1507–9; Hesiod Works and Days 54–55).7 He recognizes that he needs to examine these claims and to consider whether he can justify his way of life in light of them (Plato Apology 23b). According to his fellow citizens, the highest authority regarding justice, the noble, and the gods is the law. The Socratic philosopher is thus especially concerned with examining what law is, what authority it possesses, and what it demands of him.         "
"4","The Minos is the only dialogue in the Platonic corpus in which Socrates specifically asks, “what is law?” Because it shows us how Socrates raises this question in conversation with one of Socrates’ fellow citizens, it seems an excellent starting point for studying Plato's overall account of law. In addition, the Minos attracts our attention because it makes arguments that have been called the starting point for the tradition of natural law.8 Finally, the Minos also appears to be the introduction to Plato's lengthier treatment of law in the Laws (Chroust 1947; Strauss 1987, 67).9 But the Minos has fallen into relative obscurity because many classical scholars have cast doubts on whether it was written by Plato himself. This judgment on the Minos is relatively new. For centuries, leading Platonists such as Alexander Aphrodisiensis, Aristophanes of Byzantium, Clemens of Alexandria, Ficino, Maximus Tyrius, Plutarch, Proclus, Servius, and Stobaeus regarded the Minos as one of Plato's important political dialogues (Burges 1891, 447–48; Grote 1888: 94–98).10 But in the nineteenth century, scholars questioned whether it, along with many of Plato's shorter dialogues, could have been written by Plato himself. Influential figures such as Beockh, Heidel, Schleiermacher, Souilhe, and Stahlbum argued that the Minos's style and substance are not fully consistent with those writings that are universally accepted as Plato's (Burges 1891, 447–48; Morrow 1960, 35).11 At present, many prominent scholars still question the authenticity of the Minos, although recently some have treated it as a Platonic work (e.g., Benardete 2000; Best 1980; Bruell 1999; Cobb 1988; Lewis 2006; Morrow 1960; Strauss 1987). In the Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Political Thought, Christopher Rowe nicely summarizes the contemporary view of the Minos among classical scholars. Rowe allows that the dialogue is “attractive,”“accomplished, and, at times, ingenious,” and yet he also finds it a “strange mixture.” It is strange because it “is written in a manner that strongly resembles the ‘Socratic’ dialogues that Plato wrote in his early period,” and yet “its subject‐matter is more akin to that of the Politicus [Statesman] and the Laws” (Rowe 2000a, 307). This unusual mixture raises numerous questions about whether it should be considered a Socratic dialogue and whether Plato would have or could have composed such an amalgamation.         "
"5","According to many prominent scholars, Plato and Xenophon wrote certain dialogues that reflect the manner and thinking of the historical Socrates (see, e.g., Guthrie 1971; Irwin 1979; Kahn 1998; Kraut 1984; Vlastos 1981). In Plato's case, these Socratic dialogues are considered to be his “early” works and are distinguished from the “middle” and “late” dialogues that are said to reflect subsequent developments in Plato's own thought. The Socratic dialogues tend to be short and to show Socrates examining a companion regarding some aspect of virtue. Socrates typically asks a “what is?” question, such as “what is noble?” or “what is piety?” or “what is courage?” Having drawn out his companion's response, Socrates shows that it is contradictory and inadequate, and both Socrates and his companion find that they have no answer to the question (e.g., Penner 1992, 125). Because the Minos has these characteristics, numerous scholars have called it “Socratic” (e.g., Best 1980; Morrow 1960; Mulroy 2007; Sinclair 1952). But the Socratic dialogues are also linked by the consistency of the substance of their arguments. In these dialogues, Socrates tends to argue, for example, that knowledge is virtue and that no one voluntarily harms him‐ or herself (Penner 1992, 125–31; and 2000). But in the Minos, Socrates makes arguments about law that are not obviously compatible with what is said about law in Socratic dialogues like Plato's Apology of Socrates and Crito. In the Minos, Socrates argues that an unjust law is not a law, but in the Apology Socrates continues to speak of unjust Athenian laws as “laws” (Plato Apology 37a7–b2). And the whole tenor of the Crito suggests that Socrates thinks that the laws of Athens are substantial and obligatory laws even when they do Socrates a grave injustice. Similarly, Xenophon's Socrates speaks as if laws remain lawful even if they change and become unjust (Xenophon Memorabilia IV. 4. 12–15).12 Moreover, in the Minos, Socrates raises questions about the limits of law that are more consistent with the arguments associated with “late” Platonic dialogues. For example, he contrasts the rule of law with the rule of an expert and questions whether law can do justice to each of the individuals whom it rules (cf. Statesman 294a–96c and Minos 316c–18d; see also Laws 875a–d). For reasons such as these, Socrates’ account of law in the Minos does not seem to be consistent with any coherent account of law that might be found in the early, Socratic dialogues.         "
"6","Yet if the content of the Minos is not Socratic in this respect, it is Socratic in other important ways. The Socrates of the Minos is moved by many of the same concerns that moved Socrates to undertake the Socratic turn. He shares the Socratic philosopher's insight that philosophy must be justified before the city and the city's gods and that it must be justified using the terms that are used by the city and its gods. He asks what law is because he recognizes that he must examine the phenomenon “law” as it presents itself in everyday speech rather than in “philosophic” or “scientific” terms. He examines what a nonphilosophic citizen of Athens knows about law because he wants to know if such a citizen has recognized something that eludes the grasp of the philosopher who relies solely on reason. He asks if law is known through reason or through divination because he recognizes that divine law poses the greatest challenge to reason's authority. And he ends the dialogue with an extensive praise of the laws of Minos because he recognizes that one cannot know what law is or how it is known until one has undertaken a careful and respectful examination of a divine code of law. The Minos is not Socratic in the sense that it helps us to distinguish what the historical Socrates thought about law from what Plato thought about it. Its discussion of law and the limits of law is not consistent with what is said in the early dialogues. But it is Socratic in that it helps us to distinguish the classical political philosophy that Socrates set in motion from pre‐Socratic natural philosophy and, in principle, from any form of rationalism that assumes the authority of reason and dismisses claims made on behalf of the city and divine law. The Minos indicates that the same questions and insights regarding the relation between reason and divine law that led Socrates to make his famous turn continue to animate Plato and his students.         "
"7","The Minos's association with the late dialogues such as the Laws may lead one to conclude that it is also late (e.g., Cobb 1988, 188). But it is precisely this association with the Laws that may cause some to wonder if Plato could have written the Minos. Since the Minos refers to passages in the Laws, it seems unlikely that the Minos was written before the Laws (but see Morrow 1960, 37). But if the Laws was Plato's final work, it would seem that Plato could not have written the Minos after he worked on the Laws, either.13 This argument would dispose of the possibility that Plato wrote the Minos if we knew with certainty that Plato always wrote dialogues one at a time and that he never went back to revise his earlier works. But it is possible that Plato sometimes worked on more than one dialogue at once. As Melissa Lane observes, it is difficult to establish an exact chronology for the dialogues, especially since some works may have been “in progress” for years (2000, 157). Christopher Bobonich says that because the Laws is the longest of Plato's dialogues, “it is reasonable to think that its composition overlapped with some of his other late works” (2008, 329). Thus, Plato may have decided to take a break from the lengthy Laws in order to write a short dialogue like the Minos. Alternatively, Plato could have composed the Minos before writing the Laws but later decided to revise it, adding references to the Laws to underscore that it is an introduction to the longer dialogue. Far from us having evidence that Plato always published his dialogues serially and never reedited them, we have several ancient sources who report that Plato continually reworked the Republic.14 Thus, if Plato either composed more than one dialogue at a time or sometimes revised his works, it is possible that he composed or revised the Minos while working on the Laws."
"8","At the same time, it is possible that the dialogue was written by one of Plato's students after Plato's death. But even this would not necessarily mean that the dialogue should be dismissed as unworthy of either the Platonic corpus or our attention. Some suggest that the dialogues were written for pedagogical use within the Academy rather than for publication and that some of Plato's students may have written some of them. They further suggest that some of the students’ dialogues may have been of such high quality that they were included in the Academy's authoritative collection of Platonic dialogues. Since Plato's students included the likes of Aristotle, Speusippus, and Theophrastus, it is possible that such a student could write a dialogue that captures Plato's thinking on law. If such a student wrote the Minos prior to or after Plato's death, it would still be useful for understanding the Platonic account of law and divine law (Muller 1975, 9–44; and Phillip 1970, 296–308, quoted in Pangle 1987a, 13–14).         "
"9","In addition to finding the Minos to be a “strange mixture,” Rowe also questions the authenticity of the Minos on the grounds that the dialogue argues that experts in the art of lawgiving would never disagree about the things they oversee and thus would issue “correct” laws that never change (Rowe 2000a, 308). But, says Rowe, Plato argues in the Politicus [Statesman] that a “constitution” is “genuine” if and only if its ruler practices the political art and knowingly gives each individual what is fitting. This means that the rule of law, whose fixed character makes it ignorant of what fits each individual, is not a genuine “constitution” (Rowe 2000b, 244, 250). According to Rowe,         "
"10","                        "
"11","what the author of the Minos wants—an ideal king issuing ‘correct’ laws, valid for all time—is actually ruled out by Plato's argument: laws can be expressions of reason without being in principle unchangeable, and indeed reason will sometimes dictate that even the most carefully framed laws may need to be changed, on the grounds suggested by the Politicus [Statesman]. (Rowe 2000a, 8)               "
"12","In light of how the dialogue is both “thoroughly imbued with Platonic ideas and strategies” and yet committed to the “idea of the good king” who issues correct laws, Rowe suggests that the author of the dialogue is trying to accommodate Platonic doctrine to “Hellenic kingship theory” (2000b, 308).         "
"13","Before we put aside the Minos in our effort to understand Plato's account of law, we should consider the possibility that the Minos is an even subtler work than Rowe and other modern scholars acknowledge. Part of the subtlety of the dialogue comes to sight when we remember that Socrates is asking the “what is” question concerning law and that one of his chief purposes is to examine what his Athenian comrade knows about law. In the course of the dialogue, Socrates affirms that his comrade respects law deeply. Consequently, Socrates wants to think through what his comrade believes law is or what law would have to be in order for it to merit his comrade's respect. He may, of course, wish to make his interlocutor aware of his ignorance regarding what law is and what authority it possesses. But he may also wish to bring his comrade's ignorance regarding law to light in a way that does not undermine his comrade's deeper respect for law. Thus, Socrates may be reluctant to make the sort of bold criticisms of law that the Eleatic Stranger makes to the young mathematician with whom he speaks in the Statesman. But leaving these dramatic or politic considerations aside, Socrates may also believe that the Eleatic Stranger's criticism of law is not decisive as stated. After making the case that “correct” laws never change, the Socrates of the Minos subtly acknowledges the very criticism of law that Rowe cites from the Statesman. But instead of using the Statesman's criticism of law to shake his comrade's respect for law and end the dialogue, the Socrates of the Minos responds to that criticism by suggesting that the unchanging laws that Minos established in Crete are recognizably divine and beneficial and may overcome the criticism of law that is elaborated in the Statesman. The discussion of Minos and his divine code of law at the end of the dialogue shows why a Socratic philosopher cannot complete his inquiry into law until he also examines what divine law is and how it presents itself in its own terms. The Minos does not celebrate unchanging laws as much as it helps us understand why unchanging divine laws must be examined through a respectful and probing dialogue with people who are educated by and who believe in those laws.         "
"14","In the end, we do not know who wrote the dialogue or precisely when it was written. But we know that it has come down to us from antiquity as part of the body of Plato's works. We should give the Minos the care that we would give to any Platonic dialogue so that we might better understand the questions that it raises about law and divine law and how it came to be considered the beginning point for understanding Plato's examination of divine law in the Laws."
"15","The Minos opens with Socrates asking an unnamed Athenian comrade (hetairos), “What is law, for us?’ The fact that Socrates’ comrade is unprepared for the question suggests that Socrates raises it because he wants to learn what his fellow Athenian citizen knows or believes about law.15 Because the comrade does not understand what Socrates is asking, he asks Socrates to clarify the sort of laws that he has in mind. Socrates explains that he wants to know the characteristics found in all laws that enable us to recognize that each of them belongs to a single class of things that we call “law.” He wants to know how we are able to distinguish law from other things, like mere demands or opinions. To explain what he is looking for, Socrates says that in the same way that we are able to know how all gold is alike, so should we be able to know how all law is alike (Minos 313a).16 In elaborating this point, Socrates compares law not only to gold but also to stone. But this second comparison raises an important question about law. For if law were like the element gold, then each law would be like every other law in every respect. Law might be a settled code of laws which is recognizable everywhere as law. But if law were like stone, then there would many different laws or legal codes which would still be recognizable as laws even though the particular laws or codes differed markedly among themselves.         "
"16","In response to Socrates’ question, the comrade says that laws are those things that are “believed in” or recognized (nomizomena), by which he seems to mean that laws are those public decrees that we citizens customarily respect and believe to be lawful. Having initially compared law to gold and stone, Socrates drops his own claim that laws are external objects like gold or stones and adopts his comrade's suggestion that law is rooted in our ability to believe in or recognize that some things are lawful. Law is not found in books or written codes but within those who respect and follow the law. In order to explore this latter suggestion, Socrates points out that there is a distinction between things that are seen and the power of sight. Having called our attention to the faculty of sight that enables us to see what is seen, Socrates asks if there is some special faculty that allows us to “believe in” or recognize that certain rules are morally binding; if so, this would be the special faculty through which one could recognize law (Minos 314a; Best 1980, 102). In asking his comrade about this faculty, Socrates compares it not only to the power of sight but also to the powers of hearing and reasoned speech (logos). In asking if law is a power like seeing, hearing, and reasoned speech, he is asking if our ability to recognize law is grounded in something other than the senses and the faculty of reasoned speech through which we see, hear, and reason about all other things. By suggesting that law might be believed in or recognized through something other than reason and sense perception, Socrates raises the possibility that we believe in law not through rational knowledge but through ignorance or perhaps through the “power” of opinion (cf. Plato Republic 477a–b). But this is not the only possibility that he raises. By suggesting that one might recognize law through something other than reason, Socrates is also raising the possibility that some have a special “legal faculty” that enables them to discern laws which are beyond reason but nonetheless substantial, authoritative, and true. If there were such a suprarational faculty, then those who possess it would have a suprarational experience or knowledge of law while those who lack it might be simply and unfortunately blind, deaf, and speechless in respect to what is lawful and what is not. If laws came to light only through such a faculty, then the philosopher who sought to understand law relying solely on his own reason and perception might find law unfathomable.         "
"17","If, on the other hand, law can be recognized on the basis of some kind of rational knowledge, there are two alternatives. Socrates says that law might be scientific knowledge (episteme) or an art (techne) like medicine which, he says, discovers what brings health or sickness to bodies (Minos 314b3–4). The difference between a science and an art seems to be that the former is a kind of rational knowledge that reveals what things are while the latter is a kind of rational knowledge that reveals how things become better or worse. If law simply reveals what is permitted or forbidden, then the faculty that makes it might be a kind of scientific knowledge. If, however, law reveals what is beneficial or harmful, then the faculty that makes the law might be an art. In addition to these possibilities, Socrates asks if law is akin to the art of divination. Unlike arts such as medicine, the art of divination does not necessarily show what benefits or harms something but instead reveals “what the gods have in mind” (Minos 314b4). In addition, the art of divination seems to differ from scientific knowledge because of the role that the gods play in divination. If the one can practice the art of divination only through the cooperation of gods who disclose things that are otherwise unknown to us, then the art of divination is a kind of revelation rather than a body of rational knowledge that can be passed on from person to person, like either scientific knowledge or the art of medicine.17 If the gods reveal what they have in mind to the experts in the art of divination through something other than reasoned speech and the ordinary senses, then the law that comes through such an art may prove to be mysterious to the Socratic philosopher who studies the beings through speeches.         "
"18","Having revised his initial “what is” question in this way, Socrates’ examination of his comrade now has several discernible ends: he wants to learn what law is and also whether law can be known at all. He will pursue these questions by finding out whether his comrade knows what the “legal faculty” might be and also whether his comrade possesses this faculty. In order to pursue these questions further, Socrates presses his comrade to say what sort of discovery law is. The comrade says that laws are the opinions of the city that are voted on by the citizens (Minos 314b10–c1). Socrates says that this may be nobly spoken, but it is necessary to explore the content of the city's opinions. In the subsequent exchange, Socrates brings out the comrade's deep respect for law and clarifies what he respects about law. Socrates begins by asking about those people whom the comrade considers lawful or law‐abiding. The comrade agrees that those people who are law‐abiding are law‐abiding because they have the law within them. The comrade also believes that law is just and that law and justice together are good or useful, on the grounds that they “save cities and everything else” (Minos 314d). After agreeing to this sweeping claim about the good that law and justice can do, Socrates’ comrade also affirms that those without law are base and destructive (Minos 314e2–5). Having brought this respect for law to light, Socrates probes more deeply into its implications. Up to this point, the comrade has mentioned two features of law: he has said that law is whatever the city recognizes or opines and that law is just, noble, and good or at least not unjust, base, and ruinous. When Socrates confronts him with a conflict between these two principles, the comrade finds that he is more strongly convinced of the latter than of the former. He agrees that whatever else the law may be, it cannot be unjust, base, and ruinous. So therefore, an evil law is not a law (Minos 314e2–6; cf. Plato Hippias Major 284e). If an evil decree is passed by the majority of the citizens, that decree will not have the full moral authority of law for the serious citizen. This apparent discovery of an intelligible standard for distinguishing genuine laws from false ones has been said to mark the beginning of the natural law tradition.18"
"19","Socrates follows up the conclusion that an evil decree cannot be a law by winning his comrade's agreement that since law is a useful (chrestos) opinion it must also be a true opinion and a kind of discovery (Minos 315a1–2). It is important to note, however, that Socrates does not challenge his comrade's earlier claim that an opinion must be affirmed by the ruling part of the city in order for it to become lawful. Useful and true opinions are not lawful until they partake of the city's authority. However useful and true an opinion might be, it evidently needs to have the additional dignity and force of the city in order for it to be law. In addition, because laws must always have been voted on by a particular city, laws will always bear the stamp of the particular city that enacts them. Because opinions will inevitably vary from city to city, law is bound to appear in a variety of forms even though it is based on a true opinion.19"
"20","Immediately after declaring that law is a true opinion and a kind of discovery, Socrates immediately qualifies this by saying that law is a true opinion that “wishes” (bouletai) to discover “what is” (tou ontos; Minos 315a3, 315b1). It is not immediately clear what Socrates means when he says that law wishes to discover “what is.” How does a law regulating how fast we drive a car or what sort of license we need to sell insurance reveal to us “what is”? In one respect, at least, laws tell us what is forbidden and what is permitted. But beyond this, law also tells us what is just and what is unjust and what is respectable and what is base. In this way, law makes authoritative claims about the most serious things. In light of Socrates’ remark, one wonders not only why law must only wish to discover what is but also how one can distinguish genuine laws from evil decrees if law merely wants to discover “what is.” The comrade does not notice Socrates’ qualification regarding the law's ability to discover “what is” and understands Socrates to mean that law succeeds in discovering it. Consequently, the comrade objects that if law were truly a discovery of “what is,” then law would not constantly change (Minos 315a). He questions Socrates’ claim because he, like Socrates, wants a coherent account of law. Socrates says that law wishes to discover “what is,” but the human beings who make the laws are not always able to discover what the law wishes to discover and thus make different laws at different times. But Socrates pauses to ask if laws really change over time and whether different peoples really use different laws (Minos 315b2–5). He suggests that law itself never changes, but those who try to legislate make mistakes and unintentionally produce a wide variety of decrees which are not laws, strictly speaking.         "
"21","The comrade, however, does not seem to grasp the distinction between the law that does not change and the variety of mistaken statutes that are made by fallible human beings. Surprised at Socrates’ apparent naivete, the comrade says that it is easy to show that different peoples use different laws and that the same people change their laws over time. He points out that while Athenians no longer practice human sacrifices, some barbarian cities continue to do so, sacrificing even their own sons to honor Kronos (Minos 315b8–c2). Socrates’ comrade does not seem to be especially disturbed by the discrepancy between Athenian and barbarian laws. He expects the laws of Greek cities to be comparatively civilized. What troubles him is that he knows of Greek cities that follow the same barbaric laws regarding human sacrifices “even though they are Greek” (Minos 315c4–5). Even civilized Athens once obeyed laws that seem crude by the comrade's contemporary standards. He points out that years ago in Athens, animals were sacrificed before funerals and bodies were buried inside their homes (Minos 315c5–d5). What is particularly disturbing is that “we” Athenians change even the laws that regulate how we worship the gods and honor the dead, laws which are supposed to originate from the gods themselves (Fustel de Coulanges 1984, 220–22). But if even sacred laws can be uncivilized or subject to change, then these laws do not seem to reflect the elevated and presumably unwavering wishes of the immortal gods. The comrade's respect for the law is bound up with his belief that the legislators are supposed to know or to have divined “what the gods have in mind” (Minos 314b4) regarding the honor that we owe them and the honor that we owe to those human beings who have perished.         "
"22","It is at this point that Socrates decides to examine his comrade's conviction that law should be stable. He asks his comrade if the just things are unjust and the unjust things are just or if the just things are just and the unjust, unjust. In asking if the just things are unjust or just, Socrates seems to be asking if the just things are altogether just. If they are, then every just decree, action, and speech would be just in every circumstance and would involve no injustice to any party. The comrade answers that “for me,” the just things are just (Minos 315e9–10a1), meaning that the just things are purely just in every circumstance for everyone involved. He agrees that the just things are recognized (nomizetai) as being just not only in Athens but also in Persia (Minos 316a1). Justice does not vary according to circumstance any more than does weight. If something is heavier in Athens it is also heavier in Persia (Minos 316a4–7). Similarly, the noble things are recognized (nomizetai) as noble everywhere, just as the base things are recognized (nomizetai) as base (316b). Speaking “universally,” Socrates says that the “things that are” are recognized (nomizetai) by everyone, while “the things that are not” are not so recognized. He concludes by saying that those who mistake “what is” are making mistakes in regard to law (Minos 316b5). Recognition, in other words, seems to be a knowledge of beings that are the same under all conditions. The comrade accepts that in the same way that we are able to recognize what is just and noble everywhere we should also always be able to recognize what is lawful everywhere, and thus that the law should be the same for everyone (Minos 316b6–7). But here the comrade objects that “we” keep changing laws and says that he therefore cannot be persuaded (Minos b7–c2). Again, the comrade wants a consistent account of law and is disturbed that he does not have one. Based on the previous argument, Socrates’ Athenian comrade could have concluded that since “we” keep changing the laws, “we” must not be able to recognize “what is” because of some deficiency in our power to recognize it. Instead, Socrates’ comrade doubts whether law itself is ever constant and true. His reluctance to question his ability to recognize “what is” prevents him from entertaining the possibility that others might be able to know and believe in the stable laws that he seeks.         "
"23","Wishing to help his comrade discover a stable basis for law, Socrates argues that some laws do not change because they are grounded in a kind of rational knowledge. Socrates compares laws to the writings of experts in various arts. Focusing on the example of doctors who know how to heal the sick, Socrates wins his comrade's full agreement that those who know medicine always recognize (nomizousin) the same things in regard to the same things, at all times and in all places, regardless of whether they are Greeks or barbarians. Being grounded in an art, these experts’ recognition seems to be based on rational knowledge. Furthermore, when these experts write down what they recognize regarding sickness and health, these writings may be called the “laws” of medicine. In fact, those who are experts in a whole range of productive arts such as medicine, farming, gardening, and cooking compose writings which could be considered the “laws” of each of those arts (Minos 316c–e). Socrates’ association of the legal faculty with an art follows from his comrade's earlier affirmation that law is just and useful for “saving cities and everything else.” At the start of the dialogue, Socrates indicates that the knowledge that reveals what benefits or harms us is an art. When his comrade affirms that law is both just and useful, it makes sense to speak of the faculty that makes laws as an art.         "
"24","The comrade agrees that if there is knowledge of how to manage a city, then the writings of those kings and statesmen (or good men) who possess that knowledge are what people ordinarily call “laws” (Minos 317a5–b1). Socrates argues that since those who know an art will always agree about the same things, these experts would never change their laws. Consequently, those who change their laws are not experts. Socrates next introduces the standard of “correctness” to law: he says that those writings that are “correct” regarding justice and injustice and regarding the management of cities are “kingly laws.” Moreover, what is not “correct” is not law even though it seems to be law to those who do not know (Minos 317c2–7). Socrates now retracts his earlier qualification that law merely wishes to discover what is and asserts that they were correct in agreeing that law is the discovery of what is (Minos 317d1–2). Socrates seems to have satisfied his comrade by saying that expertise in the kingly art gives laws genuine stability and produces laws that are intelligibly correct. By accepting that there are experts in every art who can make stable laws, the comrade becomes willing to accept that “we Athenians” might not know enough to recognize what is lawful and what is not. Socrates also seems to have satisfied his own quest for a legal faculty that can recognize morally binding rules, for those who have this kingly art would have this faculty.         "
"25","As soon as his companion agrees to this argument, however, Socrates suggests that they consider it further and offers a more precise account of what it means to say that law is the discovery of what is. He says that the expert farmer knows how to distribute (dianeimai) the seeds that are “fitting” to “each” piece of land and that this farmer's laws and distributions are correct (Minos 317d3–5). They agree that this is also true in the other comparable arts such as medicine, music, and athletic training and that this is also true of those who know the kingly art (Minos 317a–18a). And as we apply this standard of expertise to the kingly art, we find that the expert in the kingly art would have to distribute what is fitting to each individual in the city. Using the arts of medicine, music, and athletic training as models for this kingly art, we see that the expert in the art not only pays attention to the particular needs and abilities of each individual for whom he cares but also looks to some constant standard of health or excellence toward which he wants to lead the individual. Socrates does not discuss the constant standard of health or excellence that the expert in the kingly art would bear in mind. But it is something like the goal to which Socrates referred at the start of the current discussion, where he says that the legislator who keeps changing the laws might be similar to those who keep moving pieces in a board game with an eye to winning the contest (Minos 316c; cf. Laws 621c–e, 628e).         "
"26","Yet this model of the king who is able to make correct laws and distributions raises a grave problem for law. Because law is not only intrinsically difficult to change but also intrinsically broad, it cannot discriminate among different individuals and cannot be “correct” in the way that the expert in the kingly art's distributions are correct. Socrates’ use of this example alludes to how those who know an art like medicine or farming cannot formulate a rule that covers every case (Best 1980, 108). Thus, in raising this new standard for the correctness of an art, Socrates subtly introduces the criticism of law that is elaborated by the Eleatic Stranger in the Statesman. According to the Eleatic Stranger's well‐known analysis, law does not care adequately for particular individuals because it always tries to formulate a rule that covers every individual under every circumstance. But human beings are so diverse and changeable that such rules cannot account for every need and exigency. Nonetheless, law rules like a “stubborn and ignorant man” who will not allow anything to be done contrary to his command or any question to be asked even when circumstances change (Plato Statesman 294c1–4).20 It may occur, under some circumstances, that a particular law benefits a given individual. But the correctness of that law for that individual depends on potentially changing circumstances which may render the law unfit. In any case, the kingly art cannot make laws that fit every individual. At best, the kingly art makes laws that govern the generality of citizens. The king who rules a city through law is like the shepherd who rules over a herd rather than one who cares for individual sheep (Minos 318a; also Plato Statesman 261d–e).         "
"27","Socrates’ reconsideration of what it means to say that law discovers “what is” has important implications for his quest to discover a legal faculty that recognizes that certain statutes or decrees are morally binding. Socrates has raised the possibility that the expert in the art of the king or statesman (Minos 317a6) might write laws and thus that those who know the kingly art could have the faculty to recognize that some rules are “correct” and thus morally binding. But we now see that the expert in the kingly art cannot recognize that a given law is correct unless he also considers whether it fits a particular individual. Consequently, such an expert cannot look at a law or at a decree all by itself and recognize that it is morally binding (Bruell 1999, 13). This means that the kingly art is not the faculty by which one can recognize that certain rules are always binding for everyone. In fact, it is precisely knowledge of how the kingly art gives what is fitting to different individuals that reveals that fixed laws cannot be based on the same knowledge that underlies the kingly art. The expert in the kingly art understands that there may not be a law that is correct “for us.” This problem with law suggests that the class character of law is different from that of both gold and a stone, for unlike gold or a stone, what counts as a law in one city or nation might cease to be a law in another. In this discussion, law comes to sight not as a being that persists on its own but as a relation that may or may not exist between a particular decree and a particular individual. Unchanging laws wish to discover what is fitting, that is to say, what is just and good for the individual, but this changes according to circumstance. Thus, it appears that the dialogue that has been said to mark the beginning of the natural law tradition (e.g., Cairns 1949, 38n22; Crowe 1977, 17) is also a dialogue which succinctly calls into question whether one can rationally conceive of an unchanging law that is always binding.         "
"28","The problem with law emerges from a conflict that is implicit in Socrates’ comrade's beliefs about law. The comrade believes that law follows justice and that what is just is the same everywhere and never changes. At the same time, he also thinks that what is just involves giving each person what is fitting. This would require that what is just and what is lawful change in different circumstances. But Socrates’ comrade emphatically denies that what is just can vary from place. The comrade's confusion in this regard is due to the fact that he believes that what is just is always lasting and universal. From the point of view of the expert in distributing what is fitting to individual citizens, the comrade errs by taking the particular “distribution” or rule that fits the individual case to be a universal rule and by disregarding the constant standard of health or excellence to which the expert looks in determining what is best for the individual. The comrade's manifest confusion regarding both justice and law shows that he does not possess a legal faculty that enables him to know what a law is. Even though the Athenian comrade expects law to be just, noble, and useful, his own belief in the law is not based in knowledge of any science or art but is, as he said at first, grounded in the fact that he and his city customarily believe that some things are lawful and some are not."
"29","By alluding to how experts in “correct” arts like farming do not issue laws when they give what is fitting to the things that they oversee, Socrates subtly calls into question the authority of law itself. But instead of elaborating on this problem, Socrates quickly raises the possibility that the kingly art is not simply identical to “correct” arts like the art of farming and the art of medicine but is also related to a kind of art whose “laws” are recognizably excellent and authoritative even though they do not change. In order to introduce us to this kind of art, Socrates begins by speaking about the art of flute music. According to Socrates, the art of flute music was perfected by the satyr Marsyas and his beloved Olympus. Socrates says that their compositions should be called the “laws” of flute music and that their music is “most divine” (Minos 318b). Their art of flute music differs from a “correct” art like medicine because it does not distribute different things to different people but always broadcasts the same music to everyone. For many centuries, listeners could discern its divine beauty. But at any given time, some of these listeners have been deeply moved by it. Socrates says that the music of Marsyas and Olympus is the only music that reveals those who are “in need of the gods” (Minos 318b4–c3). Thus, even though the same music is always played for everyone, the music seems to reach out and select those individuals who need or who especially long for the gods. Marsyas's and Olympus's flute music seems to be able to divine those who are in need of gods because the music has hit upon some insight into the needs of such people. The fact that their ancient music's divine beauty has been celebrated for centuries and has always awakened pious longings suggests that Marsyas and Olympus have an insight into some deep and lasting human need.21"
"30","After alluding to this musical art, Socrates suggests that certain kings might possess a similar kind of legislative art. He says that Minos learned the “whole kingly art” through speaking (or reasoning) with Zeus and that he used this art to make divine laws that teach virtue and bring happiness to those who live under the laws (Minos 320b1–c2). Much like Marsyas's and Olympus's divine music, the longevity of the laws of Minos shows that the laws are divine and that Minos had some insight into “the truth” about how to manage the city (Minos 321b1–4). If Minos did make a code of laws that can be known at any time or place to be lawful and morally binding, such a code might be like gold. Following Socrates’ implicit criticism of law in the previous section of the dialogue, such claims come as something of a surprise. If experts in the kingly art would not make unchanging laws, and if those who believe in such laws do so only out of mere belief, how can the unchanging laws of Minos not only last but also bring virtue and happiness to those who live under them? One possibility is that Minos found a way to use laws that do not perfectly fit each individual but that nonetheless instill a kind of virtue in each of them. But how is this possible, and what kind of virtue would it produce? And how can the laws bring happiness if they are not fitting?22 It is also possible that Minos, like Marsyas and Olympus, had some insight into the needs of a certain kind of human being and made laws that will always appeal to or even fit that kind of person. But what sort of person would these laws affect, and how do they do so?         "
"31","Rather than discuss these possibilities and questions directly, Socrates must reply to his comrade's objection that Minos is said to be savage, harsh, and unjust (Minos 318d9–10). It is the comrade's lack of respect for Minos that made him initially reluctant to acknowledge that the laws of Crete are said to be oldest and divine (Minos 318e4–7). Faced with a challenge to his claim that Minos made divine laws, Socrates mounts a demonstration that Minos and his laws are divine. Socrates begins by reminding his comrade that Minos is a son of Zeus and by saying that a divine man like Minos deserves to be spoken of with respect (Minos 318e–19a). According to Socrates’ procedure, the best way to understand a divine matter is to approach it with appropriate respect. Socrates further supports Minos's reputation and authority by citing the authority of Homer and Hesiod. Based on his reading of Homer, Socrates says that Zeus is a sophist who taught Minos the “whole kingly art” and that this art is “altogether noble” (Minos 319c3–4). He says that Homer tells us that Minos would confer with Zeus through reasoned speeches (logoi) and show Zeus what he had learned every ninth year (Minos 319c4). Socrates’ most important evidence for the divinity of Minos and his laws lies in his exegesis of a particular passage from the Odyssey. The passage says that Minos was the king of Knossos and the confidant (oaristes) of great Zeus (Minos 319b5–6; Homer Odyssey XI 568–72). But, as Socrates himself points out, the meaning of the passage that he quotes is disputed because the word oaristes could mean either a “partner in conversation” or else a “drinking partner” and “fellow reveler.” Consequently, some have interpreted the passage to mean that Minos did not learn from Zeus but merely drank and caroused with him (Minos 319e6–7). Socrates resolves this dispute by approaching the text and its subject matter with the greatest respect. He reasons that since Minos is a divine man, he would not say one thing and do another, as would a worthless man. He did not “believe in” (enomizen) laws that forbid drinking wine and then “believe in” (enomizen) drinking wine himself (Minos 320a1–b8). Socrates concludes that Minos's communion with Zeus came through “reasoned speeches” (dia logon) about being educated in virtue (Minos 320b2–4). On the basis of that communion, Minos set up the laws that have brought happiness to the citizens of Crete (Minos 320b4–7). Socrates also mentions that this same communion also brought happiness to Sparta (Minos 320b6–7). This suggests that the laws’ principles and goals are sufficiently intelligible to human reason that Lycurgus was able to apprehend them and successfully apply them to Sparta.         "
"32","Despite Socrates’ interpretation of such lines from Hesiod, Socrates’ comrade makes a further objection to Socrates’ claim that Minos is a divine man. He does not dispute Socrates’ evidence that Minos was just. But he calls out Socrates’ name as if to stop him and challenges him to explain how Minos acquired his reputation for being savage and harsh (Minos 320d8–e1). Socrates explains that Minos is blamed for being savage and harsh by Athens's tragic poets. Socrates cannot simply dismiss the authority of these poets. Like Homer, they too are said to be divine (cf. Plato Apology 22c; Laws 719c). Confronted with a conflict between two such authorities, Socrates cannot resolve it by approaching both authorities with respect. Such a dispute, he implies, can be settled only by giving an account of how the one authority came to be mistaken along with another account that demonstrates why the other is correct. As for the first of these, Socrates claims that Minos provoked the Athenian poets’ anger by waging a mistaken war against Athens and by imposing a harsh penalty on her (Minos 321a1–b1). As for the second account, Socrates points to the longevity of the laws as proof that Minos discovered the truth about managing cities (Minos 321b1–4). In response to this evidence, Socrates’ comrade says that Socrates seems to have discovered a likely account (logos) of the matter (Minos 321b5). The comrade's pious respect for a divine man like Minos and his respect for Socrates’ reasoning have overcome his Athenian prejudice against Minos. But Socrates is not satisfied with his comrade's acquiescence. He points out that someone else might still not be satisfied and might ask how the unchanging laws of Minos benefit the souls of those who live under them (Minos 321d1). In order to satisfy this unnamed questioner, Socrates tries to provide an account of how the laws improve the soul. He asks his comrade if he knows that physical trainers distribute food and toil to those whom they train so that their bodies become stronger and more developed (Minos 321c4–8). After the comrade affirms that he does, Socrates asks his comrade what the good legislator gives to the citizens to make their souls better, but his comrade cannot say. Socrates concludes by declaring that it is most shameful for “the soul” of both the comrade and Socrates himself if they know what benefits the body but do not know “what it is in the soul that becomes good or bad” (Minos 321d6–10). If they do not know how law improves “the soul,” they do not know in what respect a soul is better or worse. At this impasse, the dialogue ends. But numerous implications and questions follow from the argument and the impasse. Socrates’ closing statement assumes that we know that law improves the soul. But Socrates discusses how the laws of Minos improve the soul in order to answer the unnamed questioner at 321d1 who still doubts that Minos and his laws are divine. Because they have not been able to say how the laws of Minos benefit the soul, they have still not been able to show decisively that Minos is not savage and unjust. In fact, their failure to say how the laws of Minos bring some good to the soul calls into question whether Minos was educated by Zeus and whether Minos knew the kingly art. Despite Socrates’ efforts to persuade his comrade that Minos and his laws are divine, he has not demonstrated that Minos conversed with Zeus through reasoned speeches or that he used what he learned to teach virtue and bring happiness to Crete. In fact, he has not proven that reasoned speech is the medium through which Zeus would establish his laws. He has not demonstrated that it is possible to know divine law through reasoned speech alone.         "
"33","The Minos shows Socrates examining one of his fellow Athenians about what law is and about how we come to believe in it. Socrates wants to know if we come to respect the law through rational knowledge or through some other faculty. In the course of the conversation, Socrates finds that his comrade does not have a coherent account of law. Based on what he says about law, our ever‐changing laws do not seem to be grounded in rational knowledge of how to care for human beings. Socrates does not, however, conclude from his fellow citizen's confusion that law is not a serious thing. Instead, he leads his comrade to consider the possibility that even if we keep changing laws without knowing what is truly lawful and just, a god or a divine human being might know the whole kingly art and might use it to make a code of laws that are recognizably beneficial and divine. The last section of the Minos raises the possibility that Zeus used reason to teach Minos how to make unchanging laws that both “save cities” and bring virtue and happiness to the citizens (Minos 320b2–4). In the end, however, Socrates does not demonstrate that the laws of Minos can accomplish these goals. Moreover, he has not shown that Zeus reasoned with Minos or that Zeus teaches a ruling art that can be understood by reason. He has not proven that he knows either the source or the full purposes of the laws of Minos. In short, his conversation with his Athenian comrade shows that he needs to continue his examination of law by examining divine law. As he indicates by his treatment of Minos and Homer at the end of the dialogue, he will examine divine law as it presents itself. He will need to examine those who have been educated by the laws and who believe in its authority. Only then might he learn if they know something that he does not know about the origins and purposes of divine law. Only then might he learn whether and what sort of knowledge Zeus conveyed to Minos and specifically whether divine law is fully knowable through human reason.         "
"34","By showing us both a fundamental problem with law and why that problem cannot be fully understood unless one examines the kind of knowledge that underlies divine law, the Minos helps us understand the concerns that guide the Athenian Stranger at the start of the Laws.23 The Laws begins as the Athenian Stranger asks an elderly statesman from Crete and another from Sparta about the origins and purposes of their cities’ laws. The initial exchange shows that the Cretan statesman Kleinias admires his city's divine lawgiver because the lawgiver has perceived that the city has several important and intelligible needs and has prudently provided the means for meeting them. Specifically, Kleinias praises Crete's lawgiver for understanding that every city is by nature at war with all other cities and for establishing the correct kind of training for securing a victory in war (Plato Laws 625c9–e1). He also praises him not only for recognizing that there is a permanent war within each city and within each citizen but also for devising laws that enable the better parts of the city and of each citizen to triumph over the worse (Plato Laws 626c–e). In fact, Kleinias regards the individual's victory over himself as being even better than the city's victory over foreign enemies (Plato Laws 626e). But the subsequent discussion shows how Kleinias's very belief that his city's laws have intelligible goals becomes the source of his ultimate dissatisfaction with the existing laws of Crete. The Athenian Stranger questions the divinity of Crete's laws by drawing Kleinias's attention to another sort of law that would not merely enable the better part of the city or of the individual to triumph over the worse but instead would provide both the city and the individual with internal peace and harmony (Plato Laws 628a–b). He compares the work of the existing laws of Crete to the work of the art of medicine, an art that remedies disorders, rather than to the work of the art of the physical trainer, an art that achieves higher goods such as positive strength and glowing health (Plato Laws 628c–d). Kleinias is especially impressed by the Athenian Stranger's argument that the current laws of Crete aim only at the battlefield courage employed in fighting foreign wars rather than at the complete virtue of an excellent human being, a virtue that shines forth in the gravest crises, such as during a harsh civil war. The serious citizen who has been raised by divine law does not believe that civic virtue is reducible to patriotism (e.g., Montesquieu Spirit of the Laws 5.2). On the contrary, he thinks that it shines forth most clearly during the very breakdown of a political society. The altogether trustworthy human being comes to sight through Kleinias's admiration for a range of particular virtues, including courage, moderation, justice, and practical reason (Plato Laws 630a–b).         "
"35","Confronted with the mere possibility of laws that aim at greater goods and especially that aim at the whole of virtue, Kleinias concludes that laws that aim only at victory and only at courage cannot have been established by a god. The laws of Crete and Sparta must have become corrupted and no longer resemble those that the divinely educated Minos and Lycurgus originally established (Laws 630c, 630e, 688b). Thus, the opening of the dialogue shows that the citizen's belief in divine law is rooted in his belief that divine law has principles and goals that are knowable to human reason. He believes that divine law aims at the greatest possible ends and thus that it aims at the complete excellence or virtue of a human being. After reasoning about the goals of the laws of Minos, Kleinias's belief in those laws changes. His belief in the divinity of the laws of Minos wavers, and he finds that he believes in another code of divine laws that can be shown to aim at what is best (Plato Laws 628c). When shown that his city's divine laws seem to aim at a lesser form of virtue, he does not respond by saying that the law itself is the greatest authority and therefore the courage of the patriotic warrior must be the highest virtue, despite what we may think. Instead, he grants that the current laws of Crete do not aim at the highest ends: he does not look to the divine law to establish what is noble or just or sacred but looks to what he knows, through reasoning, about goods such as harmony and especially the complete virtue of a human being to recognize the divinity of law. Having established that Kleinias's belief in divine law is connected to what he knows through reason about the virtues, the Athenian Stranger offers to elaborate the goods that “correct” law will bring into being. The foremost “divine” goods are the virtues courage, justice, moderation, and prudence or intellect. From this point on, the Athenian Stranger will try to use his knowledge of the political art to delineate these virtues and to elaborate a legal code that can satisfy Kleinias's and Megillus's expectations of divine law (Plato Laws 649d–50b, 657a–b, 839b–c). He will try to show that divine law needs rational guidance to clarify the particular virtues at which divine law aims and to order them so that they culminate in “virtue as a whole.” At the same time, his attempt to demonstrate that he knows a code of law that can produce the complete virtue of a human being is an attempt to show that human reason can both comprehend and accomplish the goals of divine law. Much like the natural theology that attempts to use human reason alone to demonstrate the existence of the god, the Athenian Stranger's procedure in the Laws is an attempt to show that human reason alone can comprehend and reveal divine law.         "
"36","By raising questions about the relation between reason and divine law, the Minos helps us understand what the Athenian Stranger is trying to achieve in the course of the Laws. In addition, the Minos also helps us raise critical questions about the Athenian Stranger's attempt to lay out a code of divine law. The Minos’s implicit criticisms of law's breadth and inflexibility lead one to ask how even the best code of law can bring about the complete virtue and happiness that is said to be the goal of divine law in the Laws. And having raised questions about how we come to recognize law, it also leads us to wonder how Kleinias and Megillus are ultimately able to confirm that the Athenian Stranger is laying out a truly divine code of law when they admit that they do not adequately know what complete virtue is (Plato Laws 964a–65e, 966d4–5, 968b10–c2, 969c4–d3). Taken together, the Minos and the Laws do more than present Plato's best possible regime. They offer a probing examination of both divine law and of the philosophic attempt to comprehend it. Their serious, respectful, and incisive questioning of divine law stands as a model for contemporary political rationalists who wish to establish a productive dialogue with defenders of divine law.
