"1","All organizations engage in mutual learning between the organization itself and the individuals who work within it (March 1991, 73). Learning organizations engaged in the same repetitive task—in this case, a presidential administration managing hundreds of top‐level agency positions—can upgrade their information and, hence, make more informed choices that better serve their interests (Levinthal and March 1993). Because presidents, as principals in learning organizations, become more skilled at managing agents over time (Banks and Sundaram 1998; Murphy 1986), they should become more effective at appointing individuals who will best assist them in achieving their policy goals.         "
"2","Organizational learning is critical for understanding the functioning of the modern presidency (Burke 2002; Hess 1988; Hult and Walcott 2004; Walcott and Hult 1995). Presidential learning arises from two distinct but reinforcing sources. First, novice modern presidents are both poorly informed and unprepared when they begin their presidency since they usually come from outside of Washington, DC, and lack federal agency experience (Kernell 2007). If new presidents do a poor job of transitioning from campaign mode to governing mode, as they often do (Pfiffner 1988), this lack of information and preparation is exacerbated. Presidents also face a decline in both popular and legislative support that begins soon after taking office (Kernell 2007; Light 1999), necessitating greater reliance on administrative strategies to meet their policy objectives (Howell and Mayer 2005; Kagan 2001; Nathan 1983; Waterman 1989).         "
"3","If presidents become more effective at managing the bureaucracy the longer they remain in office, then they should become better at selecting agency leaders who can best serve their interests when it comes to managing the bureaucracy. This learning is specific to each president; thus, the focus is on changes within an administration, rather than across administrations. Administration‐specific learning is consistent with theories of organizational learning that posit that temporal and spatial myopia limit experiential learning to information and events most proximate to the organization (Levinthal and March 1993, 110). That is, collective memory is of a fleeting nature due to past conflicts, personnel turnover, and the decentralized nature of how public agencies function (see March, Sproull, and Tamusz 1991). Experiential learning is therefore reflected in how individual presidential administrations shift strategies in appointing agency leaders during their time in office.2 The goals largely do not change; only the means in reaching these goals shift. We next discuss three hypotheses that reflect presidential learning in response to variable constraints that they confront when managing the bureaucracy, and how that learning impacts their appointment calculus for U.S. federal agency leadership positions.         "
"4","As presidents’ political capital wanes through their tenure, presidents increasingly depend on an administrative strategy to achieve their policy objectives. Presidents therefore become relatively more risk averse when it comes to appointing agency leaders. Presidents exhibiting experiential learning will become better equipped at managing uncertainty regarding what particular tasks public agencies choose to undertake, as well as how agency leaders direct the conduct of such tasks (Carpenter 2010). In terms of appointment choices, presidents will require more of a particular agent trait to mitigate agent trait uncertainty the longer they serve in office. According to our data, one example of this growing concern for risk was when President Clinton chose to keep David Kessler as his head of the Food and Drug Administration in January 1993 but later replaced him with Jane Henney, an individual possessing not only considerably higher levels of management and policy expertise at the time of her nomination in June 1998, but also who the administration believed possessed less uncertainty regarding these agent traits. Put simply, presidents rationally learn to reduce agency costs incurred from being uncertain regarding key bureaucratic agent traits that are vital for serving their own policy interests.3"
"5","To the extent that President Obama is demanding even more competence from his “outsider” appointees in his second term, about whom he knows less, such practices comport with these dynamics (McGregor 2012). Specifically, Obama's second‐term selections are intended to help him achieve his policy agenda (Rucker and Eilperin 2013). Similarly, after realizing he had relinquished critical control to agency leaders who turned out not to be loyal to him (and then firing some of them), President Carter became more risk averse in his pursuit of acquiring loyalist appointees as his term progressed (Bonafede 1987). This logic yields the first hypothesis.               "
"6","This means that presidents should prefer to increase the relative weight placed on loyalty vis‐à‐vis competence in response to higher loyalty uncertainty, while responding in an opposite fashion to higher competence uncertainty."
"7","Most modern presidents do not possess meaningful federal agency experience when they take office. Even when presidents possess such experience, such as President George H. W. Bush, they still confront the complexity of presidential transitions and new exigencies from taking over the reins of executive power for the first time (Patterson and Pfiffner 2001, 433). Theories of organizational hierarchy underscore the information asymmetries and biases that occur when a principal delegates to agents in a vertical structural design setting (Hammond and Thomas 1989; Miller 1992). One effective strategy for mitigating such vertical integration problems is the application of information counterbalancing between supervisory agents and subordinate agents within bureaucratic organizations (Cyert and March 1963, 67–82; Downs 1967, 121–22). In turn, this can improve bureaucratic performance by exploiting both breadth (generalists) and depth (specialists) of expertise used to perform administrative tasks (Aberbach and Rockman 2000, 56; Krause, Lewis, and Douglas 2006). Presidential appointment choices can thus be utilized to mitigate particular policy biases that may exist within agencies.            "
"8","In the context of experiential learning theory, presidents will seek to mitigate the information problems that arise from managing federal agencies by altering their appointment strategy accordingly. Specifically, newly elected presidents will employ an appointment heuristic that counterbalances more loyal appointees serving in top agency leadership positions with more competent appointees serving directly beneath them. For example, President George W. Bush selected Roderick Paige, a loyalist, to head the Department of Education in 2001, subsequently naming William Hansen as the deputy secretary. Hansen had extensive prior federal experience in both the department and other federal agencies; plus, he had spent most of the 1990s working in the field of education. As presidents learn more about the federal bureaucracy, they will possess greater capacity to direct bureaucratic agencies. They then will have less incentive to rely on this type of heuristic for solving vertical coordination problems in the realm of appointment choices. This agent monitoring process produces the second hypothesis.               "
"9","In other words, the relative balance of agent traits possessed by both supervisory and subordinate appointees should converge during a president's tenure in office."
"10","Presidents rely more on administrative mechanisms than legislative activities over time to achieve their goals, and thus they should alter the relative weight that they place on loyalty vis‐à‐vis competence of agency leaders in response to legislative policy conflict. This decreased reliance on Congress results from the legislative branch being increasingly less willing over time to acquiesce to a particular presidential administration on lawmaking activities, given any amount of divergence in executive‐legislative preferences (McCarty 1997). If experience allows presidents to manage the bureaucracy more effectively, their appointment strategies should evolve to choose bureaucratic leaders who can best counteract legislative constraints on executive policymaking.            "
"11","The problem of common agency shapes how multiple principals arrive at a collective decision about delegating authority to an agent (Bernheim and Whinston 1986; Bertelli and Lynn 2004; Dixit, Grossman, and Helpman 1997). This type of horizontal coordination problem between competing political principals is distinct from the moral hazard problems that arise in an organizational hierarchy involving a political principal and nested agents that can be mitigated through information counterbalancing. In the realm of appointment politics, presidents are formally constrained by the Senate under the U.S. Constitution. When the president and Senate share similar policy preferences, the president has considerable latitude in making appointments (Gerhardt 2000; Krutz, Fleisher, and Bond 1998; Nokken and Sala 2000). Yet, as presidential and Senate policy preferences diverge, presidents become increasingly constrained when choosing officials (Bertelli and Grose 2011; McCarty 2004; Nokken and Sala 2000).            "
"12","If presidents exhibit experiential learning behavior in managing the bureaucracy, they should become more effective during their time in office at augmenting loyalty, at the expense of competence, when making bureaucratic leadership appointments in response to executive‐legislative policy conflict. To start, presidents wish to limit legislative influence over a well‐managed agency. Presidents also face less direct own‐partisan accountability for any bureaucratic failures that may occur if the party finds the relevant agency officials ideologically compatible. A competent agency leader thus poses potentially serious problems for presidential administrations because Congress can exploit the leader's expertise and skills to its own advantage, and against the president's objectives. For example, President Reagan was willing to sacrifice competence to get loyalty in his top appointees, in part not to have Congress co‐opt his policy goals (Michaels 1997). Moreover, agencies led by competent appointees are also more capable of exploiting the vacuum created by divided political principals (Calvert, McCubbins, and Weingast 1989; Hammond and Knott 1996). To handle this particular type of common agency problem, presidents will place greater weight on agent loyalty relative to agent competence in their appointment choices, even if desired competence stays constant or rises.            "
"13","If presidents become more effective at managing the bureaucracy to meet their goals over time, they should place successively greater weight on agent loyalty in response to institutional conflict between themselves and the Senate. Similarly, though perhaps not as strongly, presidents under these conditions should also be increasingly successful in choosing less competent appointees to thwart legislative attempts to control the bureaucracy. For instance, in 1996, President Clinton's pick for the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Franklin Raines, was more loyal than the outgoing director chosen in unified government, Alice Rivlin. Two years later, still in divided government, President Clinton chose an even stronger loyalist, Jacob Lew, to replace Raines. This type of experiential learning produces the final hypothesis.               "
"14","To be clear, this hypothesis does not rule out that presidents seek competent agency leaders in the presence of interbranch conflict to ensure that White House policy priorities are carried out.4 So long as the agent loyalty trait grows faster, relative to the agent competence trait, for a given appointee during times of interbranch ideological policy conflict, the hypothesis still holds. Presidents can therefore select both more loyal and competent (in absolute terms) individual agency leaders under such contexts.            "
"15","The empirical predictions derived from the experiential learning theory are tested using an original biographical database consisting of 1,372 appointees who served in an important set of Senate‐confirmed leadership positions in 56 distinct agency organizational units within 39 major U.S. federal agencies from January 1977 to January 2009 (from the start of Jimmy Carter's presidency through the end of George W. Bush's). These positions include the two highest officials at each major executive agency (if Senate‐confirmed) along with a subset of other Senate‐confirmed jobs using Trattner (2000) and the commissioners/board members at major independent regulatory agencies. This database consists of publicly available biographical information for these U.S. federal agency leaders known at the time of nomination, from which we create original measures of ex ante agent loyalty, policy expertise, and managerial skill. These measures provide a conservative test of experiential learning behavior since they omit the possibility that presidents may obtain better private (but unobservable) information over time.         "
"16","The following indicator variables known to the appointing president (or the White House Office of Presidential Personnel) at the time of nomination compose the latent concept of agent loyalty: 1 whether the appointee shared the same party affiliation as the nominating president, (2) whether the appointee gave any monetary campaign contributions meeting the Federal Election Commission reporting limit to the nominating president, (3) whether an appointee with shared partisan affiliation previously served in an appointed (Senate confirmed or not) full‐time position in any agency during a preceding administration (signifying administrative service reflecting partisan loyalty that transcends the appointing president), (4) whether the appointee had previous elective office experience, (5) whether the appointee had any experience working for a national organization or running the state organization for the party of the president, and (6) whether the appointee served in state government when the nominating president was governor. These measures account for agent loyalty reflected through a shared political orientation (inferred from shared partisanship with the appointing president and political investment through prenomination campaign contributions to the appointing president), as well as fealty to the appointing president that gauges their propensity of serving as a “team player” possessing a shared partisan organizational identity (inferred from prior service to a political party through elected office, administrative, or organizational duties).         "
"17","Agency leaders must manage an organization and engage in substantive policy issues. The following indicator variables generate a latent measure of agent managerial competence, again determined at the time of nomination: 1 whether the appointee lived in the DC area at some point in the previous decade (capturing the individual's “embeddedness” [Granovetter 1985] through personal and professional interactions in the Beltway [federal government] milieu), (2) how many of the appointee's four preceding jobs had relevant federal government management experience, (3) the extent to which the appointee had any federal management experience, and (4) whether the appointee previously held an appointed position in the agency. Managing a government agency meaningfully contrasts with managing a corporation or other nongovernment organizations for several reasons. First, government organizations possess considerably less external control over inputs and greater difficulty in measuring outputs than private and nonprofit firms and hence are more susceptible to centralization and other pressures that result in agency emulation (Frumkin and Galaskiewicz 2004, 292–93). Second, public agencies have distinct budgeting and personnel systems. Finally, agency leaders need particular political skills (Light 1987), which are not developed in the same way in the private or nonprofit sector as in senior appointed positions.5"
"18","A latent measure of agent policy (or issue) competence known at the time of nomination is also constructed. These policy expertise indicator variables include 1 whether the appointee had no bachelor's or graduate degree, a single educational degree, or multiple educational degrees in policy‐related fields germane to the appointed position; (2) how many of the appointee's four preceding jobs were related to the policy issues of the agency; (3) whether the appointee had any federal government experience related to the policy areas of the position; (4) whether the appointee had any civil service experience in the federal government; and (5) whether the appointee had any agency‐specific civil service experience in the agency. These measures are proxies for effective administrators based on managerial and policy expertise.         "
"19","Statistical measures of loyalty and competence for each agency leader are generated from a generalized latent trait model estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carolo simulation methods. This takes the form of a three‐factor confirmatory factor structural model with correlated measurement errors (containing diffuse priors) containing a mixture of various discrete (binary and polychotomous [ordered and unordered]) indicator variables in three separate continuous latent factor concepts: loyalty, managerial competence, and policy competence. Each individual agent trait is generated from the Bayesian posterior median estimates. Various convergent and discriminant validity tests, as well as Bayesian exploratory generalized latent trait analysis, revealed that the sets of indicators described above load into their respective loyalty, managerial competence, and policy competence dimensions and provide the best fit to these data.6"
"20","Presidents’ decision calculus rests upon selecting the individual with the appropriate agent profile for top agency positions. Presidents must comparatively weigh loyalty vis‐à‐vis competence as agent traits when determining the appropriate agent profile (e.g., Edwards 2001; Lewis 2008).7 Although all three agent trait measures possess roughly identical means centered close to zero, their respective variances differ considerably. These dependent variables are operationalized as the difference in an appointee's respective Z‐scores for Loyalty and Managerial Competence (ZM* = ZLoyalty − ZManagerial Competence), and also Loyalty and Policy Competence (ZP* = ZLoyalty − ZPolicy Competence). Positive Z‐score differences indicate the president has appointed someone exhibiting greater agent responsiveness vis‐à‐vis agent expertise (Z* = ZLoyalty − ZCompetence > 0), whereas negative Z‐score differences show that an appointee possesses greater agent expertise vis‐à‐vis agent responsiveness (Z* = ZLoyalty − ZCompetence < 0). An appointee with a Z‐score equal to zero is one who reflects an equal balance of responsiveness and expertise in relative terms (Z* = ZLoyalty − ZCompetence = 0).8 Examples of each type can be found in recent secretaries of energy: James Edwards (Reagan appointee) has a high positive Z‐score difference between loyalty and managerial competence (ZM* = 2.929, 97.81 percentile) and between loyalty and policy competence (ZP* = 3.412, 97.01 percentile), and James Schlesinger (Carter appointee) has a very negative Z‐score difference on both types of competence (ZM* = −3.237, 1.24 percentile; ZP* = −2.387, 7.00 percentile), implying low levels of loyalty to his appointing president (ZLoyalty = −1.334, 11.30 percentile) coupled with high levels of managerial and policy expertise (ZManagerial Competence = 1.903, 97.45 percentile, ZPolicy Competence = 1.053, 84.62 percentile). James Watkins (G. H. W. Bush appointee) has essentially balanced agent traits of loyalty and managerial competence (ZM* = −0.054, 47.74 percentile), whereas Samuel Bodman (G. W. Bush appointee) has balanced loyalty and policy competence agent traits (ZP* = −0.014, 54.88 percentile). The bivariate correlations reveal that normalized Loyalty is more negatively correlated with normalized Policy Competence than normalized Managerial Competence (ZLoyalty, ZPolicy Competence = −0.437; ZLoyalty, ZManagerial Competence = −0.122), and the two competence measures are correlated at 0.697.9"
"21","Figure 1 displays several scatterplots (and corresponding Lowess smoothed estimate) of the difference between the normalized Loyalty and Competence average annual scores across thelife span of a presidential administration. The top panel of graphs (Figures 1A and 1B) is based on all sample observations, whereas the bottom panel of graphs (Figures 1C and 1D) eliminates Patronage Appointees and Current Administration Appointees.10 The graphs accounting for all appointees in our sample (Figures 1A and 1B) reveal that presidents appoint individuals who are more loyal than competent during the inaugural year of an administration. A sharp drop in this difference ensues, followed by a subsequent modest increase early in a president's second term (if there is one), followed by a final sharp drop. When excluding both patronage and “retread” appointees within the same administration (Figures 1C and 1D), the uptick in premium placed on agent loyalty vis‐à‐vis agent competence in Years 5 and 6 of an administration becomes much more pronounced compared to the full sample of appointees (Figures 1A and 1B). This second‐term surge in presidents selecting appointees based more on responsiveness than expertise is most acutely observed with respect to Managerial Competence (ZM*) (Figure 1C). In Year 7, this loyalty‐competence balance remains flat or falls somewhat, before falling sharply in Year 8. Overall, these four graphs indicate that presidents generally trade off responsiveness for competence as their tenure in office grows. This pattern suggests that as their information about the bureaucracy improves over time, presidents become increasingly aware not only that they do not merely wish to have agency leadership who will offer managerial and policy competence in carrying out their policy goals, but also that they wish to rely less on appointing loyalists to critical positions. The key independent variables account for the interaction between presidential tenure (defined by the quarter‐year in which an appointee was nominated) and uncertainty about appointee characteristics, agency position level, and conflict between the White House and Senate. Testing of Hypothesis 1 (Agent Selection Learning) entails interacting Presidential Tenure11 with each of the individual trait uncertainty measures: Loyalty Uncertainty, Managerial Competence Uncertainty, and Policy Competence Uncertainty. According to this Agent Selection Learning Hypothesis, Loyalty Uncertainty × Presidential Tenure should have a positive coefficient, whereas Managerial Competence Uncertainty × Presidential Tenure and Policy Competence Uncertainty × Presidential Tenure should yield negative coefficients.12 Testing Hypothesis 2 (Agent Monitoring Learning) similarly requires interacting Top Supervisory Position13 with the Presidential Tenure covariate. This Agent Monitoring Learning Hypothesis predicts that the Top Supervisory Position × Presidential Tenure interaction term should possess a negative coefficient. In addition, a series of statistical models is estimated that broadens the Top Supervisory Position to include executive subagency heads.         "
"22","Presidential Appointments to U.S. Federal Agency Leadership Positions: The Dynamics of Appointee Loyalty‐Competence Trade‐offs during the Life Cycle of Presidential Administrations"
"23","Testing of Hypothesis 3 (Common Agency Learning) involves interacting Presidential Tenure with the policy conflict between the White House and Senate using ideological and partisan‐based measures, respectively. Common Space Distance between President and Senate Floor Median is the absolute difference in the first‐dimension Common Space DW−NOMINATE ideology scores between the president and the Senate floor median member at the time of the respective appointee's nomination (Carroll et al. 2009). Divided Government (President and Senate) is a binary measure marking whether different parties controlled the White House and Senate in the year of the respective appointee's nomination.14 This Common Agency Learning Hypothesis predicts that the interaction effect between these policy conflict measures and the Presidential Tenure covariate should be positive.         "
"24","The statistical models also account for the influence that presidential approval and presidential policy priorities may exert on the relative balance between loyalty and competence traits underlying appointment choices. Presidential Job Approval in Month of Nomination is the percentage of respondents approving of the president's job performance in Gallup polls, taken from national surveys during the month in which the respective appointee was nominated. State of the Union Count is the number of mentions of policy issues directly relevant to the agency to which the respective appointee was named in the year of nomination and functions here as a measure of agency policy salience.15 To account for the possibility that appointees to independent regulatory agencies exhibit higher competence and lower loyalty traits relative to executive agency appointees, Independent Regulatory Commission (IRC) is a binary indicator that equals 1 for independent regulatory commissions or boards and 0 for executive departments and agencies. In addition, first‐term presidents with reelection concerns face a different appointment calculus than lame‐duck second‐term presidents; the binary indicator Second Term equals 1 for second‐term presidents and 0 otherwise.16 First‐term presidents may wish to emphasize hiring competent political executives to enhance their chances at being reelected (Besley and Case 1995); second‐term presidents, by contrast, may place a greater relative preference for loyalty in their second term to help cement their policy legacy.         "
"25","To rule out concerns about the “talent pool” of appointees changing over time (Dewan and Myatt 2010), the statistical models account for the selection of patronage appointees through the Patronage Appointee variable. The models also control for “retreads,” in case such experience contributes to higher appointee competence independent of the experiential learning theory, through the Current Administration Appointment Experience variable.17 Finally, presidential administration fixed effects are incorporated to account for unobserved heterogeneity in appointment choices across different administrations.         "
"26","Because the data design consists of individuals as the unit of analysis (i), embedded within particular position types (j) for each agency (k), the statistical modeling approach adopted here is a three‐level hierarchical model containing random intercepts nested at the agency position type and agency levels, with covariates that correspond to individual‐specific attributes:            "
"27","Level 1 relates to the individual appointment decision whose circumstances vary by individual appointee (pth‐order coefficient vector and corresponding covariate matrix denoted by βp Xijk, p), whereas Level 3 refers to agency‐specific covariates (Agency Policy Salience and Independent Regulatory Commission), as denoted by the qth‐order coefficient vector and corresponding covariate matrix denoted by γq Wk, q. There are no position‐specific (Level 2) covariates—only the allowance of a random intercept term to account for this possible source of heterogeneity at the second level of the multilevel data structure—denoted by ξjk(2). Finally, an agency‐specific random intercept was also modeled to allow for potential heterogeneity from the third level of this multilevel data structure, denoted by ξk(3).18 The statistical model is estimated via maximum likelihood techniques based on the expectation‐maximization (EM) algorithm. Each regression model is estimated on the full sample of agencies as well as on a 95% trimmed sample (π0.025, π0.975). The symmetrically trimmed sample has the advantage of omitting extreme appointee cases involving high loyalty–low competence or low loyalty–high competence.         "
"28","The statistical estimates appearing in Table 1 analyze the testable propositions derived from the experiential learning theory regarding how presidents rationally choose to balance loyalty versus managerial competence (ZM*) in making appointments to U.S. federal agency leadership positions. Individual‐level differences explain almost 70% of the variation in appointments, with agency position differences making up about two‐thirds and agency‐level differences taking up one‐third of the remaining explained variation from these models. The covariates pertaining to presidential job approval at time of nomination, agency policy salience, the distinction between independent regulatory commissions and executive branch agencies, and the distinction between first‐term and second‐term presidencies generally fail to shape presidents’ decision calculus when it comes to balancing loyalty and managerial competence agent traits in their selection of agency leaders. Patronage appointees result in higher standardized loyalty–managerial competence appointee scores, whereas current administration “retread” appointees yield lower scores. This is what one would expect given that presidents seek relatively greater appointee responsiveness in the former case and relatively greater appointee managerial competence in the latter case.         "
"29","The statistical evidence in Table 1 shows that novice presidents require less loyalty vis‐à‐vis managerial competence as uncertainty regarding an appointee's level of loyalty (Loyalty Uncertainty) rises. With respect to increasing uncertainty regarding an appointee's managerial competence (Managerial Competence Uncertainty), newer presidents do not seek to offset uncertainty arising from this particular agent trait by appointing an individual with more loyalty relative to managerial competence. In tandem, these findings are indicative of a trade‐off, whereby the caliber of information presidents have regarding an appointee's particular agent trait is positively related to the relative abundance of each trait. Empirical support for Hypothesis 1 (Agent Selection Learning Hypothesis) is obtained by the positive and statistically significant coefficients for Loyalty Uncertainty × Presidential Tenure in all instances, and negative, significant coefficients for Managerial Competence × Presidential Tenure for only the full‐sample models. In short, as presidents become more skilled at managing the bureaucracy over time, they should require a “risk premium” such that higher levels of ex ante loyalty and competence are required from each chosen appointee to offset the presence of increased uncertainty about each type of trait.19 This risk premium effect is attenuated for managerial competence uncertainty in the trimmed models, which may result from presidents’ reduced willingness to counteract this form of agent trait uncertainty for those appointees with the most favorable balance of managerial competence to loyalty (i.e., lowest ZM* scores).20"
"30","Figures 2A and 2B, based on the estimates generated from Model 2: Trimmed Sample, illustrate the dynamics corresponding to this “risk premium.” Figure 2A reveals that a one‐unit increase in Appointee Loyalty Uncertainty nets a 0.794 unit decline in the standardized loyalty–managerial competence differential in the first quarter of an administration while resulting in a 0.689 unit decline in Quarter 16, and a 0.576 unit decline in Quarter 32 for a second‐term president—a 0.218 unit average increase in the relative balance of loyalty to managerial competence (ZM*) within an administration. For an interquartile increase in this covariate (1.159), this represents a 0.253 marginal rise in ZM* during the life span of a presidential administration (12.15% of the interquartile range for ZM*).21 Similarly, Figure 2B reveals that Appointee Managerial Competence Uncertainty yields a modest increase in the balance of loyalty to managerial competence (ZM*) that is equal to 0.558 in Quarter 1, to 0.512 in Quarter 16, to 0.464 in Quarter 32—a decrease of 0.094 units across the life cycle of a given administration. For an interquartile increase in this covariate (1.211), this represents a 0.114 unit marginal decline in ZM* during the life span of a presidential administration (5.48% of the interquartile range for ZM*).22 Presidents thus become increasingly risk‐averse with additional experience in office, in terms of requiring more of a particular agent trait in response to greater uncertainty about that trait. For this set of trimmed sample models, greater experience in office translates into presidents exhibiting twice the sensitivity to uncertainty about an appointee's loyalty compared to uncertainty surrounding his or her managerial skills.         "
"31","Agent Selection, Agent Monitoring, and Common Agency Learning Results for Relative Difference Between Loyalty and Managerial Competence"
"32","The statistical estimates for the Top Supervisory Position covariate in Table 1 reveal that individuals appointed to the highest positions within U.S. federal agencies exhibit significantly greater loyalty than managerial competence compared to those serving in important subordinate positions in the initial periods of a presidential administration. Consistent with the Agent Monitoring Learning Hypothesis (Hypothesis 2), the Top Supervisory Position × Presidential Tenure covariate possesses a negative coefficient that is statistically discernible from zero at conventional significance one‐tailed probability levels (p ≤ 0.10) across all model specifications. These differences involving the relative balance of these agent traits soften as presidential tenure increases. Appointees selected to serve in top supervisory positions for only major agencies (Figure 2C: Model 2: Trimmed Sample) in a president's first quarter in office exhibit, on average, 0.179 units of greater loyalty vis‐à‐vis managerial competence compared to their subordinates. At the end of the first term (Quarter 16), this difference is 0.026 before moving in the opposite direction until it reaches −0.144, though these differences are not significantly different from zero. In turn, this constitutes a 0.323 marginal decline in ZM* during the life span of a presidential administration (15.51% of the interquartile range for ZM*).23 This 9.36 percentile decreasing relative loyalty–managerial competence gap (ZM*) between supervisory agency leaders and their subordinates through time is roughly equivalent to a rank‐ordered negative difference of 134 appointee observations (e.g., from Olivia Golden, ZM* = 0.1804 [Assistant Secretary for Children and Families for Health and Human Services, Clinton appointee], to Edward Elmendorf, ZM* = −0.1415 [Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education, Reagan appointee]). Inclusion of the extreme agent trait imbalance cases (Model 1: Full Sample) yields a slightly higher 18.70% of the interquartile range for ZM*. This same pattern with similar conditional marginal effect point estimates also appears in Figure 2D when one considers a broader definition of top supervisory positions. As presidents become more seasoned at managing the bureaucracy, they rely less on a strategy of information counterbalancing designed to mitigate information asymmetries by appointing more loyal top supervisory bureaucratic agents monitoring their more expert subordinates directly below them.         "
"33","Although the Common Agency Learning Hypothesis (Hypothesis 3) is generally rejected in this set of statistical models, some rather modest empirical support is obtained for this proposition. The conditional marginal effects displayed in Figure 2E (based on Model 2: Trimmed Sample), for instance, reveal that a one‐unit increase in the absolute common score ideological distance between the president and Senate floor median yields a marginally stronger presidential preference for managerial competence (compared to loyalty) in appointees chosen during their first quarter in office (ZM* = −0.463). Yet, this relative preference weakens considerably by Quarter 16 (at the end of the first term; ZM* = −0.203) before reaching a rather modest balance favoring loyalty vis‐à‐vis managerial competence in Quarter 32 (at the end of a two‐term presidency, ZM* = 0.074—a 0.537 increase in the relative balance of loyalty to managerial competence [ZM*]). An interquartile increase in this covariate (0.192) yields a 0.103 marginal rise in ZM* during the life span of a presidential administration (3.65% of the interquartile range for ZM*). Yet, this pattern does not hold when assessing divided partisan control between the president and Senate (Figure 2F, based on Model 4: Trimmed Sample). In the presence of divided partisan control of the presidency and Senate, ZM* declines from 0.005 in the president's first quarter and winds up marginally declining to a value of −0.060 by the time the president departs after serving two full terms. The effect is both weak and incorrectly signed regarding the Common Agency Learning Hypothesis (Hypothesis 3). This finding reflects that the average level of each agent trait marginally rises in response to partisan institutional conflict through a president's tenure, with the managerial competence effect being slightly larger compared to that of loyalty.24"
"34","The results presented in Table 2 and Figure 3 assess how presidents choose to balance loyalty versus policy competence (ZP*) when making important agency appointments. Individual appointment differences make up between approximately 70 and 80% of these models’ explained variation, with agency‐level differences taking up most of the remaining portion. The Agent Selection Learning Hypothesis (Hypothesis 1) predicts that presidents become better at demanding a “risk premium” to offset each type of agent trait uncertainty by tipping the balance of loyalty and policy competence accordingly (Loyalty × Presidential Tenure > 0; Policy Competence × Presidential Tenure < 0). The numerical effects can be best seen in Figure 3 based on the conservative estimates reflected by Model 10: Trimmed Sample estimates. Specifically, Appointee Loyalty Uncertainty (Figure 3A) results in a conditional marginal effect on ZP* = −1.004 in Quarter 1, before rising to −0.848 in Quarter 16 and eventually reaching −0.682 in Quarter 32. This is a 0.318 relative increase in the balance of loyalty to policy competence (ZP*). For an interquartile increase in this covariate (1.170), ZP* exhibits a 0.372 marginal rise during the life span of a presidential administration (15.40% of the interquartile range for ZP*).25 Similarly, Appointee Policy Competence Uncertainty (Figure 3B) results in a conditional marginal effect on ZP* = −0.479 in Quarter 1, before declining to −0.598 in Quarter 16 and eventually reaching −0.724 in Quarter 32—a 0.245 relative marginal decline in ZP*. For an interquartile increase in this covariate (1.348), this represents a 0.330 marginal decline in ZP* during the life span of a presidential administration (13.67% of the interquartile range for ZP*).

"35","Agent Selection, Agent Monitoring, and Common Agency Learning Results for Relative Difference Between Loyalty and Policy Competence"
"36","Although the Agent Monitoring Learning Hypothesis (Hypothesis 2) is supported in either conceptualization of this covariate across models, the declining difference between agent types and their respective traits is steeper for the models utilizing only major agencies for the Top Supervisory Position covariate. The Top Supervisory Position × Presidential Tenure coefficients indicate a slower presidential learning process for adjusting to loyalty–managerial competence trade‐offs compared to loyalty–policy competence trade‐offs. Figure 3C (Model 10: Trimmed Sample) indicates that appointees selected in the administration's first quarter in office for top supervisory positions in major agencies exhibit, on average, 0.264 units of greater loyalty vis‐à‐vis policy competence compared to their subordinates. At the end of the first term, this difference is 0.107 before falling further until it reaches −0.062 at the end of the second term. This represents a 0.326 marginal decline in ZP* during the life span of an administration (13.50% of the interquartile range for ZP*).26 This marginal decline in the relative balance between agent loyalty and policy competence constitutes about a 7.14 percentile decline in ZP*. The declining loyalty–policy competence gap between supervisory agency leaders and their subordinates over time is roughly equivalent to a rank‐ordered negative difference of 102 appointee observations (e.g., from Elizabeth Bailey, ZP* = 0.2664 [Civil Aeronautics Board Member, Carter appointee], to Joseph Kelliher, ZP* = −0.0605 [Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner, G. W. Bush appointee]). Figure 3D (Model 14: Trimmed Sample) reveals a similar, albeit weaker pattern of conditional marginal effect point estimates for the less restrictive definition of top supervisory positions—representing a 0.256 marginal decline in ZP* during the life span of a presidential administration. These findings, in tandem with those discussed earlier, suggest that presidents adapt more swiftly to agent monitoring learning with respect to managerial competence than to policy competence.         "
"37","The Common Agency Learning Hypothesis (Hypothesis 3) obtains mixed support for predicting the balance of appointees’ loyalty to policy competence. In response to executive‐legislative conflict, presidents begin by emphasizing appointees’ policy competence relative to loyalty. The estimates for the common space absolute ideological distance measure exhibit the correct sign and possess meaningful numerical effects, but they are estimated with a considerable lack of precision. This covariate's conditional marginal effect on ZP* increases from −0.350 in Quarter 1 to 0.069 in Quarter 32 in Figure 3E (Model 10: Trimmed Sample). The estimates capturing differences between divided and unified partisan control of the presidency and Senate offer a similar picture. This covariate's conditional marginal effect on ZP* increases from −0.119 in Quarter 1 to 0.094 in Quarter 32 displayed in Figure 3F (Model 12: Trimmed Sample).27 The imprecision of both sets of statistical estimates testing the Common Agency Learning Hypothesis (Hypothesis 3) raises the possibility that presidents may find it easier to reduce policy expertise as a less costly way of agent control in the presence of divided political principals compared to increasing loyalty via the mechanism of appointments under these political circumstances. Analysis not reported here for each of these separate agent traits reveals that presidents facing a Senate controlled by the opposition party significantly lower the average level of policy competence by a larger amount for each successive quarter they serve in office while they marginally increase the average level of loyalty, all else equal.28 This evidence suggests that common agency learning reflects a “defensive” presidential appointment strategy to mitigate bureaucratic drift arising from a common agency problem with the Senate insofar as presidents rely more on reducing executive branch leadership expertise than augmenting loyalty.

"38","Presidents learn to become more effective at managing the White House and government agencies (Aberbach and Rockman 2000; Burke 2002; Hess 1988; Light 1999; Pfiffner 1988). Because presidents know little about governing at the start, such learning is to be expected (Pfiffner 1988). Presidents also need to learn out of necessity since both their popular and legislative support tend to decline through their tenure in office (Kernell 2007; Light 1999), and they accrue fewer benefits from the legislative process because of their waning power derived from executive veto authority (McCarty 1997). Together, these mechanisms coincide with presidents becoming more adept at managing the bureaucracy with greater experience in office.         "
"39","This study offers a dynamic perspective on appointments that reflects how presidents evolve in coping with both political and managerial constraints. Analogous to how bureaucrats obtain position‐specific expertise while governing on the job (Gailmard and Patty 2012), the theory advanced in this study asserts that presidents also learn on the job when it comes to managing the bureaucracy. The theory is motivated by theories of organizational learning (Levinthal and March 1993; March 1991; March, Sproull, and Tamusz 1991; Simon 1991), as well as dynamic principal‐agent theories predicting that principals acquiring greater experience can become more skilled at managing agents (Banks and Sundaram 1998; Murphy 1986). The statistical evidence analyzing upper‐echelon U.S. federal agency executives reveals ample support for the experiential learning theory. With greater experience in office, presidents become more effective at compensating for uncertainty regarding appointee characteristics (Agent Selection Learning), rely less on mechanism design strategies that mitigate information and policy biases through the “counterbalancing” of appointees within agency hierarchies (Agent Monitoring Learning), and often handle legislative policy conflict by deemphasizing appointee expertise more than by placing a greater premium on appointee loyalty as a rational response for insulating government agencies from legislative branch influence (Common Agency Learning).         "
"40","This study has advanced a unique perspective on the inherent trade‐off that presidents confront when selecting the type of individuals whom they wish to serve in administrative leadership positions. Specifically, greater experience in office translates into presidents becoming more skilled at mitigating these trade‐offs to achieve their administration's policy objectives. To be sure, presidents are inherently constrained when managing the administrative state due to internal limitations arising from their own information and expertise deficiencies as a political principal, as well as from external limits placed on them by the legislative branch through institutional power–sharing arrangements. On a more sanguine note for proponents of a robust executive, this study underscores that the effective exercise of executive authority by presidents reflects a maturation process for each administration occupying the White House."
