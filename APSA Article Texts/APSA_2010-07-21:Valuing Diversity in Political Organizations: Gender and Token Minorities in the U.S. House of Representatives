"1","The theory begins with the notion that the valuation of group members in collective bodies depends upon the relative size of the minority group. For instance, men may value women, but not to the extent that their own majority group status may be threatened. That is, when a minority group is small enough to achieve “token” status, individual members of the minority group tend to stand out among the majority group, thus receiving more attention (Kanter 1977). Because diverse groups tend to produce better outcomes (Page 2007), majority group members have an incentive to ensure that minority group members remain viable when they are endangered. At the same time, though, when a minority group is sufficiently small, its own members will often undermine each other's efforts since they perceive themselves as being in competition for the attention of majority group members (Laws 1975).         "
"2"," Kanter (1977) claims that the experiences of minority group members are far different once the size of the minority attains some threshold. Beyond this threshold, “minority members are potential allies, can form coalitions, and can affect the culture of the group” (Kanter 1977, 966). Once the minority group is sufficiently large, it threatens the benefits that the majority group enjoys (Crowley 2004; Heath, Schwindt‐Bayer, and Taylor‐Robinson 2005). The theoretical predictions derived from the model are robust to the threshold location, which Kanter (1977) places at 15% based on the workplace she considered, but others argue is much higher in legislatures (Beckwith and Cowell‐Meyers 2007; Wolbrecht 2000). The theory predicts that the extent to which minority group members are valued by their colleagues depends upon differences in marginal utility attributable to minority group size.         "
"3","The theory's first principles capture the relationship between colleague valuations and group membership.1 Like Kanter (1977), we consider only two groups: a majority/“in” group (Group A) and a minority/“out” group (Group B). What is of utmost importance for the theory is the marginal utility Group A members derive from Group B members. In this sense, the Group A member is asking: “Am I better off with or without an additional member of the other group?” When the marginal utility from an additional Group B member is positive, Group A members prefer increasing Group B's size. This implies that, ceteris paribus, majority group members value minority group colleagues more highly than they do members of their own group, provided that the minority group is sufficiently small. As this minority group grows, majority group members receive less utility from their minority colleagues. At some threshold, a specified utility maximum where marginal utility is zero, Group A members will be indifferent between additional Group B members and colleagues from their own group. Should the minority group's size continue to increase, the marginal utility of each minority group member becomes negative. That is, majority group members prefer not to increase the minority group's size because they prefer members of their own group to members of the majority—until the point at which the roles are reversed and Group B becomes the “dominant” majority group.            "
"4","The theory also has implications for relations between members from the same group. Group B members face negative utility from each additional member of their own group when the percentage of Group B members lies somewhere between zero and the cut‐point that differentiates between token and nontoken minority group status. This utility drop stems from the pressure additional minority group members create on the finite supply of benefits the majority group provides for the token minority group. That is, token minorities often see fellow group members as threats to their special status vis‐à‐vis the majority group (Laws 1975). Yet between the nontoken minority status and dominant majority status cut‐points, Group B members receive positive utility from their Group B colleagues since they exceed token status. At that point, they no longer feel threatened by each other and have attained a critical mass necessary for group effectiveness. Beyond its dominant majority status cut‐point, Group B's majority status is secure since Group A becomes the new “token” minority. At this point, Group B members value Group A members more than they do their own Group B colleagues.            "
"5","Combining both intergroup and intragroup colleague valuation behavior provides us with a complete description of the entire political organization. Assume that Group A is the majority, Group B the minority, within the same larger group. When Group B is small, members of Group A receive positive utility from members of Group B. In contrast, members of Group B actually receive negative utility for members of their own group. Yet the marginal utility for each group is changing as the size of Group B increases. Specifically, the marginal utility of each new Group B member decreases for the majority as Group B increases in size, since the majority wishes to maintain its dominant status. On the other hand, the marginal utility of each new Group B member increases for the minority as Group B increases in size. This leads to the following empirically testable hypothesis derived from the theory:            "
"6","                              "
"7"," H1: Majority group (fellow minority group) valuations of minority group members are negatively (positively) related to minority group size.                     "
"8","People value colleagues with diverse perspectives, but not necessarily diverse preferences. Different perspectives may provide creative solutions to shared problems, but different preferences may preclude even a shared understanding of what the problems are, thus making collaboration difficult (Page 2007).            "
"9","To that end, Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of the impact of preference divergence, a measure of this difference in perspectives of two individuals, on the marginal utility a Group A member would obtain from a Group B colleague. Group A members obtain successively lower marginal utility from Group B members as preference divergence between them increases, but this relationship becomes magnified when the degree of tokenism rises, as is the case when Group B is either very large or very small. When Group B is very small, part of the value of Group B members stems from the fact that they pose no threat to Group A's majority status. Yet this value quickly falls as preference divergence increases. When Group B is very small, according to the tokenism (Kanter 1977) logic, working with Group B members reinforces Group A's majority status, but this reinforcement comes only when it is accompanied by Group B's compliance. If a Group B member fails to be sufficiently compliant, the threat to the Group A member does not dissipate, and the utility of the Group A member thereby decreases. At the other extreme, when Group B becomes sufficiently large that it is the dominant majority, utility for a Group A member again falls quickly as preference divergence increases. This is because the now‐minority Group A members know that they will accrue tokenism benefits from now‐majority Group B members, but only if Group B members view them as compliant. If preference divergence precludes this compliance, Group A members do not receive these benefits, thus precipitating a sharp decline in utility as preference divergence increases.            "
"10","                 Preference Divergence and Between‐Group Colleague Valuations                         "
"11"," Figure 2 shows a graphical portrait of the effect of preference divergence on the marginal utility a member of Group B receives from a fellow Group B member. When Group B is very small, token Group B members do not value each other. This devaluation is exacerbated when preference divergence is high. Yet when Group B is very large, a Group B member receives very little benefit from a colleague's status as a Group B member. The only possible benefit is preference proximity. Absent that, utility falls dramatically. Therefore, as preference divergence grows between any pair of members, all members’ marginal utility valuation of colleagues, both in the majority and the minority group, will drop at a steeper rate as the degree of minority group tokenism increases, thus implying the following hypothesis:            "

"13","                              "
"14"," H2: Increases (decreases) in minority group size attenuate (exacerbate) the negative impact preference divergence exerts on individual‐level colleague valuation decisions for members of both the minority and the majority groups.                     "
"15","This is because larger minority groups can become a threat to the majority. Under these circumstances, members of both groups become increasingly concerned with the possibility that majority group status may change hands, thus decreasing their relative concern with preferences."
"16","To test our unified theory of colleague valuation, we analyze gender‐based colleague valuation decisions in the U.S. House of Representatives. Focusing on gender is an appropriate venue for our test because women compose roughly 50% of the population, yet remain minorities in virtually every legislature in the world.2 Indeed, women have held less than 15% of the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives over the past decade. Further, studies of the U.S. House of Representatives have shown that the ability of women to work together is central to successful policy enactment (Bratton 2002; Thomas 1991). Although the theory is generalizeable to other minority groups, those groups are often either simply too small or fail to provide sufficient variation to be analyzed statistically.3 Similarly, focusing on the U.S. House allows us to take advantage not only of variation in both the proportion of women across parties and across time, but also of measurable variation in preferences, even among legislators of the same political party.         "
"17","In the case of gender groups in the U.S House of Representatives, valuation of women House members by men and women colleagues is simply a function of the percentage of minority (women) members of the political party of the woman being valuated. We take the political party as the organizational unit of analysis, reflecting that most work in the U.S. Congress takes place within, rather than across, parties (e.g., Cox and McCubbins 1993; Poole and Rosenthal 1997). Moreover, the parties provide variation in their respective proportion of women members during the period under consideration, from a high of 20% for Democrats in the 107th Congress, to a low of 8% for Republicans in the 105th and 106th Congresses. Because clear partisan differences exist in the proportion of women House members, we should expect to observe clear differences in House members’ colleague valuation decisions.         "
"18","Further, member‐to‐member campaign contributions from U.S. House leadership PACs act as an empirical measure of colleague valuation decisions.4 The data are therefore constructed of donor‐recipient dyads in which each leadership PAC donor is paired with each potential recipient of the same political party.5 Although political parties pressure individual legislators to use leadership PAC contributions to advance the party's aggregate goals (Cann 2008; Heberlig and Larson 2005; Wilcox 1989), personal characteristics also matter (Kanthak 2007). Party‐level goals aimed at keeping or winning the majority center on funneling money to marginal districts. Yet these important partisan and electoral factors fail to explain all of the systematic variation in leadership PAC donation patterns. That is, the systematic portion of the remaining variance can provide us with meaningful information regarding individual latent colleague valuations.6"
"19","The analysis does not stand on the claim that these colleague valuation decisions, as reflected by leadership PAC contributions to their colleagues, are significant enough to affect electoral outcomes. Instead, we argue that making a contribution provides a consumption benefit to the donor that is analogous to why citizens vote even though they cannot affect electoral outcomes (Riker and Ordeshook 1968; Uhlaner 1989). In this sense, actors derive utility simply from expressing their preferences (Schuessler 2000). Campaign contribution decisions can thus reveal information about the level of esteem a legislator has for a particular colleague. Similarly, we can think of leadership PAC donations as being akin to gifts meant to augment social exchange relationships by demonstrating support for the existing moral order, and thus creating obligations on the part of recipients (Gouldner 1960; Shrum and Kilburn 1996).         "
"20","Furthermore, campaign contributions data have two major advantages over other measures of colleague valuation, such as the receipt of committee assignments (Heath, Schwindt‐Bayer, and Taylor‐Robinson 2005), party leadership positions, or both (Frish and Kelly 2003). First, campaign contributions are much less subject to availability constraints, unlike the assignment of a limited number of coveted positions in the legislature that is constrained by both a (weakening) seniority norm and committee property rights that are in effect (Katz and Sala 1996; Polsby 1968). Not one leadership PAC included in the data set ended an election cycle penniless. In this sense, although minority group members may perceive that they are in competition with each other for attention from the majority, we can be assured that contribution decisions are largely independent from each other. Second, because the theory is rooted in individual campaign contribution decisions as a means of gauging colleague valuation, using member‐to‐member donations avoids an ecological fallacy problem, which would arise if we were to test our individual‐level theory by considering whether a particular group receives more valuable positions than another group. The theory posits that preference divergence between legislators affects colleague valuation decisions, necessitating the consideration of dyadic valuations among individual legislators, rather than their aggregate valuations.         "
"21","About 20% of members of Congress (MCs) control leadership PACs in the period considered. Although the decision to create a leadership PAC is unlikely to be related to gender‐based colleague valuations, if the behavior of this subset of MCs differs from that of their colleagues without leadership PACs, the results may not be generalizable to the membership as a whole. Despite this, those legislators who do opt to create leadership PACs are signaling their desire to enter or remain in leadership positions. If there are systematic differences between legislators aspiring to the leadership and their colleagues who are not so ambitious, the analysis includes colleague valuation information about the more important of these two groups. Members who already have or seek leadership posts are exactly the legislators who are crucial in providing institutional support. That is, unlike their colleagues without leadership PACs who may remain permanently on the back bench, members with leadership PACs play a critical role in their colleagues’ professional development and career advancement."
"22","Thus, we can restate our hypotheses as follows:"
"23","                        "
"24"," H1: Men's (women's) frequency and size of leadership PAC contributions are negatively (positively) related to the proportion of women in the party.                  "
"25"," H2: Increases (decreases) in the proportion of women in the party attenuate (exacerbate) the negative impact preference divergence exerts on the frequency and size of leadership PAC contributions for both men and women potential donors.                  "
"26","Employing leadership PAC contributions for the U.S. House of Representatives for the 105th–108th Congresses, we empirically model legislators’ individual‐level colleague valuation decisions in two complementary ways. First, we analyze the impact of preference divergence between donor and recipient in each dyad on colleague valuation decisions, conditional on the proportion of members of the recipient's group (denoted by w) for donor‐recipient dyads in which the donor and recipient are of different genders (Between‐Group Models). Next, we analyze the impact of preference divergence between donor and recipient in each dyad on colleague valuation decisions, conditional on the proportion of members of the recipient's group (denoted by m) for same gender donor‐recipient group dyads (Within‐Group Models). This research design allows us explicitly to test the heterogeneous conditional effects of relative recipient group size on legislator valuation decisions.         "
"27","The analysis necessitates consideration of two key statistical modeling issues. First, membership valuation, the dependent variable, is operationally defined as leadership PAC contributions. We treat a zero contribution by donor i as a corner solution to their optimization problem via a natural logarithmic transformation of the dollar amount of leadership PAC contributions made by donor (“valuator”) i to recipient (“valuatee”) j either between or within group members for election cycle t, plus a scalar of positive unity—i.e.,  and , respectively. This transformed measure not only eliminates the possibility of zero contributions as representing unobserved negative contributions (Wooldridge 2002, 518–21), but is also consistent with an optimization problem subject to a nonnegativity constraint such that  by definition.7 Second, we account for both left‐censoring and sample selection problems that plague the statistical analysis of campaign contributions data through the use of a double hurdle model with independent errors between equations (Cragg 1971; Wooldridge 2002, 536–38). This statistical model is simply a generalized Tobit that relaxes the restrictive assumption of coefficient equality between the donation decision and positive donation amount equations.8 This model consists of a binary donation decision (DD) estimated as a Probit equation, and a donation amount (DA) for those members making a positive donation, which we estimate using a truncated normal regression equation.         "
"28","We estimate a pair of double hurdle models to test the theory's predictions concerning the joint consequences of preference divergence and gender composition for both between‐group (BG) and within‐group (WG) colleague valuation decisions.9 Each double hurdle model analyzes the probability of a positive donation decision being made between (or within) gender groups estimated via Probit, and the expected value of the natural log of positive donations being made between (or within) gender groups estimated by truncated normal regression. Colleague valuation decisions are represented as a combination of the group size variable—i.e., the percentage of recipient gender group members (denoted by w in between‐group models; m in within‐group models)—and preference divergence between the donor and recipient.10 The preference divergence measure is simply the squared normalized ideological distance11 between the donor and recipient's first‐dimension DW‐Nominate scores (Poole and Rosenthal 1997)—i.e.,  the interaction between these variables, a binary dummy variable accounting for women‐men donor differences (denoted by WD, where WD = 1 for women donors, WD = 0 for men donors) and its interaction with relative group size and preference divergence variables; a generic kth dimension X vector of ancillary control variables at election cycle t comprising donor‐specific effects, recipient‐specific effects, donor‐recipient dyadic specific effects, plus a disturbance term. Because the data include multiple observations per donor‐recipient dyad which are likely not independent across election cycles, robust standard errors clustered on dyad are reported.12"
"29","Also included are several variables that are likely to be related to the valuation of a colleague, but unrelated to the theoretical predictions.13 First, several variables indicate that legislators might, ceteris paribus, be more likely to donate to those colleagues who have personal characteristics other than gender which the potential donor might find valuable. For this reason, included are two binary variables, Same State, coded 1 if the donor and potential recipient represent the same state, 0 otherwise, and Same Region, coded 1 if the donor and potential recipient represent the same region,14 0 otherwise. Also included is a dichotomous variable, Same Committee, coded 1 if the donor and potential recipient work together on at least one congressional committee, 0 otherwise. Second, the logged total amount the leadership PAC gave, Total, is included. Leadership PACs vary greatly in size, from California Representative Douglas Ose's Sacramento Valley Leadership Fund, which gave $409 in 2004, to the two largest PACs in the data, helmed by current Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who gave $1,025,000, and former Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who gave $1,024,355, both in 2002. The expectation is, of course, that a larger leadership PAC will both be more likely to make a donation and to make larger donations than a smaller leadership PAC.            "
"30","Also incorporated is a series of ancillary variables that account for the fact that the central purpose of leadership PACs is to keep or secure the House majority for their parties. Indeed, there is evidence that parties take into account leadership PAC behavior when determining who receives choice leadership positions (Cann 2008; Kanthak 2007). In other words, donors are likely to make contributions to colleagues in danger of losing their seats, regardless of whether or not they value those colleagues based on their ideology and gender. To that end, four variables measure this danger. First is Election, indicating the percentage of the electoral vote the potential recipient received in the preceding election cycle. Second, In Play is a measure that CQ Weekly compiles of those districts most likely to have a close race. The variable is coded 1 if CQ Weekly lists it as being close, 0 otherwise. Incumbent Spending and Challenger Spending measures account for the total campaign spending by the two major political parties in the general election contest.            "
"31","Also included is a binary variable, Power Committee, coded 1 if the potential recipient has a position on one of the three committees traditionally considered the most powerful in the House: Appropriations, Rules, and Ways and Means (Groseclose and Stewart 1998). This is because legislators with such choice committee assignments are less likely to need leadership PAC donations to win elections, regardless of a donor's valuation. For similar reasons, Leader, coded 1 if the potential recipient has a party leadership position, 0 otherwise, is included.15 Years is a variable that reflects the logged number of years a potential recipient has served in the House. Again, legislators with longer tenures in the House face a lower probability of losing their reelection bids and are therefore less reliant on leadership PAC contributions, regardless of a donor's colleague valuation decision. This variable is log transformed because electoral safety is likely to increase nonlinearly as the number of years in the House increases. In other words, the difference in electoral safety between legislators who have won two elections as compared with those who have won three elections is likely to be great, whereas the difference between those who have won 10 elections and those who have won 11 elections is minimal.16 Also included is a binary variable, Retire, coded 1 for those candidates who are not, for whatever reason, seeking reelection to their House seat, 0 otherwise. Certainly, those legislators who are not seeking reelection do not need funds to help secure that reelection. Finally, a partisan donor dummy (coded 1 for Democratic donors, 0 for Republican donors) is designed to ensure that the effect of relative gender group size is not confounded by unobserved partisan differences. Specifically, the partisan donor dummy variable accounts for any potential independent majority party (Republican) bias that may exist.            "
"32","Last, two control variables account for other potential explanations of leadership PAC contribution behavior that are independent of the theory. The first is Size of Party, the total number of legislators in the party, which accounts for the notion that members of smaller parties may give more contributions in general, in an effort to protect or enlarge their size. The second measure, Change in the Number of Women, is simply the difference between the number of women in each party in the current Congress vis‐à‐vis the preceding Congress. Changes in gender composition may prompt legislators to protect the status quo composition by giving to members of their own group (predicting a positive value for the within‐group statistical models), but not to others (predicting a negative value for the between‐group statistical models).            "
"33","Results from the double hurdle regression analysis of U.S. House leadership PAC contribution decisions are presented in Table 1. In both the between‐group and within‐group gender composition models, the significant likelihood ratio test indicates that the double hurdle model is preferable to the Tobit model. Among the ancillary control variables,17 two statistically significant patterns clearly indicate that in explaining colleague valuations, individual considerations play a strong role alongside partisan and electoral concerns. First, personal relationships clearly affect both the probability of receiving a donation and the size of that donation, if one is made (see Kanthak 2007). More specifically, Same Committee is statistically significant in all four regressions and Same State is significant in all but one. Same Region is significant in two of the four regressions. Second, MCs serving in leadership positions are more likely to obtain leadership PAC donations from their colleagues, yet the contribution amount for those receiving donations is significantly less compared to their less‐powerful colleagues. This finding suggests that by virtue of their position, party leaders receive a financial tribute of sorts from their colleagues, but that the tribute itself need not be large.         "
"34","Statistical testing of the theoretical model reveals that the typical full preference divergence (PD) effect exerts a negative, significant impact on men donors’ likelihood of making a donation to both women colleagues (Between‐Group Model: Decision eq. −1.52 +−0.96 =−2.48; χ2 (1) = 7.26, p = 0.007) and men colleagues (Within‐Group Model: Decision eq. 0.001 +−0.93 =−0.929; χ2 (1) = 9.89, p = 0.002). Consistent with the theory, both results indicate that as gender group size and preference divergence increase, men donors value colleagues from both gender groups less, supporting H2. Interestingly, once a man donor decides to make a contribution to either a woman or a man colleague, there is no significant relationship between the average level of preference divergence and the typical amount of contributions. This suggests that men House members, on average, discriminate among colleagues based on gender and preference divergence when deciding whether or not to contribute to their colleagues, but not when determining the size of the contribution. The within‐group model statistical evidence for both the donation decision and amount equations provides additional credence to the theory by indicating that as the proportion of women in a given party increases, the sanction for preference divergence decreases. When the minority group becomes large enough, preference divergence decreases in importance as the threat to majority status increases. In short, these statistical results reveal that the hypothesized preference divergence effects among U.S. House members are, in fact, heavily contingent upon variation in the recipient's gender group size.         "
"35","A set of simulations based on these estimated double hurdle regression models better illuminates the substantive nature of the statistical estimates, depicting how well our data capture the theoretical relationships portrayed in Figures 1 and 2. Such simulations are especially necessary to perform because the model specifications required for testing the theory are rather complex. The analysis depicts an MC's donation decision as having two distinct stages. We calculate simulated effects from both the Probit regression equations predicting the probability of any donation being made, and the truncated normal regression equations predicting the dollar amount of a donation, conditional on a donation being made. All control variables are set at their mean values, thus allowing us to assess the varying impact of both preference divergence and gender group size on colleague valuation decisions for both men and women donors.         "
"36"," Figures 3 and 4 display the simulations of both the donation decision and dollar amount choices U.S. House members with leadership PACs made, based on the between‐group (Figure 3) and within‐group (Figure 4) models appearing in Table 1. Figure 3A displays how the likelihood of an MC making a contribution to a colleague is affected by variations in preference divergence, conditioned by group size. The lines on the left‐hand side of Figure 3A represent men donors’ decision regarding women colleagues, while the lines on the right‐hand side represent women donors’ decision with respect to men colleagues. Consistent with the theory, increasing preference divergence (PD) results in a lower likelihood of a positive donation decision for both men and women donors (supporting H2), and men donors devalue women colleagues less for preference divergence when the minority's group size (w) increases (supporting H1). As the PD variable goes from 0 (min value) to 1 (max value) for the average proportion of Republican women in the sample (wRepublican  Women = 0.082), the expected probability of a Republican man providing a leadership PAC donation to a woman colleague falls from 3.73% to 0.064%. While this drop may seem rather small in absolute terms, one must remember that the data, given their dyadic design, include only a small proportion of positive donation decisions. In fact, this translates to a substantively meaningful effect of reducing the expected number of leadership PAC donations from about 295 to approximately 5!18 Further, the effect is similar to that of a legislator moving ideologically from directly on a colleague's ideal point to a position equivalent to 25% of the furthest distance a legislator can be.

"41","Conversely, when we observe PD rising from 0 to 1 at the average proportion of Democratic women in the sample (wDemocratic  Women = 0.1752), the expected probability of a Democratic man providing a leadership PAC donation to a woman colleague falls from 3.05% to 0.064%—or a drop from 241 donations to about 5 donations. The average difference in expected likelihood of receiving a contribution between Democrats and Republicans, given their different proportions of women, is a maximum of about 54 donations when PD = 0 and a minimum of 0 when PD = 1. Women donors in Figure 3A also show that preference divergence results in a lower likelihood of providing campaign support to a colleague, supporting H2. Interestingly, though, the effects for women donors are the opposite of the theory's predictions for H1. That is, women donors sanction men donors more as the proportion of women decreases. Given the average partisan difference in the proportion of men colleagues (wRepublican  Men − wDemocratic  Men = 0.918 − .8248 = 0.0932), this means that Republican women are much more inclined to devalue men colleagues compared to their Democratic women counterparts. On average, Democratic women are anywhere from 14% (PD = 0.75) to 90% (PD = 0) more likely to provide men colleagues with leadership PAC donations compared to their Republican women counterparts for Republican men. The theory predicts that a large minority group sanctions the majority group at a growing rate as the minority is increasingly able to support each other and decreasingly reliant on assistance from the majority. The opposite is, in fact, true.         "
"42","The simulations for expected donation amount from those instances in which a position donation was made for the between‐group model appear in Figure 3B. Although preference divergence has a modest negative impact on men donors’ valuation decisions (supporting H2), the conditional group size effects are opposite of what the theory predicts in H1. Specifically, women group size exerts a weak positive effect on the expected contribution amount for these truncated observations from men donors. Yet, the substantive magnitude of these effects ranges between $0.00 (PD = 1) and $222.40 (PD = 0). At best, this is a very modest effect given that this represents only 11.12% of the typical (median) men donation amount to women colleagues observed in the sample ($222.40/$2000 = 0.1112).19 This inconsequential effect suggests that although men take into account both preference divergence and group size when making their initial decision to make a leadership PAC donation to a colleague, these factors hold little sway in their subsequent decision regarding the amount to donate. At the same time, women donors’ leadership PAC contribution behavior provides evidence for the theory's predictions for both preference divergence and group size effects on colleague valuation decisions. Increasing preference divergence results in a decline in the expected donation amount when one is made. Further, women MCs lend greater support to men colleagues as the ranks of women increase. One possible explanation for this finding is that women react to decreasing support from men not by joining ranks with each other as the theory would predict, but rather by trying to diffuse the threat they pose to men in an attempt to maintain the benefits they receive from men via their token minority status.20 At a given level of preference divergence, changes in the proportion of men colleagues from the mean Democratic proportion (wDemocratic  Men = 0.8248) to mean Republican proportion (wRepublican  Men = 0.918) increase the absolute donation amount by anywhere from $0.00 (PD = 1) to $344.00 (PD = 0) per recipient. In relative terms, this conditional group size effect on donation amount is rather modest given that the simulated maximum effect accounts for only 17.20% of the typical (median) women donation amount to men colleagues observed in the sample ($344/$2000 = 0.1720).21 In essence, variations in the gender composition of Congress yield a sizeable impact on between‐group colleague valuation decisions regarding the decision to make a leadership PAC donation. Once an MC decides to make such a donation, however, the donation amount is weakly conditioned by the degree of preference divergence between donor and recipient.         "
"43","The simulation results for the within‐group model provide even more compelling support for the theory's predictions relative to the between‐group model evidence. Figure 4A displays how the likelihood of an MC making a contribution to a colleague is affected by variations in preference divergence, conditioned by gender group size, for the within‐group model. The lines on the left‐hand side of Figure 4A represent women donors’ decision with respect to fellow women colleagues, whereas the lines on the right‐hand side represent men donors’ decision with respect to fellow men colleagues. The simulation evidence supports the theory: for a given level of preference divergence, women House members are more likely to support a fellow woman colleague via a leadership PAC donation as the proportion of women rises, so long as PD < 1. As preference divergence increases for the average proportion of Republican women members (mRepublican  Women = 0.082) from PD = 0 → PD = 1, we observe an expected probability of a donation being made declining from 3.69% to 1.16%. This constitutes an expected decline of 30 donations being made—which is about a 31% drop in relation to the baseline (null) total number of observed women leadership PAC donations in relation to women colleagues (98 donations). Similarly, as preference divergence increases for the average proportion of Democratic women members (mDemocratic  Women = 0.1752) from PD = 0 → PD = 1, the expected probability of a leadership PAC donation being made declines from 3.96% to 1.37%. This yields an expected decline of about 31 positive donations—which is slightly more than a 31% fall from the baseline (null) total number of observed donations for women to women colleagues (98 donations).         "
"44","Compared to the women donor within‐group effects, Democratic men donors devalue fellow partisan men colleagues more heavily for both preference divergence and as their own gender group size increases. As preference divergence increases for the average proportion of Democratic men members (mDemocratic  Men = 0.8248) from PD = 0 → PD = 1, we observe an expected probability decline of a positive donation being made from 5.81% to 0.11%. This constitutes an expected decline from 3,323 to 63 donations being made—which is just over a 65% drop from the null baseline total number of observed positive donation decisions for men to men colleagues (4,984 donations). Republican men donors sanction partisan men colleagues roughly similarly to both Republican and Democratic women donors. As preference divergence increases for the average proportion of Republican men members (mRepublican  Men = 0.918) from PD = 0 → PD = 1, we observe an expected probability of a leadership PAC donation being made declining from 4.09% to 0.03%. This constitutes an expected decline from 2,340 to 17 donations, or approximately a 47% reduction in relation to the baseline (null) total number of observed positive donation decisions for men to men colleagues (4,984 donations). These findings clearly reveal that the gender composition of Congress conditionally affects the extent to which partisan colleagues are willing to support one another.         "
"45"," Figure 4B provides the simulation results for the amount donated, conditional on a positive donation decision, for the within‐group model. Both women and men donor funding levels are consistent with the theory's predictions. When PD = 0, the typical Republican woman donor contributes $2,234, while her Democratic counterpart donates $3,595. Substantively, this $1,361 partisan difference, attributable to the proportion of women, is meaningful. It constitutes 68.05% of the typical (median) woman donation amount to a fellow woman colleague ($1,361/$2,000 = 0.6805).22 This partisan difference in leadership PAC contribution amounts declines as PD → 1. The impact of preference divergence on women donor valuation decisions is sharp for both Democratic and Republican women. As PD = 0 → PD = 1, the estimated Republican and Democratic women donors’ contribution amount falls by nearly $1,679 and $2,156, respectively. Men donor contribution amount effects are more sensitive to these gender group size effects than women donor amounts. When PD = 0, the typical Democratic man donor contributes $4,227, whereas his Republican counterpart donates an average of $1,461. This partisan difference, based on the proportion of men, is meaningful since it accounts for 138.3% of the typical (median) men donation amount to fellow men colleagues ($2,766/$2,000 = 1.383).23 Once again, the average partisan difference in leadership PAC contribution amounts declines as PD → 1. The impact of preference divergence on men donor valuation decisions is milder compared to women donors. As PD = 0 → PD = 1, the estimated Democratic and Republican men donors’ contribution amount falls by nearly $1,547 and $1,141, respectively. Given that the typical man donor leadership PACs’ median donation amount is $3,257, this effect highlights the stylized fact that men House members devalue same‐gendered colleagues less for preference divergence than they do women House members. On average, Democratic women donors sanction fellow women colleagues by roughly 18% more than their Democratic men counterparts do ([$2,156–$1,547]/$3,312 = 0.1839). At the same time, Republican women donors sanction fellow women colleagues by about 16% more than their Republican men donor counterparts do ([$1,679 −$1,141]/$3,333 = 0.1614). Recall that the theory predicts no gender differences in ideologically based preference sanctions. Sanctions for both men and women should increase similarly as the size of the minority decreases. Our data, however, indicate that women are less forgiving of ideological differences among fellow women than they are of similar transgressions from men colleagues. Furthermore, there is no indication that the effect will dissipate as the minority group grows.         "
"46","Descriptive representation is an essential aspect of democratic theory. Sufficient descriptive representation reflects an accurate portrayal of the plurality of interests within a given polity. Hence, descriptive representation leads to an increased public perception that institutions are legitimate (Mansbridge 1999; Mill 1861, chap. 3; Phillips 1991; Pitkin 1967). The legitimizing function of descriptive representation, however, necessitates the equitable treatment of underrepresented groups once they enter the political institution. Clearly, if underrepresented groups face serious discrimination in the institutions that they seek to legitimize and thus cannot fully contribute to lawmaking, institutional legitimacy is merely a chimera.         "
"47","Past research on representative institutions has been rooted in Kanter's (1977) tokenism logic that is based on two groups—a majority group and a minority group (Heath, Schwindt‐Bayer, and Taylor‐Robinson 2005; Kathlene 1994). Yet, these studies do not fully explore the logical consequences of tokenism theory for understanding colleague valuation in representative institutions. Kanter's logic, for instance, examines only the consequences of minority group size, without considering how preferences or values organizational members hold may color how they esteem one another as colleagues. Our aim has been to extend Kanter's logic of tokenism applied to the theoretical study of political organizations by examining how minority groups receive different sanctions based on preference divergence among same‐group (party) members. The major testable implication derived from the theory is that increases (decreases) in minority group size attenuate (exacerbate) the negative impact preference divergence exerts on individual‐level colleague valuation decisions.         "
"48","The statistical evidence analyzing member‐to‐member leadership PAC contributions in the U.S. House of Representatives for the 105th–108th Congresses yields strong support for the theory in several ways. Specifically, the analysis finds that when men with leadership PACs valuate their colleagues, both men and women, the gender composition of the group plays a central role in those valuations. Men give more to men, less to women, as the proportion of women increases. For women with leadership PACs, however, the results are less clear. Women valuate each other significantly differently from how men valuate each other, but the effect of gender composition is much more muted with respect to women colleague valuation decisions. In other words, although women value other women more highly as the proportion of women in the party increases, they do not increase these intragroup valuations enough to offset the decrease in intergroup valuations from their majority‐men colleagues. Further, contrary to the theory, women actually increase their valuations of men as the proportion of women increases, possibly as a means to diffuse the threat that they pose to the majority group within the political organization.         "
"49","Surely, we will know more when we can analyze a legislature in which women have transitioned to majority status. Yet the evidence reveals that this transition may not be as smooth as aggregate‐level studies suggest (e.g., Grey 2006; Yoder 1991). This is because women U.S. House members, as their numbers increase, do not exchange support from men colleagues with support from each other. If we consider leadership PAC campaign contributions as being akin to gifts meant to obligate colleagues to provide future help (e.g., Gouldner 1960; Shrum and Kilburn 1996), the results may indicate that women do not properly assess the abilities of their women colleagues to provide valuable future assistance. Instead, their valuations tend to mirror those of the men in their group. These findings may suggest that valuations of minority and majority groups are not, in fact, symmetric. Further, if these patterns persist as the proportion of women increases beyond those we observe in these data, then it is possible that gender quotas, which many proportional representation systems have implemented in recent years, may not serve as a panacea. Regardless of group size, in fact, coordination problems may make attaining an effective critical mass of women an elusive goal (Kanthak and Krause 2010). Moreover, the theory extends to those representative institutions that rely on publicly financed elections, but empirical analysis of these types of elected assemblies would necessitate the use of less finely grained data on party leadership and committee assignments that exhibit strong resource constraints.         "
"50","These results have strong implications for minority representation in general, because they indicate that underrepresented minorities in democratic institutions receive benefits from their token minority status, but those benefits ebb once the group reaches a size large enough to provide benefits for each other. Even then, there are no guarantees that the group can provide benefits. Most starkly, increasing the size of an underrepresented group may actually dramatically diminish the level of institutional support members of that group receive. Put simply, both majority and minority groups appear to reinforce one another in the construction of an implicit “glass ceiling” that serves to constrain entrenched minority group members’ ability to work together to fulfill the promise of increased minority representation.
