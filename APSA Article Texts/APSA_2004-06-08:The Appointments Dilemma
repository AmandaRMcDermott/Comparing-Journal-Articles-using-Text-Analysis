"1","Following much of the formal theoretic literature on bureaucratic control, I model the interactions of three players: Legislature, Executive, and Agency.3 Each of these actors is assumed to have preferences over policy outcomes on a single dimension. For simplicity, I assume that these preferences can be represented with a quadratic utility function. Therefore, the policy preferences can be represented by  for any x∈X⊆R1 and i∈{L, E, A}. I will assume throughout with no loss of generality that L= 0 and E > L.         "
"2","Following in the tradition of recent models of delegation (Bendor and Meirowitz Forthcoming; Epstein and O'Halloran 1994, 1999; Gailmard 2002a,b; Gilligan and Krehbiel 1987; Huber and McCarty Forthcoming; Huber and Shipan 2002; Volden 2002), the model assumes that decision making is delegated to the agent because of its superior information about the consequences of policy choices. Therefore, I assume that the outcome x=p+ω where p∈P⊆R is the policy chosen by the agency and ω is a random variable observable by the agency, but not by the executive or the legislature. Given that x=p+ω, each player's utility over policies is given by . The unobserved policy shock ω is distributed uniformly on the interval [−Ω, Ω].         "
"3","Many contemporary models of delegation assume that principals place statutory bounds on agency discretion.4 That is, the political principal specifies in advance which policies the bureaucrat may adopt, and the bureaucrat chooses policy to maximize its utility subject to choosing policies satisfying the statutory constraints. Rather than following this route, I take a somewhat different approach. Instead I assume that an agency requires budgetary resources to move policy outcomes away from those policies that would prevail absent the agency's intervention. Given this assumption, the set of policies that the agency can implement will be a function of the resources appropriated. Therefore, my model is very similar to models of bounded discretion. Indeed my budgeting model provides an additional microfoundation for those models. As I discuss below, the implications of my model for the appointments dilemma carry over to bounded discretion models.         "
"4","To formalize the budgetary control model, let p0 be the status quo policy that prevails if the agency takes no action. I assume that the agency must incur costs to move policy away from the status quo p0. This captures the idea that resources are required to implement programs that change policies and outcomes. The role of the legislature is to allocate a budget B to give the agency resources to implement its programs. Therefore, the budget sets a resource constraint on how much the agency can move policy, but the legislature and executive cannot punish the agency for moving policy less than the budget allows. Indeed, in equilibrium, they would rarely want to since they would generally prefer the agent to optimize on its private information rather than move policy more than necessary.5"
"5","I assume that the cost to the legislature and the executive of enacting budget B is simply B, but that the agency only incurs the costs associated with moving policy from the status quo to the agency's chosen level. I assume that the marginal cost of moving policy is normalized to $1 so that the cost to the agency of moving policy from p0 to p is given by |p−p0|. Obviously, this implies that the cost of moving policy to the left is the same as moving it to the right. Of course, in reality, most agencies move policy only in one direction (i.e., the Environmental Protection Agency does not increase pollution beyond that produced by laissez‐faire economic activity).6 Nevertheless, it would be a trivial extension to allow the agency to move the policy in only one direction or to make the costs of policy movement asymmetric. Neither of these extensions adds additional insight to the issues at hand. Note that the agency need not spend its entire allocated budget. For simplicity, I assume that the agency retains these unspent resources rather returning them to the treasury.         "
"6","Finally, once a budget is allocated, I assume that the legislature and executive cannot further influence the agency's policy choices through expost mechanisms and sanctions. While this is a very strong assumption, its import is not as great as it would seem. As I discuss below, an appointments dilemma can occur so long as the expected policy outcome is a function of the agency's ideal point. Thus, unless the ex post mechanisms completely eliminate bureaucratic discretion (i.e., by forcing the agent to implement a specific policy), an appointments dilemma will remain.7"
"7","As I will demonstrate, a key issue in determining whether or not the separation of powers generates inefficient policies is the extent to which the executive can commit to not changing the agency's ideal point after the budget has been allocated but before policy has been set by the agency. If the executive cannot make such a commitment, the legislature will have to take account of potential executive opportunism by further restricting the agency's discretion by lowering its budget proposal. Alternatively, if the executive could commit to a moderate agency, the legislature would pass a more generous budget which might make the executive better off and ameliorate the appointments dilemma."
"8","Obviously, a key factor which determines the executive's ability to commit to a particular agency ideal point are the constitutional and legal provisions concerning the executive's ability to remove agency officials. If the executive lacks removal power (such as the case of independent commissioners in the United States), he will be unable to manipulate the agency's ideal point after budgetary decisions are made. However, if the agency head serves at the executive's will, ex post manipulation will be easier.         "
"9","To model the different strategic situations that may arise from differences in the executive's ability to commit, I will examine two distinct extensive forms of the game. In the first, I assume that the executive cannot commit not to use his removal power to change the agencies ideal point. To model this scenario, I assume that the appointment of the agency is made after the budget is set. This assumption is not only consistent with the executive simply waiting for the budget to be established before making an appointment, but also with his making an opportunistic personnel change after the legislature has acted.8 The timeline for this model is given in Figure 1. After Nature draws ω, the legislature proposes a budgetary level B. The executive then chooses whether to accept B or to veto in which case a reversionary budget Bq.9 After a budget is enacted, the executive proposes an ideal point of the agency, A. The legislature then either confirms this choice or allows the agency to remain at a reversion ideal point of Aq.10 In the last stage, the agency chooses policy conditional on B and the realization of ω.         "
"10","                 Time Lines for Appointment Games                      "
"11","In the second model (Figure 1b), executive commitment is modeled by allowing the executive to propose the agency's ideal point prior to the bargaining over the budget. He is also not allowed to replace the agent after the budget is enacted. This assumption is intended to capture restrictions on executive removal power.         "
"12","Although both of these budget/appointment games have asymmetric information, the fact that the informed player moves last in each allows the unique equilibrium to be computed via backward induction where each player chooses optimal actions given previous actions and expectations about future actions. This equilibrium can be supported as a sequential equilibrium."
"13","Thus, I begin the analysis by examining the agency's policy choice given previous choices of B and A. Given these choices and my assumptions about costs of moving policy, the agency will choose a policy p to maximize            "
"14","Lemma 1.   The agency's optimal policy choice is given by                              "
"15","Both because it is a more realistic description of the strategic situation for many executive appointments and because it provides a benchmark to compare outcomes with those possible when the executive can commit, I begin with the “no commitment” model."
"16","Given the optimal actions of the agency, I begin with the preferences over agency ideal points in the game where the executive appoints an agency following the enactment of the budget, the “no commitment” model. These preferences are quite straightforward. Since the budget is fixed at the time of appointment, both the executive and the legislature must prefer an agency with their own ideal points so that it would make the same decision that the respective principal would for every state of the world. Preferences over agencies are also symmetric around each principal's ideal point. These results are proven in the appendix and summarized in Lemma 2."
"17","Lemma 2.   Holding B constant, the executive's preferred agency has ideal point E and the legislature's ideal agency is L. Both E and L have symmetric preferences around their ideal points.                "
"18","Given these results about preferences, it is quite simple to compute the equilibrium outcomes of the appointments stage. Since preferences are symmetric around each player's ideal point and the executive makes a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it offer, I can directly apply results from Romer and Rosenthal (1978) to bargaining over confirmation. Since the executive anticipates that the legislature will deny confirmation to any agent with an ideal point further from L= 0 than Aq, he will propose an agent with an ideal point no greater than |Aq| and the legislature will accept such a choice. If E < |Aq|, the executive will simply appoint someone with his ideal point and the legislature will accept. This logic is summarized in Lemma 3.               "
"19","Lemma 3.   The equilibrium agency appointment,                                       Anc                     , isE if E∈[−|Aq|, |Aq|]and|Aq|otherwise."
"20","Note that in the model without commitment, the equilibrium agency ideal point is independent of the size of the budget. This independence is the crux of the appointments dilemma since efficient bargaining requires making trade‐offs between appointments and budgets. As I will demonstrate, one way to eliminate this independence is to restrict executive removal powers."
"21","While Anc is independent of the equilibrium budget, as I demonstrate below, the preferred budget levels depend critically on the expected location of the agency.               "
"22","Given the optimal policy choices by the agency and the executive's appointment of agency, the legislature will propose the budget that maximizes its utility subject to not being vetoed by the executive. Two distinct considerations affect the legislature's preferred budgetary level. First, the legislature would like to provide the agency with enough resources that it can respond to the extreme values of ω. Thus, the legislature would like to give more money when the status quo outcome p0+ω is likely to be far from its ideal point. However, providing more resources may also allow the agency the flexibility to choose policies other than those favored by the legislature. Thus, when A is far from L, larger budgets become more costly. The executive faces similar tradeoffs in his preferences over budgets.11 These results are summarized in Lemma 3 along with a parallel statement about the executive's preferences over budgets.         "
"23","Lemma 4.   The optimal legislative budget is               . The executive's most preferred budget is. Fori∈{L, E}, i) Bi(A, p0)is decreasing in the distance from A to i. The budget is maximized when A = i. ii)Bi(A, p0)is a concave function of A, symmetric around i. iii)Bi(A, p0)is increasing in the distance fromp0toi.            "
"24","Results (i) and (iii) are directly related to the tradeoffs described above. Condition (ii) is a technical condition that will prove very useful in contrasting the “no commitment” results with those of the “commitment” model."
"25","Given these preferences, I turn to the bargaining over the budget given the player's equilibrium expectations about outcome of the bargaining over appointments, Anc. Given these expectations about the agency's ideal point, the executive will not accept any budget that generates less utility than {Anc, Bq}. Given the results of Lemma 4, there exists a set of budgets that E prefers to {Anc, Bq} which I denote . Lemma 5, which I relegate to the appendix, states some useful properties of this preferred set which need not detain us here.            "
"26","Given the executive's preferred set, consider the legislature's proposal. If , the legislature will choose its ideal budget BL(Anc) and the executive will accept it. If , the outcome will be  whereas the outcome is  if BL(Anc) <.            "
"27","These outcomes are summarized in Lemma 6 below."
"28","Lemma 6.   If               , Bnc=BL(Anc). If, whereas if.            "
"29","Given the results of the previous lemmas outlining the optimal actions by the agency and the bargaining it induces over A and B, computing the outcome to this game is straightforward. These results are collected in Proposition 1 for convenience.            "
"30","Proposition 1.   The outcome to the appointment‐budget game with commitment is:                              "
"31","One of the key implications of the lack of commitment is that the executive takes the budget as fixed when nominating A. In this section, I relax this assumption to show that the executive (and the legislature) can do better if the executive can commit to an agency ideal point ex ante. This ability to commit allows the executive's nomination of the agency to have an effect on the budget. In nominating A, the executive must trade off his desire to have a loyal agent with the possibility of generating higher budgets by making appointments more favorable to the legislature. These tradeoffs are demonstrated graphically in Figure 2.         "
"32","                 The Appointments Dilemma                      "
"33","To keep things simple for exposition, Figure 2 assumes that the outcome Aq and Bq are sufficiently bad for both players that the confirmation and veto constraints do not bind. The heavy line in the figure represents BL(A), the legislature's optimal budget given A.12 The indifference contours are those of the executive, and they illustrate the tradeoffs that the executive is willing to make between A and B. From lemma 2, we know that the executive's ideal point in {A, B} space must lie on the vertical line through E.13 Note that since his ideal point lies above the BL(A) curve, he prefers a larger budget at A=E than is provided by the legislature.         "
"34","Thus, the equilibrium to the no‐commitment game is easy to visualize. Since the executive takes the budget as fixed, his utility is always increasing as the appointee gets closer to his ideal point. Thus, he chooses Anc=E, and in anticipation the legislature chooses BL(E).14"
"35","Note however that there are other points on BL(A) that generate higher utility for the executive and the legislature than {E, BL(E)}. In particular, {Ac, Bc} represents the point on BL(A) that reaches the highest executive indifference curve. Thus, a more moderate agency appointment can raise the executive's utility by inducing the legislature to increase budgetary support.         "
"36","However, as alluded to above, implementing this “ efficient outcome” requires that the executive commit to not altering the agency's ideal point through appointments or removals after the legislature commits resources Bc. If the legislature does not expect the executive to leave the agency at Ac, the game unravels to the inefficient outcome.         "
"37","However, the “no‐commitment equilibrium” is not always inefficient. Consider Figure 3. In this figure, the executive wants a smaller budget at A=E than does the legislature. Now the executive can only raise his utility by committing to an agency which is more extreme than E (relative to L) in order to induce lower budgets. However, this commitment does not Pareto dominate {E, BL(E)} because it lowers the utility of the legislature.         "
"38","                 No Appointments Dilemma                      "
"39","The remaining question is to determine which features of the policy process determine whether the situation depicted in Figure 2 or that of Figure 3 holds. As I suggested above, one crucial difference is whether or not the executive prefers a larger budget than the legislature when the agency has an ideal point of E. The parameter of the model that most affects the relative priority over budgetary levels is the status quo. If the expected status quo policy is much more favorable to the executive, he will prefer a lower budget than the legislature even if the agency is located at the executive's ideal point. Proposition 2 demonstrates that as long as p0 < E, the “commitment” equilibrium is either more efficient than the noncommitment result, or the two outcomes are the same.         "
"40","Proposition 2.   Let               {Ac, Bc}               and               {Anc, Bnc}               be the commitment and noncommitment outcomes, respectively.             "

"45","Proof:  See Appendix.            "
"46","When the status quo is less favorable to E, the executive and the legislature may face a collective dilemma. Each may prefer that the executive's latitude to adjust the agency's ideal point ex post be restricted. This desire to prevent opportunistic behavior by the executive becomes an important part of the design of the agency's structure.            "
"47","In addition to the prediction that an appointments dilemma exists when the executive is a high demander, Proposition 2 suggests that the strategic setting of confirmation and veto bargaining effect the efficiency of outcomes under the separation of powers. In the next two sections, I explore these implications."
"48","An important feature of Proposition 2 is that depending on the location of Aq, the appointments dilemma may be ameliorated. Consider the case where p0 < E so that the outcome would be inefficient without the constraints associated with confirmation (i.e., if E < |Aq|). The proposition suggests that policymaking will be efficient if |Aq| is less than a cutpoint . If we interpret Aq as the preferences of career personnel absent an executive appointee, the model suggests that one way to engineer a better outcome is to design the agency so that the preferences of the careerists are more aligned with those of legislature.         "
"49","The effect of the executive veto on the efficiency of policymaking is quite different. From Proposition 2, part 3, we learn that if the veto constraint binds the outcomes of the commitment and no‐commitment model are identical. Thus, there will be no appointments dilemma. However, in this case, the appointments dilemma is solved in a way that is favorable only to the executive. Since his veto threat is credible, he need not make any concessions during the nomination stage to elicit higher budgets. Thus, while the confirmation process can be efficiency enhancing, the effect of the veto is purely distributive: it makes the legislature worse off. It occasionally solves the executive's problem of insufficient budgets, but does not change the executive's incentive to move the agency in his direction."
"50","Another consequence of veto power is that it helps prevent the legislature from responding to politicization of the agency by the executive. Suppose the noncommitment game were extended so that the legislature could readjust the budget after the executive's choice of agency (at some cost). Without the veto, giving the legislature this additional move, allows a more efficient outcome to be obtained as the executive resists moving the agency to his ideal point out of fear of the legislative adjustment. However, consider what may happen in the case of the veto. If the legislature passes a generous budget initially, the executive can then politicize the agency and block the legislative response with the veto.15 In anticipation, the legislature will only pass the budget that is optimal for a politicized agency, BL(E). Thus, the inefficient outcome reemerges.         "
"51","In summary, I find that increasing legislative supervision of the agency through the confirmation process may be beneficial to both the legislature and the executive as it diminishes the possibility of an appointments dilemma. However, an expansion of the executive's legislative powers eliminates the dilemma but solely at the expense of the legislature when status quo budget is high. Finally, if vetoes can be used to block legislative adjustments, the dilemma is exacerbated and the executive can be made worse off as well."
"52","While the model makes a number of very specific assumptions about the nature of administrative policymaking in the separation of powers, the general conclusions are potentially robust to a number of different models and extensions. This is because the mechanisms that underlie the appointments dilemma are primarily based only the following features of the model:"
"53","                        "
"54","Legislatures exercise some ex ante control of agency actions;                  "
"55","If he is able to commit to doing so, the executive may trade more moderate appointments for more lax ex ante restrictions;                  "
"56","Any ex post control mechanisms of the legislature or executive are insufficient to completely eliminate the effect of agency preferences in policymaking.                  "
"57","A number of other models of bureaucratic control are likely to have these features. As just one example, consider first the model of bounded discretion pioneered by Epstein and O'Halloran (1994).16 In their model, the legislature exerts ex ante control by specifying the set of policy actions that it is legal for the agency to undertake. In equilibrium, they show that the legislature gives less discretion when the agent has divergent preferences. Thus, the first condition for a potential appointments dilemma is met. The third condition is also met because even when the legislature can exercise an ex post veto on agency actions, the expected policy is still a function of the agency's ideal point. Condition 2 is the only one not verified directly by Epstein and O'Halloran as their model does not include an appointment stage. However, it is easily shown that the utility of any player with an ideal point greater than the agency's is increasing in the level of delegation. Thus, an executive with these preferences would be willing to trade a more moderate agent for more delegation.17"
"58","Another strong assumption of the model is that the bargaining over budgets and appointments is static. An alternative would be a dynamic model where the legislature and executive alternate in proposing budgets and appointees, respectively. Following adoption of a budget and the confirmation of an appointee, the agency carries out the policy in accordance with the original model. However, in the “no commitment” case, the executive could remove the appointee after the budget was adopted and propose a new one before the agency acts. Without any restrictions on strategies, the folk theorem suggests that such a model could support a very large number of equilibria. However, with the assumption that players are restricted to stationary strategies, I conjecture that the results would be quite similar to the static models.18 In the “no commitment” model, the executive would always (weakly) have an incentive to terminate the appointee after the budget is set to try to get a more favorable agency. Once the removal takes place the bargaining over the new appointee is a dynamic bargaining game with a single proposer. As Primo (2002) shows, the unique outcome of this game will be the Romer‐Rosenthal outcome of Anc. Thus, the bargaining over the budget will anticipate this outcome. Thus, the budgeting process becomes a dynamic bargaining game with a single proposer. Applying Primo's result once again, this generates a budget of Bnc.19 Thus, the results of the dynamic model under the assumption of stationarity are identical to those of the static model.         "
"59","Under commitment, the executive cannot remove any confirmed nominee. The outcomes of the dynamic model with commitment are a bit harder to characterize, but I conjecture a qualitative similarity to the static results. With commitment, the legislature has an incentive to delay a successful budget proposal until the nomination is confirmed, while the executive has an incentive to get a nominee in place in order to increase his influence over the budget. Thus, the timing incentives are consistent with the extensive form of the original model. Furthermore, it seems reasonable to think that budgeting and appointments will be linked as they are in the static version of the commitment model."
"60","The take‐home point of my original model is that when the executive cannot commit to not removing the agent an inefficient separation of confirmation and budget bargaining occurs. One way of preventing this separation is by restricting executive removal power. Both of these conclusions seem sustainable in a more dynamic model of bargaining."
"61","Given that the agency control game based literally the constitutional allocation of powers generates Pareto inferior outcomes, legislators and executives have a common incentive in searching for extraconstitutional procedures and institutions to manage the problems associated with this allocation of power."
"62","The model suggests a number of institutions that might help alleviate the problems. Each of these entails some restriction of executive powers of appointment or removal."
"63","For the most part, the U.S. president's prerogative to appoint executive officials (or to have them appointed by agency heads which the president has chosen) has remained intact. In particular, the courts have often rejected arrangements where Congress appoints individuals to executive positions. For example, in Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court struck down provisions for legislative appointment of Federal Election Commissioners.20 In their decision on the Gramm‐Rudman‐Hollings Act, the Supreme Court struck down executive powers delegated to the Comptroller General on the grounds that Congress makes the appointment for that position.            "
"64","However, judicial prohibitions of a direct role for Congress have not precluded the establishment of procedures and norms that enhance its role in the appointment process. Perhaps the earliest expansion of congressional influence in this area was the formation of the norm of “senatorial courtesy.” Established when President Washington acquiesced to the Senators from Georgia on the appointment of customs officials, it has evolved into a system where the senior Senator from the president's party practically nominates all of the federal officials in her state (see Fowler 1945 and Harris 1953). While this norm primarily serves to protect patronage for Senators and allow them to influence local implementation of federal programs, it does serve to constrain presidential attempts to politicize certain types of agencies.            "
"65","Another restriction of presidential proposal power occurs when Congress statutorily sets qualifications for the nominee. Many times these qualifications are technical (the head of the Weather Service should be an atmospheric scientist) or banal (“a person of high moral standing”; “a friend to the farmers”). However, in many cases, there may be restrictions with policy content. The most important of these are the party balance requirements on many regulatory commissions. While presidents can partially circumvent them by appointing like‐minded opposition party members and independents, these requirements undoubtedly make it more difficult for the president to impose his ideal point on an agency."
"66","By far the most common constraints placed on (and accepted by) presidents are restrictions on the power of removal. These restrictions are extremely important in the context of the model because they increase the ability of presidents to commit not to politicize the agency either through replacements or threats of removal. The text of the Constitution is silent on the removal power. The ambiguity of the constitutional provisions erupted into a contentious debate during deliberations on the creation of the Treasury Department in 1789. The debate was between those who viewed removal as a purely executive function and therefore the president's sole prerogative and those who felt that the Senate's “advice and consent” role entitled it to play a role in removals. In the end, those who favored an unrestricted role for the president were victorious (see Fisher 1985 and Harris 1953). On occasion, Congress has attempted to put broad restrictions on removal power, most notably the Tenure of Office Act of 1867.            "
"67","Ironically, about the same time that the Tenure of Office Act was repealed, new restrictive institutions such as the civil service and the independent commission emerged. These innovations made restrictions on removal power an explicit variable in the design of agencies."
"68","In the case of civil service reform, many hypotheses have been offered to explain the initial reforms of the Pendleton Act of 1883 and subsequent expansion of the merit system. These range from the argument that social and economic demands for efficient administration represented by the president eventually overcame partisan demands for patronage embodied by Congress (Skowronek 1982) to the idea that civil service reform was designed to restrict the supply of patronage positions to generate higher benefits for the president and congress while minimizing the transaction costs of managing political appointees (Johnson and Libecap 1994).            "
"69","The appointments dilemma provides yet another hypothesis about the incentives that may have helped shape the civil service system. The model suggests that a precursor to Congress embedding greater legislative authority in the executive branch would be some degree of insulation of agencies against the president. The most direct effect of civil service job protection is that it limits the president's ability to move the agency to his own ideal point. Secondly, while civil service protection probably reduces influence from both executives and legislatures, it may also create a bias in the preferences of the agency toward those of Congress. The career service and the Congress become the most permanent durable features of the administrative system while presidents and their appointees remain transitory (see Heclo 1977). The shared time horizons may induce shared preferences as career bureaucrats seek to please long‐term legislators at the expense of a temporary administration.21"
"70","The interpretation provided by my model does help illuminate some key facts about the development of the merit system. The first important feature of this development is that the Pendleton Act itself classified very few positions for merit and protected no one from presidential removal (Johnson and Libecap 1994; Skowronek 1982). Initially, it only provided a procedure for carrying out merit hiring, leaving the designation of merit positions to the president through executive order. Thus, the civil service grew only as presidents unilaterally acted to insulate agencies from themselves.22 Furthermore, protection from removals did not come from statutes, but through executive orders by the president.            "
"71","In addition to reinterpreting the stylized facts about expansion of the merit principle, the appointments dilemma suggests additional testable hypotheses about the expansion of the Civil Service.23 First, we should expect coverage to expand in agencies whose functions the president wants to expand. In other words, it should occur in those agencies whose output is relatively more valuable to the president than to Congress. Secondly, Congress should respond by providing more resources to agencies that have expanded coverage. Finally, the model suggests that presidents will retrench coverage or politicize the agencies when they want to constrain its policy output (or preserve the status quo).24"
"72","The appointments dilemma also has implications for the emergence of the independent regulatory commission. The model suggests that, in designing these institutions, Congress and the president recognized the importance of preventing manipulation through presidential removals. This logroll over structure has been facilitated by court decisions such as Humphrey's Executor v. the United States25 which upheld restrictions on the removal of Federal Trade Commissioners on the grounds that the Commission's activities were “quasi‐judicial and quasi‐legislative” rather than executive (see Fisher 1985). Since a definition of what constitutes “quasi‐judicial and quasi‐legislative” was not provided, Congress and the president were given a large amount of leeway to use restrictions on removal to overcome the appointments dilemma.

"73","The design of independent commissions contains a large number of degrees of freedom with which to engineer constraints on the president: the terms of service, size of commission, and the staggering of appointments. The longer the term, more staggering, and smaller the commission, the more difficult it will be for presidents to appoint a majority of the commission.26"
"74","Finally, the appointments dilemma may also affect the way that presidents and legislators bargain over bureaucratic structures (Lewis 2003; Moe 1989). In particular, it will affect the degree of insulation from presidential control that the president is willing to tolerate. Under conditions in which there is an appointments dilemma, the president will be more willing to trade away his appointment and removal powers for policy concessions from the legislature. Thus, the model would predict that the agencies that should be the most insulated from the presidential control are those whose activities the president supports more than does Congress. This result emerges because presidents are more willing to make accommodations in the design to make sure that those agencies are created and well funded by Congress.            "
"75","Debates about the separation of power are not only ubiquitous in American constitutional development, but are increasingly engaging scholars of comparative politics who seek to press new answers to these old questions into the service of new and fledgling democracies. From this literature (most notably Linz 1994) has emerged a serious critique of the separation of power and presidentialism focused in large part on the negative consequences of dual sovereignties. Certainly this article may be read as complementary to these critiques. Indeed the model identifies some important causal mechanisms by which bureaucratic accountability and performance can be undermined by dividing power.         "
"76","However, the implications of the model are not wholly pessimistic about bureaucratic performance in presidential systems. First of all other constitutional features such as the veto, confirmation requirements, and procedures for the removal of official can mitigate or eliminate the appointments dilemma. Even in situations in which the appointments dilemma looms large, separation‐of‐powers systems seem to have many mechanisms within their institutional repertoire, ranging from civil service systems to independent commissions, for controlling its worst manifestations. Therefore, any proper analysis of the effects of regime‐type on bureaucratic performance will have to carefully adjust for the ways in which these variations in bureaucratic structure have evolved to mitigate the appointments dilemma."
