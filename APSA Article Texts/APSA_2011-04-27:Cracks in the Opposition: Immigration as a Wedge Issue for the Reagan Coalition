"1","The traditional left‐right economic ideology dimension has proven to be a useful concept in the popular press and in academic scholarship. Measured as Poole and Rosenthal's DW‐NOMINATE score, it suggests that legislators’ ideological changes are relatively constant (Poole and Rosenthal 1997). But when policies are multidimensional, a great deal of strategizing is possible, some of it having far‐reaching consequences for the meaning and content of partisanship and the composition of partisan coalitions.         "
"2","With preferences distributed over two relatively independent dimensions of ideology, any winning partisan coalition should potentially be unstable (McKelvey and Schofield 1987). Divide a two‐dimensional space into four quadrants with the median voter in each dimension at the center. Unless preferences are highly skewed, there will not be a majority winning coalition in any one quadrant. This means that winning coalitions must consist of voters and politicians who are in conflict over at least one dimension. The minority party always has an interest in raising issues, called wedge issues, that divide the majority party—with the hope of winning support from one wing or the other of the majority party.         "
"3","The increasing salience of race in the 1950s and 1960s is an excellent example. Policies enacting economically liberal ideology could be supported by the majority Democratic Party, but introducing race as a secondary dimension split the Democratic coalition and allowed the conservative coalition to impact legislative choices. As race became more salient in the 1960s, civil rights legislation exerted pressure on the Democrats. “Republicans recognized an opportunity to pry the [Democratic] party further apart” (Bryant 2006, 152). A feuding majority party offered both the prospect of legislative and electoral gains. As much as President Kennedy tried to avoid the hard decision, pressure from the civil rights movement led liberal Democrats to pass major legislation that inevitably split the party.         "
"4","In reaction to the Democratic Party's sponsorship of the Civil Rights Act, the votes of many disgruntled southerners were up for grabs. In 1964, Senator Strom Thurmond was the first of many such leading Democrats to switch to the Republican Party. While Southern Democrats and Northern Democrats constituted a majority, so did Southern Democrats and Republicans. Strom Thurmond and his followers were pivotal—deciding between a coalition based on economic liberalism or one based on a fusion of economic and social conservatism."
"5","It is important to note that this partisan realignment did not require large numbers of voters to change their ideological beliefs. Nor did pivotal figures like Strom Thurmond have to change their underlying principles to join the Republican Party. They just had to believe that the Republican Party was in a better position to express their old preferences."
"6","In fact, the Republican Party came to Thurmond, rather than the other way around. Goldwater Republicans, and later Nixon and Reagan Republicans, were able to entice many such voters into the Reagan coalition of traditional pro‐business conservatives and social conservatives. The coalition, which Reagan liked to call “big tent Republicanism,” consisted of traditional pro‐business conservatives and newer social conservatives (McGirr 2001).1 This coalition succeeded despite the fact that pro‐business conservatives were often liberal on social issues like race, women's rights, and the environment, and social conservatives emphasized social issues such as opposition to abortion, gay rights, and affirmative action.         "
"7","One of the key implications of this formation of big tent Republicanism was that it completed the process of partisan realignment on the issue of race. In the nineteenth century, as the party of Lincoln, the Republican Party represented social liberalism, and continued to do so up to the passage of the civil rights acts of 1964 and 1965 (Jeong, Miller, and Sened 2009). However, once the Democratic majority was broken up after the passage of the civil rights acts in the 1960s, the Republican Party had to embrace social conservatism to form a new majority coalition with the Southern conservatives to whom race was the most salient issue. This illustrates how wedge issue politics can result in partisan realignment. To form a new majority coalition, the minority has to adopt a position on the wedge issue that can attract the alienated wing of the old majority coalition.         "
"8","However, a minority party is not a unitary actor either. That is why it took years for the Republican Party to fully embrace this idea of social conservatism. Also, while the formation of a new majority coalition between the minority party and an alienated wing of the old majority coalition represents a major achievement for the minority, it contains its own seed of destruction. The newly cobbled majority will necessarily contain elements that object to the policy initiatives necessary to attract the new pivotal group."
"9","The new Republican coalition led to a number of Republican presidential victories and the 1994 GOP conquest of Congress, but there were real fault lines beneath the surface. The socially conservative supporters were heirs of Bryan's populist tradition, whereas the business conservatives represented the Wall Street interests, abhorred by populists for generations in American politics. Combining these groups in a coalition was a remarkable accomplishment; keeping these two wings together over time proved increasingly difficult. In the process, however, the pro‐business Republicans who supported racial equality, abortion choice, and a secular state were increasingly marginalized. The leadership of congressional Republican caucuses increasingly passed into the hands of southerners and social conservatives. The success of the Reagan coalition depended on repression of the natural differences between its two wings, as the earlier New Deal coalition depended on repression of the race issue."
"10","While the national leadership of the Republican Party tried to minimize the conflict between pro‐business and social conservatives in the party, certain issues sharpened the divide between the two. One such issue was stem cell research. Pro‐business Republicans embraced the research as an opportunity for expansion in the health care sector. Social conservatives violently opposed it, as they did abortion, as violating the sanctity of life. Anticipating a state referendum on the issue, a leading Republican in Missouri said, “This referendum has the potential to rip our party apart” (New York Times, March 12, 2006). Another wedge issue that looms over the Reagan coalition is immigration. In this article, we examine the essence and the mechanics of this wedge issue that threatens to split the coalition.         "
"11","Immigration is a telling instance of the increasing salience of a wedge issue. The debate in the United States over immigration policy is related to two major issues: admission and rights of immigrants. The “admission” dimension pertains to border control and the number of family‐based and employment‐based immigrants allowed in. Restricting immigration on this dimension means stronger border control and reduced number of employment‐based and family‐based immigrants. The “rights” dimension of immigration pertains to immigrants’ access to public benefits such as public education, welfare benefits, legalization, as in amnesty for illegal immigrants, protection of guest workers, and the use of the English language.2"
"12","The multidimensionality of immigration policy shows up in the consequences of the debate as well. Economically, immigration policies affect the supply of labor and the welfare system, pitting labor against business interests. Socially, immigration policies affect race and ethnicity, pitting social conservatives against social liberals. Since immigration has multidimensional consequences, it can be defined in terms of the two dimensions—economic and social—that have been commonly used to analyze American politics for decades. These two dimensions of ideology are compelling as political elites use them to communicate the significance of new issues that come along. Labor leaders in the New Deal conveyed to allies that immigration should be limited in order to protect wages. Pro‐business politicians mobilized supporters to soften political opposition to immigration in order to keep the supply of cheap labor flowing. As long as the two political parties were distinguished by their business and labor alliances, the partisan nature of the conflict over immigration was clear."
"13","As the rights dimension of immigration policy makes clear, immigration is also related to national identity and ethnicity. This aspect of immigration has become more salient as the political parties have increasingly differentiated themselves on the social dimension of liberalism/conservatism and as the social conservatives in the Reagan coalition gained ascendancy."
"14","Pro‐business and socially conservative Republicans had conflicting goals for immigration policy. The pro‐business wing was mostly concerned with allowing enough immigrants to keep labor supplies available and cheap. Social conservatives increasingly felt that too much immigration would inevitably result in assaults on the traditional culture that they valued."
"15","Democrats, too, had diverging preferences. Pro‐labor Democrats hoped to minimize immigration to protect workers’ wages and jobs. This could put them in a coalition with socially conservative Republicans. Social liberals among Democrats stressed the principle of family reunion, increasingly seeing the issue as a civil rights issue. This could result in a voting alliance between socially liberal Democrats and pro‐business Republicans in support of immigration reform—more laborers, and more respect for their rights. Emphasizing civil rights aspects of immigration policies, those groups helped the Democratic Party and labor unions redefine immigration as a social issue rather than an economic issue (Tichenor 2002; Wong 2006). Thus, in 2006, Democrats focused on increasing the rights and inflows of immigrants rather than limiting the inflow of immigrants, transforming themselves as a desirable coalition partner to economically conservative and socially moderate Republicans. This trend explains the gradual decline of the Republican Party in the northeast of the United States during this period. In the twenty‐first century, Democrats were happy to huddle with pro‐business Republicans to split the Republican Party.         "
"16","While this argument has been made before (Miller and Schofield 2003), we know of no quantitative research of the two‐dimensional realignment argument in a legislative setting. The reason why this well‐documented phenomenon has been subject to such scant scientific attention is not for lack of interest but rather insufficient theoretical and measurement tools. The main contribution of this article is to put together the theoretical and measurement framework to allow the systematic study of party realignment that we now turn to.         "
"17","Using our original framework of analysis, we present evidence for the shift of the coalitional structure that ultimately led to the failure of the Reagan coalition and realignment of political parties on immigration. On the wedge issue of immigration, Republicans have been unable to vote together, and cross‐party coalitions have shaped the centrist legislation that emerged in the U.S. Senate. In particular, when immigration was defined as an economic issue in the 1980s, a majority of Republican senators took a pro‐admission position, making social conservatives a minority within the party. However, when immigration gained more salience since the 9/11 attacks and was redefined as a social or security issue, the majority of Republican senators identified themselves with opposition to admission of immigrants.3"
"18","At the same time, party switching and electoral change shifted the center of gravity of the Republican Party further toward the position of social conservatives. Socially conservative Democrats like Richard Shelby switched to the Republican Party. Socially liberal Republicans like Jeffords or Specter left the Republican Party or, like Chaffee of Rhode Island, were defeated in socially liberal states. With the increasing influence of social conservatives in the Republican Party, partisan alignment became almost entirely about the social dimension of ideology. Republicans like Shelby were willing to castigate business interests, not only on immigration, but also on policy issues relating to the financial developments in 2008 and 2009. By emphasizing civil rights issues, Democrats managed to get a foot in the door with pro‐business voters of social liberal leanings who, traditionally, voted Republican."
"19","We now turn to explain the theoretical and measurement framework we designed to enable a systematic study of party realignment in legislative bodies. We submit it as an integrated composite tool to study partisan legislative coalition shifts over time."
"20","As a game‐theoretic solution concept, the uncovered set established itself as the most general and widely applicable solution concept in the institutional study of free majority rule legislative processes of the type we study here (Bianco and Sened 2005; Cox 1987; McKelvey 1986). It has been shown to be a potent predictor of legislative outcomes (Jeong et al. 2009; Kam et al. 2010). We couple this solution concept with our original techniques to estimate ideal points of legislators, proposals on the floor, and final outcomes in the same statistical spaces. Together the theoretical framework and the measurement tools we put to its service provide a comprehensive framework to study party realignment in a precise and rigorous fashion that was previously unavailable to the discipline. The U.S. Senate's debate over immigration policy serves to illustrate the usefulness and power of this framework in the hope of enticing further research in this domain that is so critical to the understanding of the dynamic of democratic processes.         "
"21","The spatial theory of legislative behavior is clearly the leading theoretical framework for the study of legislative politics. Part of its appeal is its simplicity. It models legislators4 as a set of N individuals with Euclidean preferences. Each legislator  is defined by an ideal point, , and a monotonically declining utility function emanating from this point. Finally, x,y,z denote elements in the set of all possible outcomes, X. Any x beats y if it is closer than y to more than half of the ideal points. A Core consists of policy positions that cannot be beaten by other policy positions, by majority rule. When a core exists, it is a manifestation of the “will of the people” under majority rule. It is a centrist outcome, where legislators’ ideal points are “balanced” around the core. If no core exists, it is less clear what alternatives represent the will of the majority in any meaningful sense. In fact, one can construct scenarios in which almost any outcome may be selected by majority rule (McKelvey 1976).            "
"22","In multidimensional preference profiles, a majority core rarely exists (McKelvey 1976, 1979; McKelvey and Schofield 1987; Schofield 1978), rendering legislative processes indeterminate. However, theorists have concluded that the uncovered set provides significant constraints and a degree of predictability for majority rule legislative processes (Cox 1987; McKelvey 1986; Miller 1980; Shepsle and Weingast 1984). When the core is empty, alternatives split into two sets: the covered set and the uncovered set. We say that x covers y if x beats y and if any third point z that beats x also beats y. If x covers y, then y is not only defeated by x, but also it is defeated by any alternative that beat x. The uncovered set is the set of alternatives that are not covered.5 It coincides with the core when a core exists (McKelvey 1986, 290). If x is unanimously preferred to y, y is not in the uncovered set. The uncovered set is a centrally located area (McKelvey 1986, 304). The uncovered set gets larger as the distribution of ideal points becomes polarized,6 and smaller as it approaches symmetric conditions that would result in a core (Bianco and Sened 2005; Cox 1987).            "
"23","Since the uncovered set represents the center of the relevant preference profile, the uncovered set is a useful measure of the policy position of political parties as well. For instance, to measure the policy position of the Democratic Party, we can simply compute the uncovered set using the ideal points of Democratic legislators. Since this uncovered set will represent the center of the Democratic Party, the policy position of the Democratic Party can be inferred from the location of the uncovered set of the Democratic Party."
"24","In our analysis, we measure partisan realignment by examining the location of the uncovered set of each party in relation to the uncovered set of the floor. Since the uncovered set of the floor is computed using the ideal points of all legislators, it represents the center of the policy space in terms of the preference profile of all legislators. Using the relative positioning of these two sets, we can trace how a party's position has changed over the years by examining the relative location of the uncovered set of each party to that of the floor."
"25","The uncovered set of the floor provides a set prediction of where final outcomes will fall, in multidimensional legislative debates, if majority rule is the voting procedure of choice for the chamber as a whole. If legislators consider the consequences of their behavior, rather than choosing myopically between alternatives, outcomes of majority rule choices will lie in the uncovered set (Feld, Grofman, and Miller 1989; McKelvey 1986; Miller 1980). Since for any “status quo point” that starts a voting process there exists a two‐step agenda that yields an uncovered point as its final outcome (Shepsle and Weingast 1984), legislators are expected to secure uncovered outcomes using relatively simple agendas. Thus, the uncovered set should be the predictive set of choice for final outcomes in legislative processes ruled by majority rule procedures of a very broad variety (Bianco and Sened 2005; Cox 1987).            "
"26","We focus on the Senate and not on the House because the estimation method (below) requires a rich environment of amendments. The House leadership restrictions on amendments make that environment unlikely. The House leadership's restriction of amendments is not unbiased. Amendments that are likely to pass and move the legislation away from the House majority's median are more likely to be squashed. We expect that the absence of amendments in a certain range of outcomes will provide no informative cutpoints allowing an informative sorting of legislators. Consequently, we would expect inexact, and very possibly biased, estimates of individual preferences. These limitations should not apply in the Senate, where the full range of amendments may be allowed a vote, producing accurate estimates of senators’ preferences."
"27","Since the debate over immigration policy is analyzed in a two‐dimensional model, we set our statistical model in a two‐dimensional space. Let  be the vector of legislator i's ideal points in this space. Let Yeaj denote the location associated with the passage of “yea” on vote j and Nayj the location associated with a rejection of j. Assuming a quadratic utility function, the random utility function of legislator i voting yes or no on vote j is defined as               "
"28","The probability of legislator i voting yes on vote j is defined by               "
"29","To identify this model, we use the agenda‐constrained ideal point estimation technique developed by Clinton and Meirowitz (2004) and Jeong (2008). The main idea is to use the fact that a nay vote from a legislator means that she prefers the outcome proposed by the last successful amendment to that proposed by the current amendment. We therefore constrain the nay position of the current vote to be the same as the yea position of the last successful proposal. This reduces the number of bill parameters needed to identify the model.            "
"30","We now turn to test our analytical framework against the evidence, using the issue of immigration in the U.S. Senate in the last three decades as our test case. We begin with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, study the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and conclude with the Comprehensive Immigrant Reform Act of 2006. We show how parties’ positions on immigration evolved over the three decades. Tensions grew within the Reagan coalition of pro‐business and social conservatives, as the growing dominance of social conservatives became apparent. Republican senators were more likely to vote against business interests on immigration. As social conservatives gained ground in the GOP, Democrats softened their antibusiness position to accommodate ethnic and civil rights groups that defined immigration as a civil rights issue."
"31","The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was the first major immigration reform legislation since the 1960s. With the Republican control of the White House and the Senate, it might seem that the Republican coalition could enact whatever they wanted as immigration reforms. However, the Republicans were split on many issues. On the Senate floor they were split on the issue of making it more difficult for illegal aliens to get benefits, as proposed by Hawkins (R‐FL). When Kennedy proposed to table the Hawkins amendment, 10 Republicans voted with him, as did pro‐business social liberals Weicker of Connecticut and Packwood and Hatfield of Oregon. The tabling motion failed, so Hawkins’s proposal subsequently passed with a voice vote. The bill that came from committee also contained an employer sanctions program that would for the first time fight illegal immigration by fining employers who hired undocumented aliens. On this issue, the Republican coalition split again. Republican Jim McClure of Idaho offered an amendment that would weaken employer sanctions by requiring a search warrant before an officer of the INS could search a farm for illegal immigrants. This amendment divided the Republicans in half: 23 to 23. It was opposed by socially conservative Republicans like Grassley of Iowa and by Democrats representing labor unions like Dodd of Connecticut, Kerry of Massachusetts, and Gore of Tennessee. Pro‐business Republicans, like Wilson of California, and liberal Democrats like Kennedy of Massachusetts and Simon of Illinois, were united in support of a measure that would weaken employer sanctions. Civil rights and ethnic groups and liberal Democrats were worried that employer sanctions would result in discrimination against ethnic minorities in hiring."
"32","On the issue of the guest‐work programs, the initial proposal failed, killed by a motion from Simpson to table that passed 50–48. Pro‐business Republicans, like Wilson, supported the program, but a coalition of socially conservative Republicans—like Grassley—and Democrats who were concerned about the rights of workers in the program opposed it. A later version of the guest‐worker program, with restricted numbers of guest workers, passed by a vote of 51–44, backed by pro‐business Republicans. Simon advanced the successful amendment (“10” in Figure 1) that required congressional review of the program. This shifted the bill back from the pro‐business position that resulted from the passage of the seasonal worker program. A proposal by Wilson to table the Simon amendment failed 40–56. Seventeen Republican senators, including Grassley and Kasten, joined with 39 Democrats to save the Simon amendment.            "
"33","                 The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986                         "
"34","Contours denote the 95%, 70%, 50%, and 10% highest density levels of the floor UCS (shaded contours), the Republican Party UCS (continuous contours), and the Democratic Party UCS (dashed contours). The final outcome is “10.”“SQ” represents the location of no new bill (the status quo). “A” represents the location of the original proposal on the floor.                        "
"35","This debate shows that, though the Republicans controlled the Senate, the Democrats together with one wing or another of the Republican Party constituted a blocking coalition. Throughout the process, different coalitions blocked dramatic changes and brought the final outcome close to the center of the space. Yet, the presence of social conservatism in the 1986 Senate was relatively weak and inchoate. Few Republicans voted in a social conservative manner consistently, Grassley of Iowa being a rare exception. This can be explained by the Republican Party UCS in Figure 1, located to the right of the floor UCS. The central position of the Republican Party on immigration leaned toward more admission and fewer rights for immigrants. In contrast, the Democratic Party UCS is located to the left of the floor UCS, indicating that the Democratic Party's position on immigration was less admission and more rights to immigrants. It shows that the issue of immigrant admission in the 1980s was defined by both parties as an economic issue pitting labor unions again business owners.            "
"36","While the immigration bill of 1986 was a response to public concern about increasing illegal and legal immigrants, the effects of the legislation were not satisfactory to the public. In fact, the final outcome in Figure 1 is very close to the previous status quo. This is indicative of what proved to be the weakness of the bill. While the bill provided for sanctions against employers for the first time, it was a weak measure that proved of little help in diminishing the flow of illegal workers. A 1995 Commission on Immigration Reform concluded that stronger measures against employers were essential to putting a dent in illegal immigration as the 1986 legislation proved ineffectual. At the same time, the creation of the temporary workers program indicated the continued strength of pro‐business interests in the Republican Party. The public demand for immigration reform continued to grow throughout the 1990s into a grassroots movement that ultimately had the potential to challenge pro‐business interests more strongly and to shift the Republican Party's stance on immigration.            "
"37","As the issue of immigration heated up in the 1990s, its potential for splitting the Republican Party increased. In the 1996 Republican presidential primaries, most candidates reflected the traditional business position that legal immigration was not a problem, but Patrick Buchanan articulated a new position against both legal and illegal immigration, calling for a temporary moratorium on legal immigration. The move resonated with social conservatives in the party.            "
"38","The popular impact of Buchanan's call may have influenced the chair of the Immigration and Refugee Subcommittee, Senator Simpson, to restrict both legal and illegal immigration. The existing system allowed in about 800,000 permanent new residents each year. In a bid for the support of working Americans, Simpson argued that the legal system let in people who compete with U.S. citizens for low‐skilled jobs. He proposed a bill to curb admission and the rights of both legal and illegal immigrants. The idea was that if legal immigration was folded into the bill attacking illegal immigration, the animosity toward illegal immigration would be sufficient to carry the features of a bill intending to limit legal immigration. Simpson felt that “Congress would only be able to restrict legal immigration as part of a broader and more popular attempt to crack down on illegal aliens” (CQ Almanac 1996, 3–5). Simpson's subcommittee adopted quick measures to control illegal immigration, including budgets for border patrols and fences, new penalties for smuggling immigrants, restrictions on public services, and a pilot program to identify illegal immigrants at work.            "
"39","Business interests did not want to restrict legal immigration. With them, civil rights Democrats “fought to keep legal and illegal immigration in separate legislation” (CQ Almanac 1996, 3–5). Thus, Simpson's own subcommittee defied him by splitting (in a vote of 12–6) Simpson's legislation into two separate bills—one dealing with legal and one illegal immigration. Pro‐business Republican Spencer Abraham of Michigan, who led the fight to split the legislation, claimed that he was not “trying to kill legal immigration reform” (CQ Almanac 1996, 5–6). Nevertheless, the opposition to limiting legal immigration led to the inevitable outcome: the measure on legal immigration never made it to the floor. Simpson went on to introduce several amendments directed at legal as well as illegal immigration. Simpson attempted to strengthen employer sanctions by allowing INS officers to search farms without a search warrant. Although socially conservative Republicans—Fred Thomson (TN), Strom Thurmond (SC), and Charles Grassley (IA)—voted for the amendments, it was blocked by a coalition of pro‐business Republicans—McCain—and socially liberal Democrats—Kennedy and Simon."
"40","When Simpson and Feinstein attempted to limit the number of legal family‐based immigrants, the same business/social liberal coalition blocked the amendments. Once the attempts to restrict admission of family‐based immigrants had been successfully blocked, Democrats tried to modify the Simpson bill's restriction on immigrants’ access to public benefits. However, economically conservative Republicans—concerned about the fiscal impacts of immigrants’ access to welfare benefits—and socially conservative Republicans united to block attempts to relax the restrictions proposed by the Simpson bill. As the Republicans had the majority, they successfully blocked such changes, when united."
"41","An important difference from the 1986 debate was that labor unions took less restrictive positions on immigration in the 1990s. They strongly supported employer sanctions in the 1980s but changed their position during the 1990s. An increasing number of union representatives sided with civil rights and ethnic groups, opposing employer sanctions on the ground that employer sanctions resulted in discrimination against ethnic minorities in hiring. Two factors are related to this change. First, efforts of civil rights and ethnic groups to frame immigration as a civil rights issue led labor unions to redefine their positions on immigration (Wong 2006). Second, a decrease in union membership led labor unions to view immigrants as potential union members rather than competitors in labor markets (Briggs 2001; Gimpel and Edwards 1999; Haus 1995; Watts 2002; Wong 2006). For these reasons, the position of labor unions converged with that of civil rights and ethnic groups. Thus, in Figure 2, Democrats converge to the upper right end of the space. This is reflected in the location of the Democratic Party UCS. In 1986, it was to the left of the floor UCS (Figure 1), indicating the Democratic Party's more restrictive position on the admission of immigrants. In 1996, the Democratic Party UCS is similar to that of the Republican Party UCS in the admission dimension, indicating that the Democratic Party took an expansive position on admission.            "

"
"44","An unintended consequence of the 1996 act, which restricted immigrants’ access to public benefits, was that it mobilized Latino voters in subsequent elections. For instance, in the 1996 presidential election, Latino voter turnout percentage exceeded non‐Latino voter turnout in California (Tichenor 2002, 285–86). Thus, the position of ethnic groups within the Democratic Party was enhanced. The Republicans were prevented from mounting an effective appeal for Latino votes by the necessity of maintaining the new social conservative base of the Party—witness the Republican votes on the new Latina associate justice in 2009. In addition, the changing position of labor unions on immigration, mentioned earlier, reinforced the shift of the Democratic Party's position on immigration. Thus, in 2006, Democrats were consolidated toward pro‐immigration positions (the upper right space in Figure 3). This shift is illustrated by the location of the Democratic Party UCS relative to the floor UCS, showing the pro‐admission position of the Democratic Party in 2006.            "

"47","On the Republican side, the dominance of social conservatism on immigration was well established by 2006. The 9/11 terrorist attacks made it easy for social conservatives to frame immigration as an issue of national security and national identity rather than as a way of providing cheap labor as Reaganite Republicans once viewed it. For example, Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman and presidential candidate in the Republican primaries, demanded a halt to all immigration (Lizza 2007). The growing strength of social conservatism moved the center of the Republicans toward the left side of the space in Figure 3.            "
"48","The Republican Party UCS in Figure 3 is located to the left of the floor UCS, indicating the new anti‐admission position of the Republican Party. The party was pro‐admission in 1986 and 1996, as evidenced by the location of the Republican Party UCS in Figures 1 and 2. This shift represents a dramatic change of the party position. While some moderate Republicans—Lugar, Specter, and McCain—are at the middle of the space, the location of the Republican Party UCS indicates that most Republicans preferred less admission of immigrants in 2006. The immigration reform bill of 2006 was a product of a coalition of moderate Republicans such as Specter, Hagel, Martinez, and McCain, and Democrats. The bill “A,” to the upper right of the status quo in Figure 3, proposed to increase border security, allow long‐time illegal immigrants to gain citizenship, and increase the number and rights of guest workers. During the Senate debate, social conservatives modified the bill to strengthen border control and reduce the rights of immigrants. The final outcome is “31,” which is to the lower left of “A.” Most amendments that proposed to strengthen border control passed.            "
"49","Senator McCain's role in this “critical coalition” that, by our account, contributed to the undermining of the conservative “Reagan” Republican coalition, is interesting. Recruited as a business conservative by Reagan, McCain was always a champion of pro‐business immigration reform and built his “maverick” status and his moderate positions on the social dimension. Yet, while his “maverick” status helped him win the Republican nomination in the 2008 electoral campaign, the consequence of his political legacy, closely tied to the demise of the Reagan conservative Republican coalition, led to his defeat in the general election."
"50","McCain's role in the demise of the Republican conservative coalition reads as a tragic epic of classic Greek methodology: despite significant compromises in the Senate, the 2006 bill never become law due to differences between the House and the Senate versions that could not be hammered out in the conference committee. The coalition of moderates was significant enough to cause a major interlude in the drama of party realignment in the last two decades of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty‐first century, but its legislative impact was minimal at best."
"51","In the previous section, we showed that political parties realigned over immigration by comparing the location of the parties’ UCSs relative to the floor UCS. In this section, we provide evidence that such partisan realignment has resulted from the restructuring of the coalition, rather than from changes in economic and social ideologies of individual senators.7"
"52","Before we proceed, we need to highlight the difference between ideal point estimates in the previous section and ideologies of senators in economic and social dimensions. Ideal point estimates, as of the previous section, represent senators’ revealed position on immigration. Senators’ economic and social ideologies should be understood as their positions on general issues. The distinction between positions on issues and the ideology of legislators is important, given a seeming contradiction in the literature. It is often argued that legislators' ideological changes are rare (Poole and Rosenthal 1997), but some studies show that position changes of legislators on various issues are somewhat common (Karol 2009). If one accepts the distinction between ideology and issue positions, these studies are not contradictory. While legislators’ ideologies rarely change, their positions on certain issues can change. For example, we do not doubt that Senator Kennedy's ideology was socially liberal in both 1986 and 2006, but the analysis of his voting on immigration shows that his position on immigration changed over the three decades (see Figures 1, 2, and 3). Kennedy's shifts in policy position are the result of complex structural changes in American society, but they are also the result of strategic Democratic responses to the resultant instability of the Reagan coalition.         "
"53","Given this distinction, we can place issues on the two‐dimensional ideological space of American politics. For example, trade is an issue that has clear implications on the economic dimension, while the death penalty has clear implications on the social dimension. Immigration has implications on both economic and social dimensions. Thus, immigration can be defined in various ways in the two‐dimensional ideological space."
"54","In the previous section, we showed that immigration was defined more as an economic issue in the 1980s. Republicans the favored position of business interests while Democrats took the favored position of labor unions. Most Republicans supported the guest‐worker program as a measure of ensuring cheap labor, downplaying the program's possible social effects. A majority of Democrats backed employer sanction as a measure of reducing inflows of immigrants, downplaying possible discrimination against ethnic minorities in hiring."
"55","By 2006, immigration was defined more as a social issue. Republicans took a position favored by social conservatives—less admission—while Democrats took the position favored by civil rights and ethnic groups—more admission. Social liberals and ethnic groups kept raising concerns regarding possible discrimination against ethnic minorities due to employer sanction. As such, economic liberals and a growing number of labor unions gave up their support for employer sanction and viewed immigration as a social issue. Thus, economic liberals and labor unions joined social liberals and ethnic groups to support the interests of immigrants. At the same time, social conservatives raised growing concerns about social consequences of the increased inflow of immigrants—such as cultural diversity, crimes, and threats to English as the official language. As a result, the view of social conservatives became dominant in the Republican Party in regard to immigration, and the party gave up its pro‐admission position. To present a more systematic evidence for this, we first show that ideological positions remained unchanged. Then, we present evidence of coalitional reshuffling on immigration."
"56","The evidence that ideologies of senators did not change over the last three decades is found by studying the correlation of their DW‐NOMINATE scores between 1986 and 2006. Using 23 senators who served in 1986 and 2006, we computed the Pierson's correlations.8 The correlations are very high, confirming Poole and Rosenthal's (1997) finding that legislators' ideology rarely changes. In dimension 1, the correlation coefficient is 0.98 (p‐value < 0.01). In dimension 2, it is 0.96 (p‐value < 0.01). That is, social conservatives in 1986 were still social conservatives in 2006 and economic conservatives in 1986 were still economic conservatives in 2006.         "
"57","Next, we present evidence of coalitional restructuring and demonstrate that economic conservatives and social liberals formed a coalition of pro‐admission positions in the 1980s, while economic conservatives and social conservatives formed an anti‐admission coalition in 2006. Since the realignment of party positions occurred on the issue of admission, we focus our attention on this issue. On rights of immigrants, Democrats continuously supported more rights to immigrants and Republicans continuously opposed more rights to immigrants."
"58","If the changes of coalitions have occurred as we suggested, the relationship between the position of a senator on admission of immigrants and his or her ideology in the economic dimension—measured by the score of DW‐NOMINATE dimension 1—will change between 1986 and 2006. Since economic conservatives scoring high on DW‐NOMINATE dimension 1 are expected to support more admission of immigrants in 1986, the score of DW‐NOMINATE dimension 1 should have a significant and positive association with a senator's position on admission in 1986. On the other hand, since economic conservatives are expected to oppose more admission of immigrants in 2006, the same variable should have a significant and negative association in 2006. To verify these expectations, we estimate multilevel agenda‐constrained ideal point estimation models, adding some structure on the ideal points in each dimension using some covariates, including the measures of ideologies. Thus, we add the following equation to the statistical model:             "
"59","The results in Figure 4 support our expectations. Controlling district interests, we find that the DW‐NOMINATE dimension 1 score in 1986 has a significant and positive association, indicating economic conservatives were part of the pro‐admission coalition. This variable, in 2006, has a significant and negative association, indicating that economic conservatives were part of the anti‐admission coalition.10 Given the high correlation of DW‐NOMINATE scores in 1986 and 2006, the result confirms that coalitions on immigration were restructured over the three decades without changes in senators’ ideologies. This coalitional restructuring transformed the Republican Party into a party of anti‐admission of immigrants, whereas the Democratic Party transformed itself into a party of pro‐admission of immigrants.

"62","We introduced a method to study partisan coalitions in the legislature, composed of new theoretical and measurement tools. The theoretical tool is the uncovered set. Beyond its predictive power, the uncovered set's ability to track down the set of feasible outcomes at every multidimensional legislative debate proves to be a key analytical tool in studying how different legislative groups form coalitions to block unwanted policies and constrain the range of outcomes that legislators may pursue. Outcomes of multidimensional politics tend to be compromises that locate in the uncovered set. This solution concept gives us a unique insight as to why, despite the heat of controversy, radical policy shifts are marginalized, constrained, and moderated by Senate negotiations."
"63","The measurement tools we introduced that allow us to estimate ideal points, proposals, and final outcomes, and the computation of the uncovered set in the same statistical space, are the method of agenda‐constrained ideal point estimation developed by Clinton and Meirowitz (2004) and Jeong (2008). When the theoretical solution concept is combined with these new measurement and estimation techniques, we obtain, for the first time, a rather precise and detailed account of how party realignment really occurs in these legislative environments.         "
"64","The examination of immigration politics over three decades shows a gradual shift in the parties’ positions on immigration. In the 1980s, Democrats, representing labor interests, took a more restrictive position on admission of immigrants than Republicans. This has changed partly due to efforts of the ethnic and civil rights faction of the Democratic Party, which emphasized the social consequences of immigration, and partly because unions have taken a moderate stance on immigration policy, increasingly seeing immigrant workers as a target of opportunity rather than an inevitable threat. Another reason for the Democrats’ shift is an opportunity to use immigration to exploit “cracks in the opposition.” The Republican Party, increasingly dominated by social conservatives, was a target of opportunity for Democrats, who saw the value of immigration as a wedge issue. Instead of voting cohesively, Republicans split their vote, with pro‐business social moderates forming coalitions with Democrats around the issues of easier admission and immigrant rights. The bipartisan coalition that supported immigration reform in 2006 included independent Jeffords, who left the Republican Party, Specter, who later joined the Democratic Party, and Chaffee (RI), who was defeated shortly after by a Democratic challenger."
"65","In the end, the shifts in partisan positions on immigration shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3 represent both a Republican success and a Republican failure. The Republicans succeeded in locking up the socially conservative position in the legislature and, thus, locked up the electoral support of socially conservative activists and voters. Yet, the guarantee of social conservative support came at the price of decreasing loyalty of traditional pro‐business, social liberals. In the Senate, it enabled effective cross‐party coalitions of Democrats and liberal Republicans. The same coalition proved instrumental as Democrats in the Senate were able to woo these Republicans in support of immigration reform. Decreasing party loyalty of Republicans who support abortion, limited government, and immigration reform also helped a Democratic recovery in the elections to the House, Senate, and White House in 2006 and 2008.         "
"66","We chose the case of the legislative debate over immigration in the U.S. Senate as an interesting case to track down because of its profound grounding in and lasting impact on modern U.S. politics. The importance of the case notwithstanding, we call upon future research to use the methodology and the theory we advanced to test whether the mechanism of wedge issues we unveiled in this case is as generally applicable in other institutional environments and other legislative bodies across time and nation states as we believe it is."
