"1","Do blacks need black elected officials to represent their interests or are nonblack representatives just as effective in serving black constituencies? Political scientists have thus far shed light on this question either by documenting the value of symbolic representation, or by compiling an inventory of substantive benefits emanating from a particular office. Consequently, we now know that shared racial identity renders black congresspersons more responsive to their minority constituents (Whitby 1998; but see also Swain 1993) while also fostering group identity and a sense of inclusion in American political life (Canon 1999; Fenno 2003). In urban politics, scholars have utilized Abramson's (1983)“political‐reality” model, which posits that lower levels of political efficacy and trust among blacks are based on the realization that their capacity to influence political leaders is limited, to examine whether increased political representation reduces the gap between black and white trust in government. In an early test of this model, Foster (1978, 250) found that political power arrangements did structure blacks' attitudes toward political objects. Other work by Abney and Hutcheson (1981) and Howell and Fagan (1988) found that the election of African American mayors (in Atlanta and New Orleans, respectively) was associated with higher levels of black trust in local government, and Bobo and Gilliam (1990) found that blacks residing in black‐empowered cities had higher levels of political trust, efficacy, and knowledge, and consequently exhibited markedly higher levels of political participation than blacks living in unempowered cities.1"
"2","Research focused on more substantive benefits, in turn, suggests that black mayors positively influence black representation in city administrative, professional, and protective services positions (Eisinger 1982; Mladenka 1989; Sass and Mehay 2003), spend more on social policies (Karnig and Welch 1980; but see also Pelissero, Holian, and Tomaka 2000), and promote public sector contracting with minority businesses (MacManus 1990; Nelson 1987). Similar benefits have been documented in specific policy arenas as well. For example, studies have found that minority school board members achieve greater minority representation in school administrative and instructional positions (Polinard, Wrinkle, and Longoria 1990) and that the net benefits of increased representation in the educational arena go beyond mere headcounts. Specifically, gains in descriptive representation within the realm of schooling have been found to play an important role in improving the quality, effectiveness, and equality of school outcomes, particularly for minority students; for example, by decreasing the incidences of policies and practices referred to as second‐generation discrimination (Meier and England 1984; Polinard, Wrinkle, and Longoria 1990),2 and by reducing the gap between minority and nonminority student achievement (Polinard, Wrinkle, and Meier 1995).         "
"3","In addition to research investigating more substantive dimensions of descriptive representation, recently symbolic representation has been subject to closer inspection (Bobo and Gilliam 1990; Phillips 1995; Tate 2003). As Eulau and Karps explain (1977, 248), symbolic representation is tantamount to constituents feeling they are represented regardless of whether their representatives are responsive in their policy stands or the public goods and services they provide for their constituency (see also Phillips 1995; Williams 1998). While symbolic representation has been found to increase levels of political engagement, knowledge, efficacy, and trust in government (Bobo and Gilliam 1990), it is unclear if these effects can be sustained over the long term in the absence of substantive representation. Hence some scholars have begun to conceive of symbolic representation as inseparable from substantive representation (Tate 2003). This conceptualization, however, raises some challenges. Specifically, how can we determine whether attitudinal or behavioral effects on the part of constituents are driven by actual actions taken by black representatives rather than solely by descriptive representation?         "
"4","To date, Tate's (2003) analysis of whether blacks' evaluations of House members are linked to either substantive outcomes or substantive aspects of representation goes furthest in addressing this question.3 While Tate found blacks in districts with black representatives significantly more satisfied with their representatives and more likely to perceive their member as helpful, having done something special for the district, and having kept in touch with the district than were blacks represented by nonblack members, none of the variables tapping aspects of substantive representation were significant predictors of these evaluations. The lack of empirical evidence linking these enhanced levels of satisfaction and efficacy to actions taken by black representatives while in office is particularly troubling given arguments by some urban scholars that symbolic representation alone may be insufficient (see also Gay 2001, 598). For instance, the elevated expectations and enhanced feelings of empowerment blacks typically feel upon the election of African American officials may be replaced with feelings of alienation if these officials do not take actions that respond to black constituents' needs (see Bobo and Gilliam 1990; Tate 2003). Indeed, a handful of recent studies show that performance has come to rival race‐based attitudes and group membership as the key determinant of both citizen evaluations of minority officeholders (Hajnal 2001; Howell and McLean 2001; Howell and Perry 2004) and these elected officials' chances of reelection (Stein, Ulbig, and Post 2004). Thus further empirical tests are needed in order to more fully explore whether representation‐fueled attitudinal effects are driven by racial empathy alone or whether government outputs—what black elected officials do when in office—matter as well.         "
"5","Although the present study builds upon Tate's (2003) analysis, it is focused on local rather than congressional representation because doing so affords maximal analytic leverage. For example, given that institutional features of Congress dictate who can give what to whom, as a relatively small bloc in Congress, black Members are constrained in their ability to influence policy processes and outcomes. In addition, since the constituencies black Members represent reflect similar demographics (majority‐minority districts for the most part) and thus have limited contextual variance, examining the relationship between symbolic and substantive forms of representation may be especially difficult in the congressional arena. Finally, given that black leadership in executive offices is argued by some to be more empowering than leadership in legislative offices (Tate 2003, 141; see also Gay 2001), too narrow a focus on Congress not only overlooks an important part of the story but also continues to furnish incomplete understandings of the links between the symbolic and the substantive aspects of minority representation.         "
"6","Shifting the empirical focus of this research to the local level overcomes these limitations in a number of important ways. First, thousands of subnational jurisdictions are governed by elected officials with clearly demarcated zones of authority, and these jurisdictions are also home to startling degrees of contextual (socioeconomic, demographic, and structural) variation. Second, the bulk of minority representation manifests itself in local rather than in federal or state offices. In particular, while a total of only 112 blacks have been elected to Congress since 1869, the number of blacks elected to municipal offices and school boards in 2000 was 4,465 and 1,869, respectively. Between 1970 and 2000, on average these positions accounted for 47% and 23% of black elected officials, respectively.4 In short, the realm of local politics provides the ideal grounds not only for testing theories of black representation in executive, legislative, and administrative offices, but also for deciphering the links between, and the consequences of, descriptive, substantive, and symbolic representation for the represented—black constituents.         "
"7","This study seeks to examine black residents' evaluations of the quality of their neighborhood schools, police protection, and general neighborhood conditions and to assess empirically the possibility that these attitudes are at least partially driven by black elected officials' substantive representation of their black constituents. While there is some debate in the literature as to the merits of subjective versus objective indicators, it is clear that subjective indicators are not only reliable but also preferred as measures of service delivery outcomes."
"8","First, because objective measures are invariably narrow in their scope and tend to tap inputs or outputs rather than outcomes, they are limited in their capacity to measure many of the aspects of service delivery that matter to residents. As Parks notes (1984, 119), inputs such as expenditures, squad cars, or facilities can be employed in a variety of different ways, not all of which yield satisfactory outcomes. Further, since objective measures do not account for the specific level or type of service constituents desire (see, e.g., Meier and England 1984; Sass and Mehay 2003), objective measures confound quantity with quality and ignore priority.         "
"9","Second, given the highly aggregate nature of most objective measures, they ignore variation not only in neighborhood conditions, but also in demand and supply of services across neighborhoods (Kelly 2003; Kelly and Swindell 2002; Parks 1984; Van Ryzin, Muzzio, and Immerwahr 2004). Subjective measures on the other hand are without exception based on individual‐level responses. And, although self‐reported satisfaction is only a proxy for traditional objective indicators, it is independent neither of prevailing neighborhood conditions nor of actual service provision levels. Indeed, subjective indicators are conceptually and empirically associated with salient aspects of services and conditions; for instance, citizens' personal experiences with public servants and procedural aspects of service delivery (Kelly 2003; Kelly and Swindell 2002; Parks 1984; Percy 1986).         "
"10","Third, empirical evidence points to the superiority of subjective indicators. Recent scholarship not only finds congruence between citizen perceptions of several municipal services and actual changes in performance (Howell and McLean 2001; Kelly 2003; Parks 1984), but also finds citizens' evaluations of crime to be influenced most by their contacts with local police personnel (Reisig and Parks 2000). Other work by Van Ryzin, Muzzio, and Immerwahr (2004) suggests that minorities may rate public services (especially police and fire) more unfavorably than whites if these uniformed services are staffed predominantly by whites.         "
"11","In brief, residents' assessments of the quality of services provided in their neighborhoods represent a critical indicator of how well local governments are functioning and meeting the needs of constituents (see also Howell and Perry 2004, 51). Because citizen evaluations are rooted in salient aspects of these services and incorporate individuals' direct experiences with the process, efficacy, and outcomes of service delivery, they are richer, more powerful measures than objective measures of service delivery. Hence this study employs the subjective evaluations of more than 3,000 black citizens embedded in over 52 municipalities and 53 school districts that reflect substantial variation in terms of demographics, political structures, and levels of black representation in key elective public offices.         "
"12","The empirical analysis comprising the core of this study is based on a dataset constructed from multiple sources. Individual‐level data are drawn from the Multi‐City Study of Urban Inequality (MCSUI), which surveyed respondents in the Los Angeles, Detroit, Boston, and Atlanta metropolitan areas between 1992 and 1994 (Bobo et al. 1998).5 Sample households were drawn using a multistage stratified, clustered area‐probability design. For each metropolitan area, the sample includes a large number of minority and low‐income households, allowing for meaningful analyses of black constituencies.6 The MCSUI survey proves especially useful because it not only tapped respondents' perceptions of neighborhood conditions and services, but also linked respondents to census block groups, thereby allowing us to match individual‐level characteristics and behaviors with data on the economic, racial, and demographic characteristics of respondents' neighborhoods. We supplemented these individual‐ and neighborhood‐level data with information about local governing and electoral arrangements as well as the number of black elected officials in the 52 (53) incorporated municipalities (school districts) where black respondents resided, and for our last set of analyses, the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) data.7"
"13","Given this study's empirical focus on black residents' assessments of both neighborhood problems and conditions, and the quality of local public services in their neighborhoods, appropriate measures are employed that capture these assessments. The first, Neighborhood Conditions, is an index that taps respondents' perceptions about the frequency of problems with city services, crime and vandalism, and the general upkeep of the neighborhood. This additive index was rescaled to range in value from 0 to 100 such that low values correspond to perceptions of more problems while high values correspond to perceptions of fewer problems.8 Two ordinal variables are also utilized in the analyses, and are crafted from survey questions that asked respondents to rate the quality of police protection (Police Quality) and the public schools (School Quality) in their neighborhood.9"
"14","To empirically assess the attitudinal effects of black electoral representation, the models include measures of black office holding in local executive and legislative positions. Specifically, Black Mayor is a dummy variable that identifies whether the local government is led by a black mayor during the survey period (1 = yes), and Percent Black Council and Percent Black School Board tap the percentage of blacks serving on the local council or the school board, respectively.10 A statistically significant and positive coefficient on these black office‐holding variables will underscore the argument that black representation in local government has a favorable effect on blacks' assessments of the quality of conditions and services in their neighborhoods. Are these attitudes, however, driven by policy and service responsiveness? The present study answers this question by focusing on (1) whether officials have the capacity to affect change in policy or services in the particular area in question; (2) the number of years the city has had a black mayor in office; and (3) objective indicators of policing and the extent to which they influence resident evaluations of the quality of police protection and potentially wash out the effects of black mayoral leadership.         "
"15","The specific position held by black elected officials (executive versus legislative) should differentially influence blacks' attitudes about neighborhood conditions and services because each office is associated with different responsibilities, functions, and powers.11 Based on the different roles and lines of authority of legislative and executive offices in local politics, we expect (1) the presence of a black mayor to have a positive effect on all three attitudinal indicators; (2) black council representation to have a positive effect only on blacks' assessments of the quality of neighborhood conditions; and (3) black school board representation to have a positive effect only on blacks' assessments of the quality of the local schools. To fully explore (2) and (3) we test not only for these effects, but for the null effects as well: the relationship between black council and school board representation and blacks' assessments of police protection.         "
"16","This study also investigates the impact of varying degrees of black representation in the legislative body—council or school board—on attitudinal effects. Consistent with Browning and colleague's (1984) theory of minority incorporation, the effect of black legislative representation is expected to be strongest when blacks either constitute a majority in city hall or are part of the dominant governing coalition within the legislative body because under these conditions the capacity of black officials to act is greatest. However, this effect is not necessarily linear: Recent studies indicate the prevalence of a nonlinear relationship between minority representation levels and the concomitant outcomes (Meier 1993; but see also Nielsen and Wolf 2001). Meier (1993), for example, suggests that the nonlinear relationship between minority school administrators and student performance he documents indicates that a critical mass of minorities is necessary for the effects of representative bureaucracies to be discerned. Hence this proposition is tested via inclusion of a polynomial term for percent black on the council/school board in relevant models.         "
"17","An alternative strategy takes into account the fact that newly elected black mayors have had considerably less time in office to affect substantive changes in policy processes and outcomes. Consequently, potential increases in satisfaction associated with these mayors may stem largely from symbolic responsiveness. On the other hand, over time and in light of the heightened expectations that accompany the election of especially first‐time black mayors (Bobo and Gilliam 1990; Tate 2003), these symbolic effects should fade. Therefore if longer histories of black mayoral leadership in the city positively influence blacks' assessments of neighborhood conditions and city services, this provides indirect evidence that these positive attitudes are rooted in substantive changes in the level or quality of policy or service outcomes. To test this possibility, in relevant models the Black Mayor dummy variable is replaced with a Years in Office variable that counts the number of years the city had a black mayor over the 10 years prior to the survey period.12"
"18","A third and final modeling strategy employed in this study focuses on one area of service delivery, policing, and residents' attitudes about the quality of police protection in their neighborhood. These models investigate how objective measures of policing shape blacks' evaluations in the attempt to more fully operationalize and test the link between descriptive and substantive representation. The LEMAS data (U.S. Dept. of Justice 1991, 1993) generates a variable that measures the Percent Change in Black Police Officers on the city's force between 1991 and 1993 to get at both the extent to which black representation has increased, decreased, or remained stable over the short term and tap the representative‐constituency relationship emphasized by Canon (1999) and Fenno (2003).13 Both this covariate and another—Percent Service Requests Responded to—are included in the models as measures of service responsiveness.14 Since mayors typically appoint the police chief, implement police review boards, and set basic personnel policy (Kuo 1973; Nelson 1987), the effects of these objective measures are modeled in conjunction with the effects of black mayoral leadership (Black Mayor and Years in Office), both additively and multiplicatively.15 Whereas including both sets of measures allows for a direct test of whether black descriptive representation affects blacks' evaluations of police quality even after controlling for objective measures of policing, the multiplicative terms enable tests of whether the effects of these policing measures are conditional on the presence of black mayoral leadership.         "
"19"," Table 1 provides details on the location and characteristics of the black mayor cities in the sample by metropolitan area, as well as descriptive statistics for measures of black representation and policing.16Table 1 also reports comparable summary statistics for nonblack mayor cities.         "
"20","In addition to the presence of black elected officials, both neighborhood‐level factors and the broader political and institutional context wherein service delivery occurs are likely to play an important role in determining not only distributional patterns but also levels of citizen satisfaction. The models analyzed in this study thus attempt to capture these diverse contextual effects."
"21"," Institutional Arrangements control for both the capacity of local elected officials to act and the incentives they face to be responsive to district rather than citywide constituents. To measure governing and electoral arrangements of the local jurisdiction, a dummy variable reflects whether the locality operates under a Mayor‐Council form of government (1 = yes). Mayor‐council governance is more likely than other forms of government to give minority mayors the necessary discretionary power (Mladenka 1989; Zhao, Herbst, and Lovrich 2001) since mayors in these cities have considerable authority to make policy, personnel, and administrative decisions (Svara 1999).         "
"22","Additional dummy variables are employed to tap the dynamics of electoral systems. Specifically, District Elections identifies jurisdictions employing pure district systems (1 = yes) and Mixed Elections identifies localities relying on a combination of at‐large and district elections (1 = yes).17 Extant research has found that district electoral systems not only significantly increase the likelihood that minorities are elected to local office (Engstrom and McDonald 1982; Welch 1990, 1061–64; 1972), but also tend to promote a neighborhood‐based approach to municipal problem solving (Heilig and Mundt 1984; Welch and Bledsoe 1988). In our school board model, we include only the District Elections dummy since only one school district employed a mixed electoral system.18"
"23","Finally, to capture perhaps the broadest effects of institutional arrangements, a dummy variable—Central City—is employed to control for well‐documented differences in both the demand for public services and the fiscal resources available to cities versus suburbs (Peterson 1981). Central City indicates whether the respondent lives in one of the four central cities, Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, or Los Angeles (1 = yes) as opposed to a suburban municipality. The newer infrastructure and superior tax‐base of the suburbs may lead to better service quality and hence, better evaluations on average, of services as well. In addition, to control for the possibility that measures of black mayoral leadership tap other metropolitan area effects, a set of three metropolitan area markers are included in the models as well (Los Angeles is the excluded category).         "
"24"," Neighborhood Characteristics are measured via 1990 Census of Population and Housing block‐group level data.19Median Age of Housing Structures (measured in years) and Median Household Income (in thousands of dollars) tap the socioeconomic characteristics of the neighborhood and thus serve as important controls for both general neighborhood conditions and the quality of the local services. Because African Americans' socioeconomic environs are known to affect their attitudes, another covariate measures whether the block group is Majority Black (1 = yes). Racial consciousness, for example, is likely to be more (less) salient when lower‐status blacks are embedded in higher (lower) socioeconomic status neighborhoods (Gay 2004; Tate 2003). Further, lower SES communities are less likely to sustain the social institutions known to foster racial group consciousness (Gay 2004). Finally, the School Quality models include the natural logarithm of the Total Number of Students in the district.         "
"25"," Individual Demographics control for such respondent‐specific attributes as Length of Residence in the neighborhood, Education (in years), a set of dummy variables for whether the respondent is either Married or living together with a partner (1 = yes), currently Employed (1 = yes), a Homeowner (1 = yes), and a variable measuring the number of Children under 18 years of age living in the respondent's household. Much of the extant research finds that local stakeholders (residents of higher socioeconomic status, longer lengths of residency, employment, homeownership, and children under 18 years of age in the household) contact government more frequently than other residents. This higher propensity for contacting may also lead to the receipt of better services and thus higher levels of service satisfaction (Serra 1995). Inasmuch as they can, modeled respondent‐specific attributes thus control for this potentiality.         "
"26","Because the respondents in the MCSUI were sampled through a multistage stratified, clustered area‐probability design, the models are estimated via established routines for regression analysis that take the clustering of individuals within neighborhoods into account.20 Failure to account for sampling weights is known to generate inefficient variance estimates that, in turn, undermine the reliability of hypothesis tests.21 In addition, the high correlation between black office holding across executive and legislative offices prevents their joint inclusion in a single model. Therefore separate models are estimated for these two sets of offices.22 Finally, the substantial overlap between electoral arrangements and form of government forces the inclusion of only the most appropriate structural measure in each model (i.e., the form of government in the Mayor models and electoral arrangements in the Council and School Board models). We begin with a discussion of our results from the Legislative Representation models.         "
"27","The Legislative Representation models of Table 2 indicate that within the domain of appropriate jurisdictional authority, the presence of black council and school board members is positively associated with blacks' evaluations of neighborhood conditions and school quality. More specifically, the results in the first two columns of Table 2 show that while the percentage of blacks on the city council has a significant effect on blacks' rating of neighborhood conditions, this variable is unrelated to blacks' evaluations of the quality of police protection. Similarly, the second two columns indicate that the percentage of blacks serving on the local school board has a significant effect on the probability that blacks rate their schools more positively, but does not affect blacks' assessments about the quality of policing in their neighborhood.23 The overall pattern is consistent with the notion that the representative in question must have at least some capacity to act in ways that can reasonably influence the policy or service outcomes that underlie the attitudes in question (Eisinger 1982, 387; Saltzstein 1989). The findings of Table 2 thus reveal that the presence of black school board members and city councilors has a significant and positive effect on the attitudes most closely linked to the services over which they have jurisdiction, schools and neighborhood conditions respectively, but do not affect attitudes associated with services over which they have little or no jurisdiction—policing. Blacks' evaluations, then, appear to be anything but ad hoc.         "
"28","The polynomial term surrounding Percent Black is designed to shed light on the critical mass argument regarding the effects of black legislative representation. Note that although these effects were anticipated in two of the models (A and C), the polynomial term for percent black on the school board was nonsignificant and therefore dropped from additional consideration in the model.24 There is, however, a statistically significant effect in Model A, and the estimate suggests that, ceteris paribus, peak satisfaction obtains when blacks represent about 36% of the council.25 In other words, we observe increasing effects of black representation on satisfaction up to the critical mass (36%) and then diminishing marginal returns thereafter.26"
"29","The second set of models (see Table 3) also collectively investigate the effects of black executive representation, albeit both contemporaneous effects via the Black Mayor dummy variable (Column A) as well as short‐term historical effects via the Years in Office variable (Column B). The latter specification tests whether the number of years the city has had a black mayor in office potentially attenuates blacks' positive evaluations of neighborhood conditions and service quality (because symbolic effects are likely to fade over time). On the other hand, if these effects remain positive and significant, there is indirect evidence that blacks' elevated expectations about what black mayors can do for them have been met with improvements in policy and service outcomes in order to satisfy and appease core constituents.         "
"30","The results in Table 3 further suggest that black executive leadership shapes black residents' appraisal of the quality of neighborhood conditions and public services. In each of the three models, the positive, statistically significant coefficient on Black Mayor indicates that the presence of a black mayor is associated with lower levels (and frequencies) of neighborhood problems and higher levels of satisfaction with the quality of both police protection and local public schools. In the Neighborhood Conditions model the effect translates into a 3.5 percentage point increase in the rating scale, holding all other variables at their mean/mode. The results of the Police and School Quality models indicate that blacks living in cities governed by black mayors are 10 and 14 percentage points more likely to rate police and schools as good or excellent, respectively, than are blacks living in cities without black mayors.         "
"31","Turning to the effects of black mayoral tenure in office, the estimates of two of the three models emphasize that in cities where black mayors had longer tenures (over the previous 10 years), black residents rated the conditions of their neighborhoods more favorably and evaluated the quality of policing in their neighborhood more positively. Interestingly, however, the effects on blacks' assessment of school quality disappear in these models, suggesting that the positive association between incumbent black mayors and blacks' assessments of school quality might be largely symbolic. However, the positive mayoral effects visible in the neighborhood conditions and police protection models highlight that black executives have been more than symbolic leaders in these areas and most likely have conferred tangible service improvements for their black constituents."
"32","The third and final approach focuses on a particular area—policing—and introduces objective measures into the specifications in an attempt to test most directly whether attitudinal effects associated with black descriptive representation are indeed rooted in substantive policy and service outcomes. In particular, including measures of the percent change in blacks on the city's police force and the percentage of service requests the police department responded to provides substantial leverage in demonstrating that attitudinal effects are based at least in part on residents' satisfaction with policy and service delivery rather than strictly the result of psychic benefits that ensue from black political incorporation. Table 4 encapsulates the estimates of two sets of models: one with each of the two measures of black mayoral representation, with and without the metropolitan area dummies.27"
"33","The estimates from these models indicate that even after including objective measures of policing, black mayoral leadership continues to positively affect blacks' evaluations of the quality of policing in their neighborhoods. This holds regardless of which measure of black mayoral representation is employed or whether controls for metropolitan area are introduced into the specification or not. With regard to the effects of the policing variables, six of the eight coefficients are positive and either statistically significant (in three cases) or approaching statistical significance (three cases). Since altering patterns of personnel recruitment and police responsiveness take time, the models with the years in office measures (Columns B and D) ought to provide more convincing evidence of substantive benefits flowing from black representation. Model B, in particular, indicates that the probability of eliciting a positive evaluation is higher with increases in police responsiveness and the proportion of blacks on the police force regardless of a history (or none) of black mayoral leadership in the jurisdiction. Moreover, though these effects are not conditional upon black mayoral tenures, as Figures 1 and 2 show, the probability that respondents rate their local police as good or excellent is higher in cities where black mayors have governed for longer periods and where the police force is more responsive or has witnessed larger increases in black representation.28 Moreover, the baseline odds of observing “Poor” as the response when black mayors had been in office for nine of the 10 years prior to the survey (indicated by Black Mayor in Figure 1) are almost one‐half those of similarly situated blacks albeit in a jurisdiction with no black mayor occupying office in the preceding 10 years.         "

"35"," Source: Model B in Table 4. Note: No Black Mayor reflects a jurisdiction with no black mayors in office in the preceding 10 years; Black Mayor reflects a jurisdiction with a black mayor in office for nine of the preceding 10 years.                     "

"38","Although the results reported in Table 4 largely support the central hypothesis of this study—that the attitudinal effects of black descriptive representation are at least partially driven by substantive police policy—the estimates from Models C and D cast some doubt on this notion. Note, however, that the standard errors in both of these cases are extremely large and most likely related at least in part to the higher degree of collinearity resulting from the inclusion of the metropolitan area dummies (r >0.4 for Percent Service Requests Responded to and each of the metro dummies). Of course, it is possible that the relatively fresh memory of the Los Angeles riots in 1992 and the furor after Malice Green's death in Detroit (November 5, 1992) are also contaminating evaluations of metro residents.         "
"39","In addition to these particularized results, the sum of the results of Tables 2, 3, and 4 highlight more general patterns in the data. First, objective correlates of neighborhood conditions are consistently found to influence blacks' assessments. Specifically, blacks in neighborhoods with older housing stocks report more problems and lower levels of satisfaction, while those in higher income neighborhoods report fewer problems and more satisfaction. Similarly, residence in central cities is, for the most part, associated with less favorable evaluations. On the other hand, and surprisingly at that, mayor‐council governments and electoral systems exert little influence. Finally, individual‐level covariates appear to have minimal effects, perhaps because of limited variance in the SES indicators given our focus on black respondents.         "
"40","In short, overall the findings indicate that the attitudinal dimensions of blacks' evaluations of the quality of their neighborhoods, public schools, and police forces reflect both substantive and symbolic dimensions. In particular, black satisfaction is higher in the presence of black leadership in the executive's chambers, in the legislature, and on school boards than when such representation is absent. Moreover, because these positive outcomes are discerned only when black leadership has authority over the policy area in question (e.g., school boards in the domain of schools) and over longer periods of black mayoral governance, the results underscore substantive rather than purely symbolic effects."
"41","The value and dynamics of minority incorporation in local politics have fascinated students of racial and ethnic politics for several decades. While thus far scholars have attempted to determine whether minority gains in elected office lead to increased minority presence in the workforce and minority business development, or to more equitable policy and service delivery outputs, there exists precious little research on the attitudinal dimension of minority political incorporation (but see Abney and Hutcheson 1981; Bobo and Gilliam 1990; Gilliam 1996; Hajnal 2001; Jackson 1987). Certainly, the question of whether symbolic versus substantive representation leads black citizens to respond favorably to black elected leadership has remained unexplored thus far. Thus by focusing on blacks' evaluations of neighborhood services and conditions under black elected leadership in executive, legislative, and administrative offices under varying socioeconomic and policy conditions, this study breaks new ground in a number of important ways.         "
"42","First, acknowledging that symbolic representation is critical for the political health of traditionally repressed groups (see also Phillips 1995; Tate 2003; Williams 1998), this study demonstrates that blacks' evaluations of their neighborhoods, schools, and police are not devoid of tangible improvements in policy or service. Specifically, the findings discussed in the preceding pages reveal that black residents evaluate the quality of their neighborhoods, their police services, and their schools more favorably when they are represented by black mayors, and that the black representation on city councils and school boards is positively related to residents' evaluations of their neighborhood conditions and schools, respectively. However, this study also suggests that substantive police policies, specifically increases in the proportion of blacks on the force and higher levels of police responsiveness, are positively related to evaluations of the quality of policing. Finally, the additive effects of substantive police policy and longer black mayoral tenures yield the most favorable evaluations of police quality, ceteris paribus.         "
"43","Given recent evidence showing that performance now rivals race when it comes to evaluating black mayors' performance while in office (Howell and Perry 2004; Stein, Ulbig, and Post 2004), this latter finding may not be altogether surprising. However, the present study demonstrates this confluence of representational and policy effects more systematically than perhaps has been the case thus far. This study also has important ramifications for conventional wisdom regarding minorities' expectations of their leaders and these leaders' ability to meet these demands. Gilliam and Kaufman (1998, 743), for instance, indicate that symbolic benefits may come bundled with enhanced expectations of policy responsiveness from black administrations. The danger inherent in lofty expectations may explain the failure of black political leaders to meet these expectations, a shortfall often referred to as the “hollow hope” (see, e.g., Kraus and Swanstrom 2001).         "
"44","Yet, the preceding set of results highlight that hope is anything but hollow: Not only do black elected officials appear to be responding to the representational onus placed on their shoulders by the virtue of achieving office, but they also do so with markedly positive consequences for the blacks they represent. In this regard, the present study finds support for Eisinger's (1982) decades‐old claim that municipal government in America is anything but a merely symbolic prize for minority groups to capture. Indeed, at least in the case of minority incorporation in local government, the symbol of black representation rings loud and clear with substantive benefits for a traditionally dispossessed group, and perhaps most important of all, black constituencies do respond to the efforts of their leaders. Moreover, these results highlight a hitherto unappreciated quality of black leadership. Specifically, the models show that under meaningful black political leadership, factors such as the police responsiveness and especially changes in the racial composition of the police force increase in salience when respondents assess the quality of policing in their neighborhoods.         "
"45","Race is, then, of tremendous consequence for local politics and policy. Race matters largely because blacks are more likely to reside in jurisdictions that are lower in socioeconomic status and less likely to provide the resources necessary for social progress and political engagement (Gay 2004). Although there is no easy remedy for this lopsided residential distribution of blacks, the findings of this research offer avenues of hope for black political incorporation. In particular, this research demonstrates that not only is there tremendous symbolic value in advancing the cause of black representation in local elected offices because doing so enhances blacks' satisfaction with (and potentially engagement in) politics, but also that black elected officials can, when empowered with policy responsibility, improve the quality of local services in ways that matter to local constituencies. If black political leaders recognize that their constituents will judge them both on the racial composition of the relevant policy workforce and on measurable indicators of service quality, this ought to motivate black leaders to move beyond symbolic politics to focus on substantive improvement efforts. If substantive improvements cannot occur without empowering black representatives by suitably modifying local governing arrangements, so be it. Black representation will then be the valuable substantive symbol it has long sought to be.         "
