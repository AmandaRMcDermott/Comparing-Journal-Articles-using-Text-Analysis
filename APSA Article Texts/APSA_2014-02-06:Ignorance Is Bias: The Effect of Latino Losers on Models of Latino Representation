"1","There has been a concerted effort among political scientists to test for descriptive legislative representation effects for blacks, and to a lesser extent Latinos (Cameron, Epstein, and O'Halloran 1996; Canon 1999; Engstrom and McDonald 1981; Epstein and O'Halloran 2006; Karnig 1976; Karnig and Welch 1982; Lublin 1997, 1999; Meier et al. 2005; Robinson and Dye 1978; Sass 2000; Welch 1990). There has also been a long tradition of attention to electoral structures and vote dilution, as well as their effects on the minority vote (Adams 2000; Behr 2004; Davidson 1989; Davidson and Grofman 1994; Grofman and Davidson 1992; Grofman, Handley, and Niemi 1994; Key 1984). The overwhelming conclusion from this well‐established research is that the size of the minority vote (or population) is the single biggest driver of minority descriptive representation in the United States. Canon's assessment of the descriptive research in the 1980s and 1990s similarly places the weight of African American representation on the shoulders of black and white voters (Canon 1999, 54). Empirically, electoral institutions often affect levels of descriptive representation, but voter race/ethnicity is nonetheless dominant in every study that focuses on this phenomenon.2"
"2","Casellas (2011) updates this research by investigating the presence of Latino officeholders in low Latino districts and explores the reasons for their success. His combined qualitative and quantitative approach is one of the most thorough studies of Latino elites, but he (admittedly) can only focus on Latino officeholders, not losing Latino candidates (2011, 79). The focused small‐N approach suggests a variety of individual candidate and party‐level factors that might explain the success of these unique representatives, but it also reinforces the idea that these officeholders succeeded largely despite majority white voters in their districts (2011, 76–105).         "
"3","The difficulty with the inferences drawn from population‐seats evidence is that the models are ignorant of the losers on the ballot. Without looking at the supply of minority candidates, it is unclear whether descriptive representation bias happens prior to the election or on Election Day itself. A common approach to looking at minority descriptive representation comes from a study by Epstein and O'Halloran (2006). They find many of the same population‐seats patterns for blacks and Latinos as have been uncovered by work elsewhere (see also Lublin et al. 2009). Like almost all other representation scholars, Epstein and O'Halloran are forced to code the race/ethnicity of the “winning candidate” only (2006, 65). Coding the officeholder or winning candidate is a perfectly reasonable empirical strategy if no other election information is accessible, as is almost always the case in large‐N studies of descriptive representation.3 The problem is that this common practice disregards first‐stage selection bias.         "
"4","The population‐seats empirical work finds much of its theoretical support from research done at the individual level of analysis. Most recently, this evidence has been generated through the use of experiments (Kam 2007; McConnaughy et al. 2010; Sigelman et al. 1995; Terkildsen 1993). The effects of white prejudice toward Latino candidates is mixed, however, and depends on the presence of partisan cues (Kam 2007; Sigelman et al. 1995). That is, most studies find that many voters (both white and nonwhite) hold co‐ethnic preferences, but these preferences are unstable when partisan and other information cues are available to subjects (Kam 2007). Citrin, Green, and Sears theorize that pure racist voting (voting against a candidate because of his or her race/ethnicity) is the wrong way to understand how prejudice affects vote choice (1990, 75–79). However, these theoretical specifics are often brushed aside in light of the overwhelming empirical evidence of representational bias from the aggregate population‐seats research. Yet early racial bias scholars warned against extrapolating experimental evidence to explain electoral outcomes (Sigelman et al. 1995, 259–60). The approach here takes this caveat seriously.         "
"5","While the objective here is not a strict analysis of minority candidate emergence, it is important to briefly review why minority voters correlate with the presence of a minority candidate on the ballot.4 Few large‐N studies examine minority candidates at all, but those that have tend to focus on individual characteristics (Stone 1980; Stone and Maisel 1997). Krebs (1999) looks at black candidates in Chicago's City Council wards over time, finding a relationship between the presence of more experienced candidates and open seats, as well as black population effects. In a separate study, Krebs (1998) finds that party support, incumbency, and campaign spending play important roles in the minority representation process. Fox and Lawless (2004, 2005) observe individual qualities like politicized upbringing, ideological motivations, competitive traits, and occupation to develop a more complete understanding of why some people run for office and others do not. They find that blacks of equal qualifications to other potential candidates are less likely to consider running for office, all else equal (they find the same for females, but not Latinos; Fox and Lawless 2005). Thus, there are a variety of “individual‐resource” reasons to expect fewer minority candidates than white candidates at the state legislative level. U.S. history has not favored minority candidates or officeholders, and thus the political experience (in particular, incumbency), networks, and organizational capacities that come with holding elective office have not been passed on to minority individuals and groups relative to their white counterparts.            "
"6","The political context also incentivizes strategic minority candidates to run in elections where they can put their limited resources to more efficient and effective use. One of these environments is when minority voters are concentrated into districts where they achieve influence status for a particular seat (Canon, Schousen, and Sellers 1996; Johnson, Oppenheimer, and Selin 2012). Canon, Schousen, and Sellers show that African American elites were deeply involved in the battle over the creation of new majority‐minority districts in North Carolina, in part because of the consequent substantive effects, but also because of the potential effects for latent black candidates (Canon 1999, 116–18). Their elite interviews show that candidates preferred black majority districts because of the electoral opportunity they promised (117).            "
"7","Candidate strategy prior to the election is thus partly responsible for the dearth of minority choices outside of minority‐populated districts. Branton (2008) finds a significant relationship between minority population and minority primary candidates, and the results are stable across both Republican and Democratic primaries (Branton 2008, 463–70). It is clear from this and other research (Canon, Schousen, and Sellers 1996; Krebs 1999) that for a variety of reasons, candidates and parties are making strategic decisions before the general election about their chances of winning in white districts, and they typically decide not to risk it. Often, these are tactical decisions made by elites who are slotting opportunities to a team of associates (Canon, Schousen, and Sellers 1996). Casellas's work on Latino officeholders supports the idea that party elites play a significant role in the emergence of Latino candidates in Latino minority districts, reinforcing recruitment and support as the drivers of opportunity (2011, 89–90; Leighley 2001). Thus, candidate/party predictions about the racial/ethnic outcomes of a general election, whether they are correct or not, are constraining the choices given to voters.            "
"8","Consequently, we want to systematically assess whether including observations where Latinos are not present on the ballot (the “naïve” model) biases the population‐seats relationship. An empirical linkage between the emergence and minority representation research has not yet been made in the literature, but the following explicit expectations allow us to do that here.               "
"9","The election data come from a variety of sources. The candidate data for the 2000 state legislative general races are from Carsey and colleagues’ (2008) “State Legislative Election Returns, 1967–2003.” These data contain the name, party, vote totals, election characteristics, and other pertinent information for nearly every single candidate running for state legislative office in the United States in 2000 (N = 4,881). I start by using the U.S. Census Bureau's Spanish surname list (U.S. Census Bureau 2000) to code the Latino ethnicity of each candidate using computer matching. I then use multiple sources to verify Latino identities using elite self‐identification from the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO 2001, 2010a, 2010b), candidate websites, and other Internet sources. A surname match on its own has been shown to be 90% accurate (Word and Perkins 1996). The additional use of elite self‐identification methods further reduces the number of false positives and false negatives.5 This procedure matches much of the experimental work on Latino candidates and voter “affect,” which involves the specific use of Latino surnames as the experimental condition (Kam 2007; McConnaughy et al. 2010). Self‐identification is also the method used in officeholder models.         "
"10","I supplement the candidate data with demographic and socioeconomic district information from the Almanac of State Legislatures (Lilley, Defranco, and Bernstein 1999).6 The demographic information includes measures of the racial and ethnic populations in the districts (i.e., percent white, black, Latino, and Asian), the district unemployment rate, education level (percentage over age 25 with “some college”), income (average household income), and a measure of Republican voting strength in the district.7 These variables serve as controls for the Latino emergence and Latino election models. Descriptive statistics can be found in the supplemental information (Table SI 2).         "
"11","The individual‐level candidate data are aggregated to the level of the election in order to capture the overall effects of context on the pool of candidates. While there is reluctance to give up information in moving from a lower level of analysis to a higher one, the aggregate approach is the most theoretically and empirically appropriate here. The question of an individual's ethnicity (the probability of a given candidate being Latino) and the question of the ethnicity in the overall candidate pool are similar, but the latter is more of a function of system‐level variables (information we have) rather than individual‐level variables (information we do not have). It is possible that future examination of the data would involve a multilevel modeling of individual‐ and system‐level factors, but this awaits the discovery of other sources of (candidate‐level) information. In short, unlike some of the very creative and unique candidate emergence data sets used in previous work (Branton 2008; Fox and Lawless 2004, 2005; Stone and Maisel 1997, 2003), candidate‐level measures of candidate quality, personal or occupational characteristics, or socioeconomic status, which would allow for a multilevel modeling approach, do not yet exist. The trade‐off here is ignorance of candidate‐level variation (aside from race/ethnicity, party, and incumbency) for breadth of contextual variation (information about the district population and the election itself). It is important to reiterate that the main interest here is to condition the naïve population‐seats model based on whether a Latino is actually on the ballot, rather than modeling individual candidate emergence for its own sake. The former can be done with these data but not the latter.         "
"12","To account for the first stage of representation, I estimate a probit regression model of Latino candidate supply. There are a number of ways to model the broader emergence/election process, but none are demonstratively better than the sequential probit used here.8 In this first step, I model the aggregate outcomes of choices made by candidates, parties, and primary voters to be present on the ballot. This will assess the relationship between the size of the Latino population in the district and Latino candidate supply (Hypothesis 1). In subsequent sections, I estimate corrected and conditional models of population‐seats during the election (Hypothesis 2).            "
"13","The tabular results for the first stage (Latino emergence) are in the SI. The details are relegated to the SI in order to reiterate that this stage is not the primary focus of the analysis. Instead, I display the main effects in Figure 1. Latino population is positively and significantly associated with a Latino candidate being on the ballot. A few other contextual factors influence this decision, but it is clear that Latino district population drives Latino candidate emergence. This is clear from both the tabular results, where the marginal effects for Latino population dwarf those of any other variable, and from the predicted probabilities plotted in Figure 1.9 The comparison to the population‐seats relationship in Figure SI 1 is notable. Latino candidates are choosing to run for office for a variety of reasons, but the clearest contextual driver for these decisions is the percentage of Latino voters in the district. Conversely, Latino candidates are rarely on ballots in low Latino population districts, holding all other relevant political factors constant.            "
"14","Having modeled the first step of the population‐seats relationship, I move to the election stage. The question here is to what extent the absence of Latino candidates on the ballot affects the venerable population‐seats relationship. Table 1 presents results of four probit regression models of whether the election winner is Latino (1) or not (0). Column 1 displays the Latino population model on its own. This model is ignorant about whether a Latino is on the ballot, and it corresponds with traditional population‐seats models. Latino district population is significant, positive, and drives the findings in this naïve model. The controls work as expected but are overwhelmed by the population effects. Of note is the negative and significant black population coefficient, a finding that would almost certainly be interpreted as black voters being less likely than whites to support Latino candidates, or more precisely as further evidence of a black‐brown divide (Vaca 2004). In Figure 2, I display the independent effects of the naïve Latino population model from column 1 to make this point clearer. Its similarity to the Latino supply model in Figure 1 is notable. It is the first indication that what the naïve population model ascribes to voters may instead be related to candidate decisions to run.            "
"15","To test whether the population‐seats relationship remains strong after accounting for candidate selection, I estimate three election models that control for, or are censored by, Latino candidate supply. The results in the second column of Table 1 substitute a measure of the percentage of Latino candidates on the ballot (candidate “supply”) for Latino district population (voter “demand”). This censoring variable dominates the model, improves the explanatory power of the regression considerably, and on its own explains almost all of the variation in Latino winners (in results not displayed, the pseudo‐R2 using only this variable is .83). This makes sense. When this variable has a value of 0, there is no chance for a Latino to win the election. When it is 100%, there is certainty about the ethnic outcome of the race. This is an obvious point, but one that is ignored in previous large‐N empirical work.            "
"16","The last two columns in Table 2 present two variations of this censored approach, and the evidence is the same; the supply of Latino candidates substantially moderates the population‐seats relationship. In column 3, both the candidate supply and Latino population demand variables are included simultaneously. As the percentage of Latino candidates on the ballot increases, the probability of a Latino winner increases substantially. After controlling for this censoring variable, however, Latino population increases matter much less in regard to whether a Latino wins the race.            "
"17","To see how much bias may be present in the naïve model, I estimate the exact same population model from column 1 while excluding elections where a Latino candidate was not on the ballot. The results are displayed in column 4. Latino district population is still correlated with Latino winners, but not nearly as much as the population‐seats research suggests, and it is overwhelmed by the conditional effects of Latino candidate supply."
"18","It is inappropriate to directly compare the coefficients from column 1 and column 4, as they describe two different samples. Thus, the conditional population effects (column 4) are displayed in Figure 3, and two results are prominent. First, the predicted probabilities are much higher for Latino candidates in low Latino population districts than the population‐only model implies (compare to Figure 2). The best estimated range of predicted probabilities for success in Latino minority districts is between 20% and 80% Latino. More importantly, the 50% threshold for a Latino winner is crossed at 20% Latino population (the 95% confidence interval is between 10% and 30% Latino), substantially lower than in the naïve model. Second, Latino candidates do extremely well in districts that are more than 30% Latino population (70% likelihood of winning), most likely due to the partisan and ethnic makeup of these districts.10 Third, the uncertainty in this model is larger on the low end of the Latino population distribution (which is where most of the observations lie). In short, Latino candidates are expected to do fairly well in many districts in the sample, and the factors that determine how well these candidates perform on Election Day have much more to do with Latino candidate supply than with white voter demand.            "
"19","These supply‐censored models are an important step in finding out what happens when Latino candidates run outside of Latino majority districts. They do very well."
"20","To further evaluate the difference between a naïve population model and the conditional approach endorsed here, I investigate how well they do in predicting out‐of‐sample election results. I use a sample of elections in 2010 (N = 5,052), incorporating candidate and election data from Klarner et al. (2012), and the U.S. Census (2010) for district demographic controls.11 The coefficients from the naïve population model (Table 1, column 1) and the conditional model (Table 1, column 4) are compared in their ability to make predictions about the 2010 elections.            "
"21","The differences between the two approaches are stark. Spike plots that are modified from “separation plots” (Greenhill, Ward, and Sacks 2011) are presented in Figure 4. Like separation plots, these figures can more easily transmit goodness‐of‐fit information when compared to PRE, ROC, and other diagnostic tools. Actual Latino winners (the lines) are plotted against the prediction made by each model (the x‐axis). A perfect model will predict all of the Latino winners correctly and will display lines along the far right side of the figure. Conversely, more lines to the left of the figure indicate that Latinos are winning in districts where the model predicts little chance of victory. The naïve model's 2010 predictions are scattered, with a large spread of winners falling below 50% probability. Indeed, many of the actual winners in 2010 have less than a 5% chance of winning according to the naïve model. The conditional model is superb in comparison. Not only are most of the actual winners in 2010 predicted to be winners by the model (184 of 198 fall above 50% probability), but also they are concentrated at the high end of the probability scale. That is, most of the actual winners have above an 80% chance of winning according to the model.12 Knowing who is running clears up a large amount of uncertainty in models of ethnic representation.            "
"22","Modified Separation Plots of Out‐of‐Sample Predictions: Predicting Latino Winners in 2010"
"23","Note: These are modified “separation plots” (Greenhill, Ward, and Sacks 2011). The black lines represent actual Latino winners, and the x‐axis represents the predicted probabilities for these winners.                        "
"24","The results of the out‐of‐sample predictions favor the supply‐side hypotheses. Latino candidates could be quite successful outside of Latino majority districts if they were encouraged to run. To make the point clearer, cross‐tabulations of Latino candidates and election outcomes in both 2000 and 2010 are shown in Table 2. The win rate for Latino incumbents is 100% in 2000, and 95% in 2010. In contrast, Latino challengers do not do very well against non‐Latino incumbents (10% win rate). Neither of these outcomes is surprising, as all incumbents win about 95% of all races in the sample. What about open races with no incumbents? In both years, Latino candidates do very well in Latino majority areas, winning almost all of these races. In Latino minority elections, the results are not as robust, but not unfavorable either. In 2000, Latino candidates win about 33% of the open races in Latino minority districts, and in 2010 they win more than 50% of these open races.            "
"25","Looking at the actual elections in 2000, it is easy to see why many of these Latinos lost. They ran as the underdog partisans in partisan districts that just happened to have few Latino voters. For example, AnnaJane Arroyo ran as a Democrat in a very Republican state house district in Utah (District 13, 7% Latino) where Democrats average 33% of the vote (Snyder 2011). Arroyo received 30% of the vote. In Michigan's 87th District (2% Latino), Henry Sanchez ran as a Democrat even though the average vote share for Democrats in the past three elections for this seat was 32% (Carsey et al. 2008). Sanchez's vote share in 2000? It was 33%. James Auffant ran in Florida's 35th District (18% Latino), where Democrats garnered 40% of the vote in the previous election in 1996. Auffant lost with 45% of the vote. Of the 20 Latino “open” race losers in Latino minority districts in 2000, 14 were Democrats running in strong Republican districts, two were Republicans running in strong Democratic districts, and four were third‐party candidates with little chance of winning. By 2010, Latinos were winning more than 50% of these open races in Latino minority areas (Table 2).            "
"26","These examples reinforce the fact that Latinos rarely run in Latino minority districts, and when they do compete, the ethnic population of the district has little to do with the outcome of the race. Most of these candidates are running as Democrats in white Republican districts. In Figure SI 5 (in the SI), I demonstrate that in these low Latino districts, all Democrats have about a 35% win rate, all else equal. That is, in 2000, Latino losers in Latino minority districts are doing just about as well as other Democrats overall. This makes sense given how often Latino candidates run as Democrats (60% of the time versus 23% as Republicans). These districts will elect more Latinos if the parties recruit and support more competitive Latino candidates.            "
"27","The most important reason that Latino representation is low in state legislatures may not be because voters will not support them, but because Latino candidates are not showing up on the ballot in the general election. Representation scholars need to examine why this is the case (candidate emergence and supply) in a much more earnest fashion."
"28","Is there white and minority preference for co‐ethnic candidates? Yes—the literature (and popular polling) is clear that in many cases this favoritism exists. However, minority representation researchers assume that this real prejudice found in some individual races (and experimental settings) (a) is consistent across most electoral districts in the United States, (b) is so dominant that it overrides partisanship and incumbency in most legislative elections, and (c) consistently overwhelms electoral competitiveness. Given the empirical fact of a strong population‐seats relationship, these assumptions become inferences, and subsequently conclusions that have important policy consequences in the courts and state redistricting plans. The results here do not change the fact that minorities rarely hold office outside of heavily populated minority districts. They do force us to come up with a more rigorous understanding of why that is the case.         "
"29","The evidence here should convince researchers to do at least two things. First, minority representation scholars must be careful about the inferences they make based off of officeholder and election‐winner data—careful to the point of skepticism. Some of the current debate over voting rights has to do with estimating moments of equal voting opportunity and influence, and minority population tipping points in different electoral contexts. The degree of specificity with which we can trust this evidence is severely hampered by these findings."
"30","Second, linking emergence research with representation research must be the norm when possible. The lack of connection between these two research areas has been primarily a “lack of data” problem. The more information we have about the losers of elections and the choices voters are provided, the better our evidence and conclusions will be. Thus, the research concerning the parties’ roles in minority candidate recruitment should be better incorporated, theoretically and empirically, into the descriptive representation story. The officeholder evidence from past work is unaffected by the evidence presented here. What needs to change, and where this research breaks so acutely from the past, is the inferences we draw from it.         "
