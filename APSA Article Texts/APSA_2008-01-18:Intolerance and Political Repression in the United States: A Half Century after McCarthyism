"1","One of the most important ideas to emerge from the tolerance literature is the subtheory of pluralistic intolerance. According to Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus (1982), lack of consensus on who the enemy is—pluralistic intolerance—can neutralize even widespread intolerance (even if it does not necessarily do so, as for example, in the case of determined, intolerant elites). When everyone selects a different group as his or her most hated foe, the result may be that insufficient agreement exists for intolerance to be mobilized into political repression. When intolerance is pluralistic, it is dispersed and may therefore be relatively benign.         "
"2","The underlying assumption of the subtheory of pluralistic intolerance is that a united public will most likely succeed in getting what it wants; to the extent that people agree in identifying the predominant threat to a political system, their demands for political repression will ring loudly in the ears of their representatives. This simple “demand input” model—what people want they get—drives the subtheory of pluralistic intolerance. The theory strongly emphasizes the need to identify the factors contributing to the focusing and unfocusing of intolerance, for it is focused intolerance that can be dangerous and pernicious (see Sullivan et al. 1985).         "
"3","Unfortunately, little rigorous research at the system level (either over time or cross‐nationally) has investigated the subtheory of pluralistic intolerance. In their microlevel research on South Africa, Gibson and Gouws (2003) discovered that intolerance can be both focused and pluralistic, in the sense that many groups, of various ideological affinities, may not be tolerated by people. Gibson (1998), on the other hand, asserts that intolerance is focused on the far right wing in Russia. More research needs to be conducted to determine the “breadth” of tolerance in different societies—the range of ideas that people believe can be legitimately expressed in a society.         "
"4","One important limitation of the subtheory of pluralistic intolerance is that its primary (if not exclusive) focus is on repression brought about via public policy (the “demand input” model). Some research has found the linkage between ordinary citizens and policy makers to be weak or nonexistent (e.g., Gibson 1988), so even focused public intolerance may not always produce political repression. And perhaps even when the majority of people are not united in their intolerance, important political consequences may flow.         "
"5","An alternative pathway of influence is via cultural norms of conformity. Intolerance may constrain freedom not through government‐sponsored public policies but rather through norms discouraging disagreement and sanctioning opinions deviating very far from the mainstream. Tocqueville observed long ago that “I know of no country in which there is so little independence of mind and real freedom of discussion as in America” (1948, vol. 1, 263). In Noelle‐Neumann's “spiral of silence” people are encouraged “either to proclaim their views or to swallow them and keep quiet until, in a spiraling process, the one view dominated the public scene and the other disappeared from public awareness as its adherents became mute” (1984, 5). To the extent that unpopular views are sanctioned through interpersonal mechanisms, it may be unnecessary for a majority of the people to be intolerant of an idea. Moreover, the homogeneity of social networks may make it easy to identify those with aberrant views, entirely apart from the overall distribution of opinions within a country. As Mutz has noted: “If people are surrounded by people who think much like they do, they will be less aware of the legitimate arguments on the other side of contemporary political controversies … The capacity to see that there is more than one side to an issue, that a political conflict is, in fact, a legitimate controversy with rationales on both sides, translates to greater willingness to extend civil liberties to even those groups whose political views one dislikes a great deal” (2002, 122; emphasis in the original). The existence of a homogeneous social network can therefore exacerbate the consequences of intolerance, quite apart from any linkage to repressive public policy (see also Huckfeldt, Ikeda, and Pappi 2005).         "
"6","In general, the subtheory of pluralistic intolerance is largely silent about the cultural consequences of mass political intolerance. It is therefore important that research address the question of how free ordinary people feel to express their political views. Fortunately, Stouffer's survey specifically addressed this matter, so a useful comparative baseline from the McCarthy era is available."
"7","How does the contemporary period in the United States compare with the McCarthy era with regard to the political freedom available to ordinary citizens? There are many ways in which levels of political freedom might be measured, as, for instance, in studies of the degree of freedom proclaimed by statutes and constitutions. Following Stouffer and others (e.g., Gibson 1992a), my approach here is to conceptualize freedom as an individual‐level perception. From this viewpoint, the appropriate way to measure freedom is to ask individuals about the constraints they perceive on their ability to express their political views without repercussions from those around them or from the state.7"
"8","Stouffer began his inquiry into perceived liberty in 1954 by asking the respondents to estimate the degree to which others enjoyed political freedom.8 The Stouffer items were repeated on a national, face‐to‐face survey conducted in 1987 (see, for example, Gibson 1992a9). A comparison of those two earlier surveys with the contemporary data is reported in Table 1.10"
"9","The data in this table provide some evidence that freedom, or least the perception of freedom, has actually declined in the United States since the McCarthy era.11 The percentage of respondents asserting that all people feel free was 55.6 in 1954, about the same in 1987, but 13 percentage points lower in 2005. The change from 1954 to 2005 is statistically and substantively significant. The percentage responding that hardly anyone feels free has remained constant over the 50‐year period, indicating that the most important change has been the growth in 2005 in the proportion of the citizenry asserting the quite reasonable view that some do not feel as free to say what they think as they used to. By this accounting, freedom in the United States has clearly declined, even if not necessarily across‐the‐board, for all citizens.         "
"10","The respondents were also asked about whether they themselves feel free to speak their mind on political matters. The results are reported in the lower portion of Table 1.         "
"11","These data also support the conclusion that political freedom has diminished in the United States, although it must be noted that this is within the context of three‐fourths of the American people claiming to feel free. Moreover, these data are perhaps most interesting for what they reveal about the McCarthy era: At the height of the Red Scare, nearly 85% of the American people asserted that they enjoyed freedom of speech. Thus, the repression of that era seems to have been sharply focused on (or at least felt by) a relatively small political minority, and perhaps had relatively limited consequences for the larger body politic.12 Today, the percentage feeling generally free is about 10 percentage points lower than in 1954.         "
"12","In some sense, the data in these two tables are entirely consistent. Some people in the United States in fact do not feel free to speak their political minds—indeed, at least one‐fourth of the American people are in this category today. So when 45.7% of the sample reports that they perceive some Americans as not being free, they are accurate in their perceptions. Those who believe that all feel free, or those who believe that hardly anybody feels free, hold, according to these data, inaccurate perceptions."
"13","Of course, a simple dichotomy responding to a single question constitutes a poor measure of the extent of political freedom in the United States. We therefore asked several additional questions in 2005 about perceived constraints on individual freedom (questions that were also used in the 1987 survey but not in 1954). The replies to these queries are reported in Table 2.         "
"14","In 2005, substantial majorities of the American people believe that they would be allowed to engage in various types of political protest. Perhaps what is most surprising about these data, however, is the size of the minority believing the government restricts their political expression. Roughly four in 10 Americans, for instance, believe their government would not allow them to organize a public meeting to oppose the government. Only 52.0% of the respondents judge themselves free to engage in all three of these political activities (data not shown). This strikes me as a remarkably small percentage for an established democracy like the United States,13 especially in that the activities about which people were questioned are quite innocuous.14"
"15","Some perspective can be gotten by comparing these data to the comparable survey conducted in 1987 (see also Table 2). The data reveal remarkable similarity across the two periods, with a slight tendency for Americans in 2005 to perceive more freedom available to them than in 1987. For example, in 1987, 38.2% of the American people felt that they would not be allowed to organize a protest march; by 2005, this figure declined by 5 to 6 percentage points to 32.5%. Perhaps the small amount of change the data reveal is located, however, in a particular subsegment of the overall population.         "
"16","An analysis of the 1987 survey (Gibson 1992a) revealed enormous racial differences in perceptions of freedom. So as to be able to compare the 2005 and 1987 findings, Table 3 reports the data from the contemporary period broken down by the race of the respondent.15"
"17","The first observation to be made on the basis of Table 3 is that substantial racial differences still exist in perceived freedom in 2005. In each instance, African Americans perceive less freedom than whites, and the differences in percentages range roughly from 10 to 20%. The interracial contrasts are not as stark as they were in 1987, but they are still substantial.         "
"18","On all three activities, black Americans perceive more political freedom today than they did in 1987. For instance, on whether they think they would be allowed to organize public meetings, 63.7% said they would not in 1987; only 49.5% believe they could not in 2005. This finding of increasing freedom among blacks stands in contrast to whites, who generally changed remarkably little in perceptions of freedom from 1987 until 2005."
"19","Overall, this portion of the analysis supports the following conclusions:"
"20","                              "
"21","A substantial proportion of the American people today perceive political freedom to be available to them."
"22","However, this proportion has declined since the days of McCarthy, and a nontrivial proportion of the population perceives significant constraints on their individual freedom.                     "
"23","As in earlier findings from the 1980s, political freedom is strongly related to the race of the individual, with African Americans perceiving considerably less freedom than whites. The gap between blacks and whites has narrowed since 1987, but is still substantial. A remarkable percentage of African Americans does not feel free to express its political views in the contemporary United States."
"24","As noted in the introduction to this article, Stouffer found that in 1954 virtually all Americans supported depriving admitted Communists of at least some of their political and civil liberties. From this vantage point, intolerance today could not be more widespread than it was in the days of McCarthy. Nonetheless, it is essential to try to measure and assess contemporary levels of intolerance in the United States."
"25","How tolerant are the American people today? Unfortunately, answering this question is considerably more difficult in 2005 than it was in 1954. During the McCarthy era, the threat most Americans perceived came from the Left in general and from Communists in particular. The Americans had just concluded a war with the Communists in North Korea; the Cold War with the Soviet Union was heating up (with the very real possibility of nuclear confrontation); and the elites in the United States focused their intolerance on Communists and their “fellow travelers” (e.g., Gibson 1988). To be sure, a wide variety of left‐leaning non‐Communists were scooped up in the indiscriminate allegations made by McCarthy and his allies (including, of course, Ronald Reagan and the Screen Actor's Guild), but a consensus existed that the dominant threat to the American way of life was from Communists, domestic and international.16"
"26","Politics is more complicated today, and therefore rather than asking people their views of preselected groups, it is prudent to allow the respondents to tell us which groups and ideas, if any, they find objectionable. The standard technology for accomplishing this is the “least liked” measurement strategy. Developed by Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus (1982), this approach allows all respondents to identify groups/ideas they dislike. Tolerance and threat questions are then asked about these groups. Thus, although the nominal group about which the questions are framed varies for each respondent, the questions are “content controlled” in the sense that all individuals are queried about groups they find highly objectionable. The least liked approach to measuring intolerance has been used widely in tolerance research throughout the world (e.g., Gibson and Gouws 2003; Peffley and Rohrschneider 2003).         "
"27","This approach to measuring intolerance therefore begins by asking the respondents to rate a variety of preselected groups in terms of how much they like or dislike the group. These affect questions were used in part as a means of getting the respondents to think broadly about groups, including those that might be considered by some to be on the fringes of American politics. The respondents were then told they could supplement this list with any other group they disliked a great deal. Next, they were asked to indicate which three groups from the supplemented list they disliked the most.17 The selected groups are shown in Table 4, as are the affect ratings (on a 1 through 11 scale) for each of the groups.         "
"28","The most commonly disliked group in America today is the Ku Klux Klan, with slightly less than half of the respondents naming the Klan as most disliked, and almost three‐fourths putting the KKK on the list of the three most disliked groups. Nazis were also widely named as among the most disliked groups, although they were considerably less likely to be identified as most disliked. Apart from the KKK and Nazis, no other group is targeted by a majority of Americans. Perhaps the single greatest surprise is that atheists (those who are against all religion and churches) would attract the ire of one in five Americans, a figure about equivalent to that for Communists and for those who would do away with elections and let the military run the country."
"29","Is this distribution of groups “pluralistic? From the frequencies of the most disliked groups alone, one might conclude that it is, since no single group captures the enmity of a majority of the American people. On the other hand, considering groups rated as among the three most disliked groups, a significant majority of Americans rate Klansmen and Nazis as among their three most disliked groups. Beyond these two groups, considerable dissensus emerges: Only slightly more than one‐third of the Americans rate Radical Muslims as among their most disliked groups (and Radical Muslims are disliked to the same degree that the Americans dislike atheists). After Muslims, not even one‐fourth of the respondents are in agreement about their antipathy toward the groups. Given that the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi groups are hardly salient in contemporary American politics, one might conclude from these data that the distribution of group antipathy is pluralistic, with little agreement as to who the extremists are, except in the extreme.18"
"30","The 2005 survey only asked the respondents to name their three most disliked groups. This does not mean, however, that other groups are not equally disliked. To investigate the breadth of groups highly disliked by the American people requires a few additional analytical steps."
"31","                        "
"32","For each respondent, the maximum positive affect for any group within the three most disliked groups was identified."
"33","Affect scores toward the other groups on the list (including any supplementary group nominated by the respondent) were compared to the maximum positive affect found among the three most disliked groups."
"34","In counting the number of additional groups with affect scores equal to those of the three most liked disliked group, affect scores indicating neutrality or positive affect (which characterizes only nine respondents) have not been counted. In these instances, the number of tied groups was set equal to zero."
"35","The result of this methodology is an indicator of the number of groups with affect scores as low or lower than the “most liked” group of the three most disliked groups. The distribution of this variable is as follows. Only 15.3% of the respondents did not rate a group outside the three‐most disliked with an equally low level of affect. Thus, in some sense the three most disliked groups are distinctive. A total of 23.1% named five or more additional groups. The median number of groups named is 3 (with a mean of 2.9). Thus, by any accounting, the three most disliked groups people identify are far from unique. The three most disliked groups are generally highly disliked, but so too are many other groups active in American politics. Group antipathy in the United States is broadly distributed, a consequential finding to which I will return shortly.         "
"36","Tolerance questions were asked with reference to two groups—the most disliked group and “another highly disliked group.” The latter is the third most disliked group if the respondent named one (71.2% of the respondents). If no third group was named, then the second most disliked group was used in the questions (23.1%).19 As will be demonstrated in the analysis below, not much difference exists for most respondents between their perceptions and judgments of the two groups about which we asked.         "
"37","The respondents were asked three tolerance questions about the most disliked group and what I refer to as another highly disliked group. Following theories of liberal democracy (e.g., Dahl 1971), and extant research on political intolerance (e.g., Gibson and Gouws 2003), the queries concerned whether these groups should be allowed to speak, demonstrate, and run as candidates for office. The results are reported in Table 5.         "
"38","The data in this table document widespread political intolerance in the United States today. For each of the six questions, more than one‐half of the respondents gave an intolerant reply to our query. Only something on the order of one‐third of the respondents expressed a tolerant viewpoint. Little variation exists across the various activities, and surprisingly small differences can be found between the judgments of the most disliked group and another highly disliked group. Indeed, more than one‐half of the sample (54.1%) gave no tolerant replies to the questions about the most disliked group; only a somewhat smaller percentage (44.5%) would tolerate none of these activities by the other highly disliked group (data not shown). By any accounting, intolerance appears to be fairly common in the United States."
"39","As Table 4 revealed, Communists are not widely liked in the United States; only 5.2% of the respondents expressed any degree of positive affect toward Communists, although 21.5% held neutral views (data not shown). For 73.4% of the American people, Communists are disliked. As Table 4 also shows, however, only 19.6% of the Americans named Communists as among their three most disliked groups. From these data, direct comparison to the McCarthy era therefore does not seem feasible.         "
"40","However, the 2005 survey also asked all respondents tolerance questions referring to four preselected groups.20Table 6 reports the degree to which the American people are willing to tolerate demonstrations by these four groups. The question specifically asked about how the respondent would react to a decision by local authorities to ban a public demonstration by these various groups. The groups were selected to represent a variety of ideological points of view, with two groups (Communists and atheists) drawn from the leftward portion of the ideological continuum, and two groups (Radical Muslims and religious fundamentalists) representing the right. These groups vary in the degree to which the American people dislike them, with 79.6% expressing some antipathy toward atheists, 78.5% toward Radical Muslims, and 73.4% toward Communists, but only 39.1% disliking fundamentalists. These questions represent difficult tests of tolerance, since they explicitly posit that the authorities had decided not to allow the demonstration (although the questions do not indicate why). Therefore, a tolerant reply requires that the respondent go against that decision.         "
"41"," Table 6 reveals that about one‐half of the American people would today support banning a demonstration by Communists. Their views toward Communists seem not to be unique, inasmuch as a roughly similar percentage would approve of a ban on demonstrations by Radical Muslims and even atheists (those who are against all religion and churches).21 Of the groups about which we asked, only religious fundamentalists are tolerated by a majority of the American people, although it should be strongly reiterated that these figures for each group include respondents who are actually sympathetic toward the group/idea (and therefore these questions are not a fair test of political tolerance). Only 28.9% of the American people would tolerate a demonstration by each of these four groups; 33.9% would tolerate none of the groups (data not shown).22"
"42","How common is intolerance in the United States today compared to the McCarthy era? In response to a question in 1954 about whether a Communist should be allowed to give a speech, 68% of the American people replied “no.” In 2005, 54% would ban a Communist demonstration, and a roughly similar proportion would not allow a speech by their most disliked group or by another highly disliked group. Thus, the most appropriate conclusion is that intolerance is less widespread in 2005 than it was in 1954, although the level of intolerance of the American people today is still remarkably high."
"43","Although a full analysis of the causes and consequences of these attitudes is beyond the scope of this article, it is worthwhile to consider the types of Americans who perceive freedom and who are intolerant. Such an inquiry provides valuable evidence on whether “pluralistic intolerance” has any political consequences. This analysis focuses on the group sympathies of individuals and the degree to which they are associated with perceived freedom and political tolerance. For instance, one might hypothesize that those who express favorable views toward Radical Muslims perceive less freedom as being available to them, given the high level of antipathy toward Muslims in the United States."
"44","Based on the various groups about which we queried the respondents as a prelude to the tolerance questions, Table 7 reports data on who feels free to express themselves and who does not. The number of respondents analyzed varies greatly across groups (see the table), since few Americans are positively oriented toward Radical Muslims, while many think favorably of Conservatives.23 The second data column in the table reports the percentage of respondents asserting that the government would not allow them all three political activities (as reported in Table 2).         "
"45","The group most unfree in the United States today is those holding sympathetic views toward Radical Muslims.24 Sympathizers with militarists and Communists are not far behind in perceiving constraints on their freedom. What is perhaps more interesting, however, is the relatively common constraints on freedom perceived by Christian Fundamentalists and by those who oppose abortion rights. More than one‐half of these mainstream groups believe they cannot exercise full political freedom in the United States today. It is also noteworthy that the respondents least likely to perceive repression are those sympathetic toward Gay Rights Activists and atheists, groups that are fairly widely disliked in American politics.25 Certainly there is nothing in these data that suggests a dominant relationship between the degree to which radical views are espoused and perceptions of constraints on political freedom.         "
"46","Perhaps the most unexpected of these findings is that so many Christian Fundamentalists perceive limits to their political freedom. Explaining why requires some speculation. As Christian Fundamentalists have flexed their political muscles in recent times, they may have become disappointed at the degree to which government stands as an impediment to achieving their goals. From prayers in schools and at football games to the display of religious symbols on state‐owned property, fundamentalists are often thwarted today by the government. Perhaps the relationship reported here can be understood as a function of the degree of demand made on the public space. As groups demand more—as expectations rise—they are more likely to see government as unresponsive. Some are willing to make the inferential leap from lack of responsiveness to affirmative restrictions on political freedom. Perhaps those who want least from the public domain believe they have the most freedom available for their use.26"
"47","From a more theoretical vantage point, only a minority of the American people would support banning a demonstration by Christian Fundamentalists (as is documented in Table 6), yet supporters of Christian Fundamentalists perceive substantial constraints on their freedom. I take this as evidence that for the pernicious consequences of intolerance to materialize it is not necessary that a majority of the people be intolerant (as is implicitly assumed by the subtheory of pluralistic intolerance). Where significant pockets of intolerance exist, many citizens become fearful that even minority intolerance can be consequential, and they fear for their political freedom.         "
"48"," Table 7 also reports the levels of intolerance of those who sympathize with these groups. The first thing to note about the figures in this table is that intolerance is widespread, and, for most, it matters little whether the intolerance concerns the most disliked or another highly disliked group.27 In the tolerance columns, there is only a single instance in which intolerance does not predominate: Among those sympathetic to atheists, only 38.2% would not tolerate political activity by the other highly disliked group. In all other instances, the majority is intolerant. Some variability exists in intolerance: For instance, the range of intolerance directed at the most disliked group is from 58.8% to 86.9%: Intolerance predominates, to say the least.         "
"49","It is noteworthy that at both the micro‐ and macrolevels, a strong relationship exists between the perception that one's liberty is restricted and political intolerance. Although based on only 10 groups (but confirmed as well at the microlevel), the correlation between group sympathizers' intolerance and perceptions of restraints on their freedom is .65: Those who feel more unfree are likely to be more intolerant. The nature of the causal relationship between these two attitudes cannot be dissected—perhaps because they perceive themselves as not having freedom, it is easier to justify denying freedom to others—but a close connection exists between perceptions that the government should deny civil liberties to disliked groups and that it does deny civil liberties to groups to which one is favorably predisposed.         "
"50","This comparison between freedom and tolerance during the McCarthy era and today in the United States supports several important conclusions. Most interesting, even though intolerance is perhaps less widespread today (although not greatly so), the political freedom perceived by citizens is less than in the days of the Red Scare. This is an important puzzle that requires some additional thought and consideration.         "
"51","Perhaps the reduced level of political freedom today flows from the diffuse nature of intolerance in the contemporary United States. Rather than being focused only on a single political ideology (Communists), intolerance is reasonably dispersed across the ideological continuum, with some Americans preferring not to tolerate groups on the left, but others focusing their intolerance on groups on the right. Not all members of these disliked groups, of course, perceive the intolerance and the associated limits on their individual freedom. But because some Communists are not tolerated and do not feel free, and because some Religious Fundamentalists are not tolerated and do not feel free, and because some of those sympathetic to other groups are not tolerated and do not feel free, the cumulative effect is more widespread feelings of lack of freedom today than in the McCarthy era."
"52","Much has been written in the tolerance literature about the effect of pluralistic versus focused intolerance. The latter describes the McCarthy era, when nearly all citizens recognized the nature of the threat to the political system, whereas the former refers to disagreement among citizens as to where the primary threats lie. Conventional wisdom is that pluralistic intolerance tends to be benign, since disagreement on the targets of intolerance prevents a “critical mass” from forming and being effective at demanding repressive action from the government. But the evidence of this analysis is that pluralistic intolerance may in fact be malevolent in the sense that many segments of the population are subject to perceptions of restrained freedom. If pluralistic intolerance is actually multidimensional intolerance—as it seems to be in the contemporary United States—then its consequences may be quite different than ordinarily presumed."
"53","This last conjecture also points to the possibility that restraints on freedom are not exclusively or perhaps even primarily from the government. Expectations and norms widespread in the culture can inhibit free expression. Indeed, perhaps the most serious constraint of the McCarthy era was in the way in which ordinary citizens repressed each other, by which I mean they provided strong disincentives for the expression of anything remotely resembling a “radical” viewpoint. Within such a political climate, citizens often learn to “keep their mouths shut,” which, as Noelle‐Neumann (1984) has argued, can create a “spiral of silence” in which those holding minority viewpoints are fearful of expression since they perceive their own views as unusual, which in turns leads to silence, which makes minority viewpoints even less commonly voiced, which in turns leads to silence, and so on (but see Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2005). To the extent that a country's political culture does not encourage and reward expressions of a variety of points of view, political freedom is unlikely to be widespread.         "
"54","Finally, more attention ought to be paid to the ways in which social networks enhance or limit individual freedom. Gibson (1992a) has shown that network homogeneity constrains speech, a finding reinforced by Mutz (2002). Perhaps disincentives to the free expression of opinions are more a function of interpersonal interactions than the nefarious schemes of government. Since we actually know little about the internal dynamics of these processes, understanding the social processes contributing to intolerance, conformity, and the loss of freedom is a matter of considerable importance for students of American politics.         "
"55","Perhaps the most urgent task of future research is to investigate more comprehensively the interconnections among intolerance, freedom, and repression. The subtheory of pluralistic intolerance is undoubtedly too simplistic to be able to account for the mobilization of intolerance into repression; many other factors are surely involved. Majority opposition to an idea or a group seems not to be necessary for dissidents to fear for their individual freedom. Perhaps from a policy‐making viewpoint, whether the majority supports repression is important. But from the perspective of cultural constraints on freedom, it seems to matter much less whether a majority, or just a significant number of people, would not tolerate political activity by a group. Is the United States embarking on a new era of rampant intolerance and political repression, mimicking McCarthyism? Perhaps not. But even in the absence of widespread, focused intolerance, the unwillingness to allow minority viewpoints to be expressed and advocated appears to be pernicious."
