"1","Our estimation is based on a model of parliamentary systems of government in which two parties alternate in power controlling a legislative majority. In the model, two political parties, party L of the Left and party R of the Right, and an electorate interact over a sequence of periods indexed by t= 1, 2, … . The electorate is modeled as a pivotal voter M. Each of the two parties contains individuals with two different ideological convictions, call them moderates and extremists. These two groups disagree as to the ideal government policy. In each period, the balance of power within each party either tilts in favor of the moderates or in favor of the extremists. Thus, if extremists hold the upper hand in a party in some period, then we say that that party is an extreme type, e, in that period and it is a moderate type, m, otherwise. We call these types the parties’latent preferences.         "
"2","We emphasize that these latent party preferences are not determined endogenously in the model and are not directly observable by the electorate. This is in contrast to models of political competition in which it is assumed that parties are able to commit to a future policy plan, for example, via the public announcement of a policy platform prior to the election. Of course, we do not rule out the possibility that parties can collectively make decisions that influence the power of moderates and extremists within their ranks. If such actions influence the probability that a particular party remains or becomes moderate, then that effect is captured by the estimated structural parameters of the model, as will become apparent in what follows. But any such actions, e.g., the announcement of a manifesto, or the election of a leader with a particular policy predisposition, are imperfect commitment instruments:2 if extremists can prevail within the party after reelection there is nothing, except their own strategic calculation, that would prevent them from enforcing their will when it comes to government policy. Simply put, individuals within each party cannot choose their own preferences. Yet, as becomes clear in what follows, these latent party preferences do not determine the policy choices of the party: extremists can strategically choose which policy to implement if their party is elected in office.         "
"3","In each period t the beliefs of the electorate about latent extremism within the two parties are summarized by a pair of probabilities bt= (btL, btR). For example, the electorate believes that party L is extreme in period t with probability btL. Elections take place at the beginning of each period, with voter M choosing one of the two parties to be in government. We allow for the possibility that the outcome of the election is a surprise (i.e., different than the intended or preferred choice of voter M)3 with probability . Substantively, if elections are probabilistic, then governments with reputations for more policy extremism than oppositions might, in fact, win (and moderate governments might lose). The “rally‐round‐the‐flag” effect that returned the British Tories to power after the 1983 Falklands conflict is perhaps an example of the kind of electoral surprise that we wish to capture with this parameter. We denote the party elected to govern in period t by Pt∈{L, R}. Once elected, the party in government then chooses and implements a policy xt that is publicly observed. There are three possible policies drawn from a set X={xL, xM, xR}. Moderate party types always pursue the moderate policy, xM. If the government party Pt’s type is extreme, it chooses between a moderate policy, xM, or the extreme policy that corresponds to that party . Thus, while parties cannot commit to a platform or choose their own preferences, they can strategically choose whether to pursue their ideal policy or follow a moderate policy in order to manipulate the party’s reputation.         "
"4","We now describe how party preferences change between periods. If a party is in government and is of type τ (extreme or moderate) in period t, then it is of the same type in period t+ 1 with probability πgτ. For example, if party L is in government in period t with extreme latent preferences, then that party is extreme in the next period with probability πge and moderate with probability 1 −πge.4 We assume these changes are probabilistic due to the influx of a new generation of partisans with unknown preferences and the retirement of the “old guard,” or due to vicissitudes in the level of influence that different individuals exercise within parties (but behind the scenes). Once more, we emphasize that these probabilistic shifts may also reflect the residual uncertainty in voter perceptions after parties have optimally taken any unmodeled actions (e.g., selection of suitable leaders, changes in party manifestos, etc.) that might affect extrapartisan players’ perceptions. We denote the corresponding probabilities for a party in the opposition by πoτ. These probabilities, πge, πgm for parties in government, and πoe, πom for parties in the opposition, satisfy            "
"5","Note that 1 −πgm and 1 −πom are the probabilities that a moderate party in government or the opposition, respectively, becomes extreme in the next period. Thus, in Inequality (1) we assume parties are extreme with higher probability (πge or πoe) if the party was controlled by extremists in the previous period. The analogous statement is true for the case where the party was moderate in the previous period (e.g., πgm > 1 −πoe). In addition to this serial correlation in latent party preferences, assumption (1) also states that parties are less likely to change type while in government compared to parties in the opposition (πgτ > πoτ). This is a natural assumption as parties in the opposition are more likely to undergo the kind of internal restructuring that results in an ideological shift within the party. On the other hand, the prevailing ideological group within a party in government is more likely to maintain control of the party.         "
"6","All actors know that parties undergo these internal shifts in preferences according to the above probabilities. Thus, given party reputations (btL, btR) and publicly observable information (Pt, xt) for period t, the voter rationally updates beliefs about the probability that either party is extreme, and the parties do the same for the type of the opposition party, so that a new pair of reputation levels (bt+1L, bt+1R) corresponding to period t+ 1 is obtained. Then the voter elects a new party in government, Pt+1, given beliefs (bt+1L, bt+1R); this party then sets a new policy xt+1, and so on. Thus, the interaction of the players in the game determines a sequence of publicly observable outcomes (P1, x1), (P2, x2), … , (Pt, xt), … , as well as a sequence of beliefs or reputation pairs for the two parties b1, b2, … , bt, … .         "
"7","Extremists of each party receive a utility of one when they implement their favorite policy, a payoff of zero when the opposition party implements an extreme policy, and a payoff of one‐half when a moderate policy is implemented. In addition to these policy payoffs, extremists of each party receive an office benefit G when their party is elected in government, where            "
"8","We focus on strategies in which both political parties and the voter choose among available actions by conditioning on the level of political competition as reflected by the reputations of the two parties. Note that party reputations are updated rationally given previous period reputations as priors and given the publicly available information. Appendix A contains an exact statement of the equilibrium that satisfies these conditions on which we base our estimation. This equilibrium draws on the results in Kalandrakis (2009), where the interested reader can find a detailed discussion of equilibrium properties. To facilitate the substantive interpretation of our empirical findings, we summarize key properties of the equilibrium in the following proposition:         "
"9","The equilibrium is such that:"
"10","               "
"11","An extreme policy occurs with positive probability following an election with reputations bL, bR if either:"
"12","               "
"13","|bL−bR|                         is sufficiently small and party reputations satisfy                                                "
"14","An electoral surprise occurs (with probability s) electing a party with a sufficiently worse reputation than the opposition party."
"15","               "
"16","Incumbent parties are reelected with (weakly) higher probability when the value of office G is lower."
"17","If inequality                                                "
"18","If inequality (4) is reversed, then the government party tends to enjoy a persistent reputational advantage to the opposition and extreme policies occur only after electoral surprises."
"19","According to part 1 of  Proposition 1, an extreme policy occurs with positive probability either when a party with a reputational disadvantage is elected in government (after an electoral surprise has occurred with probability s) or when both parties have a reputation for being relatively extreme and neither party has a reputational disadvantage (whether an election surprise occurs or not). Part 2 concludes that incumbents survive with higher probability when office is less valuable. Finally, parts 3 and 4 state that, while the model induces a unique equilibrium for any single set of parameters, it produces two radically different long‐term dynamics for different parameter values: one dynamic (when (4) holds) involves regular alternation in office and extreme policies, while the second implies an incumbency advantage and lower probability of extreme policies.            "
"20","Given that different values of model parameters imply significantly distinct predictions, is it reasonable to ask whether we can use observed data in order to recover these parameters? To answer this question, in the following section, we show how the equilibrium of the model induces a likelihood over the observed data, as a function of the model parameters, and describe an estimation method."
"21","Consistent with the motivation for the model, we confine our empirical analysis to parliamentary systems of government in which two parties alternate in power controlling a majority of seats in parliament. Among two‐party parliamentary systems, we focus on a subset of five developed countries,5 namely Australia, Greece, Malta, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Excluded from the analysis are a large number of smaller former British colonies governed in the Westminster tradition.6 Many of these countries feature too small a number of elections with a consolidated party system, while some among those with a larger number of potential observations, such as Jamaica and Barbados, feature idiosyncratic forms of two‐party competition in which, for example, both of the two competing parties are Labour parties traditionally on the left of the policy spectrum.         "
"22","Our data consist of a sequence of binary observations encoding the victorious party in the five countries included in the analysis. The available data series is listed in Table 1. The data series starts immediately after WWII for all countries except Greece and Malta. In Greece, immediate post‐WWII politics involved multiparty systems and political instability leading to a coup in 1967. Thus, the Greek data start with the 1977 election, the first election in which the first two vote‐receiving parties coincide with the two parties that governed the country following restoration of democracy in 1974. We include in the analysis all the Maltese elections starting with the first election following independence. With the exception of New Zealand, where the data series was interrupted in 1996 due to electoral reforms,7 the remaining data extended to the present day. Thus, our data vary in length from a maximum of 26 periods (Australia) to a mere 10 elections in the Greek and Maltese cases. These data exhibit considerable alternation in power over time within each of the five countries. Note that competition between the two parties appears to be more balanced in Greece, Malta, and the United Kingdom compared to New Zealand and Australia, both of which seem to experience longer spells in power for the Right party.         "
"23","Assuming observations from a particular country and from periods t= 1, …, T, we denote the corresponding sequence of parties in government by a vector P= (P1, P2, …, PT). We also denote the (for our purposes unobserved) sequence of implemented policies by a vector x= (x1, x2, …, xT). We will first discuss the derivation of the likelihood from the model assuming the existence of the corresponding data on implemented policies x, although for practical purposes we later treat these policies as unknowns to be included in the estimation. We use the notation Pt and xt to indicate a data sequence truncated up to period t, for example, Pt= (P1, …, Pt). We assume that these observations are generated from the equilibrium of the model that corresponds to a given set of (unknown) values for the exogenous parameters. For notational sanity, we compactly represent the exogenous parameters by (s, θ, b1) where θ= (πge, πgm, πoe, πom, G). The parameters in θ are the primary focus of our estimation efforts. Parameters b1 constitute the pair of the initial probabilities with which the two parties are drawn to be extreme (and also amount to the initial reputations of the two parties), and are estimated along with parameters θ.8 Starting with period 1, we can compute the probability that party P1 is elected given parameters s, θ, b1. Also, conditional on P1 being the elected party, we can similarly compute the probability that policy x1 is chosen. Denote these probabilities  and , respectively. Now, given these choices it is possible to compute from the equilibrium the new party reputations that prevail in period 2, b2. Using these reputations, we can compute the conditional probability of observing election outcome P2 and policy x2 and, proceeding inductively in this fashion, we can compute the conditional probabilities  and  for the party and policy choice Pt and xt in any period t > 1.         "
"24","We can now combine the above probabilities in order to write the likelihood as a product of conditional probabilities as follows:             "
"25","As we explicitly show in Appendix B, all the equilibrium quantities that determine the probability with which parties choose extreme policies and the probability with which the voter elects either party to govern as well as the rule for updating party reputations are available in closed form as functions of the exogenous parameters. Thus, we can easily evaluate the likelihood in (5) for any complete data P, x and any values of the parameters s, θ, b1.         "
"26","A major difficulty in our analysis is the fact that, unlike data on the sequence of the governing parties, it is much harder to objectively measure the nature of the policy choices, xt, made by the governments in these countries. This is true even for the coarse binary distinction between extreme and moderate policies that we wish to make. Recall that a moderate policy in the model corresponds to the most preferred policy of a pivotal voter in the left‐right policy dimension. Indeed, such moderate policies differ both over time and across countries, so that reasonable people may disagree about the classification (moderate or extreme) of even objectively identical policy bundles implemented by two different governments in two countries, or in different periods within the same country. Instead of pretending to be able to determine the nature of government policy choices across our diverse sample, we pursue an estimation strategy that consistently treats the implemented policies as unknown quantities generated from the equilibrium of the model.9 In principle, there are various methods to implement this approach, but we opt for a data augmentation scheme (Tanner and Wong 1987) which has a natural implementation in the context of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian estimator we employ. The exact sampling scheme used is described in detail in Supplementary Appendix C. We discuss issues of identification of model parameters based on the observed data in Supplementary Appendix G.         "
"27","Before we move to the next section, we note that the electoral shock parameter s is not among the parameters we estimate. Naturally, the parameter s can take different values, reflecting contrasting levels of stochastic fluctuation in the political environment. Yet, the fact that probabilistic elections introduce considerable noise in model predictions does not permit us to estimate this parameter with the available data. An additional complication is that in order to ensure conditions for existence of the same equilibrium across different values of s, we must impose restriction (2), which affects the comparability of estimates of the value of office for different estimates of the parameter s, even if estimation of this parameter were obtained from our small sample. So in what follows, we proceed by estimating the model for three fixed values for the probabilistic election parameter: s= 0, meaning no electoral shocks, s= 0.1, meaning that one election in 10 is decided by factors other than electorate beliefs of relative extremism, and s= 0.2, which corresponds to the one in five elections case.         "
"28","Application of the estimation method outlined in the previous section allows us to draw several interesting conclusions. As a brief preview, on which we will expand substantially, we find that latent preferences within parties are quite stable over time, although extreme parties do tend to moderate after a spell out of office. Related to this observation, the value of government is generally high for partisans, though noticeably lower for Australian politicians in the model without electoral shocks (s= 0). We find evidence for significant country‐specific structural differences, and against pooled models in which groups of countries share structural parameters. Most notably in that regard, Australia emerges as a distinct case in our data. Finally, we find that on the basis of the available evidence, the models without electoral shocks outperform their counterparts with electoral shocks (with the possible exception of Australia).         "
"29","In Table 2 we report the parameter estimates for both the country‐specific models (first five columns) and the models that pool observations across countries (last two columns).10 Recall that π parameters are conditional probabilities of parties maintaining the same latent preferences; the superscript g or o refers to parties in government and opposition, respectively, while m and e refer to their preferences/types—either moderate or extreme. Looking across the first two rows for all three levels of electoral shocks, we observe that the estimated probabilities for the persistence of preference of parties in government (πge, πgm) are consistently at or above the 0.8 to 0.9 range, with the lowest value being πge= 0.69 in Australia for the model with s= 0.2 (i.e., extreme parties in government tend to remain extreme with relatively lower probability in Australia according to the models with electoral shocks). These estimates are quite large,11 implying parties in government maintain the same latent preferences with high probabilities across electoral periods.            "
"30","Note that by assumption (1), parties in the opposition switch preference with higher probability than parties of the same type in government. We also estimate the probability that opposition parties remain moderate, πom, to be consistently high. In the model without electoral shocks (s= 0), the minimum estimated value for that probability is 0.71 for the Uinted Kingdom, and estimates rise as high as 0.88 in the case of the pooled model. Estimates for models with electoral shocks tend to be lower in the range between 0.6 and 0.7. On the other hand, the estimates reported in the third row of Table 2 corresponding to the probability that opposition parties remain extreme, πoe, are consistently lower. In particular, certainly for the pooled models and the model without electoral shocks, extreme parties in opposition are more likely to switch preferences to moderation (with probability 1 −πoe) than to remain extreme, with the United Kingdom being the only exception (1 −πoe= 0.47 < 0.53 =πoe). Furthermore, the estimates of persistence of preferences for extreme parties in the opposition are (much) lower than the corresponding estimates for moderate parties, that is, πoe < πom across all models. No such pattern is apparent for the corresponding inequality (πge < πgm) for parties in government, with the possible exception of Australia in the models with probabilistic shocks.            "
"31","Despite the evidence from the point estimates reported in Table 2, a proper test of the hypothesis that the persistence of preference probabilities satisfies the inequality πoe < πom (or πge < πgm) must take account of the correlation among these variables in the posterior distribution. We properly evaluate the evidence in support of these comparisons using Bayes factors and report the relevant figures in Table 3. Note that the Bayes’ factors, being the ratio of posterior to prior odds for the hypothesis, reflect additional evidence in favor/against the hypothesis obtained from the data (compared to the prior evidence). For the models without electoral shocks (s= 0) there is substantial evidence against the hypothesis that πoe > πom (with the exception of the United Kingdom), implying that, indeed, the claim that moderation is stickier than extremism is supported for oppositions. The evidence is strong(er) in the case of the pooled models for all levels of electoral shocks, but becomes weak in the country‐specific models with electoral shocks. By contrast, the claim about governments being more likely to remain extreme than moderate is merely supported, or there is “minimal evidence” against it, for all the models with two exceptions: there is substantial evidence against this hypothesis (or evidence in favor of the hypothesis that extreme government parties switch preference more often than their moderate counterparts) in the case of the pooled model without electoral shocks (Bayes factor of 0.22 when s= 0), and for Australia with electoral shocks (Bayes factor of 0.29 when s= 0.2).            "
"32","Overall, the estimates of the probabilities of party preference persistence in Table 2 portray a mixed picture of internal party politics. On the one hand, these estimates indicate that partisan preferences are fairly persistent. On the other hand, parties with extreme preferences in the opposition tend to switch preferences with much higher probability, which sensibly suggests that opposition parties become more competitive after a spell out of power. Perhaps contrary to the first finding, the second finding suggests that there are forces within political parties that trigger or permit a possibly strategic shift that enhances the party’s electoral prospects. Note that such (potentially) strategic moves only occur when the party is in the opposition and, even if political parties consciously attempt a shift in preferences from extremism to moderation, we find no support for the hypothesis that they can effect that shift with probability one: all estimates of the relevant parameter πoe are larger than zero.12 Thus, it appears that the ability of the parties to strategically move toward moderation is tempered either by certain collective action failures within the party, or simply because parties do not possess the perfect institutional instruments that can bring about reform and a credible shift in the underlying party preferences.            "
"33","Turning to the last row of Table 2 for each level of electoral shock, consider the estimates of the value of government (G). Recall that a value of G equal to one implies that party extremists would be willing for their party to enact the policies of the opposition’s extremists so long as they could remain in government. That is, as G grows large, even hardcore party ideologues are willing to “sell out” to hold power. According to our estimates, Greek politicians are keenest on office rents (G= 1.19  when s= 0, 1.54 for s= 0.1, and 2.04 when s= 0.2), with Malta, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom following in that order. Australia once more exhibits an unusual pattern. Australian politicians seem relatively uninterested in the trappings of high office (G= 0.61) in the model without electoral shocks. It is tempting to relate this low valuing of office to the fact that Australia is the only country with a significant federal structure, which makes holding central office somewhat less valuable ceteris paribus than in a unitary state like Greece, Malta, or Britain. Nevertheless, the estimates of the value of office for Australia for the models with electoral shocks are more in par with those for the remaining countries. Finally, note that there is a notable increase in the estimated value of office across models as the electoral surprise parameter s increases. As discussed at the end of the previous section, this is largely a consequence of the parameter restriction (2), which makes the estimated values of G across models with different values of s not comparable.            "
"34","The differences in point estimates across countries, notably between Australia and the remaining countries, raise the question as to whether political competition across these countries is characterized by common structural parameters. To investigate this possibility we fit pooled models, wherein the structural parameters πoe, πom, πge, πgm, G are assumed identical across a set of countries. While the model labeled “Pooled” includes all five countries, model “Pooled (4)” excludes Australia, which, as we already discussed, appears to stand out from the remaining countries in our sample. As is to be expected, the pooled models that combine more data observations lead to sharper inferences as is evident by the smaller standard errors in Table 2, or the Bayes factors in the last two columns of Table 3.            "
"35","Whether we should prefer this pooled arrangement requires a comparison of models with different numbers of parameters. One possible way to perform this comparison in the Bayesian framework of our study is the Deviance information criterion (DIC) (Spiegelhalter et al. 2002).13 This statistic is reported in Table 4. The country‐specific estimation with five countries certainly does better than the pooled model (DIC difference is greater than 20) for all levels of the electoral shock parameter. The four‐country pooled model (excluding Australia) is also outperformed by the corresponding country‐specific model, although the contest is closer in this case in the models without electoral shocks (s= 0). Hence, we conclude that, though the pooled model is certainly theoretically plausible, there appears to be substantial evidence to the effect that national political idiosyncracies apparently account for the variation in the observed data, and that a significant component of this country‐specific variation is associated with Australia.            "
"36","Note that the potential explanations for the Australian exceptionalism we have identified differ depending on whether we assume no electoral shocks (s= 0), in which case the primary difference with Australia is lower estimated value of the prize that comes from winning power, or whether we assume positive electoral shocks, in which case an alternative explanation is the superior ability of Australian governing parties to shed a reputation for being extreme, or maintain a reputation for being moderate.14 A comparison of these two models (with and without electoral shocks) is also possible using the DIC scores reported in Table 4. Recalling that a lower DIC implies a better fit, we see that the model without electoral shocks consistently outperforms models with positive electoral shocks by wide margins. In fact, although these numbers are not reported directly in Table 4, there is only one country‐specific model for which the computed DIC is comparable or smaller for the models with electoral shocks (s= 0.1, s= 0.2) than the model without such shocks: Australia alone. Overall, with the possible exception of the Australian case, the performance of the models with electoral shocks appears inferior (in terms of the sharpness of inferences and the reported DIC) to the model without electoral shocks.            "
"37","In this section, we scrutinize the model’s fit by comparing observables with model predictions. In particular, we use the posterior predictive probability distribution over hypothetical replications of the data assuming they are generated from the estimated model. We draw a large number of replicated sequences of the data, Prep, i.e., the sequence of election winners in the sample period, using this posterior predictive distribution, P(Prep∣P), and then we compute p‐values for various statistics based on the value of this quantity observed in the data.15 The two statistics that we focus on are (1) the number of alternations in office and (2) the number of electoral victories of the Left. These two statistics provide a good summary of the data and the level of party competition.         "
"38","We report these calculations in Tables 5 and 6. As usual, p‐values that are too close to zero or one suggest that the data are unlikely to have arisen from the model and would be a cause for concern. Looking at the p‐values corresponding to the predictive distribution of the number of alternations in government, we see that the model does very well, with none of the models coming close to a p‐value that would raise alarm given conventional levels of significance. Turning to the number of victories for the Left party, we see a similar picture with the only possible exception being New Zealand. In that case the model tends to overpredict the number of victories of the Left compared to the observed number of such victories in the sample, notably, in the case of the highest p‐value of 0.9794 for the New Zealand model with s= 0.16 Note that it does not follow that the model cannot accommodate protracted periods of asymmetric competition between the two parties (even though the two parties are treated symmetrically in the model), as the p‐values for the Australian data indicate reasonable fit. In Figure 1 we provide a graphical depiction of the entire posterior predictive distribution for the country‐specific models without electoral surprises, in order to allow the reader to obtain a clearer idea of the range of predictions allowed by the posterior sample. Note that in many cases, the observed value is at or near the mode of the posterior predictive distribution.         "
"39","Posterior Predictive Distribution of Number of Alternations in Office and Number of Victories by the Left and Corresponding p‐Values (s= 0 Model)"
"40","First row corresponds to number of alternations, second row corresponds to number of Left party victories. The observed number of alternations is indicated with red dotted lines. p‐values appear in the top right corner of each graph. Posterior predictive distributions are computed using 10, 000 replicated data sequences using parameters from the posterior sample of the country‐specific models.                     "
"41","Moving beyond these two aggregate statistics summarizing the observed data, we now turn to an evaluation of the model’s fit with regard to individual elections. We, once more, use the posterior predictive distribution and record goodness‐of‐fit with standard criteria such as the “proportion of elections correctly predicted” and the metrics designed by Efron (1978) (pseudo‐R2) and Cramer (1999) (λ). Unlike the p‐values reported above with which we aimed to flag out any discrepancies between the model and observations, these statistics constitute cardinal measures of the model’s fit. In order to provide benchmarks for comparison, we also compute these measures for three heuristic nonstrategic or naive models. We label the first of the three models “static,” as it predicts the same probability of victory of the Left across periods based on the frequency of such victories in the data. In the second naive model, “AR1a,” the probability of victory of the Left (Right) is computed on the basis of empirical frequency conditional on the identity of the previous period’s winner (i.e., ) but maintains the same probability of alternation in government for the two parties (). Finally, in the third version, “AR1b”, we maintain the dependence of victory probabilities on the identity of the winner in the previous election but compute separate probabilities of alternation for the two parties (). Supplementary Appendix E provides details of these measurement strategies and the competing alternatives to the model.         "
"42","Table 7 reports the relevant figures; the fit for each of the three models (s= 0, 0.1, 0.2) is given in columns 1 to 3 and 5 to 7, and the appropriate contrast is to columns 4, and 8 to 9, respectively. A larger number implies a better fit and, as is obvious from the table, the models with levels of electoral shocks s= 0 and s= 0.1 outperform the naive alternatives in every one of the 21 pairwise comparisons. When the probability of electoral shocks is s= 0.2 there are two exceptions (New Zealand and Pooled (4) models), but even in these rare cases where the naive models do better, the absolute difference is very small. Of note, the pooled formal models outperform the dynamic naive model, even though we use country‐specific predictive probabilities for the naive model (i.e., we do not impose the restriction that conditional predictive probabilities for the dynamic naive model must coincide across the countries; see Supplementary Appendix E). The reader may wonder what accounts for the superior performance of the formal model compared to the AR1 models. The main difference stems from the fact that the AR1 model’s predictive probability is constant during a party’s spell in office once that party is in power. On the contrary, in the formal model the likelihood of electoral success of the incumbent party changes systematically as that party’s spell in office becomes longer. This dynamic adjustment becomes evident by our discussion of the evolution of government policies and reputations in the next section.         "
"43","The model may also be judged with respect to quantities that are not part of the data used for estimation. In this section we consider first the policies (moderate or extreme) implemented by the governments in our sample; second, the reputations of the two political parties, that is, the beliefs of the electorate about the true preferences prevailing within parties in each period. Precisely because we lack consistent direct measures of these quantities, this operation is more difficult and our analysis more discursive here. Nevertheless, we are able to bring more “hard data” to bear on our evaluation of the model when it comes to party reputations, which we contrast with survey data from the United Kingdom and historical vote margins across the five countries in our study."
"44","We report posterior estimates of party reputations and posterior probabilities of extreme government policies for the UK models in Table 8. Space considerations do not allow us to report these posterior estimates for all countries, but we make them available in Supplementary Appendix H. With regard to model predictions on government policies, two general patterns emerge from Table 8 that also generalize for the remaining countries. First, posterior probabilities of extreme policy in any given period are generally small (specifically, ≤ 0.38 for the United Kingdom). Second, and perhaps more important, is the clear monotonic pattern of increasing probability of extreme policy choices during a party’s tenure in office. In the models with electoral surprises, there is a positive but small probability of extreme policy choice in most all periods, and this probability increases steadily and becomes significant only toward the end of a party’s spell in office. In the model without electoral shocks, extreme policies are estimated with positive probability only in the last period of a party’s spell in office.         "
"45","This pattern is closely connected with the evolution of parties’ reputations implied by the equilibrium, as we explain using Labour’s last spell in office in the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2010 as an illustration. According to Table 8, Labour enjoyed an advantage over the Conservative party in 1997 when it first came to power (e.g., posterior reputation of 0.39 versus 0.55 for the Tories in the model without electoral shocks). This is typical as parties that first win elections enjoy (on average) a better reputation than opposition parties. Given this advantage, it does not pay even for party extremists to sacrifice almost certain reelection in order to pursue an extreme policy, so that early policy choices are likely to be moderate. But this initial reputation advantage of the governing party tends to gradually vanish (again looking at the case s= 0 from Table 8, both parties’ reputations equal 0.39 by the 2005 election).17 Without a reputation advantage, extremists, if they control the party, sacrifice less by choosing their preferred (extreme) policy (since they face a close election, they are no longer guaranteed to win). Thus, according to the posterior estimates, the last Labour government of Gordon Brown was much more likely to pursue a left‐wing policy in the 2005–10 interelection period (with a probability of about 0.25) compared to the early Labour governments of Tony Blair. Skeptical readers may think such a pattern is at best a stretch of reality. This is a fortiori true with regard to the previous spell in office by the Conservative party, for which the model predicts a low probability of extremism in the initial terms in office for Thatcher’s governments and a higher probability for the (last) John Major government. Of course, we cannot evaluate a model by cherry‐picking the cases it does or does not predict well. Regrettably, we are limited in our ability to perform a more rigorous evaluation of the overall performance of the model without more objective measures of these government policies’ appeal to the median electorate across time.         "
"46","We can bring additional evidence to evaluate the model more systematically in the case of party reputations. First, we look at the average responses of voters to two survey questions included in the British National Election Studies (BES) from 1974 to 2005. The first question asks voters to place the two political parties on a left‐right scale; the second asks whether they believe either party to be extreme. Both quantities (directly or indirectly) capture voters’ perception of the two parties’ extremism. Though we have relatively little data here, we do note that a positive correlation exists between these mean opinions and the average posterior reputations estimated from the model (see Table 9), more so for the model without electoral shocks, with the notable exception of the low and negative correlation between the posterior reputation of the Conservative party and the survey responses on the extremism of this party in the BES data (values of −0.03 for the model with s= 0 up to −0.28 for the model with s= 0.2). To offer some perspective on these figures, we also report in Table 9 the correlation of the left‐right Manifesto scales (Budge et al. 2001) with these survey data. Perhaps ironically, the manifesto data correlate quite well with the survey question on parties’ extremism, but exhibit a negative correlation of −0.40 in the case of the voters’ placement of the Conservative party on a left‐right scale.         "
"47","As a final check on the model’s performance in capturing party reputations, we studied the correlation between the vote margin (the difference in received vote shares between the Left and the Right parties) in the elections in our sample and the posterior difference in party reputations. Our reasoning in looking at these correlations is straightforward. If the posterior party reputations from the model recover (in part) the beliefs of the electorate about parties’ true preferences, then bigger differences in the reputations of these parties should translate to (on average) wider margins of victory for the party with the better reputation. These correlations are reported in Table 10. In most all cases,18 these correlations are positive and large, indicating that differences in posterior party reputations indeed capture cardinal differences in the sentiment of the electorate for the two parties. In fact, the correlations remain positive and of similar size when we compute them separately on the subset of the data for which the Left or the Right won (second and third rows of Table 10). This is notable as the data we used to estimate the model cannot possibly contain any information on the margin of the electoral victories of the Left (Right), conditional on the Left (Right) winning the election.         "
"48","We now turn our attention to the implications of the reported estimates for long‐term policy and electoral dynamics. Recall that from parts 3 and 4 of Proposition 1, we expect distinct patterns of party alternation in government and extreme policy choices depending on whether inequality (4) holds or not. We test whether this inequality holds using Bayes factors which are reported in Table 11. The data substantially (if not overhwelmingly) support the hypothesis that inequality (4) holds across both pooled and country‐specific models, with one exception: there is strong evidence against inequality (4) in Australia when the level of the electoral shocks is s= 0.2 (and weak evidence to that effect in the model with s= 0.1). Thus, according to parts 3 and 4 of Proposition 1, in the countries of our sample, with the possible exception of Australia, we find evidence that both extreme policies and alternation of parties in government are a regular equilibrium phenomenon (and not the consequence of electoral surprises) in the long term. On the other hand, Australian politics may exhibit a strong incumbency advantage and low incidence of policy extremism in the long run.         "
"49","With that evidence in mind, we use the model and the posterior sample for each specification in order to estimate the long‐run probability of an extreme policy. This is done by simulating long sequences of equilibrium play (2,000 periods) for the model corresponding to each point in the posterior sample separately, and then averaging the frequency of extreme policies across periods (discarding the first 1,000 periods as burn‐in). The relevant predictions are displayed in Table 12. These calculations suggest none of the nations under study are exceedingly likely to undertake radical policies in the long run, with the frequency of such policies ranging roughly between one in every 200 to one in every seven elections. Notice that the model predicts Australia has the lowest long‐run probability of witnessing such extreme policies—0.57 every 10 elections in the model without electoral surprises and as low as 0.05 every 10 elections in the model with s= 0.2. The highest of these values is considerably lower—almost half—than that of the nearest country estimate, which is Malta. The highest probabilities occur in Greece and the Uinted Kingdom, with predictions that range between one in eight and one in every seven elections across levels of electoral shocks.         "
"50","Using the same procedure, we generate long‐term predictions for the expected number of party alternations in government for the various countries. Table 13 contains the relevant figures. In keeping with the pattern we encountered in Table 12, notice that Australia stands out from the remaining countries with its governments enjoying much longer life in power, with roughly two alternations in office every 10 elections or an average duration in office of five periods compared to, say, over five government alternations in Greece for every 10 elections amounting to average spells in office that last short of two full periods. Most other countries exhibit a number of alternations that is intermediate between those encountered in Greece and Australia, with most all cases being closer to the former rather than the latter.         "
"51","The ability of parties to rebuild or maintain a good reputation regulates political competition in two‐party parliamentary systems, and this article sought to explore these reputation dynamics by matching data with an equilibrium model. We found that latent party preferences are sticky, suggesting the presence of significant inertia within party organizations, but at the same time found that extreme parties that lose elections are able to switch to moderate preferences relatively swiftly (but not with probability one), a finding consistent with the presence of strategizing forces within political parties. Despite these common general patterns, we found significant country‐specific differences, with an especially distinct pattern of political competition emerging for Australia."
"52","The theoretical model fits the observed data well, as documented by various statistics based on the posterior predictive distributions. Looking at posterior probability estimates of extreme policies by governments in the sample, we found that parties tend to suppress any latent policy extremism at the beginning of a government’s spell in office, while governing parties are increasingly likely to show their true colors as they reach the end of their spell in office. The posterior estimates of party reputations (the unobserved beliefs of the electorate about extremism within parties) correlate well with data (not used for estimation) on the electoral performance of the parties."
"53","Overall, our estimates suggested a healthy level of long‐run equilibrium competition between the two political parties in the countries of study, with reasonably short spells of control of the government by each party (with the exception of Australia), and predominantly moderate policies in the long run. We view these findings as a first step in a fruitful research direction. Future research can benefit significantly from the enrichment of both the theoretical model and the data that are used for estimation. When it comes to the theoretical model, much richer patterns of policymaking are possible if we incorporate finer distinctions in the policy preferences of various party groups. In terms of data, we would seek to add more information about the policy choices of the governments."
"54","In this appendix, we introduce necessary notation and state the exact form of the equilibrium of the model described in the second section. A strategy for the extreme type, e, of party P∈{L, R} is a function σP :[0, 1]2→ [0, 1] that maps the pair of party reputations to the probability of an extreme policy choice. A strategy for the voter is a function σM :[0, 1]2×{L, R}→ [0, 1] that maps the pair of party reputations and the identity of the incumbent party in government to a reelection probability. An equilibrium is a trio of strategies σ= (σL, σR, σM) that satisfy sequential rationality, and a belief‐updating rule,               "
