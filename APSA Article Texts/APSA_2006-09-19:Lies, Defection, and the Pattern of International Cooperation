"1","As a starting point, this article shows that governments that face fluctuating costs of compliance over time design agreements that account for political pressures to defect in such a way as to make cooperation most politically viable. From the point of view of the cooperating governments, politically efficient cooperation implies a cooperation rule that will impose the lowest participation requirements on the government that faces the highest costs of compliance in a given period. Such a cooperation rule is politically more efficient than one that would not take domestic circumstances into account: It allows sustaining cooperation under circumstances when defection by one of the governments would be necessary because of excessively high costs of compliance. I call the inclusion of such a rule in cooperation agreements domestic conditionality as it permits cooperators to condition the extent of cooperation on domestic circumstances.         "
"2","In most settings, an essential element of conditioning cooperation on domestic circumstances is the need for cooperating governments to communicate credibly about those circumstances to each other. Once the cooperating governments cannot perfectly observe each others' domestic circumstances, the benefits of institutional flexibility may be compromised by an incentive to misrepresent private information in order to achieve a more favorable outcome.1"
"3","Consider, for instance, an OPEC member who would like to temporarily exceed its production quota in order to resolve a domestic political crisis or reduce an unexpected budget deficit. Given the critical role of oil production in financing its public expenditures, the OPEC government would benefit from a temporary increase in oil production under most circumstances, not only if domestic political pressures were extreme. If these political pressures are unobservable, the cooperation partners of the OPEC government will understand that it may overstate its costs of compliance at any time. In contrast, when President Bush invoked an escape clause that is part of the WTO trade rules and increased steel tariffs in March 2002, U.S. trade partners as well as the WTO clearly saw that the reason was to win political support for the upcoming congressional elections in the swing states of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, rather than a crisis of the steel industry caused by import competition.2"
"4","This article shows that the possibility that some governments would misrepresent their domestic circumstances in order to achieve a more favorable cooperation outcome limits the potential for cooperation. The intuition is as follows: In order to prevent lying about domestic circumstances, a reasonable price must be attached to the messages from which the cooperators could benefit when lying. This can be done by assigning smaller future cooperation benefits to those that report high costs of compliance. However, the minimal level of future cooperation benefits that can be assigned to those that report high costs of compliance is bounded from below in the absence of external enforcement, or else those facing an adverse shock will abandon cooperation. If an appropriate price cannot be attached to high costs announcements, agreement flexibility must be curtailed. This will reduce the temptation to overstate the costs of compliance by those facing a favorable domestic shock. As a result, the best feasible cooperation agreement under asymmetries of information will be less politically efficient."
"5","While incentives to lie impede cooperation, cooperators can design cooperation rules that prevent misrepresentation between asymmetrically informed states. I discuss two simple cooperation rules that are self‐enforcing and allow for information sharing even when no information on domestic shocks is observable between the cooperating governments. The first rule, restraint, instructs the government that last took advantage of flexible cooperation provisions to refrain from doing so again for a specific number of subsequent periods. The second, rotation, is a rule under which low participation in cooperation under adverse domestic circumstances is allowed only in turns.         "
"6","More intuitively, both rules capture the common sense that is part of many everyday interactions. Restraint says, “If you ask for a favor too often, I can't trust that you are not exploiting my good will!” Rotation says, “Do not ask for another favor until you get a chance to return the last one!” And a common theme to both rules is “Those who ask for a favor at the wrong time may lose the chance to ask for it when they really need it!” A prominent example of an institutional arrangement that captures this intuition is the WTO Agreement on Safeguards under which safeguards can not be reapplied until after a period equal to the duration of the original safeguard has elapsed.3 The formal argument in this article clarifies why rules like this one induce truthful information sharing between cooperating governments.         "
"7","Furthermore, this article considers the interaction of governments with varying degrees of transparency of domestic political environment. I find that as the lack of transparency increases, the optimal cooperation rule becomes less flexible. Although information about domestic circumstances can be credibly communicated between less transparent regimes, it comes at the cost of designing politically efficient cooperation agreements. In particular, governments facing adverse shocks cannot opt out when they would need it most. Nontransparent governments therefore face more rigid agreement terms and gain less from cooperation than transparent regimes."
"8","When the extent of asymmetries of information between the cooperating governments can be measured in terms of the transparency of the political process, democracies face greater contracting opportunities than authoritarian regimes. Electoral competition in democracies creates incentives for the opposition to inform voters about the incumbent's policies and performance. Such incentives are either suppressed or absent in authoritarian regimes. The political process is therefore more transparent in democracies than in authoritarian regimes, and the magnitude of political pressures to defect from international agreements is more transparent to the cooperation partners of democracies."
"9","This article intentionally focuses on the transparency of the political process as the key difference between the two regime types, maintaining the assumption that both democracies and autocracies sometimes face domestic pressures to defect from cooperation. In democracies, public discontent with government policies is reported by the press, while the electoral mechanism determines how government performance affects its survival. In authoritarian regimes, public discontent with government policies and the mechanism by which it affects government survival take a different form. Although authoritarian governments try to suppress public displays of discontent, these still occur in the form of strikes or riots, and government change is more often the consequence of revolts, coups, or assassinations than elections.4 I therefore assume that interests that are affected by international cooperation exert pressure on government policies in authoritarian regimes as well as in democracies. In order to present the effect of transparency on cooperation across regime types as clearly as possible, I assume that the extent of such domestic pressures is the same across both regime types despite the different forms that these pressures take.         "
"10","The formal setting in this article involves two governments that decide on a level of cooperation in each period of an infinitely repeated game. A domestic variable that impacts the costs of compliance, costs of cooperation, is realized each period in each country and fluctuates probabilistically across periods. While the governments perfectly observe the cooperation levels that they choose each period, their own costs of cooperation may be private information. An imperfect signal of cooperation costs is observed at the end of each period, after cooperation choices have been made. The privately informed governments can communicate their costs of cooperation, but face incentives to overstate them as political efficiency implies that governments facing high costs of cooperation participate less than governments facing low costs. This formal setting intends to capture a wide range of international scenarios where (a) costs of cooperation may be private information and fluctuate over time; (b) the extent of cooperation varies over time and across countries; and (c) imperfect information about the actual costs of cooperation is observed only after the cooperation decisions have been made."
"11","The article is organized as follows. In the next section, I relate my argument and findings to related work in the international organization literature. The fourth section introduces the key elements of the formal model, and the fifth section studies a model of cooperation under changing domestic circumstances and complete information. In the sixth section, I introduce private information and discuss its implications for institutional design. The seventh section studies the implications of political transparency for the contracting opportunities of different regime types. The final section concludes. All formal statements of results and their proofs are in the appendix. Simple numerical examples illustrate each main result.         "
"12","Several earlier works explore the impact of domestic politics on the possibilities for international cooperation and institutional design. However, the extent to which governments' inability to share relevant cooperation information or the extent to which potential exploitation of institutions by lying accounts for cooperation failures has been addressed only marginally in the literature on international cooperation."
"13"," Putnam (1988) points to the domestic political environment as a key constraint on the feasibility of international agreements at the bargaining stage. Instead, this article studies the optimal agreement structure that takes the division of the cooperation surplus at the bargaining stage as given. I focus on the problem of designing a lasting agreement when both parties expect domestic circumstances to vary over time. The key properties of the agreement structure derived here hold regardless of the division of the cooperation surplus at the bargaining stage.5"
"14","In important contributions, Downs and Rocke (1995) and Rosendorff and Milner (2001) also derive the flexibility of compliance provisions from variation in domestic political pressures.6Downs and Rocke (1995) build on Green and Porter's (1984) model of oligopolistic collusion where imperfect observability of cooperation levels is at the heart of the cooperation problem. In contrast, I focus on the unobservability of domestic circumstances as the source of incentives to lie. Such a focus is more appropriate empirically as actual cooperation levels are easily observed in most international cooperation scenarios, while it is domestic circumstances reported in diplomatic communication or agreement disputes that are frequently in question.7"
"15","The difference between these two settings is also important from the incentive point of view. Downs and Rocke (1995) study strategies under which cooperation is suspended for a fixed number of “reversionary” periods after a “trigger event.” Such strategies are appropriate in settings where cooperators cannot infer with sufficient precision which player defected. When the mechanism generating information relevant to cooperation is independent across the cooperators, as is typically the case with domestic politics, trigger strategies do not take advantage of all the available information. More precisely, incentives for truthful communication or compliance can be provided by conditioning continuation strategies on the independent signal realizations across the cooperators. Such strategies can avoid the wasteful “reversionary periods” and expand the potential for cooperation.8 To my knowledge, this is the first article that applies this insight to the study of institutional design in international cooperation.         "
"16"," Rosendorff and Milner (2001) show that flexible treaty provisions make agreements easier to conclude under conditions of domestic uncertainty. Their finding corresponds to the benchmark model presented in the fifth section. My central focus then shifts to the optimal design of cooperation agreements under asymmetries of information. While Rosendorff and Milner (2001) argue that the cost of exercising escapes should balance the frequency of escapes and the benefits from cooperation, I explicitly characterize the limits to cooperation that the potential to exploit flexible institutions by lying implies when the extent of asymmetries of information between the cooperating governments varies. Furthermore, I demonstrate how the costs of exercising escapes can be translated into simple institutional rules, such as rotation and restraint, that induce truthful communication by varying the future gains from cooperation rather than monetary transfers. Such an agreement design may be more appropriate in settings where monetary transfers are implausible for institutional or political reasons.         "
"17","In contrast to Downs and Rocke (1995) and Rosendorff and Milner (2001), this article also addresses the possibility that governments may try to communicate the nature of domestic circumstances. I demonstrate that the neglect of the potential for communication leaves possibilities for efficient cooperation under asymmetries of information unexploited. In particular, communication allows governments to design cooperation rules under which future benefits from cooperation are conditioned on present messages about cooperation costs. Governments' ability to communicate is essential for the implementation of cooperation rules, such as restraint and rotation, that induce truthful information sharing even when no information on domestic shocks is observable across the governments.         "
"18","Most explicit treatments of communication in international politics have been cast in the costly signaling framework (Fearon 1994, 1997; Schultz 1998). Here, instead, communication is costless. In this setting, cooperation partners face the problem of designing cooperation terms that provide incentives for truthful communication. In the context of crisis bargaining, Sartori (2002) studies a repeated cheap‐talk game in which the threat of a wasteful noncommunicative equilibrium creates incentives to communicate truthfully. The key theoretical difference in this article is that truthful communication is induced by a transfer of the cooperation surplus that occurs on the equilibrium path: governments facing high cooperation costs today announce them, understanding that they will face lower cooperation surplus later. In another related article, Morrow (1994) considers communication as a way of coordinating on efficient cooperation outcomes and shows how incentives to coordinate are compromised by distributional problems. However, he does not study the enforcement of the coordination outcome under anarchy. International agreements studied here are self‐enforcing in the sense that no rational government would want to defect from them (even under anarchy). Furthermore, I derive the properties of international agreements as a result of efficient contracting among governments. In that respect, this article shares the motivation of Koremenos, Lipson, and Snidal (2001).         "
"19","This article assumes that the extent of asymmetries of information about governments' costs of cooperation reflects the transparency of the political process in the cooperating countries. In the present context, the costs of cooperation can be thought of as capturing electoral shocks, coalition crises, industry crises, or union strikes. Some of these are public information in most democracies, but have only limited observability in authoritarian regimes. A growing literature emphasizes the informational role of domestic political institutions in international politics (Broz 2002; Fearon 1994; Lipson 2003; Schultz 1998). This article contributes to this literature by studying a new mechanism that explains why democracies cooperate more than authoritarian regimes: Democracies face greater contracting opportunities because they can credibly sign cooperation agreements that accommodate political pressures to defect as a part of a flexible agreement.         "
"20","Finally, the game‐theoretic methodology applied in this article combines insights from the literature on mechanism design and repeated games. The repeated political environment considered here allows governments to condition future cooperation on the announced history of their domestic circumstances in each period. In formalizing this setting, I follow Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti (1990), who demonstrate how recursive formulation can be applied to the study of repeated games. This methodology allows for a convenient characterization of the entire Pareto frontier of cooperation agreements sustainable under the lack of enforcement. My treatment of incentive problems associated with asymmetries of information builds on the static mechanism design literature, particularly Sappington (1983) and Riordan and Sappington (1988). To incorporate these in a repeated setting, I draw on techniques for repeated games with imperfect public information developed by Fudenberg, Levine, and Maskin (1994) and applied in Athey and Bagwell (2001).         "
"21","Suppose that two governments, denoted by i={1, 2}, cooperate and each faces costs of cooperation that fluctuate over time. Costs of cooperationci can be high or low, denoted cH and cL, respectively, and belong to the set C={cH, cL}.9 I index the costs of Government 1 by j and the costs of Government 2 by k. I denote the four possible states (j, k); for instance (H, L) denotes the state when Government 1 faces high costs while Government 2 faces low costs. The probability that government i faces low costs in any period is Pr (ci=cL) =p, and the probability of high costs is Pr (ci=cH) = 1 −p. These probabilities are independent across time and governments. The joint probability of the state (j, k) is written as pjk, where pjk= Pr (cj) Pr (ck). I assume that p > 1/2 so that realizations of high costs are relatively rare.         "
"22","Cooperation choices are denoted by actionsa jki∈A, where A is a finite set on the interval [0, 1]. The action a jki= 0 denotes noncooperation, a jki= 1 denotes full cooperation, and intermediate values denote the extent of participation. The cooperation levels governments choose are perfectly observed.         "
"23","The stage‐game payoff from cooperation to government i in the state (j, k) is            "
"24","Benefits from cooperation depend on cooperation levels chosen by both governments in the Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) fashion, with  The assumption r > s ensures that in the state (L, L) cooperation is strictly preferred to alternating between the action profiles aLL= (1, 0) and aLL= (0, 1). Note that government i's benefits from cooperation, bi(a jki, a jk∼i), are increasing in a jk∼i and decreasing in a jki. The stage‐game cooperation surplus then ranges from b1(1, 0) −cH to b1(0, 1) for Government 1, with appropriate substitution in participation levels for Government 2.         "
"25","Assume that the costs of cooperation are such that joint cooperation is preferred to noncooperation when the costs of cooperation in that period are low, bi(1, 1) −cL > b(0, 0), while noncooperation is preferred to joint cooperation when the costs of cooperation are high, bi(1, 1) −cH < b (0, 0). Thus in the state (L, L) the incentives in this game follow a PD, while in the state (H, H) the incentives resemble the game of Deadlock. Note that irrespective of its costs of cooperation, each government prefers noncooperation to any positive level of cooperation. But if the cooperative outcome could be enforced, variation in the costs of cooperation creates incentives for variation in participation levels. The game matrix in Figure 1 illustrates this setting.         "
"26","                 A Cooperation Game with Varying Costs of Cooperation                      "
"27","In the sixth section, I study an environment where costs of cooperation are private information. In order to allow governments to condition their cooperation levels on domestic circumstances, I assume that they can communicate, perhaps untruthfully, the costs of fully cooperating in each period by sending a messagemjki∈M, where M={H, L}, before choosing their participation levels. H and L represent announcements of high and low costs of cooperation, respectively.         "
"28","In the seventh section, I introduce the possibility that an imperfect cost signalθ∈Θ, where Θ={H*, L*}, of one government's costs is observed after cooperation choices have been made. In order for such a signal to be informative, I assume that a high costs signal is more likely the result of a high rather than a low costs realization in a given country. Let πcθi be the probability that a cost signal θ is publicly observed when the actual costs of government i are c. Then for i= 1, 2 this assumption implies  and .         "
"29","The timing of the stage‐game in each period captures a setting where governments (1) privately observe their own costs of cooperation, (2) announce their costs of cooperation in that period, (3) decide on a level of cooperation, and (4) observe an imperfect public signal of the other government's costs of cooperation. All aspects of the game except for the governments' privately observed domestic costs of cooperation are common knowledge. Thus in each stage‐game, a (pure) strategy in period t for player i, σti(αi, ρi), specifies a cooperation level a jki and a message mjki about i's costs realization. The choice of cooperation level αi is a function of government i's costs ci and the other government's message m∼i, αi: C×M→A. The choice of message ρi is a function of government i's costs ci, ρi: C→M.         "
"30","Since the benefits from cooperation have a PD structure, for government i any positive level of cooperation, a jki > 0, is strictly dominated by noncooperation, a jki= 0. The realized costs of cooperation are therefore irrelevant for the Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the stage‐game, which yields the payoff bi(0, 0) to both governments. I therefore study the possibilities for cooperation under infinitely repeated interaction. I characterize the public perfect equilibria of this repeated game.10 That is, players will condition their actions only on the publicly observed history of the game. A public history ht in period t∈{2, … , ∞} of the repeated game is a sequence of actions and reports in periods 1, … , t− 1; .         "
"31","I focus on grim‐trigger strategies under which the play starts by cooperation and, after a defection, reverts forever to the Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the stage‐game. Since multiple equilibria can be supported by such strategies, I will restrict attention to those that maximize the joint cooperation surplus. An appealing feature of this approach is that it studies strategies under which no gains from cooperation are left unexploited. To keep the meaning of cooperation and communication intuitive in the context of international cooperation, I restrict attention to pure strategy equilibria."
"32","Consider repeated interaction where the expected discounted cooperation surplus of government i is            "
"33","Recognizing the lack of enforcement under anarchy as a fundamental feature of international politics, I require that in no period are the gains from compliance with the assigned equilibrium actions lower than the gains from defection in the current period and the autarchic surplus VAut forever after. The lack of enforcement under anarchy is then captured by the following enforcement constraints for the two governments            "
"34","As a benchmark, I first show that when governments perfectly observe each others' costs of cooperation, the optimal cooperation rule does not require full cooperation in each period. Instead, governments would like to reduce the costs of compliance for the government that faces excessive pressures to defect. For example, in the state (H, L), the government facing low costs is better off fully cooperating while allowing the government facing high costs to participate less. However, the lack of enforcement implies that such a cooperation rule will be self‐enforcing only if the government that participates fully in the state (H, L) can expect a similar favor in the state (L, H). For some parameter values, this rule allows for cooperation among governments that would not be able to achieve it if the cooperation agreement required full participation in each period. I call a cooperation rule that implements this strategy domestic conditionality. The following formalizes this intuition.         "
"35","I denote the Pareto frontier of the expected discounted cooperation surpluses V1(V2). Note that the cooperation surplus of Government 1, V1(V2), is written as a function of the cooperation surplus of Government 2, V2. Given the assumption that at least one nonautarchic surplus is sustainable under anarchy, V1(V2) traces a Pareto frontier with the cooperation surplus of Government 1 on the interval V1(V2) ∈[VAut, V1(VAut2)]. V1(V2) then corresponds to the Pareto frontier of self‐enforcing cooperation agreements. To characterize it, I maximize V1(V2) with respect to a jk1, a jk2, Vjk2 for all j, k, subject to a given level of cooperation surplus of Government 2 and the enforcement constraints            "
"36","Assign λ as the multiplier on the promise‐keeping constraint (2). Substitute bi(a1, a2) =−sai+ra∼i and VAut= 0 in the above optimization problem to obtain            "
"37","Suppose that the governments divide the joint cooperation surplus evenly. Also suppose that the enforcement constraints are not binding. That is, the inequalities (enfjk1) and (enfjk2) are strict and do not limit the choice cooperation levels. Then an agreement that achieves the highest joint cooperation surplus instructs governments facing high costs to withdraw from cooperation and governments facing low costs to participate fully. Note it is optimal to set a jki= 1 when r−s−ci≥ 0 and to set a jki= 0 when r−s−ci < 0. Recall that r, s > 0, r > s, 0 < cL < r−s, and cH > r−s. Then it is optimal to set a jki= 1 when the costs of cooperation are low for government i, and to set a jki= 0 when the costs of cooperation are high for government i. Since this is the unique maximum of the stage‐game, optimal continuation payoffs Vjki will also be unique with Vjki=V1(V2) =V2.         "
"38","Now consider what happens when the division of the joint cooperation surplus favors one side, that is V1(V2) ≠V2. Then in some costs states, governments will have to depart from the rule outlined above and transfer a part of the joint cooperation surplus to the government that is favored by the division. This can be done by decreasing the participation of the government favored by the division when it faces low costs (a jki < 1) or by increasing the participation of the disadvantaged government when it faces high costs (a jki > 0). Which is the optimal option depends on the relative wastefulness of the two, but both may be required when the division of the surplus is extremely uneven.         "
"39","How does the lack of enforcement limit domestic conditionality? When governments divide the joint cooperation surplus evenly, defection brings no benefit in the high costs states since governments do not participate in these states. On the other hand, for some discount factors, enforcement constraints may be binding for governments facing low costs since they participate fully. That is, the government asked to participate fully in this period may not be patient enough to do so in exchange for the promise of receiving a similar favor in the future. However, the same government may be patient enough to participate less than fully, at some a jki < 1. This is how the lack of enforcement limits domestic conditionality.11"
"40","When the division of the joint cooperation surplus is uneven, enforcement constraints may be binding in all states and bind the disadvantaged government more severely. Intuitively, an uneven division of the joint cooperation surplus exacerbates the enforcement problem. I summarize these results in the following proposition."
"41","Proposition 1  Domestic conditionality is the optimal cooperation rule for governments whose costs of cooperation fluctuate over time. The lack of enforcement under anarchy limits the extent of domestic conditionality.            "
"42","Note that the argument in this section suggests that governments can “cooperate too much” when cooperation terms require full cooperation in each period. The joint expected cooperation surplus under a “rigid” cooperation agreement that requires full cooperation in each period is                "
"43","The previous discussion demonstrated the optimality of domestic conditionality as a cooperation rule, but proceeded under the strong assumption that governments could perfectly observe each others' costs of cooperation. This section will analyze domestic conditionality when governments' information about their own costs of cooperation is private. I impose this new, strong assumption in order to highlight the limits to domestic conditionality that result from incentives to misrepresent domestic circumstances. Then in the next section, I consider a more realistic, intermediate case, when a noisy signal of cooperation costs becomes available after cooperation choices have been made.         "
"44","When information about costs is private, enforcing cooperation requires inducing governments both to choose the cooperation levels prescribed by the equilibrium and to report their costs levels truthfully. Therefore, it is useful to distinguish the following two types of defection. Defection by choosing a lower level of cooperation than prescribed by the equilibrium is perfectly observable to both sides; I call this noncompliance. On the other hand, defection by lying about one's costs of cooperation cannot be detected; I refer to this as misreporting.         "
"45","Since noncompliance is publicly observable, the threat of reversion to autarchy guarantees that, in equilibrium, neither government wants to defect by noncompliance if it is sufficiently patient. However, governments have incentives to misreport by announcing high costs since they expect to participate less after such an announcement. In contrast to noncompliance, misreporting is not publicly observable. We should therefore expect governments to anticipate misreporting and design cooperation agreements to prevent such a problem."
"46","In the present context, incentives against misreporting can be provided by conditioning future cooperation benefits on the announcement of present costs. More specifically, in order to induce truthful reporting of cooperation costs, greater future benefits from cooperation can be assigned to governments that report low costs. Or conversely, governments that claim high costs of cooperation may participate less at present, but carry a larger participation burden in the future. Under this incentive structure, misreporting high cooperation costs will not be beneficial since present benefits from cooperation are tied to future ones in a way that makes any misreporting disadvantageous."
"47","The following upward (inc jL2) and downward (inc jH2) incentive constraints make the provision of incentives against misreporting more precise.12 For Government 2, the gains from truth telling must be greater than either the gains from overstating (incjL2) or the gains from understating (incjH2) its costs of cooperation            "
"48","I show in the appendix that only upward incentive constraints will be relevant under the optimal cooperation rule. That is, governments only need to worry about misreporting that overstates the costs of cooperation when designing cooperation terms. This is quite intuitive: Since domestic conditionality implies that governments facing low costs participate more, governments will never want to understate the costs they face to their cooperation partners.         "
"49","What are the terms of the most flexible cooperation agreement that satisfies these incentive constraints? Combining upward incentive constraints of both governments at equality, we obtain             "
"50","Now I turn to the equilibrium behavior that satisfies both the incentive and enforcement constraints. Recall that under the lack of enforcement, the range of self‐enforcing continuation payoffs is bounded both from above and from below. Promising a larger share of the cooperation surplus to one government in the future implies a smaller share for the other government, which may not be patient enough to resist the temptation to defect. But at the same time, the provision of incentives against misreporting requires such a variation in continuation payoffs after different costs announcements. Cooperators will have to take this into account and may have to settle on a less flexible agreement than would be self‐enforcing under complete information.         "
"51","Consider, for instance, an equal division of the cooperation surplus. Under complete information, cooperators are concerned about enforcement only when they face low costs, since that is when they fully participate. But the variation in continuation payoffs represented by the inequalities in (3) implies that now cooperators should also be concerned about Government 1's compliance in any state after the state (H, L) and Government 2's compliance in any state after the state (L, H), since these are the states when one of them could benefit from lying. The implementation of a lower continuation payoff after these states entails a transfer of the cooperation surplus between the two governments in the future, which may intensify the enforcement problem.         "
"52","The following proposition characterizes how incentives to lie limit the potential for cooperation in terms of the lowest discount factor that achieves a particular joint cooperation surplus."
"53","Proposition 2  The lowest discount factor that achieves any joint cooperation surplus under asymmetries of information is strictly greater than the corresponding discount factor under complete information.            "
"54","Proposition 2 implies that if the cooperating governments are not sufficiently patient, greater participation under adverse domestic circumstances will be required precisely when flexibility would be needed most. As a result, joint gains from cooperation will be smaller, and cooperation agreements that would be signed under complete information will not be feasible under asymmetries of information."
"55","To illustrate the rather abstract intuition about the role of continuation payoffs in the provision of incentives against misreporting, I describe two incentive compatible mechanisms: restraint and rotation. I chose these because of their intuitive appeal and resemblance to actual cooperation rules. Both restraint and rotation allow the cooperating governments to credibly communicate domestic circumstances despite the fact that domestic shocks are their private information. However, this comes at a cost: After the asymmetric costs states, asymmetric continuation values have to be implemented in order to provide incentives against misreporting. As I argued in this section, this can be achieved only at the cost of some efficiency. The joint cooperation surplus under these mechanisms is therefore lower than the one that would be attainable if information about domestic shocks was public.            "
"56","To simplify the exposition, I will restrict my attention to scenarios in which the joint cooperation surplus is divided evenly, that is V1(V2) =V2, the payoffs in the stage‐game are bi(a jk1, a jk2) =−a jki+ 2a jk∼i as the traditional PD, and the discount factor δ is high enough so that the enforcement constraints would not be binding under complete information.            "
"57","Restraint is a rule under which the government that was the last to participate less after facing high costs in an asymmetric state cooperates fully, irrespective of its actual costs for a fixed number of periods. Less formally, restraint says, “If you ask for a favor too often, I can't trust that you are not exploiting my good will!” The WTO Agreement on Safeguards mentioned in the introduction is one real‐world example of this rule. Another one may be the Luxembourg Compromise of the European Union, where by tacit agreement, the right to veto was invoked only under exceptional circumstances."
"58","Formally, restraint means that the low continuation payoffs, VHL1 and VLH2, will be implemented by assigning full cooperation in all states and irrespective of cost realizations to the government that reported high costs in an asymmetric state. This regime will be in effect for a given number of periods unless the other government reports high costs in an asymmetric state in the meantime.            "
"59","Restraint implies the following cooperation surplus for Government 2:                "
"60","Initially, the continuation payoffs assigned in the states (L, L) and (H, H) are the same as in the beginning of the game. However, once the low continuation payoff VLH2(k) is implemented, the stage‐game payoff of Government 2 in the state (L, H) is b2(1, 1) −cH instead of b2(1, 0), and the payoff in the state (H, H) is b2(0, 1) −cH instead of b2(0, 0). VLH2(k) lasts for k periods unless the state (H, L) occurs in the meantime. Set r=δ(1 −p+p2), then VLH2(k) is formally captured by               "
"61","For Government 1, the high continuation payoff VLH1(k) also lasts for k periods unless the state (H, L) occurs in the meantime, which implies               "
"62","How long does restraint need to be applied to induce governments to communicate truthfully? Combining the incentive constraints of Government 2, we obtain                "
"63","For example, when p= 0.6, cL= 0.5, cH= 1.5, and δ= 0.98, the lowest k is 8. In that case, after the state (L, H), Government 2 will exercise restraint for the next eight periods unless the state (H, L) occurs in the meantime. If that happens, Government 1 will exercise restraint for the next eight periods unless the state (L, H) occurs in the meantime, and so on.            "
"64","When implementing rotation, the government facing high costs in an asymmetric state withdraws participation only if it is its turn to do so. If it is not its turn, it cooperates fully in all states irrespective of cost realizations. More intuitively, this rule may be described as a “favors regime, ” under which the last government to “owe a favor” does not ask for another until it gets a chance to return it. Such a rule may be a good approximation of tacit cooperation rules in diplomatic relations, but also of everyday interpersonal cooperation."
"65","Formally, after the state (L, H) occurs, Government 2 receives a lower continuation payoff, VLH2, while Government 1 receives a higher continuation payoff, VLH1. The lower continuation payoff captures the fact that Government 2 “owes a favor” while Government 1 is “expecting to receive one.” When Government 2 “owes a favor” it fully cooperates no matter what costs it faces until the state (H, L) occurs and it gets a chance to “return the favor.” After that, Government 1 “owes a favor” while Government 2 is “expecting to receive one.”            "
"66","Rotation thus implies that the expected cooperation surplus of Government 2 is                "
"67","When rotation is implemented, only two continuation payoffs are ever awarded to each government once an asymmetric state occurs. These continuation payoffs are VLH1 and VHL1 for Government 1, and VLH2 and VHL2 for Government 2. This is implied by the idea of rotation: Once the first favor is awarded, somebody either expects a favor or owes one at any later moment during the interaction. Also note that unlike restraint, rotation cannot be calibrated to account for the severity of the incentive or enforcement constraints. Thus for some parameter values, rotation may be either too flexible to prevent misreporting or too rigid to be self‐enforcing. A more general version of rotation would permit several high costs announcements before a government loses its turn.            "
"68","When is rotation sufficient to discourage governments from overstating their actual costs of cooperation? As with restraint, we can combine the incentive constraints of each government and obtain expressions analogous to (4). As before, we also need to check that the enforcement constraints are satisfied. For example, when p= 0.6, cL= 0.5, and cH= 2, rotation is self‐enforcing and induces truthful communication for δ≥ 0.99.            "
"69","The previous two sections analyzed two cases of complete and private information about domestic politics, respectively. I used these to clarify the trade‐off between the efficiency of domestic conditionality and the limits to contracting that arise from asymmetries of information about domestic circumstances. This section completes the theoretical argument in this article by establishing continuity between these two cases."
"70","I introduce the possibility that, in addition to messages, an imperfect signal of one of the government costs is observed after the cooperation choices had been made. I demonstrate that cooperation agreements that condition participation on domestic circumstances become feasible under a wider set of circumstances as the informativeness of the signal about domestic circumstances improves."
"71","To focus on the effects of transparency on optimal agreement structure, I consider the interaction between a perfectly transparent regime and one whose costs of cooperation can be only imperfectly observed. I associate the informativeness of a signal about domestic circumstances with the transparency of the agreement issue area. When the costs of cooperation can be plausibly measured as political costs, I suggest that the informativeness of the signal reflects the openness of the political system. This link between political transparency and regime type is consistent with other work that studies the impact of domestic political institutions on international politics (Broz 2002; Fearon 1994; Lipson 2003; Schultz 1998).         "
"72","Two forms of transparency may be considered in international cooperation scenarios. I refer to ex ante transparency as the ability of cooperation partners to observe each others' domestic circumstances after announcing their costs of cooperation but before the decision to cooperate is taken. Ex post transparency captures the extent to which cooperation partners can observe each others' domestic circumstances after both communication and cooperation have occurred. Media reports, parliamentary debates, or electoral results are all examples of informative signals that contribute to ex post transparency when they occur after cooperation choices have been made. In terms of cooperation design, ex post transparency presents a harder case for appropriate incentive provision since any messages about domestic political pressures can be checked against an informative signal only after cooperation choices have been made. I therefore restrict attention to ex post transparency.         "
"73","I assume that Government 1's costs of cooperation are perfectly observable, while only an imperfect ex post signal of Government 2's costs of cooperation is publicly observed. The signal assumes two values, θ∈{H*, L*}. Recall that πcθi is the probability that a cost signal θ is publicly observed when the actual costs of government i are c. Since it is Government 2's ex post signal that is observed, only πcθ2 is relevant, and I will use πcθ to simplify notation. Note that  and . A completely uninformative signal will therefore be such that . On the other hand, a signal is perfectly informative when . The restriction that  and  lie between 1/2 and 1 ensures that the signal is informative, but that Government 1 is never able to perfectly infer Government 2's costs of cooperation from the ex post signal alone. By assumption, a higher publicly observed cost signal is more likely the result of a high rather than a low costs realization. This implies  and corresponds to the monotone likelihood property. I will say that a signal is more informative when its realization is more sensitive to changes in actual cost levels. I will therefore take the variation of  on the interval (0, ∞) as a measure of informativeness.         "
"74","The availability of an informative ex post signal implies that continuation payoffs can now be conditioned not only on the announced costs, but also on the ex post signal realization. I therefore rewrite the maximization problem in expectation over the realization of the signal θ. The Pareto frontier of self‐enforcing incentive compatible cooperation agreements is now             "
"75","Above,  denotes the continuation payoff assigned to Government 2 after it announces low costs, while the publicly observed signal is high. Then  denotes the expected continuation payoff assigned to Government 2 after it announces low costs.         "
"76","Since continuation payoffs are conditioned on signal realizations that occur after cooperation choices have been made, any assigned continuation payoff needs to be self‐enforcing ex post. Any self‐enforcing cooperation agreement therefore has to respect the following ex post enforcement constraints for both governments:            "
"77","Proposition 3  More transparent governments face greater contracting opportunities.             "
"78","Consider the application of the rule restraint introduced earlier in order to induce truthful communication by Government 2. In the present scenario, a low continuation payoff is implemented whenever Government 2's report of high costs is inconsistent with the ex post signal realization. Recall that the low continuation payoff means that Government 2 will “exercise restraint” and participate fully irrespective of its actual costs for a positive number of periods. Suppose that p= 0.6, cL= 0.5, cH= 2, and δ= 0.98. Suppose . When π= 2/3 and the informativeness of the ex post signal is low, the lowest number of periods restraint needs to be exercised in order to prevent misreporting is 4. But then the low continuation payoff under restraint is too low for Government 2 to be willing to comply with the agreement. When the ex post signal informativeness improves to π= 4/5, the lowest number of periods restraint needs to be exercised in order to prevent misreporting drops to 3. This leads to an increase in the low continuation payoff and Government 2 is now willing to comply with the agreement.            "
"79","This article presents a general argument that transparent countries face more contracting opportunities than nontransparent ones. While I stressed the transparency of the political process as the key property of democracies, in some cooperation contexts, the transparency of the political system may not be as important as that of certain bureaucracies or industries."
"80","When the connection between transparency and political regime is appropriate, this article provides a new explanation for why democracies cooperate more than authoritarian regimes. In contrast to many explanations in the literature, the present model captures a politically realistic scenario in which even democratic governments may at times politically benefit from a defection on their cooperation agreements. Nonetheless, the agreement terms that democracies face are more flexible than those of autocracies because of their ability to credibly sign cooperation agreements that accommodate political pressures as a part of a flexible agreement."
"81","The second major focus of this article was the design of international agreements when incentives to lie complicate cooperation. A large literature in international politics focuses on the role of international institutions as monitors of cooperation (Keohane 1984). This article takes a different approach by investigating the design of cooperation agreements when information relevant to cooperation cannot be realistically obtained by an international monitor. Domestic political pressures or the productivity of certain industries are two examples of such information. I have shown that the recognition of incentives to lie leads to the design of cooperation rules that can induce truthful communication, and the resulting compliance, even in these settings.
