"1","It is perhaps self‐evident that in formal models, the results that are obtained depend on the assumptions that are made in formulating the model. While this fact is well understood, all assumptions are not equal and there is little discussion by practitioners of formal theory regarding how sensitive their results can be to the details of the assumed game form. Often the predictions of our models depend crucially on the precise specification of the game we choose. In the game‐theoretic literature on bargaining, for example, a number of variations of the standard alternating‐offers model due to Rubinstein (1982) have been studied.6 Taken together, these variations demonstrate that important features of the equilibrium outcome are often highly sensitive to the exact specification of the bargaining procedure. For example, a seemingly minor change in who makes the first offer can have a significant effect on the distributional outcome. Other variations, including when disagreement leads to a costly inside option, when players can opt out of bargaining, or when players cannot commit to forego renegotiating their proposal after their opponent accepts, also can have significant effects on equilibrium outcomes.         "
"2","The bottom line is that consumers of current theoretical models are necessarily left unsure about how robust existing findings are and how much our theoretical expectations depend on the analysis of a specific game form.7 Indeed, Powell emphasizes the importance of “the potential sensitivity of informational accounts of war to the bargaining environment—to the sources of uncertainty and the ability to resolve that uncertainty” and calls for “robustness checks for a particular formalization of the bargaining environment” (2004). In order to address these concerns, we make use of a methodological approach from economic theory called Bayesian mechanism design. This approach enables us to analyze the outcomes of bargaining games while leaving the precise procedures used by the parties unspecified. In particular, we may ask, what possible outcomes could occur for all possible bargaining procedures that could be used? This seems, at first glance, to be an intractable question. It is not even apparent how one might categorize all the different kinds of bargaining procedures that could be used.         "
"3","So how is Bayesian mechanism design able to generate game‐free results? The answer is that, through the use of a powerful result known as the revelation principle, we are able to reduce the scope of our analysis from the class of all possible Bayesian games to the much smaller class of “incentive‐compatible direct mechanisms.” In essence, the revelation principle allows us to include the strategic calculations and incentives to misrepresent of the bargainers as part of the direct mechanism. More specifically, the revelation principle states that the outcome of any equilibrium of any Bayesian game is also the outcome of some equivalent incentive‐compatible direct mechanism.8"
"4","The important implication of this observation is that any outcome achievable via any equilibrium, under any bargaining procedure, must be attainable as the equilibrium outcome of an “information revelation” game in which each player finds it optimal to truthfully reveal his information, given the conjecture that all other players will truthfully reveal their information as well. This is what is referred to as an incentive‐compatible direct mechanism. The revelation principle thus implies that if all incentive‐compatible direct mechanisms have some property, then every equilibrium of every game form has this property. More importantly for our purposes, if no incentive‐compatible direct mechanism has some property, then no equilibrium of any game form has this property.9 In this way, the revelation principle enables us to use direct mechanisms as a powerful tool for analyzing strategic behavior in a wide variety of settings.         "
"5","As is customary within much of the conflict literature, consider a situation where two states are involved in a dispute which may lead to war. We conceptualize the conflict as occurring over a divisible item of unit size, such as an area of territory or an allocation of resources. The expected payoff to war depends on the probability that a country will win, the utility of victory and defeat, and the inefficiencies present in fighting. We normalize the utility of countries to be 1 for victory in war and 0 for defeat, and we suppose there is a cost ci≥ 0 for country i fighting a war. Thus, if pi is the probability that country i wins the war, the expected utility for country i of going to war is simply wi=pi−ci.         "
"6","At the outset, each state has private information about its ability to contest a war. That is, each state has private information regarding its chance of prevailing in a war or the costs of conducting a military campaign. For example, a state could have unique knowledge about its relative value for the issue of dispute (captured by the relative cost of fighting ci) or the strength and capabilities of its military force (reflected in the probability of victory pi). Formally, we think of each country as having a variety of possible types, where country i's type represents its private information. The countries have a common prior about the joint distribution of types, given by F(t) for type pair t= (t1, t2) ∈T=T1×T2. In general, we will denote country i's war payoff for a type profile t by wi(t).10"
"7","The two countries can attempt to avoid war by resolving their dispute through some peaceful process, which may include direct negotiations, bargaining, threats, mediation by a third party, or some other interaction. Whatever settlement procedure is available in a given instance could then, in principle, be described (abstractly) by a game formG which is composed of a set of actions for each country, A1 and A2, and an outcome functiong(a1, a2) for a1∈A1 and a2∈A2. It is worth emphasizing that this game form can be anything from a simple strategic form game to an arbitrarily complicated extensive form. We denote a pair of actions (a1, a2) by a∈A=A1×A2. Thus, a game form defines the actions available to the countries (e.g., what negotiation tactic to use, etc.) and how those actions interact to determine outcomes.         "
"8","A crisis bargaining game is a game form in which the final outcome is either a peaceful settlement or an impasse that leads to war.11 Thus, we can decompose the outcome function g(a) of a crisis bargaining game into two parts: the probability of war πg(a), and, in the case of a settlement, the value of the settlement to country 1, vg(a). We will assume that any potential settlement is efficient and therefore the value of the settlement to country 2 is given by 1 −vg(a). We sometimes write  for the value of the settlement to country i. With this structure, it is easy to see that the payoff to country i of an action profile a is given by            "
"9","Of course, a country's private information can affect its behavior at the bargaining table. Formally, the actions taken in the game can depend on the countries' types, and we reflect this fact by defining a strategy for country i by a function si : Ti→Ai. The set of all possible strategies for state i is Si and we let (s1, s2) =s∈S=S1×S2. The equilibrium concept we employ is Bayesian‐Nash equilibrium. In particular, a strategy profile s* is a Bayesian‐Nash equilibrium if each type of each player is playing a best response to the strategies used by the other players. For a given equilibrium s* of G, define Ui(ti) to be the expected utility of this equilibrium for a type ti of country i. Analytically, we let            "
"10","In the remainder of this section, we formalize the method of game‐free analysis and discuss how to apply this method to crisis bargaining games. We begin by linking the game form and the information structure described above in the following way. Fix an equilibrium s* to the overall game. For a type pair t= (t1, t2), this equilibrium generates an equilibrium probability of war π(t) =πg(s*(t)) and an equilibrium value of settlement to country . As peaceful settlements are efficient, the equilibrium value of settlement to country 2 satisfies v2(t) = 1 −v1(t). The functions π(t) and vi(t) form what is called an equivalent direct mechanism, which can be understood as nothing more than a new game in which each country's available actions are limited to reporting one of its possible types and outcomes are determined using π(t) and v(t). If it is an equilibrium for all types to “tell the truth” by sending a report equal to their type in this game, then we say that the direct mechanism is incentive‐compatible.         "
"11","With these definitions it is now possible to formally state the revelation principle."
"12","Result 1  (Myerson, 1979). Ifs*is a Bayesian‐Nash equilibrium of the crisis bargaining game formG, then there exists an incentive‐compatible direct mechanism yielding the same outcome.            "
"13","To understand the intuition of the revelation principle, consider the simple extensive form game in Figure 1. This game has two players, country 1 and country 2, and is similar in nature to the crisis subgame in Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992). To start, country 1 decides whether to accept the status quo or make a challenge. If country 1 challenges, then country 2 can capitulate, giving in to country 1's demand, or resist. If country 2 resists, country 1 decides whether to repeal its challenge and back down, or to fight—leading to war. This describes the outcome function g of this game. If a war occurs, then country 1 wins with probability p1=p and country 2 wins with probability p2= 1 −p. Each country also pays a cost of war. In this example, there is two‐sided uncertainty: each country's cost of war is private information and can take on one of two values, cl or ch, with ch > cl > 0. For each country, the prior probability that ci=ch is given by π. For simplicity, we focus on the case in which cl is small and ch is large. Specifically, we assume that cl < min {p, 1 −p} and ch > max {(1 −p(1 −π))/(1 −π), p}.            "
"14","                 Example of the Revelation Principle: A Simple Crisis Game                         "
"15","Now consider the following pair of strategies for the two countries. For country 1, both types make a challenge and if country 2 resists, then the high‐cost type backs down and the low‐cost type fights. For country 2, after country 1 challenges, the high‐cost type capitulates and the low‐cost type resists. Note that as described above, these strategies describe what actions each type of each country takes. It is easy to verify that under the assumptions on the parameters given above, this pair of strategies is an equilibrium of this game. Thus we denote this pair of strategies by .            "
"16","We now construct the equivalent direct mechanism for this equilibrium. As each country has two types, a high‐cost type and a low‐cost type, in the direct mechanism each country simultaneously chooses to report one of these two types, which we denote H and L. As the direct mechanism is just a strategic form game formed by these simultaneous choices, the only other thing we need to specify is what outcomes are assigned to these choices. This is accomplished via an outcome function for the direct mechanism equal to g(s*(t1, t2)), for all the possible reported type profiles (t1, t2). In order to see how this works in our example, consider the profile (H, H) in which both countries report they are the high‐cost type. The direct mechanism assigns the outcome “Capitulation” to this combination. Why? Because in the equilibrium of this example the high‐cost type of country 1 challenges the status quo and the high‐cost type of country 2 capitulates to this challenge. In other words, the direct mechanism assigns the outcome that would occur if the specified pair of types plays the equilibrium strategy in the original game. In the same way, the direct mechanism assigns the outcome “War” to the profile (L, L), “Capitulation” to the profile (L, H) and “Back Down” to the profile (H, L). Using the payoffs from the game tree, we can complete the direct mechanism as given in Figure 2. In this case, because each side has two possible types, the direct mechanism is just a 2 × 2 strategic form Bayesian game.            "
"17","                 Equivalent Direct Mechanism                         "
"18","The revelation principle is a statement about equilibria of a direct mechanism. Specifically, the principle says that in the direct mechanism we construct for a given equilibrium of a given game, truth‐telling is a Bayesian‐Nash equilibrium, and it leads to the same outcomes as the original equilibrium in the original game. To see that this is true in our example, consider the direct mechanism given in Figure 2. To show that every type reporting truthfully is an equilibrium, consider country 1, assuming that country 2 is reporting its type truthfully. Then for the low‐cost type of country 1, reporting L gives expected utility (1 −π)(p−cl) +π (1), while reporting H gives expected utility (1 −π)(0) +π (1). Thus, reporting L is optimal if cl < p. Similarly, for the high‐cost type of country 1, reporting H is optimal if ch > p. As both of these conditions hold given our assumptions on the parameters, it is optimal for country 1 to report its type truthfully, given that country 2 is doing so. In a similar manner, it is easy to check that truth‐telling is optimal for country 2, given this behavior by country 1 in the direct mechanism. Finally, it is clear that the outcome in the direct mechanism is the same as the outcome in the equilibrium of the original game by the way that the direct mechanism is constructed.            "
"19","The construction of the direct mechanism for this example offers insight into how we use the revelation principle in this article. As mentioned above, because each country has two possible types, the direct mechanism for the equilibrium in our example is a 2 × 2 strategic form Bayesian game. But as the method of construction makes clear, as long as each country has two possible types, the direct mechanism of any equilibrium of any extensive form, no matter how complicated, will be a 2 × 2 strategic form Bayesian game. Thus, the revelation principle allows us to make statements about all equilibria of all extensive forms, no matter how complicated, by analyzing the set of possible direct mechanisms, which in this case is just the set of 2 × 2 strategic form Bayesian games with the given outcomes. In this way, we can use the revelation principle to learn about arbitrarily complex games by studying the much simpler class of direct mechanisms. Of course, we do not limit ourselves to models with only two types. Also, we will most often make use of the contrapositive of the revelation principle which says that if some distribution of outcomes—say, always peace—is not an equilibrium to any direct mechanism, then it cannot be an equilibrium to any other extensive form game either.            "
"20","Thus, by using the revelation principle, we can study equilibria that satisfy incentive‐compatibility constraints in direct mechanisms and use our findings to establish general results about properties of equilibria in all possible crisis bargaining game forms. Before doing so though, we discuss three important qualitative properties of crisis bargaining that play a significant role in our later analysis.            "
"21","First, given the anarchic nature of the international system, any peaceful agreement reached must be voluntary. In particular, we suppose that a country always has the option of rejecting a proposed settlement vg(a) if it thinks it will be better off by resolving the crisis by force. The form of this rejection can literally be the use of military force or it can be an escalation of the crisis which either leads to war or to the other side capitulating. Whichever is true, this feature of the bargaining context ensures each side can act in such a way that the outcome is either war or a voluntary settlement that that side prefers to war. Formally, we say a crisis bargaining game form has voluntary agreements if, for i≠j, there exists an action  such that either  for all aj∈Aj or for all .13 Put simply, in a crisis bargaining game form with voluntary agreements, there is no way to force a country to accept an agreement that makes it worse off than it would expect to be by going to war.            "
"22","A second important observation about crisis bargaining is that the process of bargaining has the potential to reveal, to a greater or lesser extent, the private information of the bargainers. Of course, a country should incorporate this additional information into its decision whether to reject a proposed settlement in favor of using force. To capture this formally, we let μi(vi, ti) be country i's updated belief about the type of country j after observing the settlement offer vi.14 As is standard, we assume that this belief is formed via Bayes' Rule, whenever possible.            "
"23","Combining this updating with our assumption on voluntary agreements, it is easy to show the following result is a consequence of the revelation principle.15"
"24","Result 2.   Suppose that                                 s*               is an equilibrium of a crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements. Then there exists an incentive‐compatible direct mechanism such that                                 vi(t) ≥E [wi(t)  ∣ μi(vi, ti)]               for all                                 t∈T               such that               π(t) ≠ 1.            "
"25","The intuition for this result is straightforward. Referring back to equation (1), we see that in a game form that has voluntary agreements, if πg(s*(t)) ≠ 1, then this condition simplifies to the requirement that the equilibrium settlement value to country i must be at least as big as the expected war payoff to country i. That is, when faced with a settlement offer vi, all types of country i have the option of playing  and receiving a payoff of E [wi(t)  ∣ μi(vi, ti)]. Therefore if s* is an equilibrium and π(t) =πg(s*(t)) < 1 for some t= (t1, t2), it must be that this deviation is not profitable, which is true only if vi(t) ≥E [wi(t)  ∣ μi(vi, ti)]. In other words, if agreements are voluntary and the unilateral use of force is always an option, any negotiated settlement must give each country a payoff at least as large as the payoff that it expects to get from settling the dispute by force, given what it has inferred about its opponent as a consequence of the negotiations. As an example, refer back to Figure 1. This game satisfies our voluntary agreements condition. Therefore, it is easy to verify that, given our assumptions on ch, both players receive at least their war payoff in each cell of the direct mechanism in Figure 2.            "
"26","The third and final observation that we incorporate into our analysis is the simple fact that war is costly. Because of this, we are interested in whether private information makes war unavoidable or whether there can be cases in which countries always arrive at peaceful settlements. Formally, an equilibrium s* of a crisis bargaining game form is always peaceful if πg(s*(t)) = 0 for all t∈T. In other words, an always peaceful equilibrium of a game form is one in which no possible pair of types ever ends up abandoning a peaceful resolution of the dispute and resorting to force. Adding this requirement to Result 2 gives our final result.            "
"27","Result 3.   Suppose that                                 s*               is an always peaceful equilibrium of a crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements. Then there exists an incentive‐compatible direct mechanism such that for all                                 t∈T, π(t) = 0               and                                 vi(t) ≥E [wi(t)  ∣ μi(vi, ti)].            "
"28","The importance of this result is that if we can show that for a given information structure there is no incentive‐compatible direct mechanism with these properties, then no always peaceful equilibria exist in any crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements.            "
"29","We conclude this section by presenting a lemma that will be useful in deriving the general results presented in the next section. This lemma is a direct consequence of the revelation principle applied to crisis bargaining games with independent types. Formally, we say that types are independent if there exist distributions F1 and F2 on T1 and T2, respectively, such that F(t) =F1(t1) F2(t2) for every t∈T.            "
"30","Lemma 1.   Suppose types are independent and               . Suppose also thatwi(t)is continuously differentiable int1andt2. LetGbe any crisis bargaining game form and lets*be any equilibrium ofG. ThenUi(ti)is continuous, is differentiable almost everywhere, and can be expressed as"
"31","Proof Suppose that s* is an equilibrium of a crisis bargaining game form. Then by Result 1, there exists an incentive‐compatible direct mechanism yielding the same outcome as s*. This direct mechanism is given by π(t) =πg(s*(t)) and . Therefore the expected utility of type ti from equation (2) can be written               "
"32","Now, viewing  solely as a function of ti, because wi is differentiable in ti, it follows that  is differentiable in ti and because wi is continuously differentiable on a compact set, this derivative is bounded. This implies that  is absolutely continuous in ti. Therefore, the Envelope Theorem (Milgrom and Segal 2002, Theorem 2) gives us that Ui(ti) is absolutely continuous and               "
"33","In this section we establish several general results that hold for every crisis bargaining game that has voluntary agreements. Before doing so, though, we must identify the appropriate information structure for our analysis. Historically, the conflict literature has held that uncertainty is a central cause of conflict among countries, but has varied with respect to the type of uncertainty it views as important. Some scholars focus on uncertainty about the relative strength of the countries (Blainey 1988; Organski and Kugler 1980) while others concentrate on uncertainty about the costs of conflict or the resolve of countries (Kydd 2003; Morrow 1985; Ramsay 2004; Schultz 1998).         "
"34","In particular, we focus on two kinds of uncertainty: uncertainty about the costs of war and uncertainty about the distribution of power. These various sources of uncertainty correspond to significantly different informational structures with important implications for strategic interaction in a crisis. Uncertainty about costs implies that the values of war to each country are independent, in the sense that one country's realized preference for fighting does not directly affect another's utility for fighting. Alternatively, the international system may produce uncertainty about the relative strength and the probability of victory. In this situation, the countries' values for war are interdependent, although information remains uncorrelated."
"35","We first consider the case in which each country is uncertain about the other's cost of fighting, which is also often interpreted as a country's level of resolve (Fearon 1994; Schultz 2001) or preference for fighting.16 From a theoretical perspective, this is a situation with uncertainty about independent private values for war. That is, the realization of one state's resolve, or relative cost of war, does not directly influence the utility of the other side. A classic example of crisis bargaining with uncertainty regarding resolve occurred between Germany and the United Kingdom in the 1930s. While relatively well informed about the distribution of power in Europe and Germany's military armaments, the British Foreign Office was unsure about Hitler's intentions and how far he would go to achieve his territorial goals (Yarhi‐Milo 2009).            "
"36","To model uncertainty about costs formally, we suppose that the probability that country 1 wins a war, p, is common knowledge but there is uncertainty regarding each country's cost for fighting, ci. In this setting, suppose country i's type, , is its cost of war, which is distributed according to a cumulative distribution function Fi(ci), with support Ci.17 War is costly, so we assume that . Denote a pair of types (c1, c2) =c∈C=C1×C2.            "
"37","We begin our analysis of this information structure by identifying some qualitative features of equilibrium play in crisis bargaining games with uncertain costs. Often, such qualitative features are central components in the analysis of a particular model. For example, in the classic take‐it‐or‐leave‐it bargaining model of conflict (Fearon 1995), it is possible to show that the expected probability of war is weakly decreasing in the cost of war for both countries. The following result demonstrates that this qualitative feature of this specific model is completely general—it will hold in any equilibrium of any crisis bargaining game with uncertainty about the cost of conflict. The result also shows that a similar conclusion can be reached about the overall expected utility of each country. For country i, define the expected probability of war, given strategy profile s, by               "
"38","Proposition 1.   Suppose costs                                       ci                                       are private information, but each country's probability of winning a war is common knowledge. Let                  G                  be any crisis bargaining game form and let                                       s*                  be any equilibrium of                  G. ThenΠ(ci)andUi(ci)are both weakly decreasing inciand differentiable almost everywhere, andUi(ci)is continuous inci.               "
"39","Proof Suppose that s* is an equilibrium of a crisis bargaining game form. Then by Result 1, there exists an incentive‐compatible direct mechanism yielding the same outcome as s*. This direct mechanism is given by π(c) =πg(s*(c)) and . Therefore the expected utility of type ci from equation (2) can be written                  "
"40","We now focus on Ui(ci). As wi=pi−ci is continuously differentiable in ci, it follows from Lemma 1 that Ui(ci) is absolutely continuous and therefore continuous and differentiable almost everywhere. To show that Ui(ci) is weakly decreasing, take  and apply Lemma 1 to get                  "
"41","Thus, monotonicity of utility and the probability of war are general qualitative characteristics of any equilibrium of any game with uncertainty about the costs of war.18 It is then interesting to observe that this monotonicity is borne out in a number of well‐known, and quite different, models of crisis bargaining. For example, in the alternating‐offers bargaining model of Powell (1996), it is straightforward to deduce from his Lemma 3 and Proposition 1 that the probability of war is deceasing in each player's cost of war. Similarly, the war of attrition model in Fearon (1994) has a monotone probability of war. From Proposition 2 in Fearon (1994, 584) we can see that a country with a low cost of war chooses to wait to some time t and then fight, while a country with a high cost waits for some time and then quits. The probability of war goes from positive in the first case to zero in the second. Finally, we can consider the model in Schultz (1999). In this model the probability of war is also a step function, which is positive when a country has a low cost of war but is zero when costs are large.               "
"42","These types of comparative statics represent testable predictions that are robust to the particular formalization of crisis bargaining, as advocated by Powell (2004). Moreover, as this result depends only on the incentive compatibility constraints inherent in the revelation principle, it holds for all crisis bargaining games, even those without voluntary agreements. In this way, we see that the monotonicities identified in the proposition are purely a consequence of the incentives to misrepresent private information that are fundamental to the crisis bargaining environment.               "
"43","In addition, this result shows that in any equilibrium of any crisis bargaining game, two types of a country with similar costs must receive similar expected utility in equilibrium. Thus a small change in the private information of the country leads to a small change in its expected payoff. This is a feature that is commonly found in “cut‐point” equilibria of Bayesian games, but it is present here with no explicit assumption on the form of equilibrium strategies."
"44","Of course, in a peaceful equilibrium the probability of war is constant at zero, which satisfies Proposition 1 in a trivial way. We now turn to inquiring about the characteristics of such equilibria. We begin with a simple existence result."
"45","Proposition 2.   If costs                                       ci                                       are private information, but each country's probability of winning a war is common knowledge, then there exists a crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements in which an always peaceful equilibrium exists.               "
"46","Proof.  To prove this result, it is enough to give an example of a game form that has voluntary agreements and that has an always peaceful equilibrium. The following very simple example shows that this is indeed the case. Consider a game form that has voluntary agreements such that  for all a∈A and πg(a*) = 0 for some a*∈A. In this case, the strategy profile s*(c) =a* is an equilibrium because if either side deviates and starts a war, then both sides are worse off and if either side deviates to a different peaceful action, then the settlement amount does not change. Moreover, this equilibrium is always peaceful by construction.     □               "
"47","This proposition shows that there exists at least one game form that has voluntary agreements and that can eliminate the possibility of war. The game form described in the proof has a particularly simple payoff structure in which the potential settlement is always equal to a country's (commonly known) likelihood of success from war. One example of such a game form would be a direct “arbitration” game in which an arbitrator would present both sides with a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it offer. Since this agreement would make both sides better off, regardless of their costs for fighting, it would provide a rational and preferable alternative to war.19 While a single example is sufficient to prove existence, it would be incorrect to conclude that this arbitration game is the only model with uncertainty about costs and voluntary agreements that has a peaceful equilibrium. For example, one kind of equilibrium studied in the alternating‐offers model of Leventoğlu and Tarar (2008) has uncertainty about costs and zero probability of war. Interestingly, Leventoğlu and Tarar observe that a puzzling feature of the standard alternating‐offers bargaining model of war is that a country cannot go to war in a period in which it makes a proposal, and when such behavior is allowed peaceful equilibria emerge.               "
"48","At some level, though, the mere existence of game forms with peaceful equilibria is not a very satisfying result. It only tells us that a peaceful equilibrium is theoretically possible; it is not a general result about the possibility of war that applies to all possible crisis bargaining games. Put another way, Proposition 2 establishes that the common understanding in the literature that incomplete information about costs leads to the risk of war is not always true; there exist instances where it does not hold. However, without a better characterization of equilibrium incentives, we do not know if this case is just an isolated exception or if peaceful equilibria are the norm and the conventional view on the link between incomplete information and war must be rethought.               "
"49","In light of this, we present a general characterization of peaceful equilibria in all possible crisis bargaining games that have voluntary agreements. For country i, define the expected settlement value from action ai, given strategy sj, by                  "
"50","Proposition 3.   Suppose costs                                       ci                                       are private information, with                  , but each country's probability of winning a war is common knowledge. LetGbe any crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements. Then an equilibriums*ofGis always peaceful only if, forfor allfor allai∈Aiand (3)for allc∈C.               "
"51","Proof Suppose that s* is an always peaceful equilibrium of a crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements. Then by Result 3, there exists an incentive‐compatible direct mechanism such that π(c) = 0 and                  "
"52","Because π(c) = 0, applying Lemma 1 yields Ui(ci) =Ui(0) for all ci and therefore  is constant in ci. In addition, because the constraint vi(c) ≥pi−ci must hold for ci= 0, we have                  "
"53","This proposition shows that the simple payoff structure used in the proof of Proposition 2 is, in fact, a general property of peaceful equilibria. Every peaceful equilibrium must have this same simple payoff structure in which the terms that a country accepts are completely insensitive to the costs or resolve of the country. High‐cost and low‐cost countries (and all types in between) must receive the same expected settlement value. The most natural example of a strategy profile that would generate such insensitivity is a (completely) pooling strategy, in which all types of a country choose the same action.20 A general lesson from this result, then, is that peaceful equilibria must be “simple” equilibria that do not depend on the private information of the countries. That is, an always peaceful agreement necessarily depends only on publicly observable information and cannot vary in response to the privately known costs or resolve of countries.               "
"54","We can better understand the general idea of this characterization of peaceful equilibria by observing that it is the generalized expression of the well‐known incentive to misrepresent private information. It is this incentive that prevents countries from resolving their uncertainty by way of “cheap talk” communication prior to bargaining (Fearon 1995). Proposition 3 shows that this same incentive forces peaceful equilibria to be completely insensitive to the private information that countries possess. This follows because if a peaceful equilibria did provide different expected settlements to different types, the type getting the worse settlement would have an incentive to mimic the behavior of the type getting the better settlement. Such a deviation is profitable because in a peaceful equilibrium the discipline generated by the risk of war does not exist, which means we could not have had an equilibrium that responds to the countries' private information.               "
"55","It is immediately clear from this general lesson that because many examples of crisis bargaining games in the literature have equilibria that do not conform to this simple payoff structure, these examples support the common understanding that incomplete information about costs leads to war. Indeed, given the severity of the necessary condition that strong types receive the same expected settlement as weak types, it does seem intuitively clear that many game forms will fail this necessary condition. In fact, we can strengthen this observation into the following necessary and sufficient condition:"
"56","Corollary 1.   Suppose costs                                       ci                                       are private information, but each country's probability of winning a war is common knowledge. Let                  G                  be any crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements and let                                       s*                  be any equilibrium of                  G. Thenfor someif and only if there is a positive probability of war in equilibrium.               "
"57","Proof The “if” direction follows directly from the argument in the proof of Proposition 3 that Ui(ci) is constant in ci if the equilibrium is peaceful. To show the other direction, suppose  for all . Then by Lemma 1,                  "
"58","In other words, this corollary establishes that two types can have different expected utilities if and only if war occurs with positive probability. If we interpret private information about costs as a country's “resolve,” then this result can be stated more clearly in the following form. Crisis bargaining games in which more resolved countries expect to be better off than less resolved countries in equilibrium are those with a positive probability of war. Put another way, this result shows that the only way that countries stand to gain from their resolve is through running the risk of war, as in the well‐known “risk‐reward” trade‐off.               "
"59","As an illustration of Proposition 3 and Corollary 1, we briefly return to the model of Leventoğlu and Tarar (2008). As mentioned above, their analysis considers an extension of the alternating‐offers bargaining model with one‐sided uncertainty about costs that allows both countries to choose war in any period. In the always peaceful equilibrium to their game, either both types accept the initial offer or both types reject this initial offer and make the same counteroffer, which is accepted. In either case, the payoff of two types is the same, as required by Corollary 1.               "
"60","This model also allows us to demonstrate how Proposition 3 and Corollary 1 can be used to characterize equilibria outcomes of games. At the end of their paper, Leventoğlu and Tarar consider what would happen if their game had two‐sided incomplete information with a continuum of types. While they do not attempt to solve this version of their model, they conjecture that a peaceful equilibrium would exist and suggest that the agreement would likely be on the division (p, 1 −p), perhaps after some delay. Our results allow us to address these conjectures directly, without actually solving the model. Suppose that the two countries' costs are drawn from the interval  in this model. Then Proposition 3 tells us that if a peaceful equilibrium like Leventoğlu and Tarar describe exists, the expected value of settlement for every type pair of the two countries must be (p, 1 −p). Moreover, as these expected values sum to one for every type pair and future payoffs are discounted, it must be that in any peaceful equilibrium the game ends with an accepted offer in the first round, with probability one. Thus we can confirm the conjecture that the peaceful settlement will be (p, 1 −p) and, additionally, demonstrate that this settlement will occur without delay in the bargaining.21 In this way, the results in this section can offer significant insight into equilibrium behavior of complex games with general uncertainty without actually doing the hard work of solving these games.               "
"61","While the previous section dealt with the case of uncertainty about the costs of conflict, in this section we deal with a second source of uncertainty that has received significant attention in the literature—uncertainty about the distribution of power and the likelihood of success in war. In this case, countries are assumed to be informed about their opponent's relative cost of fighting, but are uncertain about the likely outcome of conflict. In particular, countries have private information about the quality of their military or their combat strategy that leads each side to hold private beliefs about what will happen as a result of fighting a war. This is a situation with interdependent values. That is, each country's utility for conflict is not only dependent on its own type but also depends on the type of its opponent. A nice example of this class of problems is the run‐up to the 1973 Arab‐Israeli War. In this instance, any questions about Israeli resolve, by and large, had been laid to rest in the 1967 war; there was little doubt that Israel would defend herself resolutely if attacked. But even knowing this fact, Egypt and Syria were uncertain about how effectively the Israeli Defense Force would respond to a surprise two‐front war. In particular, the Syrian leadership thought their military build up put them in a strong position to retake the Golan Heights (Yarhi‐Milo 2009).            "
"62","To model this, we assume that the costs of engaging in a war, c1 and c2, are common knowledge, but both countries have private information regarding the probability of winning. We implement this in our framework by supposing that country i's type, , is independently distributed according to a distribution function Fi and the probability that country 1 prevails in a war, p(t1, t2), is a function of both types. We assume that the types can be ordered such that the probability of victory is monotone in the countries' types. That is, higher types have a greater chance of winning, all other things being equal. Formally, this assumption is that  implies , for all t2∈T2. Likewise, we assume that p is monotonically decreasing in t2. Also, to ensure there is uncertainty about the distribution of power, we assume that p is not everywhere constant. In this way, the type ti reflects the “strength” of country i and thus the probability of victory depends on the relative strength of the two combatants.            "
"63","Our first result deals with how expected outcomes must vary as the strength of a country varies. Recall from the previous section that the expected utility of type ti of country i is denoted Ui(ti) and the expected probability of war is denoted Π(ti).            "
"64","Proposition 4  Suppose costs are common knowledge but each country is uncertain about the probability of winning a war. Let                  G                  be any crisis bargaining game form and let                                       s*                  be any equilibrium of                  G. ThenUi(ti)is weakly increasing intiand differentiable almost everywhere. If, in addition,p(t) is continuously differentiable, thenUi(ti)is continuous inti.               "
"65"," If                                       p(t1, t2)                  is strictly increasing in                                       t                     1                  and strictly decreasing in                                       t                     2, then there exist, withsuch thatΠ(ti) = 0for allfor all, andΠ(ti) = 1for all.               "
"66","Proof Suppose that s* is an equilibrium of a crisis bargaining game form. Then by Result 1, there exists an incentive‐compatible direct mechanism yielding the same outcome as s*. This direct mechanism is given by π(t) =πg(s*(t)) and .               "
"67","As in the proof of Proposition 1, we can write the expected utility of type ti reporting a type  as                  "
"68","To show that Ui(ti) is weakly increasing, fix  and ti such that . Then                  "
"69","We now prove the final part of the proposition. By the same argument as in the proof of Proposition 1, incentive compatibility requires that                   "
"70","This proposition shows that, regardless of the game form, a stronger type of a country is never worse off than a weaker type of that country. Thus the monotonicity result for expected utility given in Proposition 1 with uncertainty about costs continues to hold with uncertainty about relative power. With the added assumption that the probability of winning does not jump discontinuously with type, we find that the continuity result of Proposition 1 also carries over to this setting. However, the earlier result on the monotonicity of the expected probability of war does not fully carry over. Instead, when the probability of winning is strictly monotonic in type, the weakest types have zero expected probability of war, moderate types have an expected probability of war strictly between zero and one, and the strongest types have war with certainty.22 Thus, expected probability of war displays a limited kind of monotonicity in this environment.               "
"71","One important consequence of focusing on uncertainty over relative strength is that the process of bargaining can reveal important clues as to the likely strength of the two countries. In particular, when a country receives a settlement offer, it can update its prior about the private information of the opposing state by inferring what must be true of the other state in order to generate the received offer. Recall that μi(vi, ti) is country i's updated belief about the type of country j after observing the settlement offer vi. Let V1(t1, v) ={t2 ∣ v1(t1, t2) =v} be the set of possible types of country 2 that a given type t1 of country 1 would think are possible after observing a settlement v.23 In this setting, then,                  "
"72","For convenience, we use the following notation in stating our results:                   "
"73","Let . It follows from the monotonicity of p that . Our next result shows that if the costs of war are less than , then no matter what bargaining procedure is used, there is a positive probability of war during a crisis.               "
"74","Proposition 5  Suppose costs are common knowledge but each country is uncertain about the probability of winning a war. If                  , then no always peaceful equilibrium exists in any crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements.               "
"75","Proof The method of proof is by contradiction. We begin by supposing there is an always peaceful equilibrium of a crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements. By Result 3, there exists an incentive‐compatible direct mechanism such that π(t) = 0 and vi(t) ≥E [wi(t)  ∣ μi(vi, ti)] for all t and i= 1, 2. Because π(t) = 0, the expected utility of country 1 with true type t1 reporting type  is                  "
"76","Turning now to the condition that vi(t) ≥E [wi(t)  ∣μi(vi, ti)] for all t and i= 1, 2, we use equation (3) evaluated at the type pair  and  to get                  "
"77","We next show that . Starting with the fact that v1(t1, t2) +v2(t1, t2) = 1 for all pairs (t1, t2), it follows that                  "
"78","Therefore, adding inequalities (5) and (6) yields                  "
"79","This proposition shows that there is a range of costs such that the countries' private information about the probability of winning is always an obstacle to peace in any interaction with voluntary agreements. Phrased as a general result, Proposition 5 shows that small costs of war is a sufficient condition for the impossibility of completely peaceful settlements in crisis bargaining games with voluntary agreements. We thus can view this result as extending the claim of Fearon (1995) that when costs are low, private information leads to a positive probability of war from the case of uncertainty about costs to the case of uncertainty about relative power. The reason that the war problem is particularly hard to solve in games with interdependent types is because, in such games, the strongest type of a given country knows that every type of their opponent cannot be a stronger adversary. So, from the strongest type's perspective, war is a relatively attractive option and therefore in order to persuade the strongest type to forego this option, such types must get relatively generous terms from peaceful settlements. This in turn creates an incentive for weaker types to pretend that they are strong in order to secure this high payoff. The only way a peaceful settlement can exist with these incentives is if the settlement gives every type of a country the same payoff as the strongest type of the country. But when the total costs of war are less than the critical value , such settlements are impossible.               "
"80","As an example of this sufficient condition, consider the model of Reed (2003). In this model, country 1 makes an offer to country 2, who either accepts the offer or goes to war. This model has one‐sided uncertainty: country 2 knows the probability of winning the war, while country 1 does not. In fact, in Reed's model, country 2's type is exactly the probability p that 1 wins the war. In our notation, then, country 2's type t2∈ [a, b] ⊆ [0, 1] and p(t2) =t2. Therefore,  and P2(t2) =t2, because country 2 has no uncertainty. Thus, the sufficient condition in Proposition 5 states that if , then war must occur in any equilibrium.25 To understand what this condition means in Reed's model, first note that in order to avoid war, country 1 must make an offer that the strongest type of country 2 will accept. Thus, country 1 must make an offer that gives at least 1 −a−c2 in order to ensure peace. Such an offer gives country 1 a payoff of at most a+c2. However, suppose country 1 makes an offer that all types of country 2 reject. This leads to war with certainty, so country 1 has an expected payoff of . Thus, peace is not possible if , which is exactly the sufficient condition in Proposition 5. To be clear, this does not show that such an extreme offer is optimal, only that country 1 will not make an offer that avoids war entirely.               "
"81","The intuition of Proposition 5 further suggests that when costs are large enough, peaceful settlements may be possible. This is exactly what we show in the next result. Specifically, we show that if the total costs of war are greater than the critical value , it is possible to find some game form that always avoids war.               "
"82","Proposition 6  Suppose costs are common knowledge but each country is uncertain about the probability of winning a war. If                  , then there exists a crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements in which an always peaceful equilibrium exists.               "
"83","Proof As with Proposition 2, it is enough to give an example of a crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements which has an always peaceful equilibrium. Consider a crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements such that  for all a∈A and πg(a*) = 0 for some a*∈A. By construction, the strategy profile s*(t) =a* is always peaceful. To show that it is an equilibrium, first note that if either side deviates to a different peaceful action, then the settlement amount does not change. If country 1 takes an action that leads to war, its expected payoff from war, given its type t1, is                  "
"84","The proof of Proposition 6 presents a crisis bargaining game form with voluntary agreements that has a peaceful equilibrium when . Thus, the proposition demonstrates the existence of a peaceful game form. It should be emphasized that the result does not claim that all game forms will have such a peaceful equilibrium when . As an example, consider the model of Reed (2003) described above and assume that F2 is the uniform distribution on [a, b]. In this case, it is easy to check that . However, it is also easy to verify that the peaceful equilibrium in which country 1 makes the offer x=a+c2 that is accepted by all types of country 2 exists only when c1+c2≥b−a. Thus, Reed's model is an example in which war still occurs in equilibrium for values of .               "
"85","Another important feature of Proposition 6 is that it implies that a trivial sufficient condition for the existence of a peaceful game form is that c1+c2≥ 1. Yet, much of the time this condition is unlikely to hold, i.e., it is rarely the case that a real‐world conflict generates relative costs that are greater than the total value of the object of dispute. However, if there is a third party that is willing to provide a sufficiently large subsidy to the peace process, such as an international organization or a superpower, a peaceful settlement is possible. Permitting this possibility, we can say that, if a third party provides a subsidy                  "
"86","We conclude our analysis of this case by presenting a characterization of peaceful equilibrium that is similar to the results in the previous section."
"87","Proposition 7  Suppose costs are common knowledge but each country is uncertain about the probability of winning a war. Suppose also that                  p(t) is continuously differentiable, strictly increasing int1, and strictly decreasing int2. LetGbe any crisis bargaining game form that has voluntary agreements and lets*be any equilibrium ofG. Thenfor someif and only if there is a positive probability of war in equilibrium.               "
"88","Proof The proof of Proposition 5 shows that Ui(ti) is constant in any peaceful equilibrium. For the other direction, suppose  for all . Then by Lemma 1,                  "
"89","This proposition tells us that, as in the previous section, every peaceful equilibrium of every crisis bargaining game with uncertainty about relative power must give every type the same expected settlement. As with the case with uncertainty about costs, we can use this result to shed new light on strategic problems without having to solve complicated games. For example, consider the crisis bargaining game in Smith (1998). The extensive form of this game is quite involved. To start, a leader from a “defender” country makes a cheap talk announcement of their intent to defend a client state if that state is attacked. Next, an aggressor state chooses to attack the client or not. If the aggressor attacks, then the client can retaliate or capitulate. If the client retaliates, the defender chooses to intervene or not. If the defender intervenes, he changes the probability that the client wins the war. After the crisis is complete, the defender's citizens decide to keep or replace their leader, given the cheap talk message, the play of the crisis, and the outcome of the war.               "
"90","One of the main conclusions of Smith's paper is that the defender's message “can only be informative if war occurs with positive probability.” To prove this, Smith uses several lemmas,27 but we can derive this result directly from Proposition 7.28 In a peaceful equilibrium, all types of the attacker must get the same expected utility. This means that either the client retaliates with positive probability when attacked and all types of the attacker stay out, or, if the client never retaliates, all types of the attacker attack and get the capitulation utility. In either case, the outcome of the crisis does not vary. Therefore, for the defender country, the only way for its utility to vary is by the probability that the government is replaced. But again by Proposition 7, all types of the defender must have the same expected utility. Therefore, all types must have the same probability of replacement. But this implies that the cheap talk message must be uninformative, because otherwise differences in the types would be revealed and the less competent types would be removed. Therefore, messages must be uninformative if the probability of war is zero. In this way, we can derive useful results from specific models using our propositions without actually solving for the equilibria in those models.               "
"91","As we have emphasized, one strength of the game‐free method of analysis presented here is the ability it provides to establish results that hold across a wide variety of strategic interactions between countries. That is, our results apply to any direct bargaining process in which the countries can make offers and counteroffers to each other, with or without communication, as well as any arbitration mechanism in which the parties communicate to a formal institution and this institution decides how the dispute will be settled. In this way, we have been able to give a clear picture of the general consequences of private information and the incentives to misrepresent this information on the possibility and form of war and peace. In addition, given our interest in understanding how different kinds of uncertainty may imply different general tendencies for strategic behavior, our mechanism design approach allows us to clearly and cleanly explore the effects of various types of uncertainty across many different game forms."
"92","Using our techniques, we have established several general results. The first group of results concerns the monotonicity properties of equilibria. We show that crisis bargaining games with two‐sided private information have some, but not all, of the monotonicity properties described by Banks (1990) for games with one‐sided private information. Proposition 1 shows that countries' expected probability of war and expected utility are both (weakly) decreasing in their costs. So the general intuition that low‐cost types have higher expected utilities from crisis bargaining, but also face greater risk of war, carries over from the setting with one‐sided incomplete information. Unlike Banks (1990), however, we are unable to guarantee monotonicity in expected settlements with two‐sided incomplete information about costs. Similarly, Proposition 4 shows that with uncertainty about strength, the monotonicity result for utilities also holds in every crisis bargaining game. For expected probability of war, however, we are only able to establish a limited kind of monotonicity, unlike Banks (1990).         "
"93","A second interesting general result occurs in the interdependent case, where countries are uncertain about relative power. Here we find that the conditions that determine whether or not peaceful equilibria can exist need not depend on any aspect of the game form. As seen in Propositions 5 and 6, the nonexistence of peaceful equilibria depends only on the costs of fighting and the form of the uncertainty about relative power, and not on the details of the bargaining. When the conditions for peaceful equilibria are met, then a simple mechanism that gives both sides at least the best they could hope for from war is a simple solution. Otherwise, when such an arrangement is not possible, there is no bargaining process, no matter how complicated, that ensures peace."
"94","A final interesting result of our analysis is that the effect of private information and the incentive to misrepresent varies as we vary the structure of the decision maker's uncertainty. This is true even though in each framework we consider there is common knowledge that a settlement exists that both sides prefer to war. The fact that in each framework the conditions on the game form that lead to war are different makes clear that the type of uncertainty that exists in the international environment can have important implications for players' strategies and the probability of war. At the same time, our focus on the informational roots of conflict is not meant to suggest that this is the only potential cause of war. To be clear, this article does not claim to present an all‐inclusive model for war. Rather, we have attempted to provide game form free results for an important class of strategic situations discussed in the literature on private information and war."
"95","One basic assumption that we have used to define this class of games is that any peaceful agreement must be acceptable to both sides of the conflict. This “voluntary agreements” assumption is intended to be general and substantively motivated. We require that there be an action that allows decision makers to reject settlements that give them less than they might expect from fighting, but we do not require that this action leads to a war lottery or even immediate fighting. This flexibility implies that our results hold in many different kinds of games. For example, the fact that our results hold in game forms that include capitulation as a possible outcome distinct from war and peace also aids in clarifying the application of our model to several historical cases. While there are many clear examples of the direct, unilateral use of force such as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, there are other historical cases that could be better categorized as capitulation, such as the invasions of Denmark and Luxembourg in 1940. Thus, our results apply to both kinds of circumstances, including those that involve armed aggression but that ultimately do not involve significant armed conflict. Moreover, as noted above, we can see our results materialize in a wide variety of extensive forms, from alternating‐offers bargaining and wars of attrition to crisis bargaining models and models of extended deterrence (Fearon 1994; Leventoğlu and Tarar 2008; Powell 1996; Schultz 1999; Smith 1998).         "
"96","While our view is that our “voluntary agreements” assumption is a natural consequence of the anarchic nature of the international arena, there may remain some question as to how best to describe the process leading countries to war. One alternative assumption is that war occurs only if both countries agree to fight and otherwise the status quo or an imposed settlement prevails. This assumption has been used to consider the idea of mutual optimism as a cause of war. Central to this literature (Blainey 1988; Wittman 1979) is the claim that both countries must want to fight for a war to occur, hence the name mutual optimism. Not surprisingly, this alternative assumption yields different conclusions about the possibility of war. Thus our results for the case of voluntary agreements highlight the role of private information and the incentives to misrepresent and can be interpreted as the complement to the mutual optimism argument.29"
"97","The other basic assumption we use to define the class of crisis bargaining games is that whatever form the interaction of the two sides takes, the end result is always either a negotiated settlement or war. Dividing outcomes into these two categories seems to us to be quite natural. At the same time, because we make the common assumption that the war outcome is a game‐ending costly lottery, we should consider how our results speak to the recent formal conflict literature on “war as a bargaining process” (Filson and Werner 2002; Powell 2004; Slantchev 2003b). In a manner similar to Powell (2004), we can relax the assumption that fighting is a game‐ending move by supposing that fighting creates a chance of a militarily decisive outcome but can also be indecisive and lead to further negotiations or further fighting. We can fit such a model into our theoretical framework by identifying all terminal nodes with a decisive military outcome as “war” outcomes and all other terminal nodes as “peaceful settlement” outcomes. However, as a number of rounds of fighting can precede any such outcome, we must make changes to two of the assumptions we make about our class of crisis bargaining games. First, we must modify the assumption that peaceful settlements are efficient because if the countries fight for some time before reaching a peaceful settlement, the payoffs to the two countries for such a strategy profile will sum to less than one. Second, for a similar reason we must modify our assumption that a country's war payoff does not depend on the actions taken in the game. The longer the countries choose to fight before a decisive military outcome results, the lower is the expected value of this outcome.         "
"98","How do our results fare if we make these two changes to our framework in order to accommodate models of war as a bargaining process? Reassuringly, it is possible to show that all of our main results continue to hold. In the case of the first change, we show in a companion paper (Fey and Ramsay 2009) that permitting settlement outcomes to be inefficient does not change any of the qualitative features of our results. This is also true with the second change, permitting the war payoff to vary with the actions taken in the game. Rather than provide formal proofs here, instead we briefly explain why our results continue to hold.30 Our reasoning rests on the fact that even if a country's war payoff depends on its actions, as its equilibrium actions depend on its type, we can use the revelation principle to find a direct mechanism in which a country's war payoff depends directly on its type. In this way, Lemma 1 continues to hold. As this lemma is a key ingredient in our proofs, this result, coupled with the fact that the actions of a country can only change its payoff by incurring the costs of multiple rounds of fighting, yields the same characterizations as found in our propositions.

"99","This article has set out to establish general results about the fundamental incentives inherent in crisis bargaining. Rather than fix a particular model and derive results that are limited to this single extensive form, we develop a method to identify properties shared by all equilibria of a large class of crisis bargaining models. The value of this approach is twofold. First, such an approach allows us to cut through the clutter of the endless variety of modeling assumptions, in particular assumptions about sequencing of moves, and to show how uncertainty and the incentive to misrepresent affect the probability of war in a variety of crisis bargaining settings. Second, our “game form free” approach allows us to compare the effect that differences in the kinds of private information possessed by actors have on strategic choices of the actors. We have developed these results across a range of information environments in order to identify conditions under which the positive probability of war is an unavoidable consequence of private information and conditions under which peaceful resolution of conflicts is possible. We have also characterized the nature of such peaceful resolutions. In short, we have found that while it is possible to give general results that support the rationalist explanation of war as a consequence of private information and the incentive to misrepresent this information, the link between private information and war depends in important ways on the types of uncertainty that states face."
"100","Throughout this article, we have emphasized the generality of our approach and the necessity of utilizing such a general approach to justify broad claims about the causes of war. Although we are able to give results that identify specific relationships between information and outcomes, there is an obvious trade‐off between general results and specific predictions. The relative value of the two must depend on the question being asked. In particular, questions regarding particular behaviors in a specific institutional setting call for an approach very different from the one we take here. On the other hand, as a theoretical matter, we may be interested in results that are not institution specific, or that apply to a wide class of different institutions and strategic settings. To the extent that answers to general questions about the relationship between uncertainty and war, independent of institutional specifics, are the object of interest, no iteration of the process of analyzing specific protocols will reveal these general equilibrium phenomena. For these questions, the game‐free approach is a useful tool. As a guiding principle, we endorse the “two‐step” approach outlined in Banks (1990) in which general results are established first using the approach developed here and then additional behavioral predictions are generated from a particular game form that captures specific institutional features of interest.         "
"101","In the end, while this article has laid out a framework for analyzing some general questions about war and peace, several additional aspects of this approach remain to be explored. First, while we have focused on how various theoretical sources of uncertainty may influence the possibility for “well‐designed” institutions to eliminate unwanted, inefficient conflict, it is also true that institutions do not just arrive from nowhere; they are endogenous to the negotiation process between states. It is natural, then, to consider the process by which countries bargain over possible game forms that then govern their interaction. It should be possible to use our approach to deal with such a situation by viewing the institution selection process as itself part of a more broadly defined game and applying the revelation principle.31 Second, although each of the two kinds of uncertainty that we have considered in this article have involved one‐dimensional types, it should also be possible to generalize our approach to allow for multiple‐dimensional types. One example of this kind of uncertainty would be a case in which countries possessed private information about both their own cost of conflict as well as the relative balance of power. We leave the analysis of this case as a topic for further research.         "
