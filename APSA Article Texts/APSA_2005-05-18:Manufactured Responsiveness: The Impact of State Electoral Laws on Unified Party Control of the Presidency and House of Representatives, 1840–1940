"1","Any explanation for the extraordinary responsiveness of nineteenth‐century congressional elections (and weakening during the twentieth century) needs to take into account that America's national elections were largely the sum of state‐level events. In this era of undeveloped national transportation, poor communications, and modestly integrated regionally economies (Wiebe 1967), comparatively few policy demands moved up federalism's ladder to Washington. Reflecting the societal setting, political parties were necessarily confederations of state organizations—themselves frequently riddled by geographically defined factions—that assembled periodically at state and national conventions to select candidates.6 National campaigns were loosely coordinated efforts of these organizations to select their common standard bearer, largely in order to win control of federal patronage that flowed from the White House. Until late in the century, presidential candidates rarely campaigned personally, leaving state parties the latitude to cast their message in the most favorable light. None of this accords well with the requisite features of “nationalized” elections. Presidential campaigns were not bereft of issues but neither were they the robust national appeals of programmatic parties on which highly responsive elections are frequently viewed as resting.         "
"2","Instead of basing responsive elections on systematic swings in the preferences of issue voters, we propose an alternative route that emphasizes the role of institutions in cuing and channeling preferences and distributing votes across districts. Specifically, we posit a two‐stage model (diagrammed below) in which responsive elections are the joint product of strong coattails induced by consolidated party ballots and robust swing ratios generated by efficient gerrymandering.            "

"4","The [Democratic] gentleman from Georgia says, we [Whigs] have deserted all our principles, and taken shelter under General [Zachary] Taylor's military coat tail,” noted Abraham Lincoln in a House of Representatives floor debate over the Whig party's 1848 presidential nomination. He added, “He has no acquaintance with the ample military coat tail of General [Andrew] Jackson? (Safire 1978, 125)                  "
"5","For modern elections presidential coattails refer to a kind of affinity relation in the voter's mind between a political party's presidential nominee and its other candidates running for lower‐level offices. Enthusiasm for the presidential candidate presumably prompts a voter to choose other politicians who would help the president achieve his campaign promises (Campbell and Miller 1957). In the nineteenth century presidential coattails typically did not require voters to make this association across offices. Voters cast party‐supplied tickets headed by the presidential and vice‐presidential candidates and followed by the rest of the party's candidates.7 Unless a voter undertook some extraordinary effort to “split the ballot”—such as tearing and submitting parts of different ballots, scratching off names, or pasting different candidate names over those of the party supplied ticket (Bensel 2004; Reynolds 1988)—in full view of party workers stationed at the polling place, coattail voting occurred by default. Party workers ushering voters to the polls could reliably count in their column even those citizens who expressed weak preferences.            "
"6","Students of electoral history (Ferejohn and Calvert 1984; Moos 1952; Rusk 1970) have previously noted the inherent coattail effects of the party ticket. But generally missed in past scholarship is the fact that not all party tickets induced presidential coattails in House elections because frequently states held these elections on different dates. Until 1872 when federal law consolidated presidential and congressional elections (with minor exceptions), 20 non‐Southern states at one time or another separated House and presidential election calendars by one to ten months.8 During the 33rd Congress (1852), for example, only eight of the 20 states held their congressional and presidential elections on the same day; the other states scheduled their House elections from the preceding August to the following October. In testing the effects of institutional arrangements on electoral responsiveness, it is important to distinguish those elections in Figure 3 where a consolidated party ballot was in place from those “split” ticket systems that arose from different electoral calendars.9"

"8"," Note: We compiled this figure by combining information from Dubin (1998) (on dates of elections) and Ludington (1911), Albright (1942), and Walker (1972) (on ballot laws). In a number of instances, we confirmed the timing of congressional elections by consulting various historical state blue books.                        "
"9","From 1888 through 1911 Australian ballot reform swept the nation (Albright 1942; Evans 1917; Fredman 1968). Not all reform provisions entering state codes—laws limiting access of third and fusion parties to the new state‐supplied ballot (Argersinger 1992)—were hostile to the existing major party organizations. Yet the reforms of interest appear well designed to weaken state parties by breaking the ticket in a couple of ways. First, the secret ballot removed voters from the steady gaze of party workers, and second, the new state‐supplied ballots made it easier for voters to cross party lines in selecting candidates for different offices. The reform ballots took one of two principal formats. The “party column” aligns same party candidates into a column, making it easy for those wishing to vote a straight ticket to do so. Representing a more thorough reform the “office bloc” discourages casual straight ticket voting by locating offices in different areas of the ballot (Burden and Kimball 1998; Rusk 1970). The initial wave of reforms favored the party column, but by the 1920s about half of the congressional elections (see Figure 3) were being decided with office bloc ballots. Below we test for their potentially dissimilar effects on coattail voting.            "
"10","Coattail voting represents only the first cog in the electoral machinery manufacturing presidential votes into congressional seats. At least since Elbridge Gerry's day, politicians have viewed districting as an opportunity to influence future elections. Earlier we noted that Tufte's (1973) seminal analysis of electoral responsiveness showed strong swing ratios attending uniform swings in closely contested, narrowly decided national elections. Yet among the couple of dozen vote‐seat relationships Tufte reports, the strongest swing ratios arose not in Westminster‐style systems but in those nineteenth‐century congressional elections held during presidential election years. Noting the sharp difference between swing ratios for nineteenth‐ and twentieth‐century congressional elections, Tufte attributed the weakening relationship to the modern practice of bipartisan gerrymandering aimed at protecting incumbents of both parties. We accept his insight that design matters but argue that it applies equally well in explaining the exceptional responsiveness of nineteenth‐century elections. Politicians in this era dedicated themselves to congressional redistricting sometimes to the exclusion of other legislative work. As party control of Ohio's state government flip‐flopped repeatedly from 1878 to 1892, the legislature redistricted seven times. In one stretch the state conducted six consecutive elections with six different districting plans (Argersinger 1992, 90; Martis 1982).            "
"11","Nineteenth‐century politicians appear to have calculated political advantage differently than would their risk averse twentieth‐century counterparts and in ways that rendered the era's congressional elections highly responsive to presidential outcomes. Partisan lawmakers during the earlier era were more inclined to construct gerrymanders in which “the dominant party magnifies its popular vote by creating many districts it can reliably but narrowly carry” (Argersinger 1992, 75). Cain (1984) has termed these practices “efficient” gerrymanders since they waste few votes in a party's effort to maximize its seat share—that is, strengthen the swing ratio—by having each district mirror its favorable statewide vote. To return to Ohio's instructive experience, each of the six districting plans effectively converted narrow statewide vote majorities for the controlling party into large seat bonuses to the House of Representatives. In 1886 Ohio Republicans could take special pride in their new district maps that secured them 15 of 21 seats (73%) with only 53% of the statewide vote (Engstrom 2003).10"
"12","The efficient gerrymander stands in contrast with the more familiar packing strategy of twentieth‐century gerrymanders in which supporters of the out‐party are concentrated into one or a few districts while in‐party supporters are distributed evenly throughout the rest of the state (Cain 1984; Cox and Katz 2002; Owen and Grofman 1988). This ensures a number of easy victories for the in‐party while conceding a minimal number of districts to the out‐party. It also yields flatter swing ratios.            "
"13","Why would twentieth‐century politicians prefer this alternative to efficient gerrymandering? One familiar argument (Tufte 1973) holds that during the twentieth century, increasingly careerist incumbents (Kernell 1977; Polsby 1968) in the House of Representatives successfully importuned state legislatures to draw district boundaries insulating them from future challenges.11 Whether state politicians, some of whom might covet a seat in the House of Representatives, would modify their districting preferences to accommodate these budding professionals remains unclear and conjectural (Cox and Katz 2002, 36).12"
"14","The answer might also reflect structural changes in electoral institutions that increased the risk of mistakes.13 Districts with intentionally narrow majorities might in time become narrow minorities, opening the door for a disastrous sweep by the opposition. Efficient gerrymandering required accurate, up‐to‐date election forecasts for which public voting monitored by legions of “district men” (Silbey 1991, 222) proved an essential asset both in identifying who to turnout and for warding off reneging on prior commitments. Moreover, institutionally induced coattail voting meant that this era's politicians did not have to pay as close attention to some of the subtler aspects of voters' preferences including strength and breadth of support down the ticket. An individual whom a party canvasser scored as only marginally favoring James G. Blaine would be escorted to the voting place and safely counted in the Republican column for the House election. This rationale agrees with nineteenth‐century electoral history that finds, “politicians … able to predict outcomes with great accuracy” (Silbey 1991, 153) in large part because “the party structure … provided them with a range and feel of information that the modern politician with … computers and survey data clearly does not have” (Marcus 1971, 10–14; Kernell 2000). The reformed ballot in contrast allowed variations in party loyalty and intensity of preferences to come into play and add an element of uncertainty to the outcome. Voters now privately chose among the parties' individual candidates and could even decide to quit voting as they moved down the ballot into the region of unfamiliar names. Confronted with increased estimation error partisan districters responded rationally (McDonald 1999; Owen and Grofman 1988) by covering targeted districts with extra partisans.            "
"15","Finally, whether measured by the frequency of redistricting or the average age of existing boundaries Figure 4 exhibits a clear trend away from the frequent fine‐tuning of district boundaries that efficient gerrymanders require. Neglect could have arisen from the declining turnover in party control of state governments—itself possibly a result of shortening presidential coattails on state legislative elections after ballot reform—that had triggered redistricting events throughout the nineteenth century (Engstrom 2003).14 Or it might be simply that since packing strategies involved surplus margins they required less maintenance. Whatever its cause Figure 4 traces the steady decline in congressional districting after ballot reform at the same time swing ratios were turning less responsive (Brady and Grofman 1991; Tufte 1973).            "

"17"," Note: We calculated these figures from the redistricting dates reported in Martis (1982).                        "
"18","Control over the critical institutional ingredients in our model—ballot form, district lines and, until the 1880s, election dates—resided with the states.15 As a consequence, in any given election year one finds a number of institutional arrangements in place across the nation. Overall Appendix B displays 17 different combinations of state ballot and calendar laws. While such variety across states cautions against inferences of institutional effects from national‐level data, it represents a godsend for testing the mediating effects of this electoral machinery in a quasi‐experimental setting.16"
"19","Accordingly, we have pooled the relevant electoral and institutional variables for the 37 non‐Southern states for the years 1840 through 1940. Nineteen states entered the Union after 1840, giving us an unbalanced, time‐series cross‐sectional data structure pairing 733 states with presidential elections.17 In the fourth section we reaggregate these state‐level relationships to assess whether they account for national trends in party control of the House of Representatives.         "
"20","To analyze the effect of presidential coattails and differing institutional regimes on House voting we estimate the following equation:               "
"21"," Equation 1 frames two basic tests for the effects of the state Democratic presidential vote on its congressional vote share.19 The first test identifies the direct effect of coattail voting on House elections both under the consolidated ballot, bDPVit, and under various alternative ballot structures, c(DPVit* Bit). If differences in state electoral laws mediate presidential coattails then the coefficient for the stand‐alone presidential vote term (here representing states with a consolidated party ballot) should be significantly stronger than when it is interacted with either off‐November congressional elections or ballot reform. In Table 1 this is what we find. The consolidated party ballot generates a nearly one‐to‐one relationship between statewide votes for the two offices when both were present on the ticket. Separate election calendars cut the coattail effect approximately in half from .87 to .51 (Equation 1a). Ballot reform also trimmed presidential coattails, but contrary to our expectation, the office bloc form reduced the relationship no more than did the party column ballot. In Equation 1b we have consolidated these reforms into a single Australian ballot variable. During the first four decades after the spread of ballot reform, the coattail effect lost about a quarter of its impact—from .86 to .64.20"
"22","A second, indirect test of coattail effects is available by interacting the lagged congressional vote (i.e., the previous midterm vote) with the state's current electoral institutions. Where coattails are hypothesized to be strong, such as states with a consolidated party ballot, the lag effect should be weaker than in settings where presidential from congressional voting were separated. This is precisely what we find in Table 1. Under the consolidated ballot regime, congressional elections did not track past results nearly as closely as they would after ballot reform. The combined weakening of the coattail and strengthening of the lag term presented House members with a much more stable electoral environment for contemplating a career in the House of Representatives. It is probably no coincidence that the proportion of non‐Southern incumbents seeking reelection increased sharply (Kernell 2003) during this period.            "
"23","We also tested a number of control variables that capture important aspects of the broader political setting. With the Democratic vote for both House and president percentaged against a state's total popular vote, the coattail variables (i.e., the presidential vote and its interactions) may be diluted by the presence of third‐party candidates in the presidential or congressional races.21 The positive relationship for the minor party presidential vote indicates that a state's Democratic congressional vote increases with the strength of minor party presidential candidates. This makes sense for a couple of reasons. First, throughout this period, minor party presidential candidates tended to draw votes at the expense of Republican or Whig candidates. And second, Equation 1b controls for the Democratic presidential vote, so that at a given Democratic vote share, the larger the minor party vote the smaller the residual share available to the Whig or Republican candidate. The significant, negative interaction between the minor party presidential vote and the Democratic vote, on the other hand, indicates that the stronger the minor party, the weaker the pull of the coattail. Minor parties occasionally ran House candidates or “fused” their tickets with a major party's nominee. The net effect of the minor party terms (in Equation 1b) reduces the Democratic House vote by one percentage point for each ten‐point gain in the minor party vote.            "
"24","Clearly, the findings indicate that the Australian ballot, whatever its form, weakened the link between presidential and congressional voting. One way to assess the cumulative, national impact of this reform is to ask the counterfactual question: How would the Democratic House vote have differed had ballot reform not occurred? In Figure 5 we simulate this for 1880 (when the 1872 federal law standardizing election dates became “fully” implemented) through 1940.22 Beginning with the 1912 election, when presidential voting grew more volatile, the two series diverge from 1.4 percentage points on average prior to 1912 to over five percentage points afterward. The1932 election is instructive as an exception to this pattern. Here, the spread between the actual and simulated House votes shrinks to about three percentage points. Reprising Tufte's nationalization thesis, this finding suggests that a charismatic candidate promoting a national policy agenda could generate coattails nearly as long as those induced by consolidated ballots. Clearly though, normal nineteenth‐century coattails became exceptional after ballot reform.            "
"25","                 Actual and Simulated House Vote in Presidential Elections, 1880–1940                         "
"26"," Note: We calculated the simulated House vote by passing the actual Presidential vote through the parameters in Equation 1b assuming that the Consolidated Party Ballot was in place for the entire time‐series.                        "
"27","Coattail voting represented only the first stage in the nineteenth‐century manufacture of responsive elections. Vote shares must be transformed into comparable seat shares if presidential coattails were to contribute to unified governments. Above we argue that skilled mapmakers used sharp pencils to draw marginal, yet winnable, congressional districts. After ballot reform they adapted to their more uncertain environment by abandoning efficient gerrymanders in favor of a packing strategy. To test this proposition, we estimate the following vote‐seat relationships:               "
"28","To distinguish efficient from packing strategies consider the vote‐seat relationship as comprised of two components—a swing ratio (captured by the coefficients c and d) and partisan bias.23 Recall from our discussion of Figure 2 the former measures the sensitivity of legislative seat shares to changes in the vote. Bias refers simply to the intercept term, or as commonly stated the party's expected seat share given 50% of the popular two‐party vote. A positive five‐percent bias means that the state's Democratic candidates could expect to win 55% of the seats with 50% of the vote.            "
"29","Following a technique introduced by Cox and Katz (2002)Equation 2 includes a number of interactive terms fashioned to compare the partisan effects of balloting plans drawn before and after ballot reform (Bit).24 If, as we argue, ballot reform altered the redistricting strategies in ways that reduced the responsiveness of congressional elections, the swing ratios for the pre‐reform era should be larger than those for the post‐reform era. To test this we have classified all redistricting events according to the partisan control of the state legislature and governor (taking into account veto override provisions).25 With each party holding a veto redistricting will be less likely to occur under divided control of state government, but when lines were redrawn, these plans should take on a bipartisan cast that reflects each party's option to revert to the current apportionment.            "
"30","In Table 2 we estimate bias and the swing ratio for each party regime presiding over redistricting. Since marginal changes in the vote near the 50% threshold have the largest impact on seat changes and weaken sharply toward a skewed two‐party vote, the vote‐seat function is conventionally represented as a logistic. Moreover, because there is likely a correlation across a state's districts in the probability of Democratic victory we, as do Cox and Katz, assume that seat shares follow an extended beta binomial distribution (King 1989; Palmquist 1998).26"
"31","These relationships confirm that the partisan design of districts rendered the congressional outcomes highly responsive to vote changes before ballot reform and less so after.27 The vote‐seat conversion rates are, as hypothesized, significantly stronger for those redistricting plans passed in the party ticket era (swing ratio of 4.64) than after reform (swing ratio of 3.48). Similarly, districts drawn during divided control of the state government follow our prediction of weaker swing ratios than did their partisan counterparts.            "
"32","The results for bias are presented in the lower half of Table 2. Because bias is directional (favoring one party over the other), we have split the bias coefficients under unified government according to the governing party that wrote the districting plan. During the era of the consolidated party ballot, unified Democratic plans produced a significant pro‐Democratic bias of 3.34% and unified Republican plans, an even greater pro‐Republican bias of 6.41%. Unsurprisingly, plans passed during divided government display insignificant levels of bias.            "
"33","According to these relationships, a statewide vote‐share of 50% yielded the Democrats anywhere from 47 to 56% of their state's delegation depending on the partisan origins of the current plan.28 The post‐reform results for bias are a little less straightforward. While bias for Democratic plans after reform increased to over 7%, bias fell to nearly zero for Republican plans. This discrepancy possibly reflects the geography of the parties' strongholds. Democratic strength in the cities versus Republican dominance in many states' rural areas might have allowed legislators greater latitude in subdividing the more populous and Democratic urban counties where congressional districts had long abandoned the integrity of county boundaries that dictated rural districts in most states.            "
"34","Nevertheless, the overall pattern of results in Table 2 is consistent with our argument that strategic state legislators assiduously designed districts with narrow margins to maximize their parties' success. Moreover, following the adoption of ballot reform, these politicians generally changed the way they approached redistricting. They laid out district boundaries that generated more predictable and stable results—results less sensitive to the vagaries of presidential elections.            "
"35","The statistical relationships uncovered thus far confirm the individual components of our model: first, nineteenth‐century voters, keying on the presidential campaigns, cast coattail ballots for House elections to a significantly greater degree than did their post‐reform counterparts; and second, these votes were generally distributed across districts in a manner that accentuated seat gains of the party winning the statewide plurality. The question before us now is whether, in fact, they combine to solve the puzzle of nineteenth‐century responsiveness that motivated our inquiry."
"36","There are a number of ways to sum the individual parts of the model and assess its overall performance. The standard approach looks to variance explained—in this instance to variance in a party's seat shares in the House of Representatives as a function of coattails and strategic gerrymandering. By this test our institutional variables perform quite well; specifically, the overall estimates based on combining Equations 1b and Table 2 explain 88% of the variance in the actual Democratic seat shares for the House seats introduced in Figure 1. This compares to 66% of the variance explained by the lag term of seat shares for the non‐Southern delegations in the previous Congress. So, knowing only the states' presidential vote gives us a significantly better guess as to the partisan composition of the next House of Representatives than does the make‐up of the current House.         "
"37","In Table 3 we report two additional tests that demonstrate the model's accuracy in generating individual point estimates of Democratic shares for state delegations and Democratic seat shares for individual Congresses. Although we are principally interested in accounting for the highly responsive House elections of the nineteenth century and its subsequent decay in the twentieth, the pervasive cross‐sectional variation in institutional provisions (see Appendix B) offers another way to test the model's ability to reproduce particular partisan outcomes—in this instance, the party composition of individual states' congressional delegations. Again using the lag of the Democratic percentage as the benchmark for comparison, the first two columns of Table 3 show the predictive improvement of our model.29 For most of the nineteenth century our institutional model performs much better. The difference in performance is especially notable during the 1844 to 1888 period when the consolidated ballot was ubiquitous. Our model explains on average 90% of the variance in Democratic shares of state delegations, significantly better than the 81% (p < .05) accuracy for the lag benchmark. During the transition period between the party ticket and Australian ballot the predictive accuracy of our model declines slightly, although on average it still outperforms the baseline. Once the Australian ballot is fully in place across the nation (1912–40), however, our model offers no advantage over the lag term. But this null finding also corroborates our institutional story of a significant decoupling of presidential from congressional elections early in the twentieth century.         "
"38","The second test in Table 3 allows us to assess the accuracy with which state electoral institutions can predict partisan changes in House party delegations from one Congress to the next. For this exercise, we have simply summed the individual predicted seats shares employed for the first test and compared the predicted changes in Democratic share in the last column of Table 3 with the actual changes from the preceding Congress in column 5. Once again, our model, informed wholly by a state's presidential vote, outperforms predictions based on the lag term. Finally, we return to where we began our investigation—the consistent occurrence of unified party control of the presidency and House of Representatives. At this stage to assess the overall performance of the institutional model to account for actual party control of government, we need simply to add the South's large Democratic and small Republican delegations to the estimates in Table 3. When we do so, the model correctly predicts majority party control of the House in 21 out of the 25 presidential elections between 1844 and 1940. And in those instances where we end up on the wrong side of majority control (1848, 1880, 1888, and 1916), the estimates, nevertheless, come very close; the mean absolute error for these four elections is less than ten seats. In sum, whether measured by overall explanatory power or accuracy in estimating party shares of delegations across the states or in the House of Representatives, state electoral institutions had cumulative effects in shaping party control in Washington.         "
"39","Responsive elections are those that amplify a party's plurality support with representation in the legislature. Arguably, the most important implication of responsiveness arises in highly competitive two‐party elections where a small shift in voters' preferences can yield large swings in the parties' seat shares and with it, turnover the control of government. By these criteria America's nineteenth‐century elections were highly responsive and twentieth‐century elections less so. Past research has explained electoral responsiveness as a function of nationalization. Programmatic political parties campaign vigorously on platforms of national issues to appeal to voters who are attentive to these issues in their choices. Nationalization is the ingredient promoting homogeneity across electoral districts and allows small changes in preferences to lead, when other conditions are satisfied, to large changes on election outcomes. Since the quadrennial presidential contest represents about the only consistently national ingredient in nineteenth‐century elections in America, this era's exceptionally high levels of responsiveness presents an anomaly, or puzzle, for this argument. It is compounded by the counter‐trend during the twentieth century that congressional outcomes became less responsive at the same time that American politics became increasingly nationalized."
"40","In this article we have looked for an explanation beyond platforms and preferences to the electoral institutions that cue vote choices and subsequently channel them into districts. In the consolidated party ballot and efficient gerrymandering, nineteenth‐century politicians opted for institutions that magnified slight swings in presidential preferences into pronounced shifts of fortunes in House elections. Minor shifts in party preferences reverberated to House elections via coattails and steep swing ratios. As these institutions were dismantled in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries congressional elections became less responsive. Here, in the details of state codes one finds institutions manufacturing a level of electoral responsiveness that conventional theory reserved for highly nationalized, Westminster‐styled electoral systems."
"41","These findings remind us that manipulating institutional design can have unintended consequences—some desirable, some not—the significance of which can surpass the original purpose of reform. As nineteenth‐century party politicians discovered solutions for their local collective action problems in consolidated ballots and efficient gerrymanders, they were presumably unconcerned that in concentrating their fortunes on presidential contests they staved off balkanization of the party system that a parochial society and robust federalism might otherwise have produced."
