"1","Over the past few years, a number of political scientists and economists have explored the ways in which electoral systems shape policymaking processes and outcomes. We are learning that the rules governing elections have substantial effects on policy, though these effects are largely indirect. For example, electoral systems help determine which actors get a seat at the table and which are excluded. Electoral systems also play a key role in determining how many actors are likely to have a say in policymaking through their effect on the number of political parties and party cohesion. Finally, electoral systems generate incentives for politicians to pursue certain policies over others via their effect on the nature of a politician's constituency (the groups to which he or she responds). It is this latter link between electoral incentives and policy that we explore in this article.4"
"2","We know that the broader the constituency to which politicians are accountable, the stronger the incentives to provide broad public goods. Alternatively, where politicians have very narrow constituencies, they tend to pursue goods and services that can be targeted to smaller groups (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2004; Cox and McCubbins 2001; Franzese, Nooruddin, and Long‐Jusko 2004; Lake and Baum 2001; Olson 2000; Stasavage 2005). Scholars interested in the effects of electoral systems have explored this relationship with an eye towards the different incentives generated by majoritarian versus proportional electoral systems. Several scholars argue, with some empirical support, that majoritarian systems are associated with greater targeting of goods and services to narrow (geographic) groups compared to PR systems (Milesi‐Fereti, Perotti, and Rostagno 2002). On the other hand, other scholars contend that PR, especially closed‐list PR, is more prone to corruption than other types of electoral systems (e.g., Persson and Tabellini 2003). However, within PR systems we observe a marked difference between those that privilege the cultivation of a party vote (closed‐list PR) and those that privilege an individual's reputation and hence the cultivation of a personal vote (e.g., open‐list PR). Open‐list PR, for example, is associated with higher levels of perceived corruption than closed‐list PR (Chang and Golden n.d.).         "
"3","Chang and Golden (n.d.) are representative of a growing number of scholars interested in moving beyond the PR‐majoritarian distinction, as useful as it may sometimes be, to focus instead on the extent to which the electoral and party rules generate incentives for a party vote and party‐centered campaigns or a personal vote and candidate‐centered campaigns (e.g., Ames 1995; Carey and Shugart 1995; Golden 2003; Golden and Chang 2001; Hicken 2006; Nielson 2003; Samuels 1999). The central argument in this literature is that under some electoral systems candidates for office distinguish themselves from their competitors primarily on the basis of partisan differences.5 During election campaigns it is the party's label and reputation that are the key assets for candidates and parties. Typically these are systems where party leaders have strict control over party nominations and where a candidate's success is completely dependent on the party's success. Under other sets of rules, however, personal reputation and candidate‐focused appeals supplant partisan appeals as the dominant strategy for candidates and the primary cue for voters. Incentives to cultivate a personal vote tend to be strongest where there is significant intra‐party competition and where party leaders exercise only weak control over access to the party label.         "
"4","If electoral incentives affect politicians' behavior on the campaign trail, should we not also expect these incentives to shape their behavior once in office? The answer appears to be yes. In personal vote systems, legislators place a greater emphasis than do their party vote counterparts on policies for which they (a) can claim personal credit, and (b) directly and personally control the distribution. Thus, studies of highly personalized systems such as Brazil, Italy, Japan, and Thailand find that the legislators in these systems tend to rely greatly on pork and particularism (Ames 1995; Chang and Golden 2005; Cox and Thies 1998; Golden 2003; Samuels 1999).         "
"5","What we don't know is the extent to which the incentives to cultivate a personal vote and the resulting particularism ultimately affect public goods outcomes. After all, Japan and Italy are among the wealthiest countries in the world while Thailand and Brazil are two of the best performers in the developing world. This raises several questions. Are public goods truly undersupplied in personal vote systems? Does pork barrel spending come at the expense of spending on needed public goods or is it a relatively innocuous disaggregation of public goods expenditures (a different means to the same end)? In short, do personal vote systems really do a poorer job overall at producing needed public policies?"
"6","We argue that indeed, countries with a strong party vote should do a better job at supplying public goods than those with a strong personal vote. This is because the emphasis on policies that individual politicians can directly control and claim credit for generates two sets of costs. First, and perhaps most straightforwardly, personal vote systems are extremely vulnerable to corruption. The combination of the means (access to government resources), opportunity (control by politicians over some of those resources), and motive (the need to raise campaign funds) that can arise in personal vote systems is a recipe for official corruption. It's not surprising, then, that the personal vote and candidate‐centered campaigns are regularly associated with high levels of corruption in the literature (Chang 2005; Chang and Golden n.d.; Cox and Thies 1998; Hicken 2006). Corruption, via diversion of state resources and weaker economic performance, ultimately reduces the amount of resources available to spend on public goods.6"
"7","Even if corruption is low, however, the process of carving up social welfare spending into targetable, politician‐controlled morsels often carries severe efficiency costs.7 To begin with, the diversion of government funds to a particular district imposes costs on other districts and may come at the expense of national policy goals (Lyne and Carroll 2006). In short, the morselization of public spending implies a decision to forego potential gains from economies of scale. This loss might be worthwhile if offset by a more efficient delivery of needed goods and services to smaller constituencies—i.e., specialization. For example, politicians armed with information about the most pressing education needs in their district could potentially make more efficient use of education funds in that district than would be possible if spending were mandated and controlled by central government officials. However, given politicians' electoral incentives it is perhaps not surprising that their first priority is often not efficiency. Instead, their primary concern is to use the funds at their disposal in ways that help them develop and maintain the personal support network necessary for reelection. When allocation and distribution are based primarily on political rather than economic calculations, dead weight losses occur and as a result outcomes may depart quite substantially from any measure of economic or social efficiency.8"
"8","A couple of examples from the Philippines underscore the way in which public goods provision may suffer where there are strong incentives to cultivate a personal vote. Filipino legislators have access to large amounts of pork. Traditionally they spend a good portion of their pork allotment on various health care, education, and infrastructure projects for their district.9 These politicians contend they are meeting needs that would otherwise go unmet and in the process promoting economic development and reducing poverty. But in fact, pork is primarily a political, not a developmental tool (Cruz and Chua 2004). For example, legislators often give large donations to hospitals in their districts to care for those who lack the capacity to pay. However, only a legislator's political supporters are typically eligible for this subsidized care. Patients must present an ID card or a letter signed by the politician identifying them as a political supporter before receiving care (Cruz and Chua 2004).         "
"9","Politically driven inefficiencies in the Philippines are not confined to the provision of health care. In the area of education, politicians often award scholarships to students in their districts. The primary distribution criterion for these awards is not financial need or academic merit, but rather the political affiliation of the students or their parents.10 Politicians also spend enormous sums every year from various pork barrel funds to purchase textbooks for schools. Yet there remains a chronic shortage of required textbooks in most Filipino schools—as few as one textbook for eight students. How can this be given the amount spent on textbooks each year? It seems that politicians prefer to spend their funds on supplementary textbooks and education materials rather than on the required texts used in core courses. The reason: the Department of Education has established limits on the price of required textbooks while there is no such ceiling for supplementary textbooks and materials (Chua 2000). Politicians prefer to purchase these supplementary textbooks at greatly inflated prices since the higher margins on these books translate into bigger “commissions” or kickbacks for the purchasing politician. The net result—schools are awash in overpriced education materials they don't need while lacking the basic texts needed to educate students (Chua 2000).         "
"10","Consider, as a contrast, the spending incentives where the party's reputation is at a premium. In such circumstances the goal of winning a nontrivial number of seats in the legislature provides an incentive for parties and their membership to use policies that appeal to a broader segment of the population. Doing so enables the party to form a positive relationship with a large swath of the voting public. As a result, party‐centered systems should be associated with politicians who are relatively more concerned about achieving the efficiency and economies of scale associated with broad public goods provision due to the benefits for the party label."
"11","In addition to the incentives to appeal to broader constituencies, party‐centered systems also enjoy stronger party discipline than do candidate‐centered systems. First, because the system places a premium on the party's reputation relative to individual candidates', individual party members are less likely to defect from the party's collective goals in pursuit of narrowly targeted goods that do little to benefit the party as a whole. Second, party leaders in party‐centered systems are typically delegated greater authority to protect the party reputation and impose discipline on party backbenchers. Party leaders' control of ballot access and order, campaign financing, and legislative/postlegislative careers enables them to rein in personalism/particularism while promoting policies that benefit the party collectively (Cox and McCubbins 2001; Grossman and Helpman 2005; Nielson 2003).11"
"12","In summary, we propose that candidate‐centered electoral rules will correlate with a systematic undersupply of public goods and that spending on budgetary categories nominally called “public services,” such as public spending on education and health, will be associated with corruption and efficiency losses.12 Note that our argument about the public goods consequences of particularism and the personal vote does not include directional prediction about the amount of spending on public services. Instead, we expect to see no relationship between the personal vote and aggregate levels of spending. Particularistic spending is not a substitute for the level of spending on public services—public services expenditures themselves can be turned to particularistic purposes without having to resort to the politically risky move of slashing spending on public services. In other words, we don't very often expect to see legislators slashing education spending to free up more resources for pork. (If such were the case we should observe a negative relationship between particularism and total education spending.)13 Instead, as we argued previously, particularism in personal vote systems should generally take the form of policy morselization or commodification within existing amounts of spending. Less efficient targeted spending may displace more encompassing forms but total spending on public services need not significantly change. With this logic in mind, our argument has important implications about the effect of democracy in public goods and public service spending. A number of scholars have found a positive relationship between democracy and spending on public services (Lake and Baum 2001; Stasavage 2005). Scholars often find that democracy is correlated with greater education spending and by extension some reason that democracy should also be correlated with better education outcomes (Stasavage 2005). We counter that improved education outcomes will not necessarily follow from a move to democracy and the resulting increase in spending. Specifically, if our argument is correct, we should find that in some democracies strong incentives to cultivate a personal vote will undermine or negate the impact of increased spending on education outcomes.         "
"13","We test these ideas using data from a sample of democratic less developed countries between the years 1980 and 1998. We code a country as being democratic if its Polity score is greater than 0 on a scale of –10 to 10.14 We test our hypothesis regarding the relationship between incentives to cultivate a personal or party vote and public goods provision by investigating whether those incentives modify the effects of education spending on the level of illiteracy. Our dependent variable is the percent of the population over the age of 15 years that is illiterate.15 We note that in our sample the illiteracy variable is right‐skewed to a significant degree; the vast majority of countries in our sample fall within the range of 5–30% illiteracy, but some countries have values in excess of 60%. To ensure that these extreme observations do not drive our results, we use logged values of illiteracy rates.         "
"14","We rely on the variables and coding scheme developed by Carey and Shugart to operationalize the extent to which the political setting places a premium on cultivating a personal or party vote. They offer three variables, Ballot, Pool, and Vote, each of which is coded 0, 1, or 2, where higher values denote greater incentives to cultivate a personal vote. Ballot measures “the degree of control party leaders exercise over ballot rank in electoral list systems” (1995, 418). A score of 0 indicates a situation in which the leader presents a ballot that voters cannot change, 1 represents systems in which leaders present party lists that voters can change, and 2 is assigned if leaders do not control the ballot at all. Pool codes whether votes for one candidate affect the number of seats won in that district by the party as a whole. A score of 0 means that “a vote for any candidate of a given party is counted first as a vote for the whole party list for the purpose of determining how many seats are to be allocated to the list” (421), 1 indicates that votes are pooled across candidates or factions in the same party, and 2 indicates that no pooling occurs at all. Lastly, Vote codes the rules articulating the nature of the voter's choice. A score of 0 means that voters cast one vote and must cast it for a party, 1 indicates that voters have multiple votes and can cast them for multiple candidates, and 2 indicates a system where voters have a single vote and must choose from among several candidates.            "
"15"," Wallack et al. (2003) collect data based on Carey and Shugart's scheme for 158 countries, and we use these data for our analyses.16 Wallack et al. make a couple of changes from the original Carey and Shugart scheme, however. First, rather than coding Ballot, Pool, and Vote as strictly trichotomous variables, they code them as the “weighted averages … for each group of legislators that is elected under a different set of rules” (2002, 13). They also create a variable, parindex, that is the average of Ballot, Pool, and Vote.17 We will use each of the indicators in the analysis below.            "
"16","To test our hypothesis that personal vote systems are associated with efficiency losses with respect to public goods provision, we estimate the following equation:                "
"17","We estimate equation 1 on a cross‐section of just under 40 democratic countries. While the use of a time series cross‐section (TSCS) sample of countries is increasingly common in studies of comparative political economy, and we will make use of a TSCS sample in a robustness check, we believe a cross‐sectional model is the most appropriate choice given the nature of the data. The independent variables of interest for us are institutions that are time‐invariant for most countries and change only rarely for others. The TSCS format would likely call for the inclusion of country effects (in fact, Wald tests indicate we should include country dummies), which will be highly correlated with the time‐invariant variables and would therefore wash out any effects of the institutions that are the focus of our study. A cross‐sectional design is more appropriate. We estimate all cross‐section models with White's heteroskedastic‐consistent standard errors.            "
"18","Our theory leads us to expect the following: β1 in equation 1 should be negative, telling us that education spending reduces illiteracy when either parindex, Ballot, Pool, or Vote equal 0 (i.e., when those variables identify a party‐centered political system). However, β3 should be positive, indicating that education spending is less effective at reducing illiteracy in personal vote systems. That is, assuming a negative coefficient on β1, a positive coefficient on β3 is consistent with our proposition that personal vote systems are associated with efficiency losses with respect to the provision of public goods and services. Governments may increase spending, but rather than aiming to reduce illiteracy and attaining the growth consequences thereof, leaders opt to spend on pork. Additionally, in such systems corruption may decrease further the efficacy of education spending for illiteracy reduction. Table 1 lists the sample of included countries with their values on the key variables. It also presents the summary statistics.            "
"19"," Table 2 presents our main results in a series of seven models. The first estimates the effect of education spending on the illiteracy variable without including the interaction term between education spending and any of our institutional variables. Model 2 estimates equation 1 including parindex as the institutional variable. Model 3 replaces the original, continuous coding of parindex with a dichotomous measure, while Model 4 uses a trichotomous measure. We recode the variable as there are only a few scattered observations that do not take values of 0, 1, or 2 in the original continuous coding. This is relevant since we want to know the range of the modifying variable where the marginal effect of education spending is statistically significantly different from zero and where it is not. For those values of the modifying variable where there are only one or two observations, it is impossible to tell whether failure to reject the null hypothesis occurs because it is an accurate estimate of the truth (i.e., there is in actuality too much variation at the level of the institution in question to reject the null hypothesis) or because there are simply too few cases from which to draw information. By recoding the variables, we avoid this issue. We use trichotomous codings of Ballot, Pool, and Vote respectively for the same reason. Those results are displayed in Models 5–7 in Table 2.20"
"20","We start our discussion with Model 1. Here we find that most regions of the world have lower illiteracy rates than in sub‐Saharan African countries and that GDP is negatively correlated with illiteracy. Notably, we find no statistically significant effect of education spending on the illiteracy rate.21"
"21","Model 2 tells a more nuanced story. Here, the coefficient on education spending is negative, which tells us that when parindex equals 0, education spending reduces illiteracy. This is as expected. Substantively, the sizes of the coefficients are notable. These results say that a one‐unit increase in education spending (e.g., moving from 1% of GDP to 2%) corresponds with an 8.5% decrease in the log of illiteracy. Since illiteracy itself is in percentage form, we need to go further to get a sense of what this coefficient means. In our sample, the mean illiteracy score is 19.6%. Therefore, a one‐unit increase in education spending, when parindex equals 0, would decrease illiteracy in a country with the mean value from about 19.6% to about 18%.22"
"22","Notice, however, that the positive coefficient on the interaction term suggests that the marginal effect of increasing education spending on illiteracy reduction is weaker where strong incentives to cultivate a personal vote are present. That is, in personal vote systems, education spending reduces illiteracy less than in party vote systems. Kam and Franzese (2007) and Brambor, Clark, and Golder (2005) recommend that we plot the marginal effect of education spending on illiteracy over the range of parindex to get a better sense of the processes at work here as the significance tests we report are uninterpretable given the interaction term.23Figure 1 displays six graphs. In each, the solid line represents the marginal effect of education spending, while the dashed lines are the 90% confidence intervals around that marginal effect. The top left graph presents results from Model 2 in Table 2, which uses the original continuous coding of parindex. The center graph in the same row uses the dichotomous measure and the last graph uses the trichotomous measure. The bottom row of graphs comes from Models 5–7 from Table 2.            "
"23","                 The Marginal Effect of Education Spending on Illiteracy as Incentives to Cultivate a Personal Vote Increase (Using Continuous, Dichotomous, and Trichotomous Parindex Measures and Trichotomous Measures of Ballot, Pool, and Vote)                         "
"24","Starting with the first graph in the top row, we see results that support our hypothesis. The marginal effect of education spending on illiteracy is significantly negative only when parindex indicates the lowest incentives to cultivate a personal vote and the highest incentives to campaign on the party's reputation. As incentives to cultivate a personal vote increase, the confidence interval around the marginal effect are on either side of the 0 line, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the marginal effect of education spending on illiteracy is 0. Notice also the positive slope to the marginal effect line. These results are consistent with our argument that when incentives to cultivate a personal vote are high, legislators place a small premium on the economies of scale associated with public goods and prefer instead to allocate budgetary resources in a form they can easily distribute and for which they can claim credit when voters go to the polls. The middle graph in the figure, using the dichotomous measure, supports this conclusion as well. When we use the trichotomous measure, however, the results are somewhat less supportive.24 Although a similar trend exists in that the marginal effect of education spending tends toward zero with increasing particularism, we find no value of parindex where the effect of education spending is a statistically significant predictor of illiteracy rates.            "
"25","The bottom row of graphs investigates our hypothesis further by using the trichotomous codings of the three constituent variables.25 Once again we observe that education spending decreases illiteracy only when the institutional variable in question indicates low levels of political particularism and high incentives for candidates to cultivate the party vote. The lone exception to this trend is the model using Pool. In that case, there is no value of the modifying institution where education spending is statistically significant.            "
"26","We turn now to an assessment of the stability of our estimates. There is some evidence of influential outliers and in a small sample like ours, these can be especially damaging. Using Model 2 from Table 2, we create partial regression plots with respect to education spending, parindex, and their interaction respectively and show them in the top graphs in Figure 2. We have labeled the countries that look to be influential. Four cases, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Uruguay, have either DFFITS values above the threshold or Cook's Distance scores above that threshold.26 We examine the effects of these observations by estimating a series of models, inserting dummies for each of these observations. The results are displayed in Table 3. Our conclusions do not change with the inclusion of these dummies. In each, education spending is negative but the interaction between spending and parindex is positive.27 That said, including dummy variables is not an altogether appealing strategy for dealing with outliers as there is no theoretical reason to add more variables to the model. Nor is dropping these observations appealing. As Granato, Inglehart, and Leblang note, in a small sample like ours, dropping cases discards useful information and perhaps more importantly, “one imagines a situation where after deleting observations and re‐estimating the model other influential cases are identified and are removed. This process continues until few interesting observations remain” (1996, 623). We thus conduct a robustness check described in Welsch (1980) and used by Granato, Inglehart, and Leblang to further analyze the stability of our results.28 Welsch suggests a bounded‐influence estimator conducted as follows. First, estimate OLS and calculate the DFFITS for all observations. Then, estimate the model of interest using weighted least squares with weights calculated as follows:            "
"27","                 Top Row: Added‐Variable Plots Form the Baseline Models for Variables Education Spending, Parindex, and Their Interaction. Bottom Row: Results from Bounded‐Influence Estimation and Models TSCS 1 and TSCS 2 (Both from Table 3)                         "
"28","                              "
"29","Weight = 1 if |DFFITS| ≤ .34."
"30","Weight = (.34/|DFFITS|) if |DFFITS| >.34."
"31","Welsch suggests the value .34 as it provides for approximately 95% asymptotic efficiency. We conduct this procedure and show the DFFITS and weights in the last columns of Table 1. The results of bounded‐influence estimation are displayed in Table 3. The corresponding marginal effect graph is shown in the bottom left of Figure 2. The substantive conclusions do not change when we use this procedure. The marginal effect of education spending is negative when parindex equals 0, but the positive coefficient on the interaction term suggests that this effect of education spending is reduced in personal vote systems.            "
"32","To this point, we have found what we think are interesting and novel results. The extent to which electoral rules and institutions provide incentives for legislators to cultivate a personal reputation has an important modifying effect on the efficacy of education spending at reducing illiteracy. When such incentives are low and incentives to cultivate the party's reputation are high, education spending has a statistically significant downward pressure on illiteracy rates. By contrast, where the incentives to cultivate a personal vote increase, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect of increasing education spending on illiteracy. These results hold for our summary indicator of personal versus party‐centered systems and for the constituent parts of that summary indicator. The conclusions do not appear to be due to influential outliers."
"33","Furthermore, the effect of the personal vote seems to work entirely through how personalism affects the allocation of education spending, rather than on the level of education spending. In a set of four models, we tested whether the measures of particularism predict the level of education spending and we found none of the indicators had a statistically significant effect. We also regressed illiteracy rates on both education spending and parindex additively but without their interaction. The p‐value on the index's coefficient was 0.98.29"
"34","As a final sensitivity analysis, we test our hypothesis using a TSCS sample of countries. Even as our cross‐sectional results are supportive (and, we believe, the more appropriate model given the structure of the data), a TSCS sample can be useful for several reasons. First, a TSCS sample allows us to control for likely endogeneity better than we can in our small cross‐section sample. In our equations, we have included GDP per capita on the right‐hand side. However, in the theory, we noted the effects of literacy and human capital formation for economic development. There is, then, reason to believe that illiteracy and GDP per capita have an endogenous relationship. Our cross‐section sample is too small, however, to account for that relationship reliably. With a TSCS model, we can lag our right‐hand‐side variables one period, which grants us some relief from the endogeneity concern."
"35","A second reason we turn to a TSCS sample is so that we can have a more precise sample of democratic countries. A country is included in our cross‐section sample if its average Polity 2 score is greater than 0 for the entire period over which we have data. Such a coding scheme may be problematic in that it will exclude countries that have had democratic episodes that were shorter than their episode of dictatorship as well as those countries whose democratic episodes were only moderately democratic (say, a Polity score of 6), but whose autocratic episode were more extreme (a value of −10). A TSCS sample can make these issues less pronounced since a country can be democratic for some shorter period and still be included in the sample."
"36","That said, some estimation issues warrant discussion before discussing the TSCS results. First, because literacy rates move only very slowly over time, we need to be careful in how we model the temporal dependence. Tests from a TSCS database using yearly data reveal that illiteracy exhibits a unit‐root when the data are at that level of detail. To avoid the concerns unit‐roots cause for statistical inference, we estimate the relevant equations using panels of five years each, again between the years 1980 and 1998, where the observation for each country i, in panel p, is the average value of that variable for every year in that panel for which we have data.            "
"37","Another concern is how we account for unit‐heterogeneity. Wald tests indicate unit‐specific indicators are needed in the model to avoid omitted variable bias, but the inclusion of country dummies will minimize the explanatory power of our key independent variables—many of which are nearly time‐invariant (i.e., parindex) or temporally sluggish (education spending as a percent of GDP and the percent of the population living in rural areas). One alternative specification is to use a random effects model, but the strict exogeneity assumptions that go along with that model are likely to be violated with our data.            "
"38","Our approach is to follow the strategy outlined in Plümper and Troeger (2004). Their suggestion is to use a three‐step approach where the first stage estimates the relationship between the dependent variable and the fixed effects; stage 2 uses the vector of fixed effects coefficients reported in stage 1 as the dependent variables and includes only the slowly moving and time‐invariant independent variables on the right‐hand side. The final stage places the original dependent variable on the left‐hand side of the equation and includes all independent variables of interest and also the stage 2 residuals on the right. Stage 3, then, includes all of the variables of theoretical interest to us while also including that part of the country‐specific effects that are uncorrelated with the slowly moving and time‐invariant independent variables. With this procedure, we can estimate a model with invariant and slowly moving right‐hand‐side variables, include the necessary country effects, and are not subject to the strict exogeneity assumptions included in the random effects model. Plümper and Troeger's Monte Carlo simulations show that this approach has better properties than a random effects model, pooled OLS, or the Hausman‐Taylor instrumental variable approach. The authors write:            "
"39","                              "
"40","This procedure adopts the robustness of the fixed effects model and allows for correlation between explanatory variables and the unobserved individual effects. The effects of time varying factors are consistently analyzed and remain unbiased. Since fixed effects are robust with respect to potential correlation between right hand side variables and the individual specific effects the exogeneity of explanatory variables is not required. (9)30"
"41","Using this approach, we use the same controls as in the baseline cross‐section models. However, education spending, parindex, GDP per capita, and rural population are entered in 1‐period lags to indicate our expectation that the effects of these variables take time to manifest in observable improvements in literacy. Our sample includes countries that have an average Polity score greater than 0 for two consecutive five‐year panels. That is, to enter into the sample, the country must be democratic in the present period and in the previous panel when the education‐related resources were allocated.31"
"42","The results are displayed in the last two columns of Table 3. In these models, the coefficients in bold italics denote the variables we treat as slowly moving/time invariant. TSCS 1 uses the continuous measure of parindex and TSCS 2 uses the trichotomous coding.32 Turning to the estimated coefficients in TSCS 1, we see that the lagged dependent variable is somewhat close to 1 indicating that we should still be wary of a unit‐root, but the t‐statistic is large, giving us confidence that we are safe from such concerns. The control variables also perform as expected with illiteracy decreasing with wealth, decreasing with urbanization, and most regions of the world performing better on illiteracy statistics than sub‐Saharan Africa. Here we see further evidence in support of our hypothesis. In model TSCS 1, education spending reduces illiteracy when parindex equals 0, but as before, this effect of education spending is less negative with increases in the index.33 TSCS 2, using the trichotomous parindex, tells the same story.            "
"43","The last two graphs in the bottom row of Figure 2 use the results from TSCS 1 and TSCS 2 to graph the marginal effect of education spending on illiteracy. As before, the efficacy of education spending on illiteracy reduction is contingent upon institutions that shape which reputation receives a political premium. The marginal effect of education spending is negative and significant in party‐centered systems, but trends toward zero with increases in parindex and becomes statistically insignificant.            "
"44","Our aim in this article is to better understand the ways in which electoral and party systems affect public goods provision. To understand this relationship we need to look not only at how incentives to cultivate a personal vote shape spending decisions, but also whether/under what conditions those decisions affect the policy outcomes we ultimately care about. In our attempt to examine the effects of spending on public goods provision we have focused on education spending and illiteracy. Our core findings can be summarized as follows. First, we find that incentives to cultivate a personal vote dampen the marginal effect of increased education spending on illiteracy and at their highest levels particularistic incentives completely undermine the positive effects of increased education spending on literacy. Second, there appears to be no significant relationship between our measure of particularistic incentives and the level of education spending. In other words, the effects of the personal vote on illiteracy operate through the efficiency of education spending rather than on the level. While democracies may spend more on education that nondemocracies (as several scholars have found), the effect of greater spending on education outcomes depends on the type of democratic institutions in place."
"45","There are several intriguing questions worth exploring in future work. To begin with, do the patterns we observe in education policy appear in other areas as well, for example health or infrastructure? Could we more directly observe actual forms of spending that would allow us to track the differences in the form of spending in personal and party vote systems? At present we can say that the spending and illiteracy results are consistent with our theory but we do not directly observe the way in which education budgets are allocated. To do so we would need detailed data on allocations within the education budget. We are currently exploring the feasibility of collecting such data. It would be worth exploring further the differences in the way each component of parindex affects illiteracy. Finally, an interesting question is whether you can have too much of a good thing—whether extremely high levels of party centeredness undermine the incentives to provide needed public policies. As discussed earlier we were unable to explore this question here given the nature of the available data, but we hope to return to the question in future work.         "
