"1","An influential body of theory suggests that electoral law has a critical influence on the resolution of the individual‐collective conflict within the party (Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987; Cox and Rosenbluth 1995; Shugart and Carey 1992). The typology of candidate‐centered versus party‐centered electoral rules developed by Carey and Shugart (1995) categorizes electoral systems according to the degree to which they create incentives for intraparty competition and weaken party leaders versus reducing incentives for intraparty competition and strengthening leaders. Rules that foster internal competition, by allowing voters to choose between members of the same party, as with primaries, open lists, and the single nontransferable vote, are labeled candidate‐centered. They create strong incentives for rank and file to focus on activities that allow them to differentiate themselves from copartisans in order to get nominated or (re)elected. Since the party's national policy positions and reputation are a common component of all individual members' electoral appeal, it cannot serve as a means for internal differentiation. Internal differentiation necessarily requires behavior that is at best irrelevant to the party's policy reputation, but at worst can directly undermine it. Certain kinds of constituency service, such as the resolution of one‐off bureaucratic errors or assistance in accessing available services, are typically unrelated to the party reputation, but other activities aimed at internal differentiation can be directly damaging to the party's policy‐based appeal.         "
"2","Individual legislators often would prefer exceptions to universal policies like trade liberalization or tax reform for their own constituents. With intraparty competition, they will be tempted to vote against such policies or seek exceptions for their constituents in order to demonstrate their ability to effectively represent local interests and differentiate themselves from challengers from within the same party. Similarly, extensive pork barreling that undermines party positions such as fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability, or electoral reform can also be damaging to the party reputation. All of these behaviors designed to develop personal reputations can harm both the policy reputation of the party (fiscally conservative, pro‐free trade) as well as the substantive pursuit of a given policy goal (balanced budget, tax reform). Excessive individualist behavior can thus undermine the credibility of party electoral appeals based on the collective voting record or a substantive policy outcome and can provide powerful ammunition for the party's opponents in the next election (Cox and McCubbins 1993, 123). But if individual members face competition from those within their own party, as this framework highlights, those who refrain from bucking the party in the interest of their own constituents risk being defeated by challengers who pledge to do so.         "
"3","Electoral rules' influence on internal competition is combined with an examination of how the rules affect party leadership leverage over rank and file. Once again, rules like primaries or open lists, which deny leaders control over the ballot, reduce their leverage in managing individual legislators' behavior. Party‐centered rules, in contrast, have the opposite effect. Closed lists eliminate incentives for internal differentiation among the rank and file and provide leaders with direct control of the electoral fate of individual members. They thus enhance parties' ability to behave as coherent collective actors (Carey and Shugart 1995; Cox and McCubbins 2001; Cox and Rosenbluth 1995; Ramseyer and Rosenbluth 1993).         "
"4","These powerful arguments have been used to buttress analyses that conclude that Brazilian parties fail to function as meaningful collective actors. Many scholars have emphasized the highly candidate‐centered nature of Brazil's electoral rules and argue that these rules lead to high levels of individualist behavior (Ames 2001; Geddes 1994; Mainwaring 1995, 1999; Shugart and Carey 1992). Scholars point to a variety of different types of evidence to support the causal connection between electoral law and pervasive personal electioneering, including corruption (Geddes and Ribeiro Neto 1992), pork barreling (Ames 1995a, 1995b), an ineffective and patronage‐ridden bureaucracy (Geddes 1994), parties with only minimal extra‐parliamentary organization and high levels of party switching (Mainwaring 1999), and low levels of unity in legislative voting (Ames 2001; Mainwaring and Perez‐Liñan 1997). Shugart and Carey (1992) developed a rationale for the choice for such extreme candidate‐centered electoral law, which they dubbed the “inefficient secret.” According to this view, the extreme individualist incentives created by Brazil's rules are designed to allow legislators to focus exclusively on servicing local constituencies, while delegating national collective policy responsibility to the president.1"
"5","Few of these studies, however, examine whether there are any forces that countervail the individualist incentives of Brazil's electoral law, or whether there is any empirical evidence to suggest that parties might also be functioning as national collective actors.2 At the same time, a number of these studies argue that personalist politicking in Brazil seriously undermines parties as collective actors.3 In sum, this scholarship established a long‐dominant conventional wisdom that parochialism in Brazilian politics is so extreme that parties are unable to represent national policy positions and do not compete electorally on the basis of such positions.         "
"6","This view has been increasingly challenged, however, with systematic empirical data on intraparty unity, interparty difference, bill proposal behavior, electoral coalitions, cabinet composition, and legislative support for the executive policy agenda, demonstrating that Brazilian leaders have greater powers, and that parties are considerably more internally unified and externally differentiated than depicted in this earlier literature (Amorim Neto and Santos 2003; Figueiredo and Limongi 2000; Limongi and Figueiredo 1995; Lyne 2005). The collective action theory of internal party organization illuminates how and why party leaders will seek to balance personalist electioneering with a national party reputation and can unify these apparently contradictory findings.         "
"7","The new literature on internal party organization has made a bold contribution to the continuing debate over the determinants of unity in legislative voting.4 According to this view, parties are unlikely to succeed in maintaining unity over time absent leadership intervention (Cox and McCubbins 1993). As noted above, the party policy reputation is common to all members of the party. Moreover, no individual member who runs under the party's label can be excluded from the electoral benefits derived from such a policy reputation. If voters look to the party label for information about policy positions, and use this information in their voting decision, all of the party's candidates will benefit (or suffer) electorally from the party's policy record whether they voted to maintain that record or not.         "
"8","In other words, the party's policy reputation is a classic collective good for individual members of the party, and thus, ensuring that all do their share in maintaining that reputation presents them with a prisoner's dilemma (Cox and McCubbins 1993). In the absence of a system that punishes those who fail to vote for policies critical to that record, for example, no individual member has an incentive to contribute his vote when the party program clashes with the interests of his constituents. An individual member who votes against the party program in the interest of his district still enjoys the benefit of the information conveyed through the party reputation come election time. Thus, without a system to monitor and punish those who do not support the party on key votes, voting unity will collapse and the party reputation will suffer.         "
"9","This is a particularly important addition to our understanding of unity, since it shows that even if members have common collective policy goods positions, they may not be able to vote in a unified fashion absent delegation to a central agent. The recognition that the party's policy record, as embodied in the party label, is a collective good for all members means that the individual‐collective conflict is not amenable to a spontaneous solution. Since personal reputations are private goods, individual legislators can be relied upon to look after their provision, but absent explicit organization, the collective good of a party label with collective policy content will be undersupplied (Cox and McCubbins 1993).         "
"10","Of course, this view of party policy reputations raises the question: undersupplied compared to what? A second crucial component of the theory is that choices about internal organization are driven by electoral incentives. Without sufficient organization to overcome the collective action problem associated with maintaining voting unity, parties will supply fewer collective goods than desired by the electorate. Parties that organize to solve this collective action problem will be better equipped to provide the electorally optimal level of collective goods and thus will prosper electorally in comparison to those that fail to so organize (Cox and McCubbins 1993).         "
"11","Combined with the electoral law literature discussed above, this work provides a reinterpretation of effective party organization. When rules allow voters an intraparty choice, personalist electioneering that does not interfere with the party reputation becomes a net plus in terms of party electoral success. Not all roll calls are likely to be important for maintaining the party's policy reputation, and judicious choices about when to punish dissenters can in fact increase electoral success in comparison to demanding strict loyalty on all votes. In other words, effective party organization is that which, within the parameters of the given system, strikes the electorally optimal balance between maintaining the collective reputation for providing national policies and personalist electioneering (Cox and McCubbins 1993).         "
"12","At first glance, it might appear that Brazilian party leaders lack the necessary powers to influence rank‐and‐file behavior sufficient to counteract the incentives of the highly personalist open‐list proportional representation rules that govern federal legislative elections. Brazilian party leaders have limited control over the ballot and do not have robust direct powers for controlling floor voting. As has been shown for the American case, however, ballot control and other direct means of influencing the electoral fate of the rank and file do not exhaust the possibilities for influencing their voting behavior.5 Like their American counterparts, contemporary leaders in Brazil have other tools at their disposal to counter excessively individualist behavior that might damage the party's policy reputation. Party leaders have powerful agenda‐setting powers and can override committee jurisdiction (Amorim Neto, Cox, and McCubbins 2003; Pereira and Mueller 2000). In addition, the allocation of resources for local districts is highly institutionalized and centralized in party leaders' hands. Budget procedures allow individual legislators to request locally targeted funds through formal submissions of amendments to the annual budget. Legislators typically submit amendments totaling the maximum allowed sum of 2,000,000 reais, and Budget Committee approval is largely a formality. The decision to actually release funds to the individual deputies, however, is controlled by party leaders in conjunction with the executive. These resources are critical to deputies' ability to build personal reputations (Ames 2001).6"
"13","Interview data and regression analysis strongly support the view that party leaders wield these resources in order to influence rank‐and‐file behavior and ensure unity in legislative voting. In contemporary Brazil, party leaders publicly announce and publish the party position on all roll‐call votes and lead the floor voting.7 Monographic work (Beatriz 1999), interviews with Congressional staff, and staff to the PMDB, PSDB, and government leaders in the Chamber of Deputies confirmed that party leaders carefully monitor rank‐and‐file voting, and reward those who vote according to leadership dictates with locally targeted resources, and punish those who vote against the leadership by withholding such resources.8"
"14","These interview results are corroborated by quantitative analysis of the determinants of the receipt of locally targeted resources. Since 1996, the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies has maintained public records on the release of funds requested through individual budget amendments. The dependent variable is total resources received in the given legislative year.9 Independent variables used to predict the receipt of locally targeted resources include party loyalty in legislative voting (Ployl), electoral performance in the most recent election (Eperf), seniority (Sen), and dominance (Dom). A legislator's party loyalty score is measured as the percent age of roll calls in which he votes as recommended by the leadership.10 Electoral performance is the ratio of the deputy's vote total to the number of votes it takes to win a seat in his district (the electoral quotient), which provides a measure that is standardized across districts. Seniority is a count of terms served. Dominance, as developed by Ames (2001), is a measure of the degree to which a deputy has developed a solid personal following in the municipalities that make up the statewide district.11 Since many scholars have emphasized the importance of state‐level influences, I also controlled for the state of the deputy.12"
"15","As the data in Table 1 demonstrate, party loyalty is positive and significant for five of the six largest parties, at the .001 level for four and at the .05 level for the fifth. Moreover, no other variable is significant for more than three parties: seniority is significant for two parties (PMDB and PFL), and dominance is significant for three (PSDB, PMDB, and PPB). In other words, loyalty to the party in legislative voting is by far the most consistent predictor of who will receive resources for their local constituencies in contemporary Brazil. Party leaders have clearly intervened consistently to reward loyal party voting.         "
"16","If party leaders wielded roughly the same powers in both regimes and wielded all powers save that of disbursement of budget funds similarly, then an identical analysis of budget fund distribution would provide a valid test of whether leaders intervened in a similar fashion to promote unity across both periods. This level of control in comparative intertemporal social science analysis, however, is rarely possible, and theory testing typically requires creative use of available data in order to approximate such ideal controls as closely as possible (King, Verba, and Keohane 1994). Unfortunately, the two regimes in Brazil are no exception. Leadership powers differed dramatically across the two periods, necessitating a nuanced approach to a comparative analysis of leadership behavior and its implications.         "
"17","In order to develop a valid comparative test, I compared a variety of party leaders' powers and behaviors across the two periods. An examination of the powers vested in the office of the leadership provides the first evidence that post‐War party leaders did not actively promote unity. Contemporary party leaders wield far more powers than their post‐War counterparts. Unlike in the post‐War, contemporary party leaders in the legislative support coalition coordinate the policy agenda with the executive, and all party leaders can cast votes with the force of their respective caucus. Party leaders today can override committee jurisdiction in consideration of bills and bring them directly to the floor for a vote. Finally, contemporary party leaders have the authority to determine which rank‐and‐file members' budget amendments will be funded."
"18","There is near unanimous agreement in the literature on the post‐War that executive‐legislative negotiations were not coordinated and were instead conducted on an ad hoc and individual basis (Ames 1987; Geddes 1994; Rocha 1995; Sola 1982). Party leaders could not vote with the force of the caucus, and they had no power to override committee jurisdiction in determining a bill's trajectory in the Chamber. Since there were no provisions for overruling committee jurisdiction, and all bills had to pass through several committees before being brought to the floor, committee presidents had the power to place bills on or remove them from the legislative agenda (Santos and Renno 2004). Thus, as in the contemporary U.S. House of Representatives, all standing committees in the post‐War Chamber of Deputies had significant agenda‐setting power. Unlike today, party leaders had no systematic influence over the release of approved budget amendment funds. Rather, the members of the Budget Committee are routinely noted to have been high‐status politicians based on their ability to accept or reject amendments, and unlike today, many amendments were rejected at the level of the Budget Committee (Ames 1987; Hippólito 1985; Rocha 1995).13 Finally, as today, post‐War Brazil used open lists, and thus, party leaders also lacked ballot control. In sum, this profile of leadership powers strongly suggests that party leaders' control over committee assignments was their most potent source of influence over rank and file.         "
"19","In order to assess whether post‐War party leaders used this power to reward loyal party voting, I conducted several analyses of post‐War committee assignments. Appointments to all standing committees were for terms of one year, with unlimited reappointments. Given the power the Budget Committee conferred on its members to deny locally targeted resources, and this committee's widely noted high status, I examined all appointments to the Budget Committee throughout the period.14 Independent variables used to predict committee appointments are the same as those above, including party loyalty in legislative voting (Ployl), electoral performance (Eperf) in the most recent election, seniority (Sen), and dominance (Dom).15 Once again, I included control variables for the state of the deputy. The results of the logit analysis, with robust standard errors in parentheses, are reported in Table 2 below.         "
"20","Clearly, party loyalty was not the key determinant of whether a deputy would gain a seat on the powerful Budget Committee for any of the five largest parties of the period. Party loyalty is positive but just below the range for statistical significance for the PSD, is negatively associated with gaining a Budget Committee seat in the UDN, and insignificant for all other parties, indicating that party leaders did not systematically employ this widely recognized valuable plum to influence rank‐and‐file voting.16"
"21","In order to investigate whether leaders distributed other committees' agenda‐setting power in order to reward loyal party voting, I analyzed all appointments to the presidencies of all standing committees for the three largest parties that controlled roughly 98% of all committee presidencies throughout the period (the PSD, the UDN, and the PTB).17 I also analyzed appointments to the presidencies of the three committees with the highest externalities in isolation in order to investigate the possibility that party leaders restricted their influence to these three powerful committees (Constitution and Justice, Budget, and Economics). Finally, since the Constitution and Justice Committee was the central gatekeeping entity—all bills had to pass first through this committee—I also analyzed appointments to the presidency of this committee in isolation.18"
"22","As the results in Table 3 above and Table 4 below demonstrate, none of these tests for evidence of party leadership intervention to enforce voting unity showed any statistically significant relationship between appointments to committee presidencies and party loyalty in voting.         "
"23","Despite having ruled out all of the key powers typically employed by party leaders seeking to influence rank‐and‐file behavior, this does not mean that post‐War leaders did not wield other powers (albeit ineffectively, as shown below) in an effort to discipline voting. One way to increase confidence in the conclusion that leaders were indifferent to unity, rather than simply ineffective in promoting it, is to examine whether leadership voting itself was consistent with an indifferent stance. If the overall patterns of voting observed were the result of leaders' inefficacy in enforcing discipline by some means analysts have not discerned, then we would expect that they would take their own floor behavior very seriously. If they were in fact uninterested in unity in floor voting, then their voting behavior might well reflect that disinterest. An examination of leadership voting indicates that their apparent disregard for enforcing unity is of a piece with their own floor behavior. Post‐War leaders failed to appear and cast their own vote on an astonishingly high percentage of roll calls: examining the six largest parties of the period, the PSD leadership failed to vote on 30.6% of roll calls, the UDN 48.2%, the PTB 34.2, the PDC 50.1, the PSP 40.3, and the PR 47.8. In short, if post‐War party leaders valued unity in legislative voting, it is difficult to explain why they did not utilize their ability to confer resource and agenda control through committee assignments to reward loyal voting, and it is astonishing that they failed to appear and cast their own votes on such a high percentage of roll calls."
"24","How do patterns of legislative voting compare across the two periods? As already discussed, electoral law was unchanged, and thus this critical variable is held constant, allowing us to isolate the influence of leadership behavior. If the collective action theory of party organization can shed useful light on cases such as Brazil, then we would expect that the differences in leadership intervention discussed above should lead to significant differences in unity in legislative voting. Given the active role played by the contemporary leadership and the post‐War leadership's indifference, we would expect levels of unity in contemporary Brazil to be considerably higher than those seen in the post‐War."
"25","In a multiparty presidential system such as Brazil's, the legislative agent is typically a governing coalition rather than a majority party. In these types of systems, it is important to examine the collective behavior of the governing coalition as well as that of individual parties in order to assess whether collective actors are sufficiently organized to translate voters' preferences into policy. If parties in the governing coalition were highly unified internally but voted differently on crucial bills, the governing coalition would have difficulty pursuing its legislative agenda."
"26","The patterns of coalition unity in legislative voting in the two periods are presented graphically in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 compares voting unity within the governing coalition across the two periods, with each data point representing a given cabinet. For each cabinet, I first calculated a weighted average for the coalition for each roll call, weighting the unity score of each party in the coalition according to the percentage of seats it held in the coalition for that vote. The average over the entire cabinet was then calculated using these weighted average scores for each roll call.         "
"27","                 Roll‐Call Voting Unity in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies                            Government Coalition 1989–2006 and 1945–64                      "
"28","                 Roll‐Call Voting Unity in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies                            Opposition Coalition 1989–2006 and 1945–64                      "
"29","As can be seen from the figure, contemporary governments have had more consistently unified support in the legislature than in the post‐War. Figure 2 provides the same data for the opposition coalition. For each cabinet, the opposition coalition was designated as the largest contiguous coalition of parties outside of government. Each data point once again represents a given cabinet and is calculated by averaging the weighted average Rice Index for each roll call over all roll calls. Here the difference across periods is more pronounced: contemporary opposition coalitions are far more unified than their earlier counterparts.         "
"30","These aggregate data could, however, mask large differences in unity at the party level that might call into question the general efficacy of leadership intervention in contemporary Brazil. Moreover, if some component of unity is simply a function of party size, then smaller average parties in the current period could contribute to increased unity. In order to demonstrate uniformity of effect at the party level, and to rule out size as the key variable driving higher unity in the current period, I conducted pairwise difference of means tests of the major parties across the two regimes. Table 5 below provides the results that confirm that there is a significant difference in the level of unity across every pairwise comparison. This is seen even in the cases comparing the two smallest parties (the PTB and the PT) and the two largest parties (the PSD and the PMDB) across the two periods, which suggests that party size is not the key variable driving differences in unity overall.19"
"31","These data provide strong support for the view that party leadership intervention in contemporary Brazil is the critical factor that has led to the higher levels of unity in legislative voting in comparison to the post‐War. As the next section will show, electoral patterns did not exhibit any systematic influence of the party reputation in the earlier period, as would be expected given the absence of leadership intervention and the low levels of unity. In the current period, in contrast, electoral patterns exhibit a systematic influence of party reputations as evidenced in partisan tides."
"32","The party reputation for providing national policy goods is a collective good for all individual members. If voters consider the national policy reputation of the individual candidate's party in making their voting choice, then there should be a common component to the vote for all members of the same party. Scholars have dubbed these forces that affect the electoral fate of all members of the same party “partisan tides” (Cox and McCubbins 1993; Cox and Rosenbluth 1993). When voters consider parties' national policy reputation, we would expect to see partisan tides as all members of the same party are helped by a reputation for good results, or hurt by a reputation for bad results (Cox and McCubbins 1993). Both periods in Brazil were characterized by large‐scale national programs. If voters were considering party reputation in their voting choice, the success of Vargas' and Kubitschek's import substitution industrialization programs in the 1950s, the abject failure of Sarney's Cruzado stabilization program in 1986, and the success of Cardoso's Real stabilization program in 1994 are all policies likely to generate partisan tides. If leadership intervention is necessary to ensure voting unity sufficient to create a party label with policy content as asserted by the collective action theory, however, then we would expect that elections would exhibit partisan tides only in the current period.         "
"33","Brazil uses proportional representation in multimember districts, with the federal state as the district. The use of electoral coalitions and the pooling of votes within the coalition to determine seat allocation mean that a party's seat total is not necessarily proportional to its vote total. I thus analyzed the determinants of party vote share rather than seat share. I regressed vote share for the given party in the given district at time t (Votet) on vote share for the given party in the given district at time t–1 (Votet‐1) and the vote swing of the given party between t–1 and t (Vote Swing). The vote swing variable is designed to capture the effect of partisan tides and is a composite measure of the change in the party's fortunes in all other districts across the two elections. The vote swing variable is constructed by calculating the difference in the percentage of the vote between the two elections for the given party in all other districts, and averaging those differences across all districts. If the vote swing between t–1 and t is a significant determinant of the vote in the given district at time t, this indicates that partisan tides are present. The equation is of the form:            "
"34","I estimated four different pooled models. A dummy for the current period (1986–2006) is included (Current Period), and this variable is also interacted with vote swing (Vote Swing x Current Period) in order to separate out the vote swing effects from each period. Controls for party and election were also included, and the data were clustered by district to control for possible nonindependence of observations over time within the same district.         "
"35","The results from Model 1 confirm no partisan tides in the earlier period, and the presence of partisan tides in the current period: Vote Swing is not significant, and Vote Swing x Current Period is significant at the .05 level. In order to rule out the possibly overweening effects of the one party that most analysts agree is programmatic, a pooled model controlling for the PT's influence on the vote swing was also estimated (Model 2). Finally, to rule out possible inordinate influence of the more developed states, the pooled model was estimated in two additional configurations: with all parties but without Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo (Model 3), then without Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais (Model 4). The results were robust to all these model specifications: Vote Swing remained insignificant, and Vote Swing x Current Period remained significant at the .05 level, indicating that the difference across periods is a national, cross‐party phenomenon.20"
"36","In contemporary Brazil, leadership intervention, high levels of unity in legislative voting, and partisan tides all occur together. In post‐War Brazil, by contrast, no apparent leadership intervention, low levels of unity in legislative voting, and the absence of partisan tides all occur together. These empirical results provide strong evidence to support the collective action theory of party organization. The theory also provides an electorally based model of internal party organization that can reconcile currently competing views of Brazilian party behavior. Rather than view the leadership mandate as universally one of enforcing strict discipline, this theory links the leadership's role to electoral imperatives. The leadership's job is to strike the electorally optimal balance within the parameters of the given system, including electoral law, voters' preferences, national conditions, etc. Given Brazil's highly candidate‐centered electoral law, contemporary parties are organized to give legislators wide latitude in building personal reputations. As this analysis of contemporary parties demonstrates, however, leadership intervention can also ensure that individualist behavior does not hinder collective organization designed to gain votes based on a national party reputation."
"37","The results from the post‐War, however, raise a key puzzle. Given the inhospitable institutional environment of both periods, if contemporary party leaders have nevertheless suceeded in managing the collective‐individual conflict in order to reap electoral gains available based on building a national policy reputation, why did post‐War party leaders fail to do the same? The literature on resolution of the collective‐individual conflict within the party has focused almost exclusively on variation in the incentives for rank and file to buck the party leadership and how the leadership manages these incentives. The results presented here, however, strongly suggest that scholars need to also consider variation in leadership incentives to enforce unity in order to better understand the wide variation in party unity across democratic regimes.         "
"38","Indeed, post‐War Brazil is only one of a large number of contemporary and historical democracies that exhibit party disunity so substantial that a consideration of variation in electoral dynamics and leadership incentives appears essential to a fully general theory. An emerging body of work on variation in the modes of electoral exchange between voters and politicians suggests an endogenous source of variation in leadership incentives. Although the near universal implicit assumption within the positive theory of elections and political behavior is that voters and politicians are linked through indirect exchange, this new literature has shown that direct, clientelistic exchange is a widespread phenomenon.21 When voters opt for some mix of nationally collective and locally targeted collective goods (pork), party leaders organize to solve the internal individual‐collective conflict associated with this mandate, as discussed here. When voters opt for direct, clientelistic exchange, however, the individual‐collective conflict that plagues party organization can be expected to differ. Moreover, under conditions of pervasive direct exchange, a party reputation for collective policy goods provision has no electoral value. The collective action theory of party organization has provided a key contribution to how collective goods get supplied. It has also pointed the way toward a more general theory of parties that can subsume anomalous cases like post‐War Brazil. Attention to how the collective action problems associated with party organization will differ when voters opt for clientelistic goods, and how politicians organize to solve these distinct collective action problems, is a promising route to a more general theory of party organization and behavior.22"
