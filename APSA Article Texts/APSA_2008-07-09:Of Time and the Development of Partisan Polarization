"1","In order to demonstrate the individual‐level dynamics of attitudinal stability and the connection between partisanship and attitudes, we draw upon the longitudinal political socialization project (ICPSR studies #4023 and #9553), which had its origins in the spring of 1965 with a national survey of 1,669 high school seniors and their parents (Jennings and Niemi 1974). Follow‐up surveys were conducted in 1973, 1982, and (for the younger generation only) 1997. We utilize both generations but concentrate more on the younger one because it was initially captured on the verge of adulthood when many political orientations were weakly grounded. The raw, unadjusted retention rate from the original pool of respondents is 56% for the four‐wave youth panel, which stretched over 32 years, and 57% for the parent sample, which spanned 17 years.3 Although these two samples have a socioeconomic bias in that high school dropouts and their parents are not included, there is little reason to think that the broad outlines of our findings would differ with their inclusion. In terms of life history, the class of 1965 has gone from around 18 to 50 years of age and has been exposed to a variety of conventional as well as extraordinary political events during that time. The historical placement of the sample raises the possibility of cohort‐centric effects that threaten generalizability. To some degree the presence of the parent panel component of the project lessens the cohort‐centric problem. More importantly, as we shall argue, cohort‐centric phenomena are in fact crucial in understanding the evolving nature of the ties between partisanship and issues.         "
"2","While the socialization panel data enable us to test propositions about the strengthening of political attitudes and the relationship between these attitudes and partisanship as individuals age, they cannot capture the emergence and evolution of partisanship/issue ties across multiple cohorts coming of age under different configurations of issue‐based party cleavages. Rather, what is required is longitudinal data based on replicated measures and covering a lengthy period of time. We first present simulations of what party/issue constraint would look like across cohorts and over time under three different partisan environments. These simulations clarify the relationship between learning processes and context. They also set forth expectations that are met when tested against National Election Studies cross‐section data stretching from 1972 to 2004."
"3","Although commonly accepted, the proposition about declining openness across the adult life span has rarely been subjected to the scrutiny of long‐term panel data. We use panel data from the political socialization project to generate support for this proposition and to expand upon it. We have observations for the youth sample across all four waves for several measures and across three waves for others, thus permitting us to look at the patterns of persistence up to age 50. In addition, we have three‐ and two‐wave data for the parent sample. Table 1 presents the continuity coefficients (r) for 11 commonly used attitudinal measures.4 The correlations indicate attitudinal continuity across adjacent years of observation. In order to convey a sense of life‐stage progression, the age range has been affixed to each panel's calendar time, with the parental range being expressed in terms of mean age.         "
"4","Modest attitudinal continuity, at best, is evident as the youth aged from 18 to 26, whereas continuity was much more pronounced over the next decade, a trend found for a number of other orientations as well (Jennings and Markus 1984). Across the third time frame—as the youth aged from 35 to 50—these gains tend to remain very much in place, a particularly arresting fact given the much longer time span represented by that third period. Significantly, the 11 measures range widely in terms of attitude objects, question format, and the political vicissitudes that have been relevant to them since 1965. The overall similarity is not to deny the likelihood of interaction effects involving life stage, political history, and the stability of particular attitudes (Sears and Funk 1999).         "
"5","Drawing on the parent panels from the same project reinforces the image of declining openness. The gains posted by the parents across the first two panel periods on the five measures first used in 1965 are, predictably, not nearly as sharp as those registered by the youth cohort during the same two time frames. These incremental gains in stability beyond young adulthood point toward a plateauing effect in the middle to late middle years. Combining the youth and parent panels results in a makeshift life span ordering. Splicing of this sort is risky, but the exercise is instructive and the results are similar to those based on long‐term surveys of special populations (Alwin, Cohen, and Newcomb 1991; Sears and Funk 1999). Viewed this way, in eight of the 11 measures the overall pattern is one of early gains and then gradual increases or little or no change over the remaining years.         "
"6","The three exceptions merit brief attention. First, parental PID stability substantially exceeds that found in the younger generation. A generational accounting for this exceptionalism proposes party ties as simply being generally more volatile in the cohorts coming of age after 1964 (e.g., Miller and Shanks 1996, chap. 6), whereas a life cycle explanation allows for even greater strengthening of partisanship well after midlife due to the unique features of partisanship as a concrete, frequently reinforced orientation with high affective mass. At this point we cannot choose between these alternative explanations, but the results do show the uniqueness of PID. Much lower parental stability with respect to the newer issues represented by evaluation of the women's movement and the legalization of marijuana constitute the other two exceptions. These were emergent issues as the class of 1965 came of political age and developed their political identities. By contrast, the issues hit the parental generation when they were already well into middle age and found themselves trying to graft these issues onto previous identities.         "
"7","As indicated above, we expect that the increasing stability of partisanship and political attitudes will be matched by a strengthening linkage between the two. People in a reasonably stable party system should increasingly come to understand the issue positions differentiating the parties and respond by bringing their policy views and partisan affiliation into greater alignment. In so doing, they would either come to adopt the policy views advocated by the party with which they identify or adjust their partisan affiliation to be consistent with their issue commitments, or do some of both.5 This would be true regardless of the specific learning mechanism involved—if, for example, political experience brings about a clearer sense of the parties' issue stances, which then drives the enhanced tie between attitudes and partisanship, or if political experience enhances the frequency with which political attitudes become primed, which then generates the tighter bond (e.g., Sears and Funk 1999).         "
"8","We also expect adjustments in constraint to be more pronounced during the “impressionable years” of young adulthood, which is when the greatest gains in understanding of party differences are likely to occur.6 This expectation follows from Converse's argument that “rates of learning would decline with the resistances and psychological interferences of more advanced age” (1969, 144). It also accords with Achen's (2002) Bayesian updating model of how party differences in a stable party system are learned, which shows that the value of new information declines with age. Finally, the expectation of nonlinear gains in party‐issue constraint is tied to the expectation of nonlinearity in openness to change. As partisan and issue attitudes become more crystallized, they should be less subject to the adjustment that builds constraint.         "
"9","One test of this hypothesis consists of using the socialization panel data to observe the associations between political attitudes and party identification across time. We restrict the analysis to the youth sample in order to take advantage of a fuller range of the life cycle and political developments between the early 1980s and late 1990s. Table 2 presents the findings, gauged in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients.7 For the most part, the expected strengthening does occur with the passage of time. Relationships for all but one indicator (evaluation of blacks) are demonstrably higher in 1997, usually by a very hefty margin, than are those in 1965 and 1973. Especially striking is the dramatic rise with respect to ideological identification; partisans increasingly place themselves where they “should be” on the 7‐point liberal‐conservative continuum. Overall, these results underscore the learning associated with sheer adult‐level interaction with the political system. People experience more politics, and thus make more sense of politics, as they age. That the pattern across the years is not always monotonic suggests the contribution of short‐term period effects, most pointedly so in the case of the school integration issue, which has waxed and waned as a salient partisan issue.         "
"10","However, another possible explanation for the rising constraint levels is that the class of 1965 was merely responding to push‐pull forces that were affecting all cohorts passing through the same historical time—a long‐term period effect. There is, in fact, a hint of that in the more limited parent panel. In this scenario, constraint gains have been fueled by party differences that have become more pronounced or less uncertain since the 1960s. Researchers have found increased public awareness of party differences on issues in recent decades, as elaborated on below. These kinds of changes in partisan cues have also undoubtedly contributed to the increased linkages shown in Table 2.         "
"11","Thus we are left with two explanations for the observed growth in the partisan/issue linkage: (1) political learning processes associated with aging, and (2) period effects associated with more distinctive party divisions. Only by analyzing longitudinal data on multiple cohorts over an extended period of time can we begin to distinguish between these two effects and, more critically, we will argue, the interaction between them, whereby entering cohorts are more affected by changing party cleavages than are older ones. In order to clarify the processes at work, we first present simulations of party‐issue constraint under three different scenarios of partisan cleavages. In doing so we reintroduce the missing part of our original model in Figure 1, namely, contextual variations in partisan divisions interacting with individual learning processes.         "
"12","We have suggested that growing party‐issue constraint at the individual level requires a relatively stable partisan system in terms of the issue positions parties are staking out and the groups whose interests they are seeking to advance, though not necessarily stable in terms of what particular issues are on the agenda. This argument by no means rules out inter‐cohort differences in terms of what particular attitudes become linked to partisanship or in how strongly the linkages form. Quite the contrary. As cohorts begin to make firmer their partisan allegiances and attitudinal dispositions, the particular linkages being forged between the two should vary with the contextual forces at work at the time. How issues, groups, and parties become connected in a voter's mind should depend upon how they are aligned in the political environment that marks the individual's coming of age."
"13","As a first step we simulated how party‐issue constraint would change across time and cohorts given varying assumptions about the nature of party differences on an issue. Specifically, we modeled constraint at time t as equal to constraint at time t − 1 plus an increment that depended on the magnitude of the party difference in place and the individual's openness to change. Individuals who came of age when the party difference was already intact were modeled as growing in constraint by the amount indicated in Figure 1 (above). For those who came of age prior to the emergence of the party difference, growth in constraint was discounted by their level of openness. Constraint levels were treated as responsive to the magnitude of the party difference, which varies over time in two of the simulations.         "
"14","The first scenario assumed a constant party difference on an issue over the entire time span being modeled—1930–2000. That is, the parties differed on an issue in 1930 and continued to differ, in the same way, on the issue across the next 70 years. A prime example would be the decades‐long distinction of Democrats as being prolabor and Republicans as probusiness. The entries found in Table 3 report simulated constraint levels given the proposition that constraint increases with age in the fashion described earlier. Each cohort shows the same, curvilinear maturation pattern as it ages (looking across rows), which is also found by comparing age cohorts at one moment in time (looking across columns). No “generational effect” is evident (looking across the diagonals). Overall, the extent of the party cleavage in the electorate, indexed by the average constraint coefficient (see bottom row), is constant over time.8"
"15","The second, more dynamic simulation stipulated that the parties took similar positions on the issue until 1970, at which point a party difference emerged (Table 4). One can think of this as representing, for example, the emergence of a party division on racial issues, with the Democrats being more liberal and the Republicans more conservative on policies aimed at promoting racial equality. Several aspects of the simulation findings deserve emphasis.         "
"16","First, the older cohorts are less responsive, less open to change than are the younger cohorts. Compare, for example, the changes across 1970 to 2000 for the 1930 cohort (.24–.26) and the 1970 cohort (.32–.63). These contrasts appear because the policy and partisan attitudes of the older cohort are more crystallized than those of the younger cohort as of the moment the new party difference emerges. Their attitudes are not as likely to readjust to reflect the new partisan alignment."
"17","Second, the cohort differences grow over time. Whereas initial cohort differences are inconsequential, they are dramatic at the end of the period and display a pronounced curvilinear pattern. The highest level of constraint occurs in the 1970 cohort, which was just coming of age when the new party difference emerged. Constraint drops off among both older and younger cohorts, though for different reasons. Compared with the older ones, the 1970s cohort was more open to change across the 1970–2000 period, which generated higher levels of constraint for this group by 2000. Compared with younger cohorts, the 1970s cohort has had more experience with the political system, more time to develop constraint; the younger cohorts are simply behind, developmentally. Consequently, it is the interaction of life cycle, developmental process, and a new political environment that—eventually—produces a distinctive “'70s generation.”         "
"18","In this simulation the party difference emerges in 1970 and is stable subsequently. Nevertheless, the population continues to polarize on the issue (bottom row of Table 4). This comes about for three reasons. First, it reflects the operation of developmental processes, as people slowly adjust to the new political reality by modifying their issue attitudes and/or partisan affiliations. Second, it reflects the process of population replacement in that new entrants to the polity evidence more constraint than do those who are exiting. Third, and most interestingly, the heightened polarization reflects the interaction between generation formation and developmental processes. At first, new entrants look hardly more polarized than those exiting. But the polity is losing people who do not develop and is replacing them with people who do develop as they age. As a result, the population replacement engine produces effects that are increasingly felt as the developmental process plays itself out. Overall, partisan polarization in the 2000 electorate is the consequence of an event taking place 30 years earlier, an event whose full effects will not be felt until well after the pre‐1970s cohorts are fully replaced.         "
"19","In the final simulation, the party difference is modeled as emerging in 1970 and then continuing to expand. One can think of this increasing polarization in several complementary ways. First, the parties might be becoming more divided on the issue, understood spatially, with Democrats more liberal and Republicans more conservative. Second, uncertainty about party differences on the issue might be declining as cues and information about the party difference accumulate. Third, the emphasis or salience of party differences on the issue may be growing."
"20","The patterns found in this case (Table 5) are similar to those seen in Table 4, with four significant differences. First, constraint grows more rapidly over time within each cohort (e.g., change from .32 to .82 for the 1970 cohort vs. .32 to .63 previously). Second, constraint develops even more quickly for new cohorts facing a highly polarized partisan environment than for those facing a moderately polarized partisan environment, producing cohort differences not seen in Table 4. Constraint levels for new entrants range from .32 for the 1970 cohort to .35, .39, and .42 for the cohorts of 1980, 1990, and 2000; and during their first decade as adults, constraint rises by .21 (.53–.32) for the 1970 cohort, which is exceeded by the 1980 cohort (.23) and then again by the 1990 cohort (.24). Third, and as a consequence, enhanced cross‐sectional cohort differences appear, especially as time passes. For example, the gap between the 1930 and 1970 cohorts by 2000 is .49 in Table 5, compared to .37 in Table 4. Finally, the overall partisan polarization level grows at a faster rate than that seen in the previous simulation, and by 2000 is larger.         "
"21","Evaluating whether the dynamics of partisan polarization in the U.S. electorate match expectations from one or more of these simulations requires longitudinal data on multiple cohorts. It also requires that issues be differentiated on the basis of when elite‐level divisions between the parties emerged. We analyzed NES data on 10 issues from 1972 to 2004, a period during which partisan polarization at the elite levels was expanding in general (e.g., Bond and Fleisher 2000; Jacobson 2004, chap. 8; McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 2006; Miller and Jennings 1986, chap. 8; Poole and Rosenthal 1997). Issues were categorized into three groups based on how the emergence of party differences has been characterized in previous research.         "
"22","The first group consists of economic and social welfare issues on which the parties have long been differentiated. Included here are attitudes toward labor unions, government provision of social services to the poor or disadvantaged, and the size of government—essentially, whether the federal government should have a large or limited regulatory role. Attitudes on these longstanding issues were combined into a cumulative “New Deal Issues” index. The second set contains issues involving racial and gender equality, in which the parties began to differentiate themselves in the mid‐1960s to the early 1970s (e.g., Carmines and Stimson 1989, chap. 3; Leege, Wald, Krueger, and Mueller 2002, chaps. 9–10; Wolbrecht 2000). Responses to these questions were combined to form a “Race & Gender Issues” index. A final group includes attitudes on cultural and moral issues, where party differences became more pronounced in the late 1970s and subsequently (e.g., Adams 1997; Gerrity, Wagner, and Carmines 2004; Layman 2001; Leege et al. 2002, chap. 10; Lindaman and Haider‐Markel 2002). The “Cultural Issues” index contains attitudes on abortion, gay rights, and—to index religiosity—church attendance, as well as a general indicator of support for traditional family values.9"
"23","This categorization scheme resembles the trichotomy of social welfare, racial, and cultural issues employed by Layman and Carsey (2002) in their analysis of partisan polarization in the American electorate. Their evidence on public perceptions of party differences across time and issues also supports, albeit indirectly, the characterization of party differences set forth above. For example, while in 1976 54% of respondents viewed Republicans as more conservative than Democrats on the NES “government guarantee of jobs” scale, only 42% did so with respect to the NES “government help for blacks” scale and only 13% viewed the Republicans as more likely than the Democrats to support a constitutional ban on abortion (Layman and Carson 2002, 790). Yet by the 1980s and 1990s, respectively, the public's recognition of party differences on race and abortion had reached levels comparable to those found on social welfare issues.         "
"24","In order to have sufficient cases for the cohort analysis, NES data from eight presidential election year studies were combined into pairs: 1972–76, 1980–84, 1988–92, and 1996–2000. Rather than exclude 2004 or treat it separately, which produces small sample sizes for the various cohorts we analyze, we decided to include 2004 along with the 1996 and 2000 surveys. We begin with 1972 because the earlier NES studies did not contain the instrumentation that was carried over the 1972–2004 period."
"25"," Table 6 shows the constraint levels for the 12 issues, the three indices, and the lib‐con self‐location measure over time for the full sample of available cases. First consider the comparison across items. The constraint correlations for the “New Deal Issues” are substantially higher than those found for issues concerning race and gender, which themselves are higher than those found for cultural issues. As of the initial sounding (1972–76) these are .31, .15, and −.03 for the three indices, respectively, and as of the latest sounding (1996–2004) they are .50, .36, and .24. These differences are to be expected if, as we have argued, party differences were late arrivals for race and gender issues and even later still for those involving cultural concerns.         "
"26","Turning to the longitudinal comparisons, we see that constraint levels are indeed climbing across the period, nearly always monotonically. The fact that this is true on the longstanding “New Deal Issues” suggests, indirectly, that the parties have become increasingly differentiated even on these issues over the past four decades, despite the fact that party differences were already in place by the 1960s.10 The cohort‐specific results will provide more persuasive evidence that this is the case.11"
"27","Cohorts were distinguished by the presidential election in which they first became eligible to vote. Those who were eligible to vote in elections before 1964 are designated “Came of age: before 1964.” Those first eligible to vote in 1964 or 1968 were designated “Came of age: 1964–68.” Using this same system we designated cohorts who “came of age” during the other sets of elections as well.12 We examine constraint levels using the three indices across cohorts and over time.         "
"28","Our expectations are threefold. First, since party differences on New Deal issues are longstanding, the results for that index should mirror those from the first simulation. At the same time, if party differences on those issues were growing across the period, cohort differences may also emerge. Second, findings for the “Race & Gender Issues” and “Cultural Issues” indices should mirror those given in the second or third simulation depending upon whether party differences on these issues have been static or increasingly accentuated over the period. Because accumulating research indicates that the parties in Congress and in national conventions have become increasingly divided on these issues in past decades (see research cited above and Layman, Carsey, and Horowitz 2006 for a review), simulation three is the more appropriate model. Finally, while the “Cultural Issues” index should show the same pattern as found for the “Race & Gender Issues” index, that pattern should be delayed by a decade due to the later emergence of party differences on cultural topics.         "
"29"," Table 7 contains the results. On the New Deal issues, some growth in constraint is found for all cohorts, evidence in support of the idea that the parties have increasingly distinguished themselves even on these longstanding issues since the early 1970s, with an especially noticeable boost during the Reagan years. Comparisons across cohorts, along the diagonal, support this conclusion as well. The cohorts entering the electorate in 1996–2004 show much higher levels of constraint (.38) than did those entering previously: .28, .24, and .17, respectively.         "
"30","At the same time, and even more importantly, our expectations regarding cohort differences in development, based on the steady state model of simulation one, are largely met. Growth in constraint across the entire period is less for the oldest cohort (.22 = .54 − .32) than the two immediately younger ones (growths of .38 and .33, respectively). Comparing the last pairs of elections, new entrants gain the most (.14 = .42 − .28), and the gain diminishes among older cohorts (.08, .05, .05, and .09, respectively). Moreover, gains in early adulthood usually exceed those in later adulthood. Illustratively, constraint in the 1972–76 cohort rises first by .22 (.39–.17) and then by .06 (.45–.39). In the 1980–84 cohort, the gains are .13 and then .08. Finally, the cross‐sectional expectations are also met. Constraint levels are generally highest among the oldest cohorts and decline near monotonically across the younger ones. In 1972–76, for example, constraint levels range from .32 (oldest) to .17 (youngest), whereas in 1996–2004 they range from .54 (oldest) to .38 (youngest)."
"31","All in all, these results demonstrate that individuals do, indeed, develop greater consistency between their partisan affiliation and their issue commitment as they age, with the greatest gains usually coming in early adulthood. They also suggest that party differences on these longstanding issues have been growing, in contrast to the steady state modeled in simulation one. People have responded to these changes in the political environment by developing a tighter alliance between their partisan affiliations and their opinions on New Deal issues. At the same time, incoming cohorts over the past three decades have entered the electorate with their party affiliations increasingly aligned to their views on these issues long dividing the parties—sympathies for the working classes, the role of government in regulating the economy, and government assistance for the disadvantaged. Both individual‐level change and generational differences are at work in producing greater partisan polarization on these issues in the electorate writ large."
"32","The pattern changes when we turn to race and gender issues, where party divergence came in the 1960s and early 1970s (second panel of Table 7). As with our second and third simulations, cohort differences are initially minimal, as the 1972–1976 column shows, but eventually become pronounced and assume a curvilinear shape. Constraint levels are lower among the cohorts coming of age prior to the 1960s than among those entering the electorate later. At no time point does constraint in the oldest cohort exceed that for the younger cohorts. In the late 1980s and early 1990s constraint is highest in the generations coming of age in the late 1960s and early 1970s (.42 and .37), and dampened among those both older (.25) and younger (.31). By the 1996–2004 sounding, constraint levels range from .38 to .42 for the younger cohorts compared with .30 for the oldest cohort.         "
"33","In two respects the patterning for these issues is similar to that found for the New Deal issues. First, early adulthood again is the period where constraint gains are typically highest, precisely as one would expect if people make age‐related gains in party‐issue consistency in the fashion that we have proposed. Second, each succeeding cohort is entering the electorate with a closer alignment between their party affiliation and their views on race and gender issues, as would be expected if the party differences on these issues have become clearer. As a consequence, by the last surveys the younger cohorts look very much like those who preceded them, save for the oldest cohort. The advantage in constraint that age and political experience have brought to the generations coming of age in the 1960s and 1970s has been wiped out by the more vivid socialization into party differences that the youngest cohorts have experienced. These results also hold when considering only the South, which is consistent with the findings of others (e.g., Fleisher and Bond 2001) that show little to no regional variation in the over‐time growth in the consistency between party affiliation and ideology or issue opinions (but see Valentino and Sears 2005).         "
"34","The results are even more striking for the cultural issues index (bottom panel of Table 7). Here, constraint levels begin at near zero in 1972–76 for all cohorts. They climb steadily across the period, but especially for the cohort coming of age in the mid‐1970s. Both of the older cohorts lag behind, as do the younger cohorts, which is precisely what would be expected if the developmental processes we have discussed are at work across this period during which new party differences on cultural issues emerged. Younger individuals, in their early 20s, have not yet developed crystallized partisan or other political attitudes; they lack the degree of political experience that has helped the earlier cohorts forge tighter connections. By contrast, the oldest cohort has had plenty of political experience, in fact too much political experience with another political era, one when the partisan conflict over cultural issues was absent. Their political identities were well formed before these changes in the partisan landscape, leaving them with partisan affiliations that are relatively detached from the new issues on the political scene.         "
"35","A second clear finding about cultural issues is one of enlarging initial cohort differences. Each succeeding cohort entering the electorate shows higher constraint levels than the proceeding one, ranging from .01 for the 1972–76 cohort, to .06, .18, and .29 for succeeding cohorts. This pattern would be expected if, as other evidence shows, the parties have been increasingly distinguished on sex and morality issues since the mid‐1970s. As with issues regarding race and gender, this leaves the partisanship of the youngest cohort almost as strongly aligned with their views on cultural issues as other cohorts coming of age since the late 1970s. What they lack in terms of years of political experience they make up for in terms of the clarity of the party differences they perceive as they come of age."
"36","Our explanation of the results in Table 7 stresses the consequences of processes occurring in the impressionable years of early adulthood, and the tendency of attitudes and identities crystallized early to be less malleable in the later years. Older Americans, socialized before the 1960s, tend to think of the Democratic party as aligned with labor, a large and active federal government, committed to providing assistance to the disadvantaged—more, certainly, than they were socialized to think of them as aligned with blacks, the women's movement, or liberal positions on cultural issues. They carried that connection forward over the decades and strengthened it along the way. Later on, they were less likely to integrate their partisan orientations and their attitudes on the new issues of the day, certainly less likely to do so than were younger Americans whose experience with the political system and political parties were full of partisan conflict on these new issues.         "
"37","Still, events taking place well after the impressionable years do influence the relationship between issue stances and partisanship. Cohorts, such as the class of 1965, which came of age in the mid to late 1960s, show a dramatic over‐time increase in the extent to which they link their political views on race, gender, and cultural values with their partisan affiliation because those issues both marked their coming‐of‐age and persisted on the political agenda, presenting clear, indeed clearer, party differences. For the even newer generations, the same is true for cultural issues as well.         "
"38","Another way of showing the dynamics involving issue positions and partisanship is to posit party identification as dependent upon issue stances. Even though the relationship is undoubtedly reciprocal, as noted above, making the unidirectional assumption provides a useful analytic strategy in that it will indicate the relative significance of each set of issues to the partisan affiliations of each cohort over time. This is key to understanding whether the basis of partisan conflict is expanding (Layman and Carson 2002) or instead shifting to emphasize issues newly dividing the parties at the expense of the old. Table 8 gives results from multivariate regressions treating party identification as the dependent variable and the three issue indices as independent variables. Standardized coefficients are given, along with R2 values, for each cohort and time period. The results are organized to facilitate comparisons across cohorts.         "
"39","The partisanship of Americans socialized before the 1960s has been, and remains, primarily tied to their positions on New Deal issues that have long divided the parties. As seen in Table 8, at each time point the party identification of this cohort is more strongly linked to opinions on these issues than to opinions on race, gender, or cultural matters. Even more, the standardized coefficient has grown from .32 to .51 over the period, which is largely responsible for the increased R2 (.11 to .31). Although opinions on race and gender issues have at times been associated with the partisanship of this group, their influence is weak and did not grow over time. Cultural issues do, however, show signs of growing influence. By the last period, the standardized coefficient is .11 and highly statistically significant.         "
"40","Among the other cohorts, the influence of New Deal issues is diminished relative to issues on which party divisions are of more recent origin. A useful, albeit crude way to see this is to compare the coefficient on the New Deal Issues index to the sum of the coefficients for the indices concerning race and gender and culture. For the oldest cohort the ratio is 3.4 (.51 vs. .15) as of 1996–2004, and for each successive cohort this ratio is 1.7, 1.0, 1.3, .9, and .7. The results for the youngest cohort are especially striking in the prominence of cultural issues, where the coefficient nearly matches that found for the New Deal issues."
"41","Still, and consistent with Layman and Carson's (2002) ideas about conflict extension in the electorate, partisan alignment with New Deal issues is not disappearing or being replaced by partisan conflict on issues concerning race or gender or culture. It is true that the partisanship of younger cohorts is less tied to their views on these longstanding issues than it is for older cohorts, and this is true near monotonically at each point in time. But this pattern is the result of the developmental processes that led those with less political experience to manifest less party‐issue constraint than their seniors on issues that have long divided the parties. The continuing and even growing importance of the traditional party cleavage is manifest in the over‐time gains in constraint on the New Deal issues that are evident within each cohort. Even more telling are the generational differences that have emerged. New Deal issues are more important to the partisan affiliation of new entrants to the electorate today than they were to the new entrants of yesteryear. Specifically, the coefficient of .29 marking the youngest generation's entrance compares with coefficients of .19, .20, and .16 for preceding ones.         "
"42","What is happening, instead, is that the “new” issues involving race, gender, and culture, taken together, are becoming ever more important over time and across generation without supplanting traditional issue concerns. Correspondingly, the ability of our three issue indices to explain partisan affiliation in a statistical sense is growing across time and generation as well. Looking across time, the R2 grows for each cohort but peaks for those who came of age in the late 1960s and early 1970s, those individuals most open to revising their partisan and issue attitudes over the period and who have had the most time to do so. Looking across cohorts, the R2 values for new entrants range from .06 for the 1970s cohort to .09, .18, and, finally, .27 for the most recent cohort. As new entrants face a political environment where the partisan differences are not only evident on more issues but are also becoming clearer, partisan affiliations become increasingly aligned with, and perhaps influenced by, a diverse set of issue commitments.         "
"43","At the same time, it appears that the power of cultural issues in defining Americans' partisanship is beginning to outweigh that of issues concerning race and gender. In the 1970s and 1980s opinions on cultural issues were mostly disconnected from partisan affiliations, though attitudes about race and gender were seemingly influential. By the late 1980s and especially in the past decade, the pattern has reversed. For each cohort save one the connection between cultural issues has grown stronger and has come to outstrip the connection based on race and gender issues. Unless the political environment changes to diminish or cloud party differences on cultural issues, their ascendancy in defining the partisan cleavage in the electorate can only be expected to grow in the future as the developmental processes we have identified have time to play out, and as new, impressionable generations enter the electorate, replacing those for whom cultural issues have little bearing on their partisan affiliations."
"44","One focus of political socialization researchers is on the character of political development over the life cycle, which entails studying general age‐related political maturation processes as well as the effects of life‐cycle events and secular movements. These inquiries are important for what they reveal about individuals, but they are especially important for what they imply for the political system. There are implications for how mass party cleavages emerge over time if people mature politically as they age in the fashion we have set forth—developing more crystallized attitudes and higher levels of party‐issue constraint. Changes in the positions taken by the political parties will, eventually, be reflected in the public, but only after many years and perhaps decades have past. Along the way, strong and predictable age‐related differences will appear in the extent to which people align their partisan attachments and their issue commitments. The strongest alignment typically, though only eventually, will be found among those who came of age when the new party division emerged. This developmental result can, however, be eclipsed if party differences become increasingly accentuated over time, raising the constraint levels of young adults to levels that match or even exceed those of their politically experienced elders."
"45","Our arguments about the forces working to fuel mass partisan polarization are more complex than those ordinarily posited in the literature. Rather than emphasizing either population replacement or individual‐level change as the mechanism by which greater partisan polarization in the electorate emerges, we have brought the two arguments together. It is not just that both are operating, but that they are also interacting. Over the past 30 to 40 years, growing partisan polarization in the American public has been driven by generational replacement as new entrants evinced greater party‐issue constraint than did those they replaced, by individual‐level change as individuals who persisted within the electorate developed increasing constraint as they aged, and by the conjunction of these mechanisms as the population became increasingly composed of cohorts that entered the electorate in the wake of the new party divisions and hence whose partisan and issue attitudes were open to the development of constraint over time. Beneath the clear over‐time growth in ideological differences between Democrats and Republicans in the electorate is a dynamic process that varies across time, across issues, and across generations. There is no simple mapping from elite‐level partisan cleavages to cleavages in the general public."
"46","Another way in which our arguments depart from ordinary thinking about this topic concerns the character of the explanations we have provided. Our explanation for the emergence of partisan polarization in the electorate, and for the prominent variation across cohorts as of 1996–2004 (Tables 7, 8), is, in a fundamental sense, historical. Explanations for over‐time changes in an outcome such as level of cohort distinctiveness or overall polarization levels usually cite over‐time changes in some proximate causal variable (Haydu 1998). Scholars might, as such, try to explain the prominent cohort differences as of the 1996–2004 period as prompted by something about the politics of this period that differentiated it from the politics of the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s. Some studies in fact have drawn connections between polarization at the elite and mass levels by examining how well elite polarization at time T predicts mass polarization at time T+1 (e.g., Adams 1997; Lindaman and Haider‐Markel 2002). According to our arguments, however, such efforts overlook the critical lagged effects of preexisting conditions. Even if the parties had not intensified their differences since the 1960s and 1970s, polarization in the electorate and sharp differences across cohorts would still have emerged as the delayed consequence of a single, historical event: the emergence of an elite‐level party division some 30 or 40 years before.         "
"47","Our approach also yields clear implications regarding future trends. The level of partisan polarization on topics concerning race, gender and, especially, cultural matters is likely to increase in the coming decades as population replacement and developmental processes play out. The party affiliations of a large and growing group of American have become strongly linked with their opinions on those issues and will not easily be uncoupled, even if the issue landscape changes or existing party differences become obscured."
"48","Our results suggest several lines of further research. Two questions about polarization and mass‐elite relationships are raised by our treatment of party divisions as given, exogenous and unexplained. First, we have black‐boxed the question of what cues the public is receiving about the nature of party differences. Are those cues sent primarily through election campaigns and the positions taken by major, national‐level candidates? Do they reflect the behavior of House and Senate partisans, conveyed through the ongoing stream of political news or the activities of interest groups (Gerrity, Wagner, and Carmines 2004)?         "
"49","A second question is whether the simple top‐down representation of the elite‐mass influence process misses important dynamics working the other way. Various scholars have suggested that partisan divisions at the elite level are in part explained by those that have emerged in the public (e.g., Jacobson 2000; Layman, Carsey, and Horowitz 2006; Ono 2004; Stonecash, Brewer, and Mariani 2003). Our understanding of the mass‐elite linkage in partisan polarization would be enhanced by a closer examination of these two issues left unexplored in our work.         "
"50","A third question raised by our results stems from our very general propositions about how people develop over the life cycle. These arguments about declining openness and growing party/issue constraint, though not deterministic, neglect important developmental variations across individuals. Put another way, it is almost certainly wrong to view these developmental processes as simply the inevitable consequence of aging per se. At the very least, an individual's level of political awareness and engagement also matters to how he or she develops politically. As Jennings and Stoker (1999) demonstrated, young adults who were politically engaged during the turbulent late 1960s and early 1970s emerged with a more crystallized and constrained set of political and partisan attitudes than did those who went through their impressionable years politically disengaged. Just as short‐term responsiveness to elite cues depends upon one's level of political awareness, so too do the contours of development over the life cycle. A more complete understanding of the development of partisan cleavages in the electorate must take these and other developmental variations into account.         "
"51","This article has also set aside the question of what causal mechanisms are producing age‐related gains in constraint. Yet the implications of such gains vary dramatically depending upon whether party identification is being shaped by, or is shaping, issue commitments. If the former predominates, then the story is not just about partisan polarization but about partisan realignment as well. These causal questions need careful study in a developmental framework—examining the acquisition versus the revision of partisan affiliations and issue opinions, addressing how the strength of preadult socialization moderates the causal dynamics, and evaluating how the influence flows vary by age and across generations."
"52","At the outset of this article we invoked Converse's work on time and partisan stability. Converse worked with ideas about individual‐level learning processes and macropolitical contexts to develop a model of aggregate partisan development applicable cross‐nationally. A final question we pose for future research to consider is how well the model and dynamics we have developed here apply to the party contexts outside of the United States. Although the individual‐level developmental processes we have identified are general, how they operate and aggregate will be highly contingent on the character and stability of the political parties competing within a nation."
