"1","The 1990s saw a resurgence in interest in the dynamics of policy. As part of this renewed attention, interest developed in integrating incremental models of policy (Wildavsky 1964) with some mechanism for policy change over time. The evidence for incrementalism (based on case studies as well as statistical analyses) was too strong to ignore. Similarly, it was undeniable that policies do, occasionally, experience large changes that the incremental theory could not explain. Scholars sought a theory that incorporated explanations of the relative rarity of large changes, but nonetheless predicted that such changes can also be expected. An answer would come in the form of punctuated equilibrium theory in paleontology.         "
"2","Gradualist accounts of evolutionary change had dominated paleontology for generations. This perspective argued that small changes in phenotype were constantly emerging in species. Gould and Eldredge challenged this view in the 1970s by arguing that periods of stasis punctuated by rare periods in which one could see dramatic changes was the most common pattern of evolution. After a couple of decades, the punctuated equilibrium account of evolution displaced the gradualist account as the dominant theory of evolutionary change (Gould and Eldredge 1993).         "
"3"," Baumgartner and Jones (1993) adopted the punctuated equilibrium model to describe agenda dynamics in American politics. They argued that policy is characterized by long periods of negative feedback wherein any changes in the status quo are small and difficult to sustain. Large changes can and do occur, but only when the negative feedback forces are overcome and replaced by a process of positive feedback. The result is an account of policy history that predicts long periods of stability (as in incremental theory) interrupted by rare but dramatic periods of change (as the critics of incrementalism argued occur).         "
"4","Testing this model of policy dynamics has proven to be difficult. Theory does not predict when, precisely, punctuations will occur or when equilibrium returns after a punctuation. The punctuated equilibrium theory posits that punctuations will be large, but rare. The null hypothesis for punctuated equilibrium is slippery. Any particular policy history in which one sees change can be called confirming evidence. Any policy history in which one sees stability can also be seen as confirming evidence. Only evidence of frequent punctuations or their complete absence would be disconfirming, though proponents of punctuated equilibrium theory could save the theory by claiming that one only needs a longer time period to find the missing stability or punctuation."
"5","Recent research has identified an alternative approach to testing the punctuated equilibrium model. Rather than focusing on the existence of punctuations and stability, the recent research focuses on the relative frequency and magnitude of changes. True, Jones, and Baumgartner (1999) argued that evidence of leptokurtosis would serve to confirm the presence of a punctuated equilibrium process. The authors contended that in rational choice theory policy changes should be the result of random shocks to the system. These shocks are then averaged out in the long run by the law of large numbers. Thus, the distribution of policy changes should be normal. True, Jones and Baumgartner found that the observed distribution of federal program budgetary changes was instead characterized by an excess of large changes and small changes—resulting in a leptokurtic distribution. A leptokurtic distribution has a larger concentration of data points near the center and in the tails of a distribution than does a normal distribution. The shoulders of the distribution are smaller in the former than the latter. This distribution is more consistent with a process that experiences long periods of relative stasis punctuated by periodic large changes than rational adaptation to random environmental changes. True, Jones, and Baumgartner concluded that the prediction of the punctuated equilibrium theory was stronger than the rational choice prediction.         "
"6","This approach to the study of punctuated equilibrium processes has a serious limitation. The study of punctuated equilibrium processes has relied on descriptive assessments rather than inferential theory testing. While the evidence is now convincing that punctuated equilibrium models of policy describe the distributive characteristics of samples of policy outputs quite well, much hard work remains. Now punctuated equilibrium theorists need to build a set of predictions related to when organizations are likely to act in a manner consistent with punctuated equilibrium theory and when they are not. In short, we need to move from finding leptokurtic distributions to explaining why some distributions are more leptokurtic than others."
"7","Some of the more recent examinations of punctuated equilibrium theories of policy processes suggest factors that affect the frequency of small, medium, and large changes. Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen (2003) focus their attention on “friction” within organizational decision making. Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen argued that decision‐making processes that involve more “friction” (like congressional budget allocations) will produce outputs more consistent with punctuated equilibrium theory than decision‐making processes that involve less “friction” (like the stock market). The authors did not devote much time to defining “friction,” but their arguments imply that the increases in transaction and decision costs are closely related to organizational “friction” (2003, 155–57).         "
"8","One element that Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen focused on when ranking the transaction and decision costs of a policy process is the complexity of the process. Processes that require the participation of a larger number of participants or require complex rules of participation are presumed to be higher in transaction and decision costs. For example, they argue that the creation of statutes (a process involving hundreds of participants who each have complex, and sometimes decisive, roles in the process) has higher transaction costs than calling hearings (a process that can be initiated by a smaller number of people with less complex rules). The transaction costs required to coordinate diverse participants represent the sort of “friction” on which Jones and his colleagues focus."
"9","A related literature in education policy argues that the large number of people involved in contemporary education policy and the bureaucratization of educational policymaking institutions make change hard (Chubb and Moe 1990). Chubb and Moe argued that school districts are unable to respond to changes in their environment and new information on teaching technology because the bureaucracy of school districts prevents change. They call for radical reform (a potential punctuation) to eliminate the bureaucracy of public school districts—a shift to localized administration and competition. While their findings that bureaucratization directly reduces the test scores of the students in the district are disputed (Meier, Polinard, and Wrinkle 2000), the resulting literature illustrated the interest in the factors affecting flexibility in school districts.         "
"10","In the punctuated equilibrium research literature, Robinson (2004) examined whether or not bureaucracy created inflexibility. The Chubb and Moe argument presumed that bureaucratization makes policy change more incremental (and possibly more punctuated). Robinson found that the outputs of bureaucratized/centralized districts were less consistent with punctuated equilibrium theory than nonbureaucratized districts.         "
"11","Why might greater bureaucracy generate such a pattern? Bureaucracy, after all, operates under the architecture of complexity; it breaks complex tasks down into smaller ones that can be solved and then reassembles the solutions based on the belief that the parts will add up to the whole. In short, bureaucracy operates an intentionally incremental process. In Robinson's study, however, the transaction costs of bureaucratization were less important than some positive influence of bureaucratization on normalization of the change processes—possibly through the development of expertise or information‐gathering capacities in the organizations. The answer may be quite simple: bureaucracy is a multifaceted concept wherein some elements do produce incrementalism and inflexibility while other elements produce agility empowering agencies to respond to changes in their environment. This could explain why some studies of bureaucracy, like those reviewed above, focus on the rigidity of bureaucratic organizations while other studies report that bureaucracies create buffering and smoothing capacities (O'Toole and Meier 2003; Thompson 1967). Bureaucracy may not be as simple as a force for either rigidity or rationality—it may represent a series of organizational characteristics, some of which create rigidity while others improve information gathering or other functions of organizations.         "
"12","Bureaucratic leaders could well recognize the dangers in the punctuations of equilibrium, not just to the organization but to the overall political system. While stability is generally a good thing for bureaucracies, organization theory has long recognized, and management programs consistently teach, that stability hinders the ability of organizations to adapt to environmental change and in the process creates a threat to the very existence of the organization. In this view, bureaucracy might seek to increase the variance in its outcomes to be able to respond to environmental pressures and to avoid locking the bureaucracy into a suboptimal path. Such information and planning functions are likely housed in the central decision‐making units of the organization. This is one aspect of bureaucratization as a whole: centralization. The logic of centralized information processing in centralization suggests an alternative hypothesis to the Jones friction hypothesis, that greater centralization of authority in a bureaucracy will generate patterns that less resemble punctuated equilibrium. Centralization may reduce the number of consulted participants or empower a central authority to force cooperation, thereby bypassing potential organizational friction."
"13","In addition to centralization, organizational size is an element of bureaucratization that should affect the friction of the policymaking process. Large organizations make more complex decisions and decisions requiring consultation with a larger number of actors. Both of these factors affect organizational friction and should influence the distribution of the outputs of the policymaking process. While research into the effect of organizational size on educational outcomes can be identified (Meier and Bohte 2000), no results are available for the effect of organizational size on the punctuated nature of policymaking outputs.         "
"14","This section has reviewed a series of potential hypotheses as starting points for the analysis of the multifaceted impact of bureaucratization (and two of its elements, centralization and organization size). Given the complexity of the punctuated equilibrium model, we have broken the expectation of the model into three parts. An increase in the punctuated character of a process would involve (1) an increase in the expected proportion of small changes; (2) a decrease in the expected proportion of medium changes; and (3) an increase in the expected proportion of large changes. This is contrasted with the incremental model, which anticipates that any change that increases incrementalism will (1) increase the expected proportion of small changes; (2) reduce the proportion of medium changes; and (3) reduce the proportion of large changes. One should note that the distinguishing characteristic of punctuated equilibrium theory is in the behavior of large changes. The punctuated equilibrium hypotheses (H1A‐H1C, H2A‐H2C) below are contrasted with the incrementalism hypotheses (H∼1C, H∼2C)         "
"15"," Centralization hypotheses (based on expectations that centralization reduces punctuation):          "
"16"," H1A: Centralization decreases the expected proportion of small changes in a policymaking institution's outputs.         "
"17"," H1B: Centralization increases the expected proportion of medium changes in a policymaking institution's outputs.         "
"18"," H1C: Centralization decreases the expected proportion of large changes in a policymaking institution's outputs.         "
"19"," H∼1C: Centralization increases the expected proportion of large changes in a policymaking institution's outputs (incrementalism hypothesis).         "
"20"," Organization size hypotheses (based on expectations that large organizations will experience more punctuations):          "
"21"," H2A: An increase in organization size increases the expected proportion of small changes in a policymaking institution's outputs.         "
"22"," H2B: An increase in organization size decreases the expected proportion of medium changes in a policymaking institution's outputs.         "
"23"," H2C: An increase in organization size increases the expected proportion of large changes in a policymaking institution's outputs.         "
"24"," H∼2C: An increase in organization size decreases the expected proportion of large changes in a policymaking institution's outputs (incrementalism hypothesis).         "
"25","The null for each of these hypotheses is that the identified independent variable has no effect on the frequency of small, moderate, or large change."
"26","These alternative hypotheses related to incrementalism (H∼1C and H∼2C) are important as benchmarks for punctuated equilibrium theory. Punctuated equilibrium's more complicated theoretical infrastructure related to various sizes of nonincremental change are only important insofar as these distinctions improve our ability to explain organizational processes. In this sense, the comparison to traditional incremental theory is more appropriate than comparison to a true null hypothesis of no effect. The comparison to the alternative hypotheses provides for an opportunity for punctuated equilibrium to set itself apart as an important innovation in the study of organizational change (and organizational budgeting in particular).         "
"27","These hypotheses put great demands on any research effort aimed at employing punctuated equilibrium theory. Essentially, punctuated equilibrium involves inferences about common events (stability) as well as rare events (dramatic change). Getting leverage on the rare‐event hypotheses requires a large data set. Ideally, the data set would involve a long time series. In policy research, this is seldom possible. Instead, we must rely on panels of shorter time periods. This section introduces a data set that provides leverage on the rare‐event hypotheses related to punctuated equilibrium theory."
"28","The key requirement of any test of a punctuated equilibrium hypothesis is a large data set. The absence of punctuations in a small set of data would not represent a challenge to punctuated equilibrium theory. Furthermore, the individual instances of large change (if they were to occur) would become unduly influential unless there were multiple large changes. Rather than have the outputs of a single policymaking organization over an extraordinary time scale, a panel approach looks at the policy outputs of a number of similar organizations over a shorter period of time. For example, the True, Jones, and Baumgartner (1999) research focuses on a panel of budgetary changes in a series of parallel policy systems. While there are only about 50 yearly observations, there are observations of spending in over a dozen policy areas. The result is a large data sample from which they can test for the consistency of the observed distribution of budgetary change with the distribution based on the expectations of punctuated equilibrium theory.         "
"29","The assumption is that all observed budgetary changes are drawn from a probability distribution based on punctuated equilibrium theory. This probability distribution is such that it produces a relatively large number of small and large changes and a relatively small number of moderate changes. Each budget is a single observation drawn from the presumed underlying distribution. Each budget maker has an underlying probability for each type of change. If the sample of observed budgetary outputs is large enough, one should see the underlying probability distribution for the presumably similar budgetary processes. In True, Jones, and Baumgartner (1999), all budgetary processes are assumed to possess a common probability function (and thus all are pooled into one analysis of the underlying probability of various levels of change). In Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen (2003), the authors compare the outputs of a series of different processes and compare the resulting distribution of each. In this case, the underlying probability of each individual process is assumed to be consistent, but each process possesses its own underlying probability distribution. It is essential to have a large enough sample of comparable units.         "
"30","This article uses a data set that includes budgetary information from over 1,000 education organizations (K–12 public school districts in Texas) on a yearly basis from 1989 to 2001.1 These data have a number of advantages that relate to the testing of punctuated equilibrium theory. First, the organizations are all performing similar tasks within a similar cultural and legal environment. Second, the data cover 12 years of budgetary results, thus allowing for the test of dynamics as needed in punctuated equilibrium theory. Third, the large number of these organizations (over 1,000) means that the overall size of the sample is sufficiently large to test for rare events. Finally, these data have proven a reliable source in a variety of studies (e.g., Meier and Bohte 2000; Meier, Polinard, and Wrinkle 2001; Robinson 2004).         "
"31","From these organizations, we have observed the percentage changes in instructional spending per pupil as an indication of the organization's educational strategy. Each district can set a level of spending, within a budget constraint. The districts can choose to focus on instructional spending or other potential uses of the budget (infrastructure investment, management, etc.). This measure of strategy is appropriate in that it is close to the core function of these organizations, educating students. Use of this measure also allows direct comparison to Robinson's (2004) use of the same measure.         "
"32","The punctuated equilibrium model makes predictions about the discrete change of outputs from small change to medium change to large change. Testing this theory requires the transformation of the continuous measure of budgetary change into a categorical variable matching the categories of punctuated equilibrium theory. The categorizing of change has proven problematic in the incremental literature and deserves careful attention (Berry 1990). This article uses the confidence that Jones and others have built in the leptokurtic distribution of policy outputs as leverage to create a nonarbitrary categorization system.         "
"33","If outputs are leptokurtic, as Jones, Sulkin, and Larsen have convincingly demonstrated, then there will be a characteristic pattern to the distribution of these outputs compared to the expectations of a normal distribution. Figure 1 illustrates that this is the case. Over some range of large negative values, the observed pattern will exceed the expectations of the normal distribution. This is region 0 in Figure 1. At some point the expectations of the normal distribution will cross over the observed expectation for a range of moderate negative values where the observed frequencies are lower than the expected frequency. This is region 1 in Figure 1. The expectations will cross over again for a range of small changes (positive and negative) where we will observe higher frequencies of observations than expected from the rational choice model. This is region 2 in Figure 1. Symmetrically, there is a range of moderate positive values where the rational expectations exceed the observed (region 3) and a range of large positive values where the rational expectations are lower than the observed frequencies (region 4). We use this characteristic pattern to define small, medium, and large changes. A large change is a change in the tails of the distribution where the observed frequencies exceed the frequencies predicted by the normal distribution (a category 0 change if negative, 4 if positive). A medium change is a change in the region where the observed frequencies are lower than those predicted by the normal distribution (a category 1 change if negative, 3 if positive).2 A small change is a change near the mode of the distribution where the observed frequency exceeds the frequency predicted by the normal distribution.33 The dependent variable for the analyses will then involve tests of whether various organizational factors contribute to the relative frequency of large and small change versus the relative frequency of medium change. The exact cutpoints between regions are identified on the X‐axis of Figure 1. Table 1 presents the distribution of budgetary changes per pupil.         "
"34","                 The Aggregate Distribution of Changes in Instructional Spending per Pupil with Cutpoints                                                   2                      "
"35","The hypotheses H1A–C stated in the previous section related centralization to punctuated equilibrium characteristics. If centralization decreases the punctuated equilibrium behavior of a policymaking process (as was suggested in Robinson 2004), then centralization should decrease the probability that a policymaker produces small changes and large changes, but increase the probability of medium changes. To measure centralization, we employ the percentage of spending on central administration in a district. This spending represents the resources allocated to central managerial activities as opposed to decentralized management or core service provision. This measure is closely related to the measure used in previous studies of bureaucratization (Meier, Polinard, and Wrinkle 2001; Robinson 2004)—where it was taken to stand for bureaucratization as a whole.         "
"36","The hypotheses H2A–C relate organizational size to punctuated equilibrium behavior in policymaking outputs. The expected effects of organizational size are similar to the effects of bureaucratization—large organizations should produce outputs more consistent with punctuated equilibrium predictions.4 Our measure of organizational size is the total enrollment of the district (a measure highly correlated with total expenditures and total number of staff). This measure is similar to that used in previous studies of the effect of district size on district policy outcomes (Meier and Bohte 2000).         "
"37","Hypotheses related to punctuated equilibrium theory present methodological challenges for presentation. The discrete nature of the hypotheses requires the use of discrete choice models rather than linear models. Furthermore, the hypotheses suggest that the preference for the categories may not be strictly ordered. It may be the case that large positive change is the most preferred option, followed by medium positive change, and finally small change. It may, alternatively, be the case that the most preferred option is large positive change, followed by small change, and then medium positive change. This possibility means that ordered categorical choice models would not be appropriate. Instead, this analysis employs a statistical model that assesses the relative probability of discrete choices without imposing any assumptions about the ordered relations between categories: multinomial logit (Greene 2000).         "
"38","Multinomial logit allows for the estimation of the change in relative probability of two unordered, discrete choices. For example, multinomial logit allows one to test whether independent variables make a policymaker more or less likely to adopt a large positive change rather than a moderate positive change. This estimator matches the requirements of the punctuated equilibrium process as a choice between unordered, discrete categories of outputs. Furthermore, this model allows for multivariate hypothesis testing, something difficult in the existing approaches to punctuated equilibrium analysis (e.g., Jones, Sulkin, and Larson 2003; Robinson 2004). Finally, multinomial logit is relatively easy to estimate given desktop statistical software packages. This makes the results of analysis easier to replicate by others because it does not require proprietary statistical code.5"
"39","Our first test is of the aggregate distribution of budgetary changes. Are changes in instructional spending per pupil distributed as expected in punctuated equilibrium theory? A quick look at Figure 1 illustrates that this is the case. As expected, the frequency of observations at the tails and near the mode are greater than expected by a normal distribution. Also, there are fewer observations in the moderate range than expected by a normal distribution.         "
"40","Being comfortable with the assumption that outputs are distributed in a manner that is consistent with punctuated equilibrium theory, we proceed to test the hypotheses related to factors that may be related to the quality of the fit between policymakers and the punctuated equilibrium expectations."
"41","Our first test is of the influence of centralization on budgetary outputs. If centralization makes a policymaking process less likely to produce outputs consistent with the punctuated equilibrium theory, we should see a decrease in the probability of large changes and small changes while seeing a increase in the probability of medium changes. In Table 2, we compare the relative frequency of each category to the base category of small change (based on the incremental model expectations).6 The first column of the first set of results (the individual tests) presents the test of the individual effect of centralization on the relative probability of a category rather than the baseline category of small change (while including a constant term and a control for growth). The results suggest that centralization does affect the choice between small change and alternative budgetary outputs.8 Higher levels of centralization make large and medium changes in positive and negative directions more probable. This suggests that centralization makes budgets less likely to remain in stasis.9 The results are consistent with those in Robinson's study of bureaucratization (2004) in that centralization—which was Robinson's measure of bureaucratization—is seen to increase nonincremental changes. It is more consistent with the incremental hypotheses linking of moderate and large change. The punctuated equilibrium model is not a necessary complication over the traditional incremental model in this situation insofar as moderate and large changes vary in the same way.         "
"42","To better assess the punctuated equilibrium theory, we present the results in a form in which it is easier to see the effect of centralization on the probability of large, medium, and small changes. The right side of Figure 2 presents the simulated probabilities of large change (positive and negative) under conditions of low and high centralization. This figure provides a sense of significance as well as effect size. The left column under Centralization in Figure 2 compares the probability of large negative change. Moving from low to high centralization (moving from the first to the third quartile values in the sample) almost doubles the predicted probability of a large negative change. The confidence intervals illustrate the significance of the relationship. The right column under Centralization in Figure 2 compares the probability of large positive change. Moving from low to high levels of centralization increases the probability of large positive change only slightly, and the overlap of the confidence intervals suggests the effect is not particularly significant. This initial finding illustrates the importance of separating positive from negative change. The dynamics of each may be (and in this case are) different.         "
"43","                 Effect of Organizational Size and Centralization on the Probabilities of Large Changes                      "
"44"," Figure 3 presents the same comparison for medium changes. Again, the right side of the figure presents the simulated probabilities under conditions of low and high centralization. The results indicate that centralization makes medium changes more likely (in the positive and negative direction) by 100% in the case of negative change and 50% in the case of positive change. The probability for a medium negative change doubles when one moves from low to high levels of centralization. Centralization is seen here making both medium and large changes more probable. This is characteristic of reduced stasis, but not punctuation behavior because of the parallel increases in large and medium changes. Figure 4 presents the same comparison for small changes. Centralization reduces the probability of small budgetary changes. The effect size is substantial (10%) and the confidence intervals suggest that the effect is significant.         "
"45","                 Effect of Organizational Size and Centralization on the Probabilities of Medium Changes                      "
"46","                 Effect of Organizational Size and Centralization on the Probabilities of Small Changes                      "
"47","We present similar analyses for the effect of school district size. The second column in the first set of tests on Table 2 presents the MNL coefficients comparing the relative probability of choosing large and medium changes rather than small changes. The pattern of effects related to organizational size is quite different from that of bureaucratization. Organizational size makes large and medium changes less likely than small changes. These effects are all individually significant. These results are consistent with the prediction that increases in organizational size are correlated with increased stasis. Again, the moderate and large changes change together as is predicted by a more traditional incremental approach. There is no evidence here that the increased complexity of separating moderate and large change is necessary to explain the effects of organizational structure on organizational policymaking. An institutional friction theory situated in a traditional incremental approach would be just as capable of explaining the pattern of changes—and would avoid the incorrect prediction of divergence in effects on moderate and large changes.         "
"48","The left sides of Figures 2–4 present the effects of organizational size on the probability of large, medium, and small change. These figures demonstrate that increasing organizational size (again, moving from the first to the third quartile values in the sample) decreases the probability of large changes. As in the case of centralization, the effects are substantial and significant for large negative changes and smaller and less significant for large positive change. Size has little effect (in terms of size or significance) on the probability of medium changes. Larger organizations are more likely to experience small changes, but the effect is small and only weakly significant. Here, as in the results related to centralization, organizational size is related to the stasis aspect of punctuated equilibrium theory, but the effects are not consistent with the punctuation aspect because the probabilities of large and small changes moved in opposite directions.         "
"49","The results suggest that centralization decreases and organizational size increases the stasis of the budgetary process, but do not make the process more or less consistent with punctuated equilibrium theories as a whole. Instead, these effects reduce or increase the frequency of all substantial change. The results seem more in keeping with the traditional incremental approach to explaining policy change than the newer, more complex punctuated equilibrium model.10"
"50","These findings have important implications for the study of education policy and public policy theory. The results should inform the debate over the impact of two elements of bureaucratization on school districts. Here centralization is related to less stasis (consistent with the results in Robinson 2004) rather than more stasis (as argued in Chubb and Moe 1990). More attention should be devoted to the effect of the various elements of centralization on education policymaking rather than accepting the traditional wisdom that centralization is a barrier to change. It may be the case that centralization stops certain types of changes while facilitating others, but this is an issue needing more study.         "
"51","These results also have important implications for policy theory. The growing acceptance of punctuated equilibrium models of politics should turn attention toward the factors that promote punctuated behavior. This article represents an initial test of some tentative hypotheses about these factors. Here the factors hypothesized to affect punctuation processes acted only partially consistently with expectations. While the aggregate sample was characterized by the excess of large and small changes as expected, the factors hypothesized to affect punctuations seemed only to affect the probability of the stasis aspect of punctuated equilibrium theories. Centralization made large change more likely while reducing the probability of stasis. Organization size made stasis more likely while reducing the probability of large changes. Against the predictions of punctuated equilibrium, these measures of institutional friction did not make both large and small changes more likely (or uniformly reduce the probability of medium changes). Future tests of punctuated equilibrium theories should recognize this possibility and allow for organizational factors to affect one aspect of punctuation behavior (say, the probability of stasis) and not the other (say, the probability of punctuation)."
"52","More importantly, the results suggest a challenge for punctuated equilibrium theory. While the theory has been remarkably successful at describing the distributions of policy change, the theory needs to justify itself as an explanatory theory. To do so, it needs to demonstrate that it helps us understand causal processes that traditional incremental theory cannot explain."
"53","This research suggests that while punctuated equilibrium theory is an important model of public policymaking, there is a long way to go before we really understand punctuated dynamics in policymaking processes. We hope that this study will serve as a springboard for more research by providing a more flexible research strategy to allow easier testing of hypotheses related to the dynamics of policy outputs."
