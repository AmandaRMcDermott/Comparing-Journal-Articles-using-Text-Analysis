"1","Consider the timeline of elections (following Erikson and Wlezien 2012; also see Wlezien and Erikson 2002). We start the timeline immediately after the previous election. We end it on Election Day. Many events occur over the timeline—some very prominent and others routine. We want to know whether these events have effects. We also want to know whether the effects last.         "
"2","There is evidence of lasting influences from pre‐election polls in U.S. presidential elections (Erikson and Wlezien 2012). In these “trial heat” polls, survey organizations typically ask respondents which candidate they would vote for “if the election were held today.” The results of these polls tell us only a little about the persistence of specific events, as it is difficult to even identify their effects.2 The polls can tell us quite a lot about general patterns, however, as we can assess how poll results at different points of the election cycle match the final results. If polls are increasingly informative across the timeline, then we know that electoral preferences change and that some of the change lasts to impact the outcome. If polls are equally well informative across the timeline, then either (1) preferences do not change or else (2) preferences do change but these innovations do not persist; that is, the fundamentals remain the same.3"
"3","Scholars have found that, at the beginning of the election year in the United States, some 300 days before the balloting, there is virtually no relationship between the results of presidential polls and the actual vote. At the end of the cycle, by contrast, poll results virtually match the final result. In between, polls become more and more accurate. This is revealing about voter preferences. It tells us that they change over the election year and in meaningful ways: Although much of the change that we observe is short‐lived, and dissipates before Election Day, a substantial portion carries forward to impact the final outcome.4"
"4","Polls and the vote in U.S. congressional elections exhibit a similar pattern (Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien 2010). In the “generic” ballot, survey organizations ask respondents which party's candidate for Congress they would vote for in their district. These measured preferences are more informative early in the election year. They also are less informative toward the end of the election cycle. Polls for parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom are informative earlier still (Wlezien et al. 2013), starting to come into focus years before Election Day.         "
"5","This research offers certain lessons. First, polls in each case become more revealing about the outcome the closer the election. This is as we might expect, but it indicates that electoral preferences evolve over time in both countries. Second, there is a hint of difference between presidential and legislative elections, where polls for the former are less predictive of the vote early in the election cycle and more predictive at the end of the timeline. This is also as we might expect, given that presidential polls capture preferences for the two candidates and the parliamentary and congressional polls tap party support in the various legislative districts. Third, it may be that early polls are more informative about U.K. parliamentary election outcomes than legislative elections in the United States. This is suggestive about the effects of government institutions—that electoral preferences develop earlier in parliamentary systems. Whether the patterns are real and hold in other countries remains to be seen."
"6","Countries differ in many ways, and there is reason to expect that some of the differences—particularly in relation to political institutions—matter for electoral preferences (also see Shugart and Carey 1992). We consider both government and electoral institutions. They structure the set of choices faced by voters, and this can influence the formation and stability of preferences across the timeline.         "
"7","The government structure can influence how and when electoral preferences form. Of special importance are the differences between presidential and parliamentary systems. There are two main differences: (1) between presidential and parliamentary elections and (2) between legislative elections in presidential and parliamentary systems."
"8","First, in presidential elections voters select an individual to represent the country, whereas in parliamentary elections they select a legislature, which in turn produces a government. In presidential elections, there often is greater uncertainty over the identity of the candidates. Even to the extent the candidates are known, information about their attributes and policies often is not known until later still in the election cycle. By contrast, in parliamentary systems, parties tend to dominate (Adams, Merrill, and Grofman 2005; Budge and Farlie 1983). This is important because dispositions toward parties, while not fixed, are more durable than those toward candidates. Even to the extent party leaders are important to voters in parliamentary systems (e.g., Clarke et al. 2004), their identities typically are known well in advance, earlier than presidential candidates. As a result, we expect that voters’ preferences crystallize earlier in parliamentary elections.5"
"9","Second, there also is reason to expect that the difference between legislative elections in parliamentary and presidential systems influences the formation of preferences. There actually are at least two reasons. To begin with, as discussed above, politics in parliamentary systems centers on parties even where single‐member districts are used (also see Cox 1997; Mair 1997). To the extent party dispositions matter more in parliamentary systems, preferences in legislative elections should harden earlier by comparison with preferences in presidential systems.6 In addition, legislative elections in presidential systems can be influenced by presidential elections themselves, in the form of coattails (Ferejohn and Calvert 1984; Golder 2006). As a result, electoral preferences in such systems may coalesce later in the election cycle.            "
"10","Electoral systems also may have consequences for how preferences evolve. There are two main expressions: (1) the general difference between proportional representation and single‐member districts and (2) the specific differences in the number of political parties."
"11","First, we might hypothesize that there is less change in preferences in systems where proportional representation is used as opposed to single‐member districts (SMDs). The intuition is fairly straightforward: Voters choose among parties and not candidates, and so preferences may tend to be more stable over the election timeline. Of course, this depends on the level of voter alignments with parties (van der Brug, van der Eijk, and Franklin 2007).7 The basis for party alignments also is important (Clarke et al. 2004). The stability of party coalitions is as well, since change in the coalition (or in the expected governing coalition) can cause voter preferences to change (Strøm 1997).            "
"12","Just as there are elements of instability in proportional systems, there are elements of stability in candidate‐centered ones: Parties matter there too and incumbency as well, and this can limit the effects of events (Abramowitz 1991; Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1984).8 It thus is not clear that proportionality should produce more stability. Further, some proportional systems have candidate‐centric aspects to their electoral formula—the degree to which candidates have incentives to cultivate a personal vote (Carey and Shugart 1995).            "
"13","The degree of candidate or party centricity actually might better account for variation across countries than the categorical distinction between proportional and SMD systems per se, which we consider in our analyses."
"14","Second, we might even propose that proportionality actually leads to greater volatility in preferences. It is well known that electoral systems produce party systems, and the number of parties is one consequence (and indicator) of proportional election rules (Duverger 1954; also see Cox 1997). This may have implications for the evolution of electoral preferences. In systems where there are fewer parties, voters face less choice, and this may make preferences more stable and also more predictive of the final vote. That is, the propensity of individual voters to transfer their vote between parties is reduced as a function of the number of options available to them and the perceived average distance between the parties (Pedersen 1979). In multiparty systems, there is more choice and opportunity for change, and so the Election Day vote may be less clear in the polls until very late in the electoral cycle.            "
"15","Pollsters have sought to measure citizens’ preferences for candidates or parties for almost three quarters of a century. While varying due to differences in context, most pre‐election polls ask how citizens would vote “if the election were held today.” We have compiled what we believe is the most extensive comparative data set ever assembled of national polls of the vote intentions for presidential and legislative elections.9 The data set consists of a total of 26,917 polls spanning the period from 1942 to 2013. The data cover a total of 312 elections (including 22 runoff elections) in 45 countries, 13 of which are pure presidential systems, 28 of which are parliamentary systems, and four of which are mixed, including a president and a parliament. All told, we have poll data for presidential elections in 23 countries and legislative elections in 31 countries, summarized in Table 1. Further details are provided in Appendix S1 in the supporting information. On average, we have 598 polls per country for approximately seven elections per country, or about 86 polls per election cycle. Given the typical interval—1,195 days—between elections, we are missing polls on most dates and in many weeks and even months.         "
"16","Recall that we are interested in whether and how electoral preferences evolve over the timeline. For this, we need a method for assessing the correspondence between polls at different points in time and the eventual vote. Ideally, we would use time‐series analysis. That is, we would examine the relationship between polls at different points in time within the various election years taken separately or pooled together. In theory, this would tell us exactly what we want—whether changes to preferences decay or last. In practice, it is not so straightforward because of data limitations. There are two main problems. First, as we have seen, data frequently are missing for weekly periods and even months. This has fairly obvious implications for what we can do with standard time‐series techniques. Second, the ratio of sampling variance to the true variance often is quite large. This has substantial, if less obvious, complications: The presence of sampling (and other survey) error makes it difficult to uncover the underlying process."
"17","What can we do instead? Our approach is to follow Erikson and Wlezien (2012) and treat the data as a series of cross‐sections—across elections—for each day of the election cycle. With the data organized as a series of cross‐sections, we can assess how polls and the vote across elections match up at different points in time. Sampling error is not a problem for such an exercise; whereas error may swamp the variance from true change when observing within‐election polls, it is dwarfed by election‐to‐election (and party‐to‐party) differences in the cross‐section.10 However, the problem that pre‐election polls are sometimes sparse and conducted at irregular intervals remains.         "
"18","When readings of electoral preferences are missing, we can interpolate daily voter preferences from available polls. For any date without a poll, an estimate is created as the weighted average from the most recent date of polling and the next date of polling. Weights are in proportion to the closeness of the surrounding earlier or later poll. Where we interpolate, we also introduce a random component based on the poll variance—controlling for country, party, and election—to reflect the uncertainty associated with the imputed values.11 We thus are able to include in our analysis any election cycle from the moment the first poll is conducted in that cycle. This would not be acceptable in conventional time‐series analysis, as interpolating would compromise the independence of observations. Given that the methodology is explicitly cross‐sectional, there is no such problem: Interpolating actually permits a more fine‐grained analysis. The main drawback of the approach is that we cannot assess whether dynamics differ across particular elections. Importantly, the method allows us to assess patterns of correspondence across elections in different subsets of elections (e.g., across types of systems).12"
"19","For our analysis, we also need data on the actual vote shares parties and candidates receive on Election Day. We rely on a wide range of official sources and election data resources; details are reported in Appendix S2 in the supporting information."
"20","To analyze the relationship between polls and the vote over the election timeline, we estimate a series of daily equations predicting the vote share for different parties or candidates (j) in different elections (k) across countries (m) from vote intentions in the polls on each day of the timeline:            "
"21","To begin with, we are interested in the variance explained by the polls (R‐squared) over the timeline. This tells us how well the polls predict the vote at each point in time. If the R‐squared increases over time, we know that polls become better predictors the closer the election. The improvement in predictability will reflect the variance of the shocks and the proportion that persists, bearing in mind that some changes may not last. An increase in R‐squareds would not necessarily mean that the polls themselves—instead of poll‐based predictions—are increasingly accurate. For this, we need to examine the regression coefficient (bt) relating the polls and the vote. This tells us what proportion of the poll margin on each day carries forward to Election Day. If the coefficient increasingly approaches 1.0 as the R‐squared increases over time, we know that the polls converge on the vote.         "
"22","It is important to recognize that polls can be increasingly predictive of the vote—and produce larger R‐squareds—while the coefficient relating the polls and the vote remains unchanged. This suggests that the R‐squareds may be more relevant, as they reveal how predictable outcomes are. The problem is that these are not very useful across different data, as they are standardized based on the total observed variance in the particular sample. Change the countries and we change the variance and so also the R‐squareds, and that change may tell us absolutely nothing about the effects of polls. We thus turn to unstandardized measures, specifically, the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE indicates how much of the actual vote variance is unexplained (e.g., 2.5 percentage points for one set of countries compared to 1.5 points for another) and so is a particularly useful measure when forecasting, which in effect is what we are doing here.14"
"23","Let us consider some simple examples of what we might observe, focusing on the RMSE. Clearly, if preferences evolve at all, the RMSE would go down over time. That is, the polls would increasingly predict the vote. The exact functional form would depend on how much of the variance is due to long‐term and short‐term components, however. Figure 1 displays four possible models.         "
"24","The panel in the upper‐left corner presents the path of an RMSE from a baseline model where the vote is a function only of short‐term factors, with all elections in different years sharing one common equilibrium value (V*). In time‐series language, polls for all parties and elections evolve as a stationary series. Here, earlier polls tell us little about the Election Day vote. This is because any difference between early polls and the common mean would decay by Election Day, leaving V* as the expectation in each year. Late polls would provide information, however, as they reflect effects that do not fully decay. The result in terms of the RMSE is the nonlinear temporal pattern shown in the panel, where the RMSE starts at some high value and declines near the end of the cycle.         "
"25","The assumption of a common equilibrium may not be very realistic, as it implies that elections are pretty much the same. We relax the assumption in the upper‐right frame of Figure 1. Here, the vote is a function of both short‐term factors and long‐term factors, where the equilibrium term (V*Y) varies by year Y but does not change over time. From a time‐series perspective, this represents a set of stationary series varying around different yearly means. (We also could introduce different means for parties and candidates (j), which matter much more, as we will see.) In this representation, earlier polls tell us more about the Election Day vote because of differences across elections (and parties). Later polls provide additional information because of late‐arriving campaign effects. The result in terms of RMSE is much like what we saw in the upper‐left panel, but consistently lower. This characterization is implicit in many election prediction models (e.g., Gelman and King 1993).         "
"26","It may be that equilibria are not constant over each election cycle. The lower‐left panel of Figure 1 reflects this possibility, where the equilibria evolve over the timeline. In this model, all shocks accumulate, and so the time series evolves as a “random walk” and polls become consistently more informative over time. Of course, it may be that there are both short‐term and long‐term components, where the model combines a stationary series and a random walk. Here, polls would become more predictive but at an increasing rate as the election approaches, owing to late‐arriving short‐term forces. The expected pattern is depicted in the lower‐right frame of Figure 1.15"
"27","Which, if any, of these models should we expect as an accurate portrayal of the RMSE? That is an empirical question, of course. To begin with, we note that there are substantial differences in the average level of electoral support across parties and, to a lesser extent, elections. Consider analysis of variance (ANOVA) results, which indicate that 86% of the variance in the party vote in different countries and elections is due to systematic party differences. In actuality, since party variables are specific to each country, some of this party‐explained variance reflects differences across countries; specifically, countries account for 37% and parties account for another 49%. The remaining 14% of the variance reflects differences across elections and time. ANOVA of daily polls indicates that an even smaller percentage is due to changes in preferences over the election timeline. That is, most of the variance in the polls is due to differences across parties, countries, and elections. This leads us toward the models in the right‐hand column of Figure 1, where there are differences in equilibrium support. The question that remains then is whether the changes in voter preferences that we observe decay or last. If some substantial portion lasts, we would expect a pattern like what we see in the lower‐right corner of the figure.         "
"28","It may be that electoral preferences evolve over the election cycle in a similar way across political systems. It also may be that the pattern differs. Consider our discussion of political institutions. There we posited differences between presidential and parliamentary elections, where electoral preferences come into focus more quickly in the latter. In terms of Figure 1, we expect that the RMSEs would be consistently lower in parliamentary systems until the very end of the timeline, when presidential elections come into focus. We also posited differences between legislative elections in presidential and parliamentary systems, which might show a similar, if less pronounced, pattern. Finally, we posited possible, contrasting differences between legislative elections in proportional and SMD systems. First, to the extent the former mostly led voters to place a greater emphasis on their party preferences, we would expect electoral preferences in proportional systems to be more predictive of the vote throughout the election cycle, at least until the very end of the campaign. Second, to the extent these systems mostly provide voters with choice leading up to Election Day, we would expect preferences to be less predictive throughout, potentially right up to the very end.16 These are our hypotheses. Now let us see what the data reveal.         "
"29","To begin the analysis, let us consider the scatterplot between polls and the vote at various points of the election cycle. This is shown in Figure 2. The figure displays the poll share for all parties or candidates in all elections and countries for which we have actual polls (i.e., excluding imputed poll numbers). In the upper left‐hand panel of the figure, using polls that are available 900 days before the election, fully 2.5 years before an election, we see that there already is a discernible pattern. That is, the poll share and the vote share are positively related, though there also is a good amount of variation. At that point in time, we have polls in the field in approximately 40% of our cases, and this increases fairly steadily, reaching 75% one year before Election Day. As we turn to polls later in the election cycle, moving horizontally and then vertically through the figure, a clearer pattern emerges; the poll share and final vote share line up. Simply, as we get closer to the election, the polls tell us more about the outcome. It is as one would expect if preferences change and a nontrivial portion lasts. But how much do preferences evolve?         "
"30","In Figure 3, we make a more fine‐grained presentation. Here, we display the cross‐sectional RMSE from regressing the vote division on the poll division for each date starting 900 days before the election, now including the imputed data. (The number of cases—parties/candidates and elections—on each day is shown in Appendix Figure A1.) To calculate the RMSE, one estimates the prediction errors from the regression, squares them, calculates the mean of those squared errors, and then takes the square root of the mean. The adjusted R‐squareds and coefficients from the regressions are provided in the supporting information, Appendix S3, Figures S3.1 and S3.2.         "
"31","To begin with, we estimate Equation 1 for all elections pooled together. This includes controls for different parties in different countries—which effectively accounts for differences across both countries and parties, recalling that party variables are country‐specific. To show what effect the party controls have, we also estimate the equation without those controls. The regression equation is bootstrapped to estimate the standard errors of the RMSEs, enabling us to determine whether the relationship between polls and the vote differs significantly across institutional settings.17"
"32","The series of RMSEs in Figure 3 reveals that polls predict the final vote fairly well far in advance of an election. Consider first the results without party controls. Fully 2.5 years out, the RMSE is about 7 percentage points. In terms of R‐squareds, the poll share at that point in time accounts for over 80% of the variance in the party/candidate vote share on Election Day. This early structure may be surprising but is very much to be expected given the large cross‐party variance in the poll and vote shares noted earlier. That is, shares of both the polls and the vote tend to be consistently higher for certain parties and consistently lower for others. Much as we could see in Figure 2, the RMSE decreases quite steadily over the election timeline, to about 5 points on Election Day. This tells us that preferences evolve, if only very slowly. The pattern almost perfectly matches the depiction in the lower right‐hand panel of Figure 1.         "
"33","Results in Figure 3 from regressions including dummy variables for the different parties in different countries reveal a similar pattern. Not surprisingly, the RMSEs are smaller throughout the 900‐day timeline, as the party controls help predict vote shares. The trend over the timeline is essentially the same, however. This indicates once again that preferences come into increasing focus. They come into focus over the “long campaign” between elections but also during the short, official campaign in the weeks leading up to the election.         "
"34","The results in Figure 3 are based on a growing number of elections. At the beginning of the final year of the election cycle, for instance, the number of parties and candidates in our equation is about 750; by Election Day, the number is over 1,000. The fact that the cases (and the dependent variable) change can impact the trend in our results. We thus need to estimate the daily equation for the same set of cases. Figure 4 shows the resulting RMSEs from regressions for the 252 elections—and a total of 899 observations—for which we have poll readings for the final 200 days of the election cycle. These results are almost identical to what we observed in Figure 3; indeed, the correlation between the series is 0.98 (p < .001). The patterns we have observed thus are quite real. Electoral preferences demonstrate early structure but also evolve.18"
"35","Thus far, our analysis has examined all elections pooled in a single analysis, regardless of institutional context. We have hypothesized that institutions matter, however. Specifically, we posited that political institutions structure the formation of preferences in a number of possible ways. Let us first consider the effects of government structure. Recall that we expect that voters’ preferences crystallize earlier in the electoral cycle in parliamentary elections compared to presidential races. To test the hypothesis, we estimate separate equations relating poll and vote shares in the two types of elections. Figure 5 plots the resulting RMSEs over the final 200 days of the election cycle, based on models including party controls. The patterns in the figure are consistent with our expectations. At the beginning of the timeline, 200 days out, polls are much more informative in parliamentary elections, with an RMSE of 4 percentage points compared to 6 points for presidential elections. As can be seen in the figure, the difference is statistically significant; that is, the confidence intervals do not overlap. The gap narrows over time, with preferences for presidential elections coming increasingly into focus, especially during the last 50 days. The two are indistinguishable on Election Day. By that point in time, preferences in both types of elections are pretty much fully formed. Thus, there are important differences in the structure and evolution of preferences in presidential and parliamentary elections. This is as hypothesized.            "
"36","We next turn to differences between legislative elections in parliamentary and presidential systems. There is reason to suppose that party matters more in the former, so that electoral preferences crystallize earlier there than in the latter. Figure 6 shows the RMSEs for regressions relating the polls and the legislative vote in the two systems. The patterns in the figure indicate little difference in the evolution of preferences. While polls are slightly better predictors of the legislative vote in presidential systems, the differences are small and not consistently reliable. It seems that preferences for legislative elections evolve in much the same way regardless of the institutional context.19 The only real difference relating to government institutions is between presidential elections on the one hand and legislative elections on the other.            "
"37","Earlier, we posited that proportional and plurality systems might influence how electoral preferences evolve over the timeline. There are two contrasting expectations: (1) that preferences crystallize earlier in proportional systems because of the greater importance of party support, and (2) that preferences crystallize late in proportional systems because of the greater choice (i.e., larger number of political parties)."
"38","To begin with, we examine the general differences between the two systems. Figure 7 plots the RMSEs for regressions relating the polls and the legislative vote in proportional and single‐member district plurality systems. In the figure, we can see that polls are slightly more predictive in proportional systems. The differences are very small, however, and statistically significant only intermittently. If nothing else, the results indicate that preferences do not come into focus earlier and more completely in proportional systems.            "
"39","As discussed above, the potential impact of proportional and plurality systems may depend on electoral formula or rules, as well as the extent to which they structure vote choice by party preference or create incentives for candidates to cultivate a personal vote. We can test such differences. For this, we classify countries as either party‐ or candidate‐centric based on the Johnson and Wallack (2013) index. Specifically, we code a country's electoral rules as party‐centric if it scores 1 to 6 on the index and candidate‐centric if it scores 7 to 12. Table 2 shows the overlap of the proportional‐plurality and party‐candidate categories—confirming that most but not all proportional systems are party‐dominated and that most but not all plurality systems are candidate‐centric.            "
"40","Figure 8 plots the RMSEs for party‐ and candidate‐centric electoral systems. This reveals a larger and statistically significant difference. From 200 days out, preferences are clearer in party‐centric systems, with the difference only narrowing slightly in the final 50 days, and even then only marginally. This suggests that, while there is weak evidence that proportional systems per se structure electoral preferences in meaningful ways, party‐centric electoral rules that often are associated with proportional systems do matter, at least to some degree.            "
"41","As discussed, there are other ways in which proportionality can influence the formation of preferences, including the number of choices that electoral systems present. We hypothesized that choice could reduce the predictability of elections from polls owing to volatility in preferences it induces. To test the possibility, Figure 9 plots the RMSEs from regressing vote shares on polls for those election cycles where the effective number of parties (ENP) is less than or greater than 3.5.20 This threshold is the mean effective number of parties across all election cycles in legislative elections, enabling us to assess the difference between electoral systems that are highly fractionalized and those that are not. The differences here are inscrutable. While the RMSEs are lower over most of the time period for election cycles where there are fewer than 3.5 effective parties, the differences are trivial and statistically insignificant. Thus, there is little evidence to support the hypothesis of greater instability in preferences in multiparty systems. The main effect of electoral institutions thus seems to be in the degree to which they encourage party voting and so increase electoral predictability over the timeline of elections.            "
"42","Voter preferences evolve in a systematic way over the election timeline in a wide range of representative democracies. There is structure to preferences well in advance of elections—indeed, years before citizens actually vote. That is, very early polls predict the vote, at least to some extent. This largely reflects differences in the equilibrium support of parties and candidates. Polls do become increasingly informative over time, however, pointing to real evolution of preferences. That this pattern holds across countries is important and points toward a general tendency in the formation of electoral preferences. But the pattern is not precisely the same in all countries. Political institutions structure the evolution of voters’ preferences.21"
"43","Government institutions are important. Preferences come into focus later in presidential elections than in parliamentary ones. A year out from Election Day, parliamentary elections are more predictable from the polls than are the outcomes of presidential races. This presumably reflects the greater uncertainties involved in the assessment of presidential candidates and also the time it takes for voters to directly factor in their dispositions toward the political parties (Erikson and Wlezien 2012). In parliamentary systems, by contrast, parties matter more early on. This is important because partisan dispositions, while not fixed, are more durable than those toward candidates. That preferences are in place much later in presidential systems thus comes as little surprise. That there is little difference between legislative elections in presidential and parliamentary systems may be surprising, however. It implies that parties do not matter consistently more to voters in the latter.         "
"44","Electoral institutions also are important. We find limited evidence of general differences across systems—that proportional representation per se is what matters. We find stronger evidence that the party centricity of the systems matters most of all. Although closely related to proportionality, there is significant variation in party centricity within both proportional and plurality systems, and this variation is of consequence for the formation of electoral preferences. The number of parties, meanwhile, appears to have little effect."
"45","We have only scratched the surface of the variation in context. To begin with, political institutions differ in ways that we have not considered. Perhaps more importantly, there are other differences in context that we have not even begun to explore. Some of the differences relate to countries themselves. For instance, following Converse (1969), there is reason to think that the age of democracy is important to the formation and evolution of preferences. Other differences relate not to political institutions or the countries themselves, but to characteristics of political parties. There are numerous possibilities here, most notable of which may be whether parties are in government or opposition, as is suggested by the literature on economic voting (e.g., Duch and Stevenson 2008; Fiorina 1981). Another is whether parties are catch‐all or niche. The age and size of parties also could matter. Clearly, much research remains to be done, and our methodology can guide the way.         "
"46","That said, we have learned something about the general pattern relating preferences and the vote over the election timeline and the structuring influences of political institutions. We have shown that preferences are often in place far in advance of Election Day and that they evolve slowly over time. Indeed, the final outcome is fairly clear in the polls before the election campaign really begins. This is not to say that the campaign does not matter, as it does, particularly in certain types of countries and elections where candidates are central. Even there, however, it is clear that the “long campaign” between elections matters most of all."
