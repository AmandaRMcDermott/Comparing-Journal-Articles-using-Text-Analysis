"1","The main data I analyze are from a regular, face‐to‐face survey conducted by the Russian Center for Public Opinion Research (VCIOM) until 2003, and then by its successor, the Levada Center. VCIOM, founded in 1988, was directed from 1992 by Yuri Levada, a sociologist who had been fired from Moscow State University in 1969 for “ideological mistakes in his lectures.” VCIOM earned a reputation as the most professional and politically independent of Russia's half‐dozen leading polling organizations. This independence is thought to have prompted a state takeover in 2003, in which Levada was fired. The center's researchers set up the private Levada Center, which continued the polls."
"2","The surveys are of a nationally representative sample of voting‐age citizens, who are interviewed in their homes. I focus on two questions. First, the pollsters ask: “On the whole do you approve or disapprove of the performance of [the president's name]?” This question, similar to one on the U.S. Gallup poll, was included monthly from late 1996.4 I use it to examine approval of President Putin, first elected in March 2000. Since this question was asked only occasionally before September 1996, I use another to study Yeltsin's popularity. This one, included every second month from early 1994, asked: “What evaluation from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest) would you give the President of Russia Boris Yeltsin?”5 I analyze the average evaluation.6 When both measures are available, the two are highly correlated, in levels (at r = .98) and in two‐month differences (r = .91).         "
"3"," Figure 1 shows the data. On the left, Yeltsin bumps his way down from a December 1990 peak to a low of 6% in early 2009. On the right, Putin glides along, consistently above 60%. No American president has equaled Putin's record since regular polling began in the 1930s. Eisenhower came closest, but even his rating fell at times into the 40s. No British prime minister has come close since the first MORI poll in 1979.7 Nor have postwar U.S. presidents plumbed the depths to which Yeltsin sank—the lowest was Harry Truman's 22% in February 1952.         "

"5"," Source: Surveys of VCIOM and Levada Center (see web appendix).Note: Yeltsin approval is percentage of respondents saying on the whole they approve of the performance of Boris Yeltsin. Likewise for Putin approval. Ratings on 10‐point scale are average answer to question: “What evaluation from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest) would you give the President of Russia (name of president)?” Missing months interpolated. Putin approval includes his first period as prime minister.                     "
"6","A natural first question, then, is whether the results are believable. Might Putin's ratings have been concocted to please the Kremlin or reflect insincere replies of intimidated respondents? There are reasons to doubt this. First, it is hard to believe VCIOM was slanting results to please Putin given its leader's semidissident past and the state's takeover to punish it for insufficient loyalty. Various Western pollsters (such as World Public Opinion and the New Russia Barometer) have worked with the Levada group and found it highly professional. The dynamics in VCIOM/Levada polls match those in surveys by other organizations. For instance, in 2006–2007 the Levada 10‐point rating correlates at r = .93 with the share that said in polls of the Fond Obshchestvennogo Mnenia that they “trusted” Putin."
"7","Second, it seems unlikely many respondents were intimidated given their critical responses on other questions. Asked in 2004 whether there was more or less corruption and abuse of power in the highest state organs than a year before, 30% said “more,” 45% said “the same amount,” and only 13% said “less.”8 Respondents were not shy to give Yeltsin a 6% approval rating and Putin just 31% in 1999. Even as Russians swooned over Putin, until mid‐2007, his governments never won the approval of more than 46%, and large majorities opposed some of his policies, including—after the initial period—the military occupation of Chechnya.9"
"8","Another concern is that, by limiting respondents to a 10‐point scale, the surveys might be censoring the data. In the web appendix, I show the distributions of responses around Yeltsin's highest and lowest points. While the distribution is reasonably symmetric for Yeltsin's peak, respondents did cluster at the bottom in 1999. If the scale was censoring some respondents, the effect of economic decline under Yeltsin may actually have been greater than that estimated here."
"9","What might explain the path of approval in Figure 1? In other countries, the public often rallies behind leaders at the start of wars (Mueller 1973). Both wars in the southern republic of Chechnya began in the run‐up to presidential elections. In November 1994, Yeltsin's aide Oleg Lobov reportedly said that a “small, victorious war” would “raise the president's ratings.”10 Putin's surge occurred as he sent troops to the republic for a second time and promised to crush the terrorists who had bombed four apartment buildings. “People believed that he, personally, could protect them,” Yeltsin wrote in his memoirs. “That's what explains his surge in popularity” (Yeltsin 2000, 338).         "
"10","Surveys suggest the public viewed the two wars quite differently. Yeltsin's use of force in December 1994 was widely condemned; the next month, two‐thirds of respondents opposed it (Jeffries 2002, 372). By summer, 71% disapproved of Yeltsin's approach to Chechnya. However, opinion soon soured on the compromise of 1996, under which terrorists regularly crossed the border to take hostages for ransom. In October 1999, 74% favored a major military operation against illegal armed groups in Chechnya.11"
"11","Support, however, proved fickle. By July 2000, about two‐thirds of Russians thought Putin's attempts to rout the insurgents mostly or completely unsuccessful, and the share remained above 60% until 2006. By November 2000, more Russians favored starting peace negotiations than continuing the military operation. By early 2001, fewer than one in ten respondents said they were attracted to Putin by his Chechnya policy. If Putin's hard line on Chechnya helped him early on, this does not seem to have been the case later. To capture attitudes toward Putin's Chechnya policy, I use a variable that measures the percentage of respondents who favored “continuing the military operation” in Chechnya rather than “negotiating with the ‘fighters’.”12"
"12","Second, some saw the main reason for Putin's popularity and Yeltsin's dwindling appeal in their divergent personal styles. Yeltsin—ailing, gaffe‐prone, at times visibly inebriated—could hardly have seemed more different from the disciplined, energetic, sober Putin, a former spy and judo black belt. Polls confirm that Russians were attracted by Putin's image of youthful vigor and put off by Yeltsin's physical decline. Asked what qualities attracted them to Putin, from 30 to 47% of respondents chose “he is an energetic, decisive, strong‐willed person.” Only 9% said this of Yeltsin in January 2000. Even in 1996, the third most frequent thing respondents disliked about Yeltsin was that he was “a sick, weak person.”13"
"13","But did the presidents’ images explain their varying support? Unfortunately, regular data on this were not available; respondents were asked only occasionally about Putin's attractions. Governing style is also manifested in particular incidents. One episode thought to have harmed Putin's image was his reaction when the Kursk nuclear submarine sank in 2000. While the Navy brass dithered, ignoring Western offers of help, the news showed Putin jet‐skiing on the Black Sea. Yeltsin's frequent hospital stays cannot have improved his image (Mishler and Willerton 2003). His drinking problem was made vivid in August 1994, when television showed him jerkily conducting a police band in Berlin.         "
"14","Putin promised from the start to restore “order” after the turbulent 1990s, to fight crime and corruption and reimpose control over wayward local officials. A former KGB officer, he seemed to have the appropriate experience and connections. Could this explain his popularity? In surveys, many Russians say they favor strong leaders and are willing to sacrifice some rights in return for order.14 However, advocates of a “strong hand” and other antidemocratic norms turn out to be less likely to support Putin than to back Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov or the ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. In fact, Whitefield (2005) found it was democracy supporters who favored Putin.15"
"15","Moreover, many Russians were skeptical of Putin's claims. Periodically, VCIOM/Levada polls asked how successful Putin had been at imposing order. On average 47% thought he had been at least partly successful; 49% thought he had been unsuccessful.16 There was no clear trend. On more specific questions, reports of deterioration predominated. Each year after 2000, at least 25% more thought citizens’ personal security had worsened than thought it had improved; at least 15% more saw decline in law enforcement than saw progress.17 Early on, 29% liked Putin because he “could impose order in the country.” By October 2006 the share had fallen to 13%.18"
"16","Following Mishler and Willerton (2003), I created a measure of Russians’ political mood from the question: “Overall, how would you assess the political situation in Russia?” I subtracted the proportion choosing “critical, explosive,” or “tense” from that saying “calm” or “favorable.” To test whether attacking the oligarchs and exploiting nostalgia won Putin support, I created dummies for the months after the arrest of the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and after Putin restored the Soviet music to the national anthem. A large plurality—46% in a VCIOM poll—favored the Soviet version.19"
"17","Respondents credited Putin with “strengthening Russia's international position.” Between July 2000 and March 2007, on average 65% of respondents said he was quite or very successful at this, compared to 47% who said this of his efforts to “introduce order in the country.” By contrast, many thought Yeltsin had been too accommodating toward the West, which expanded NATO into Eastern Europe on his watch and then bombed the Serbs over Kosovo. To capture effects of foreign affairs, I included dummies for the Kosovo bombing, the 9/11 attack, which prompted a pro‐American turn on Putin's part, and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. The Kosovo and Iraq wars were both unpopular in Russia and might have sapped support for presidents viewed as too cozy with Washington. Under Putin, I also included the share that said he was strengthening Russia's international position minus the share that thought him mostly or completely unsuccessful in this."
"18","To his opponents, Putin's ratings simply showed the Kremlin's increasing dominance of the press. In the words of Garry Kasparov: “You cannot talk about polls and popularity when all of the media are under state control” (Remnick 2007). Under Putin, state companies or loyal businessmen took over the last independent national television networks. Strong criticism of the president—although not of the government—disappeared from broadcasts. Based on a 1999 survey, White, Oates, and McAllister (2005, 192) concluded that media bias helped secure Putin's victory: “The decisive factor in this dramatic reversal of fortunes appeared to be the media, particularly state television.” Measuring change in press freedom was difficult. Lacking a more sophisticated gauge, I used Freedom House's index of press freedom, with the annual value used for each month of the relevant year. I also created a variable for the month of the state takeover of NTV, the network previously most critical of the Kremlin.         "
"19","Finally, economic performance—and, especially, perceptions of it—has been shown to affect approval of incumbents in the United States, France, and Britain (Clarke and Stewart 1995; Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002; Lafay 1991; Sanders 2000). In Russia, scholars have found economic influences on voting (Colton 2000; Tucker 2006), and these might also shape presidential popularity. Such effects might be retrospective or prospective and might focus on respondents’ own circumstances or their views of conditions nationwide. Previous studies of post‐Soviet countries found evidence of all four types of economic influences. Hesli and Bashkirova (2001), looking at cross‐sectional surveys, found all four effects affected support for Yeltsin. Mishler and Willerton (2003), focusing on time‐series data, noted the influence of retrospective evaluations of the national economy and family finances. Rose, Mishler, and Munro (2004, 209) found in a cross‐section that views of current economic performance were the strongest predictor of support for the political regime.         "
"20","Data were available in the VCIOM/Levada surveys to construct three variables. For retrospective evaluations of the national economy, I use the question: “How would you assess Russia's present economic situation?” For retrospective assessments of personal finances, I use: “How would you assess the current material situation of your family?” For each of these, I subtracted the shares saying “very bad” or “bad” from those saying “very good” or “good,” ignoring those who said “in between” or “don't know.” For prospective evaluations of the national economy, I use: “What do you think awaits Russia in the economy in the coming several months?” I subtracted the percentage anticipating decline from that expecting improvement.20 Unfortunately, no question captured prospective evaluations of personal finances for a comparable period. I use a dummy for the shock of the August 1998 financial crisis and another for January 2005, when Putin introduced a reform to replace in‐kind benefits such as free bus tickets and drugs for pensioners by cash grants. This provoked major demonstrations of benefit recipients, who complained that the compensation was insufficient.         "
"21","Before analyzing the presidential ratings, some statistical issues must be addressed. As is well known, OLS regressions on nonstationary data may produce spurious results. I therefore examined whether the approval data and the time‐series explanatory variables were stationary, i.e., I(0); had a unit root, i.e., I(1); or were something in between, i.e., fractionally integrated, I(d) where 0 < d < 1.21 Table 1 shows test statistics for these series. I use the augmented Dickey‐Fuller (ADF) and the Phillips‐Perron tests to test the null hypothesis of a unit root, and the Kwiatkowski et al. (KPSS) and Harris‐McCabe‐Leybourne (HML) tests to test the null of stationarity. I treat the two presidencies separately because, examining Figure 1, it seems likely the underlying process changed between their tenures.22"
"22","The tests have weak power and do not always agree. In almost all cases, the HML test—but not the KPSS test—suggests the series are not stationary.23 In almost all, the ADF and Phillips‐Perron tests cannot exclude the possibility of a unit root.24 Given the likelihood that most or all series are not stationary and the uncertainty about whether they are exactly I(1), it makes sense to see whether they are fractionally integrated.25 I therefore estimated the order of fractional integration, d, for each series in each period, using Robinson's Local Whittle Gaussian ML semi‐parametric method (Robinson 1995; estimates in Table 1).26 I fractionally differenced each series by its d, estimated for the appropriate period, before including it in regressions.27"
"23","I then examined whether the presidents’ ratings were cointegrated with any of the economic series. If two variables are cointegrated, a long‐run equilibrium relationship exists between them (Box‐Steffensmeier and Tomlinson 2000, 70). The usual test for cointegration of two I(1) variables is to regress one on the other and test whether the residuals are I(0), in which case the variables are cointegrated. To test whether two fractionally integrated series are fractionally cointegrated, one regresses one on the other (both in levels) and estimates d for the residuals. If the residuals’ d is less than those for the “parent” series, the variables are fractionally cointegrated.28 The estimates in Table 1 suggest that Yeltsin's rating was fractionally cointegrated with perceptions of the current economy and/or family finances (the two are highly correlated). Putin's approval may be fractionally cointegrated with economic expectations and support for continuing the military operation in Chechnya; it may also be cointegrated with the political mood. However, this was highly correlated with the economic variables and preferred Chechen policy, and tests in the web appendix suggest it may have been Granger caused by economic expectations.         "
"24","One revealing way to analyze nonstationary time series is with an error correction model, which simultaneously estimates the long‐run relationship and the short‐run dynamics of adjustment. Error correction models have been used with fractionally integrated series to study various problems (Baum and Barkoulas 2006; Clarke and Lebo 2003). I use the three‐step fractional error correction model of, for instance, Clarke and Lebo (2003) and Lebo and Cassino (2007). That is, I run regressions of the form:            "
"25","The different economic perceptions measures are highly correlated (r = .89, for the current economy and family finances under Putin), which is not surprising since the same factors are bound to affect all three. Lacking good instruments, it is easier to assess the aggregate impact of economic perceptions than to be sure which type matters most. Because of the high correlations, I first present models with each economic perceptions measure separately and then report a preferred model with more than one, dropping those event dummies that were not significant at p = .30 (Table 2, column 5; Table 3, column 7). Under Putin, the choice of which economic variables to put in the final model was somewhat arbitrary given the high correlations. Including family finances together with perceptions of the national economy, the former had an odd negative coefficient, which I judged to be a spurious result of the correlation between these two variables rather than evidence that worsening finances boosted Putin's popularity. In my view, the data are just not fine‐grained enough to adjudicate between the three types of perceptions. I also include the political mood variable separately as it is so highly correlated with the economic variables and likely Granger caused by one of them (see the web appendix). I show separate models with the measures of Putin's policy performance (on international affairs, order) since these require shortening the data series. Finally, in Table 2, column 6, and Table 3, column 8, I show the preferred models with the FECM dropped; these are needed for subsequent simulations.         "
"26","Choosing how to model the influence of discrete events poses a dilemma when the duration of such effects is unclear. One can arbitrarily assume a path of decay. Or, lacking theoretically informed priors, one can try several specifications. The second course reduces the danger of missing the true effect because one has misspecified the duration, but increases the risk of false positives. In my experience, readers are more uncomfortable with the latter than with the former. In general, I model each event with a dummy valued 1 in the month of the earliest subsequent survey, and 0 at other times. The impact is thus assumed to decay at the same gradual rate that the fractional differencing implies."
"27","The one exception is the end of the first Chechen war, which arrived gradually. In March 1996, Yeltsin decreed a halt to military operations, but this changed little on the ground. In May 1996, he and acting Chechen President Yandarbiyev signed a cease‐fire agreement. But only in late August was the Khasavyurt Accord signed, actually ending the war. I model this with a dummy valued 1 in May and July, and 0 otherwise (June and August were not in the bimonthly data). I include simple dummies for the months in which the two Chechen wars started (since the dependent variables are differenced, dummies for the start and end make more sense than a dummy for the duration)."
"28","As is common in studies of U.S. presidential approval, I control for the time the president had been in office. Approval of American presidents typically falls, even controlling for other factors. Mueller (1973) argued that citizens start with unrealistically high expectations and gradually grow disappointed in their leaders. Under Putin, months in office and the index of press restrictions turn out to be highly correlated (r = .96); both rose monotonically over time. Therefore, I do not include them in the same regression; months in office turned out to be more significant in each case.         "
"29"," Table 1 suggested that, under both presidents, more than one variable might be cointegrated with the president's rating. Since it was not obvious a priori which of these—individually or in combination—belonged in the FECM, I tried several formulations. In Table 2, columns 1 and 5 contain an FECM formed using the residuals from regressing Yeltsin's rating on perceptions of the current economy. In column 2, the FECM used residuals from Yeltsin's rating regressed on perceived family finances. The former proved much more significant, and also more significant than an FECM for which the cointegrating regression contained both family finances and the current economy. In Table 3, the FECM uses residuals from regressing Putin's approval on economic expectations. This proved more significant than FECMs that incorporated preferences on Chechnya policy or the political mood.         "
"30","What do the results show? Consider first the effects of war and terrorist attacks. Yeltsin's Chechen misadventure appears to have cost him support, although perhaps less than might have been expected. His rating fell at the start of the first war by more than one quarter of a point on the 10‐point scale (Table 2, column 5). It rose as the war ended in 1996, by .31 of a point in both May and July; of course, the estimates should be viewed as only approximate. Yeltsin lost another quarter point after the 1995 Budyonnovsk terrorist siege. By contrast, the start of the second war had no clear effect.30"
"31","Putin's approval rose and fell with support for the use of military force in Chechnya. Since the latter peaked at 70% in March 2000, falling to just 13% in December 2007, this suggests the Chechen situation helped Putin early on, but weighed him down in later years. Indeed, supposing the coefficients on the fractionally differenced series roughly correspond to those for first differences, Putin lost about 20–30 points of approval over the course of his presidencies as faith in his military approach dwindled. Terrorist attacks temporarily revived backing for military force. After the Nordost siege in 2002, support for the military option leapt from 34% in September to 48% in November, before falling back to 31% in January 2003. This led to a rally behind Putin, whose approval temporarily jumped by six points. (Nordost had no effect beyond its militarization of the public mood; the dummy is insignificant in Table 3, where regressions control for support for the military operation.) Beslan led to a smaller jump in support for military force (from 24 to 31%); but Putin's approval actually fell that month. The Beslan dummy is significantly negative, controlling for preferences on Chechnya policy; in other words, support for Putin rose by less than one would have expected given the militarization of the public mood. One might speculate that in this case, Russians blamed both the terrorists and the authorities for the disastrous outcome.         "
"32","I lacked good data to assess the influence of presidential style conclusively. But it probably made some difference. After Yeltsin conducted the band in Berlin, his rating fell by about one quarter point. I found no evidence, however, that Yeltsin's hospitalizations hurt his popularity. Perhaps his ill health was already too well known for this to matter. Putin's approval may have fallen after the Kursk sank, but the estimates were statistically insignificant. Restoring the Soviet music to the national anthem produced a boost of eight or nine points. It could be that this was the moment Putin “closed the deal” with some former Communist supporters. Perhaps for the same reason, the arrest of the oligarch Khodorkovsky led to a bounce of about seven points."
"33","Neither respondents’ assessments of the political situation nor their evaluations of Putin's success in international affairs or at establishing “order” significantly affected presidential ratings, although in the latter cases the limited data might be to blame. After the United States invaded Iraq, Putin's approval fell several points: apparently the exercise of American power cast his previous solicitousness of the United States after 9/11 in a bad light. Putin's rating also fell after the 9/11 attack. NATO's bombing of Kosovo did not have a clear impact on Yeltsin's rating (it was not significant in the final model)."
"34","As with U.S. presidents, a time trend remains in Yeltsin's and Putin's ratings controlling for other variables. One should interpret the months’ term along with the intercept; the first was negative for both presidents, the second positive. This implies that, other things equal, approval tended to rise at first, but then fall. Such a pattern makes intuitive sense: at first citizens rallied behind a new leader, but over time more and more grew disillusioned for a variety of reasons not captured by the model. For Yeltsin, the effect turned negative after about 70 months (mid‐1997); for Putin, it remained positive through the end of his second term.31 The admittedly rough press freedom data do not suggest greater Kremlin control boosted Putin's rating. The NTV takeover had no clear effect. Nor did Freedom House's media index; always less significant than time in office, it was dropped from the regressions. Months in office might, under Putin, be picking up the trend toward less press freedom. But if so this would suggest that unfree media lowered Putin's approval: the coefficient on months was negative.         "
"35","These results include a mixture of surprises and confirmations of the conventional wisdom. Some of the hypothesized factors help account for the spikes in the ratings at various points. But most effects are small. By contrast, economic perceptions have considerable explanatory power.32"
"36","Under Yeltsin, perceptions of the national economy had the strongest impact. The significant FECM in columns 1 and 5 suggests a long‐run relationship between rosy views of current conditions and support for the president. The coefficient's value, –.23 in column 5, implies that when a shock knocks the two variables out of equilibrium, about one quarter of the gap is closed each period. The significant coefficient on fractionally differenced current economic perceptions suggests these also had a short‐term effect. As expected, the 1998 financial crisis depressed Yeltsin's popularity. This is not significant if one controls for perceptions of the current economy, suggesting the crisis affected Yeltsin's rating via this pathway. Under Putin, the evidence suggests a long‐run relationship between economic expectations and presidential approval, with about one‐third of any divergence eliminated each period (coefficient of –.32 in column 7). I also found evidence of short‐run effects, although the correlations among variables make it hard to say which matters more. Current economic assessments and expectations are both significant if entered alone (columns 1 and 3), but statistical significance falls if more than one is included at one time. Again, the strongest short‐run effects are of perceptions of the current economy. As expected, Putin's monetization of benefits cost him several percentage points even after taking into account the impact of the reform on perceptions of family finances."
"37","How much difference did the economy make? One can explore this by simulating the final model estimated for one president, substituting economic perceptions from the corresponding month in the other's term, while leaving all other variables at their actual levels. The two presidents’ simulated ratings supposing each had presided over the other's perceived economic conditions are shown in Figure 2.33 This exercise should be taken with a grain of salt. The simulations change somewhat depending on the specification, and it was not possible to include an FECM.34 Nevertheless, the results are suggestive. It seems Russians’ radically different evaluations of their first two presidents were strongly influenced by the very different economic conditions under which each served. Had Yeltsin presided over Putin's economy, he would apparently have left office extremely popular. Had Putin presided over Yeltsin's, his rating would have plunged early on, recovered a bit, but then sunk again. In January 2008, fewer than 50% of Russians would have approved of his performance.35"
"38","                 Simulating Yeltsin's Rating with Putin's Economy (top); Simulating Putin's Approval with Yeltsin's Economy (bottom)                      "
"39","The regressions also enable us to explore an intriguing counterfactual about Putin's rise, which is usually seen as inexorably tied to the violent events of late 1999. Suppose there had been no apartment bombings, no second Chechen war. Would Putin's rating have stayed around its starting point of 31%? Of course, we cannot know for sure, but the statistics offer some clues. To see what economic perceptions alone would predict, I used the estimated effects of just economic perceptions and months in office from Table 1, Model 6, and simply extrapolated forward using the actual economic perceptions data under Putin and restarting months in office. In Figure 3, the dotted line shows the simulated rating of a generic new president based on just the dramatic economic recovery, supposing Russians started evaluating the new leader in September 1999, right after Putin became prime minister. The dashed line supposes Russians started evaluating the new incumbent in January 2000, when Putin became acting president.36"
"40","                 Predicting Putin's Approval Rating with Economic Perceptions                      "
"41"," Sources: VCIOM/Levada Center and author's calculations.                     "
"42","The striking implication is that even without a Chechen war or terrorist attacks, economic factors alone would have prompted a leap in the new president's popularity quite similar to that which occurred. In late 1999, the economy began to revive. Between August 1999 and June 2000, real wages rose by about 20%, while wage arrears and unemployment fell. This fueled an unexpected rebirth of economic optimism that would have boosted support for any new Kremlin incumbent.37"
"43","The main difference is that the surge in approval predicted by economic factors comes a little later than the actual surge. In those months, time was of the essence. Putin would have to run for election in June 2000, or, after Yeltsin resigned early, in March. Were it not for the Chechen war, the Kremlin would have been best served by the original election schedule. If the public began evaluating Putin in September 1999, by July 2000 the simulation suggests his rating would have reached 4.5 on the 10‐point scale. Supposing instead that Putin remained tethered to Yeltsin's rating until January 2000, by July his would have been 3.7. In 1996, when Yeltsin won reelection with 54% of the valid vote, his rating had been 3.9. Thus, it is very possible that Putin—or some other new Kremlin candidate—would have won the presidency even without the Chechen conflict and terrorist bombings."
"44","However, economic factors do not explain why Putin's rating actually surged when it did. This might, indeed, be associated with the Chechen events. Although economic factors would have achieved the same result a few months later, the traumas of late 1999 apparently sped things up.38"
"45","If economic perceptions were important, what caused these perceptions? Did they reflect actual economic conditions, were they idiosyncratic, or were they manipulated by government propaganda? Russians’ rosy view of the economy under Putin might itself result from the Kremlin's media control. Or positive economic perceptions might reflect a general confidence in Putin's stewardship."
"46","To explore this, I ran fractional error correction models with the fractionally differenced economic perceptions measures as dependent variables (Table 4). Among explanatory factors, I included six objective measures of economic conditions—the average real wage, real wage arrears, the average real pension, logged inflation, unemployment, and the demand for workers (job openings reported to the state employment service). As might be expected, these were correlated (e.g., r = .87 for the real wage and pension), so besides showing models that include all six (odd‐numbered columns), I present simpler models from which the most insignificant variables have been dropped (even columns). Given the high correlations, conclusions about which economic variables were most important have to be tentative. All the economic indicators appeared to be fractionally integrated, so I fractionally differenced each by the appropriate d (average estimate for bandwidths 10, 20, and 30; N = 82–4) and included a fractional error correction mechanism. Based on exploratory analysis, the most appropriate FECM was based on cointegrating regressions, including the real wage (columns 5–6), the real wage and demand for workers (columns 1–2), and the real wage and unemployment (columns 3–4).         "
"47","Besides the official statistics, certain events informed the public about economic conditions. One might expect gloomier views after the August 1998 financial crisis. Earlier, Russians had been shocked when on “Black Tuesday” in October 1994 the ruble plunged almost 30%, prompting Yeltsin to fire his main economic ministers. The protests that followed the January 2005 reform of social benefits suggest many Russians thought this had worsened their financial situation. I also include a dummy for whether the economy was in its decline or recovery phase, on the theory that expectations tend to overshoot, being too pessimistic in downturns and too optimistic in recoveries. It is almost a cliché that in business cycles consumers swing between “irrational exuberance” in the boom and excessive pessimism in the recession; there is some evidence for this from the United States.39"
"48","What about political influences? First, causation might run in reverse from presidential approval to perceptions of economic performance. In the United States, overall presidential approval does not appear to affect consumer sentiment (MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson 1992), but approval of the president's economic management does (De Boef and Kellstedt 2004). So in estimating the impact of economic indicators on perceptions, one should at least control for presidential ratings; I include the incumbent's differenced rating on the 10‐point scale. (My estimate of d was almost exactly 1, so first differencing was appropriate.) Certain government actions are likely to affect economic perceptions. I included a dummy to see whether Russians viewed Khodorkovsky's arrest as good or bad for the economy (recall that Putin's approval jumped). Finally, I looked for effects of media manipulation. I included a dummy for Putin's presidency given the view that coverage became more favorable under him, and also included the Freedom House index of press freedom. Media effects are expected to be particularly strong during election campaigns. I included variables valued 1 for the six months before a presidential election and –1for the six months after it.40"
"49"," Table 4 suggests that Russians’ views of economic conditions were not just idiosyncratic. Each perceptions variable is systematically related to objective measures of economic performance. All three appear to be in long‐run equilibrium with the average real wage; perceptions of the current economy and family finances were apparently also in long‐run equilibrium with, respectively, demand for workers and unemployment. When real wages rise, economic expectations adjust upward to a new equilibrium, closing about a quarter of the gap each period (column 6). In the short run, more job vacancies (significant at p = .06) and perhaps lower wage arrears (p = .09) correlate with a rosier view of the current economy. Short‐run increases in pensions (p = .01) and drops in unemployment (p = .04) were associated with cheerier views of family finances; higher wages may also have helped (p = .08). Rising pensions (p = .01), falling wage arrears (p = .04), and possibly falling unemployment (p = .13) led to more positive expectations. Inflation was never significant; its effects might be captured here by real wages and pensions. Attitudes did also overshoot, accentuating the current trend; even controlling for political factors, views of the current economy and family finances were more negative in the downslide and positive during the recovery than would be predicted from just the objective indicators.         "
"50","As expected, major economic events also triggered reevaluations. The 1998 financial crisis fostered gloom about the current economy, although oddly it did not influence expectations. Both views of the current economy and economic expectations worsened after the October 1994 currency crisis. However, these events did not affect Russians’ assessments of their own finances, unless such effects were captured by the economic indicators. By contrast, the 2005 monetization of benefits prompted a sharp fall in how well‐off many Russians felt, as well as more pessimistic expectations."
"51","The extent to which objective economic indicators and events can, by themselves, account for the pattern of economic perceptions can be seen in Figures A2.A and A2.B in the web appendix. In these graphs, I plot both actual economic perceptions and those predicted using just the economic variables in the regressions in columns 2 and 4, leaving out political effects. The predictions do not catch all the spikes and dives in perceptions. But they do an excellent job of capturing the trends."
"52","Politics helps explain the remaining variation. As expected, presidential approval correlated with all three economic perceptions measures; controlling for it allows greater confidence in the estimated impact of the economic variables. The coefficients on presidential approval—2.78, 1.44, and 6.91, in columns 2, 4, and 6—suggest the extent of reverse causation. For the current economy and family finances, such effects seem minor. Of the 84‐point range of the current economy variable, presidential popularity could predict about 16 points, and it could predict about eight points of the 77‐point range in family finances.41 The possible effect of presidential approval on economic expectations is somewhat larger—the former could predict up to 39 points in the 81‐point range of the latter.         "
"53","The dummy for Putin's presidency was not significant in columns 1 or 5. It was significant at p = .051 but negative in Model 3 for family finances. Of course, it was highly correlated with the economic recovery variable, which distinguished months after February 1999. Interpreting the two together suggests that perceived family finances improved a lot in the early recovery months of 1999, but that the effect diminished after January 2000. Including the economic recovery and Putin dummies separately in the preferred family finances model (column 4), economic recovery is highly significant but the Putin dummy is not. In short, the evidence suggests that perceptions were better during the recovery phase, which largely corresponded to Putin's presidencies. But it is not clear that Putin's leadership (and media management) had an independent effect beyond that already captured by the presidential rating. Nor was there evidence that economic perceptions improved as press freedom decreased, at least as measured by the Freedom House index."
"54","Khodorkovsky's arrest led to a boost of some six or seven points in Putin's approval (Table 3). Apparently this was in spite of—rather than because of—the economic effect Russians anticipated: after the arrest, assessments of and expectations for the economy worsened. Russians may have favored the arrest on grounds of social justice despite fearing adverse economic effects; or perhaps it was different Russians who applauded Putin's action and who anticipated economic reverberations.         "
"55","Finally, presidential campaigns do seem at times to have influenced perceptions. In 1996 and 2004, Russians’ views of the economy and economic expectations improved during the six preelection months and fell during the six postelection months by more than expected based on the economic data. Interestingly, the campaigns brought no improvement in Russians’ perceptions of their own material situations—these may even have worsened in 1996—so this might indeed reflect the media's influence. There were no significant campaign effects in 2000, and November 2007 (the only month in the dataset from the 2008 campaign) actually saw a decline in economic expectations and perceived family finances. Whether the Medvedev campaign later kicked into gear must await future research.42"
"56","Thus, politics does help explain some of the peaks and dips in economic perceptions. Russians’ greater approval of Putin than of Yeltsin may have fed back, exacerbating economic pessimism in the late Yeltsin period and fueling optimism in the early Putin years. Biased media might help explain the surges and falls of economic optimism around the presidential campaigns of 1996 and 2004. On the other hand, I found no evidence of systematically greater distortions under Putin than under Yeltsin. Overall, the trends in economic perceptions were well predicted by just the economic indicators. Perceptions of the economy plummeted under Yeltsin and soared under Putin not because of effective propaganda but because the underlying economic variables were doing the same."
"57","In illiberal democracies and semi‐authoritarian states, politicians’ ratings wax and wane, sometimes very rapidly. Electorates swing between candidates and parties, at times embracing complete unknowns. It is easy to attribute such fluctuations to an unhealthy brew of rootless and cynical voters, demagogic politicians, and media manipulation. But in some cases the cause may be something else: electoral volatility may mirror economic volatility—and the efforts of rational voters, against the odds, to hold their leaders to account."
"58","In Russia, Yeltsin's plunging popularity and Putin's soaring ratings are often linked to their personalities and public images.43 Some see in Putin's ratings an endorsement of his Chechen military campaign and efforts to rebuild the Russian state (Sil and Chen 2004). Others suppose Russians backed Putin because they had been brainwashed by a state‐controlled media from which criticism of the Kremlin had been eliminated (Ryzhkov 2004).         "
"59","Wartime rallies, media effects, and image did play a part at times. Perhaps better data would show their role to be somewhat greater. However, Russians’ perceptions of economic conditions have been more consistently important. Much like citizens in Western democracies, Russians approved of their president when they saw the economy improving and felt hopeful about its future. Although Kremlin public relations influenced perceptions, especially in certain electoral campaigns, Russians’ views of the economy were closely related to objective economic indicators such as real wages, pensions, and wage arrears."
"60","From this perspective, the fates of Russia's first two presidents appear in a new light. Yeltsin's ignominious slide and Putin's eight years of adulation seem largely predetermined by the economic conditions each inherited. (Of course, each influenced the economy on his watch; still, Yeltsin inherited the Soviet system in midcollapse, whereas Putin benefited from a recovery fueled by soaring oil prices.) Simulations suggest a generic new president would have become extremely popular—judo or no judo—as a result of the boom."
"61","Starting in late 2008 (after the first draft of this article was written), Russia succumbed to the international financial crisis. Yet the ratings of Putin (now prime minister) and Medvedev, his successor, did not drop dramatically. Has the relationship between economics and presidential popularity in Russia changed? In fact, considered more closely, recent data offer a striking confirmation of the relationships noted here. Two circumstances are important. First, the Putin government, concerned about social stability, succeeded in sheltering the public from the full pain of the crisis. Despite an 8% drop in GDP per capita in 2009, real wages fell only 2.8%; real disposable incomes actually rose by 1.9% because of generous increases in pensions, which rose by 10.7% in real terms that year. Unemployment only increased from 5.7% in July 2008 to 8.2% in December 2009, less than the United States's 9.7%. Although alarming, the economic downturn was relatively mild in its effects. Second, the effect of deteriorating economic sentiment was largely offset by a surge in support for Putin and Medvedev during the war with Georgia in August 2008. Between July and September 2008, Putin's approval leapt from 80.4% to 88.0% and Medvedev's rose from 69.4% to 83.0%. This was a classic wartime rally behind the flag."
"62","If one subtracts out the 7.6‐point jump in Putin's approval in September 2008 attributable to the Georgian war, his rating follows almost exactly the course predicted by the model I previously estimated for the Putin presidency (column 8 in Table 3) when one enters the actual economic perceptions data for the Medvedev presidency (see Figure A3 in the web appendix). The percentage approving of Putin's performance falls in the simulation from 85 in March 2008 to 69 in November 2009; Putin's actual rating minus the Georgia jump fell from 85% to 71%. Medvedev's rating correlates with Putin's at r = .85 in this period; if we subtract out his even larger jump during the Georgian war, his approval closely parallels the predicted trajectory.44 Thus, the financial crisis of 2008–2009 does appear to have pulled down the leaders’ popularity, but by a fairly moderate amount since the government took active measures to shelter the population, and in a way that was largely offset by the wartime rally of support for the Kremlin over the conflict with Georgia.         "
"63","The findings of this article fit with a body of recent work that has been discovering familiar, rational behavior beneath the irregular surfaces of political life in developing and middle‐income countries (Drazen 2008). Outside the rich democracies, information is usually asymmetric, uncertainty is endemic, and economic conditions often fluctuate wildly. In such environments, quite rational behavior can look like impulsiveness and manipulation. While miscalculations and fraud are certainly common in the hybrid regimes of the developing and postcommunist worlds, so too, it turns out, is retrospective voting and economics‐based evaluations of incumbents. From Peru to Zambia, “governments are being held accountable for bad economic policies, at least to some degree” (Lewis‐Beck and Stegmaier 2008). The irony is that in such countries economic conditions are particularly vulnerable to global forces, which complicates the task for citizens—even sophisticated ones—of separating noise from signals about leaders’ competence.
