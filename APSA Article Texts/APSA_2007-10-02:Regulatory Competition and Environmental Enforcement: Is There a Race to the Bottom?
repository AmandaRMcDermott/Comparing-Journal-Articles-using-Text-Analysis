"1","There are a number of competing claims in the theoretical literature about the effect of interstate economic competition on environmental regulation. In this section, I review the race to the bottom argument as well as a couple of alternative theories."
"2","Race to the bottom theory is a fixture of the state environmental politics literature (e.g., Engel 1997; Levinson 2003; Potoski 2001; Woods 2006). The theory maintains that, confronted with interstate economic competition, states have incentives to adopt excessively lax environmental standards in an effort to attract mobile capital. These incentives, coupled with the fact that governments may act strategically, may lead states to reduce their standards to gain a competitive advantage over other states. If all states reason similarly, the result will be the continued lowering of standards across the country to the level of the least stringent state. The race to the bottom argument is an example of the “Prisoner's Dilemma”; the equilibrium outcome is suboptimal, since states would be better off collectively maintaining their standards rather than relaxing them.            "
"3","The race to the bottom argument, taken to its logical endpoint, suggests a literal bottoming out of environmental protection. In this strong form of the argument, all states face ongoing pressure to relax their environmental regulation, and regulatory competition leads them to reduce their environmental protection efforts to the level of the least stringent state. There is also a weaker form of the race to the bottom argument. While all states may not “race” toward the least stringent state, some states may nonetheless respond to interstate economic competition by reducing the regulatory costs they impose on industry."
"4","One could imagine a number of reasons why state officials might choose to ease environmental protection efforts when confronted with interstate economic competition. Two reasons seem particularly compelling. First, state‐elected officials may have electoral incentives to relax environmental regulation. Elected officials have much to gain politically from positive economic news. Most models of voting behavior suggest a central role of economic factors in explaining individuals' vote choices, and recent research has demonstrated the importance of economic voting at the state level (Atkeson and Partin 1995; Ebeid and Rodden 2006; Lowry, Alt, and Feree 1998; Niemi, Bremer, and Heel 1999). Economic voting may provide state‐elected officials with an electoral incentive to do what they can to create economic gains for their states, and there is suggestive evidence that elected officials believe that their electoral fortunes are, at least in some measure, linked to state‐level economic growth (Grady 1988, 1991; Hansen 1999; but Turner 2003). State‐elected officials—motivated by their desire to enhance their state's economy to increase their electoral prospects—may then take direct actions to weaken state environmental protection efforts or indirect actions in an attempt to influence the regulatory behavior of state environmental agencies.1 This is not to say that all state‐elected officials will trade‐off environmental protection for economic development. Many state‐elected officials may view environmental protection as an investment in the local quality of life and as a positive influence on, not an impediment to, economic growth (Meyer 1995). Moreover, there might be an electoral penalty to state politicians if, by easing environmental regulations, they alienate environmentally minded voters.2"
"5","A second influence potentially pushing states to weaken environmental regulation are business‐oriented interest groups. Business lobbies may attempt to persuade states to reduce the regulatory costs of doing business in their state. Since pollution control regulation targets particular industries, it is reasonable to assume that affected businesses use the threat of relocation to influence state behavior. Lowry (1992) suggests two forms of this argument. First, one might argue that businesses do relocate to areas where policies match their preferences (presumably, areas with less costly environmental regulation), thereby creating incentives for state policymakers to find ways to ease the regulatory costs they impose. There is increasing evidence that private sector economic investment does systematically respond to interjurisdictional differences in environmental regulatory stringency.3 The second, and milder form of the argument, suggests that, whether or not businesses do relocate, state policymakers make decisions as if they do. In a survey of administrators of state environmental agencies, Engel (1997) found that concerns about the effects of environmental standards on industry‐location decisions had influenced agency decisions, and that a substantial minority of states had at some point relaxed their environmental standards in response to such concerns. Moreover, whether businesses relocate or not, business lobbies likely push for regulatory policies that minimize compliance costs, using a message that business climate is an important concern in siting decisions (Davis and Davis 1999).            "
"6","There are at least three alternative ideas about regulatory competition that deserve consideration. First, skeptics of race to the bottom theory argue that regulatory competition will lead to precisely the opposite outcome. The most ardent proponent of this argument is Vogel (1995), who argues that regulatory competition is likely to generate stronger (not weaker) environmental standards. In the context of U.S. state environmental policy, Vogel points to the example of automobile emissions standards, in which both the federal government and many state governments have over the years adopted California's more stringent standards. Vogel refers to this phenomenon as the “California effect,” and, although he suggests it represents a broader phenomenon, it seems most applicable to environmental policies unrelated to “smokestack chasing”—that is, policies unlikely to be modified in efforts to attract mobile capital.4 A stronger logic for the race to the top argument is that some states may not be interested in creating a regulatory climate receptive to investment from pollution‐intensive industries. This type of behavior is consistent with “not in my backyard” environmentalism (NIMBYism), in which states strive to keep pollution‐intensive industries out of their state by imposing higher regulatory costs than other states. With these preferences, state officials will modify their own environmental regulatory effort to meet, if not exceed, that of the states that they believe have strong commitments to environmental protection.            "
"7","Second, the race to the bottom and the race to the top arguments suggest very different (and mutually exclusive) implications of regulatory competition. It may be the case, however, that neither argument fully accounts for the complexity of state environmental regulatory behavior, and that the weakness of each argument is that it generalizes away meaningful heterogeneity across the states. Put simply, states may differ in important respects (e.g., the size and structure of their economies) that may make them more susceptible to race to the bottom behavior or more likely to engage in race to the top behavior. In sum, states may engage in regulatory competition, but this competition may lead to different outcomes for different states."
"8","Last, both the race to the bottom and the race to the top arguments assume that there is regulatory competition—that is, that state environmental decision makers respond to the regulatory decisions of other states. What if this is not the case? What if, instead, regulatory decisions are based solely on intrastate factors? Many models of economic competition among political jurisdictions assume that regulators do not act strategically (e.g., Wilson 1996). In these models, regulators determine their preferred level of environmental standards by negotiating the tradeoffs between economic development and environmental protection. For example, in the Oates and Schwab model (1988)—still the standard in the field—regulators are assumed to be welfare maximizing and set environmental standards (and, thus, the level of economic investment that can be attracted to the jurisdiction) at the level which maximizes the utility of the median voter. As a result, each jurisdiction will provide a Pareto‐optimal level of environmental protection, an outcome that Oates and Schwab demonstrate leads to socially efficient results across jurisdictions. Under conditions of perfect competition, there simply is no regulatory competition.5 For the purposes of this study, the possibility that there is no environmental regulatory competition among states serves as the null hypothesis that there is neither a race to the bottom nor a race to the top.            "
"9","There is now a large empirical literature examining the theoretical potential that interstate economic competition leads to systematic relaxations of state environmental protection. Most studies have focused on the question of whether state differences in environmental regulatory stringency influence private sector investment decisions. Scholars have inferred that, absent such firm behavior, concerns that interstate economic competition leads to less stringent environmental regulation are spurious. As noted above, there is an emerging consensus that economic investment does, all else equal, move to jurisdictions with less stringent environmental regulatory requirements. Nevertheless, regulatory competition theories pertain more directly to government behavior, not firm behavior. In essence, these studies have put the proverbial “cart before the horse” by jumping to study the effects of a theoretical race to the bottom, before studying whether states actually behave as the theory predicts."
"10","Other studies have also aimed to empirically test the race to the bottom argument. Potoski, for example, conducted a survey of state air pollution control programs and found that states had adopted more stringent air emission standards and conducted more monitoring than required by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). He concludes from this evidence that “economic pressures have not overwhelmed the states' ability to set their own environmental standards. There is no evidence of a race to the bottom” (2001, 339). Yet, the mere fact that some states have gone beyond EPA standards does not mean that pressure from interstate economic competition has prevented others from doing the same. In fact, Potoski's survey indicates that sizeable majorities of the states had not done more than required under the CAA, and many states have put in place explicit restrictions that prohibit them from enacting standards that exceed federal standards.6"
"11","Collectively, I would argue that the preponderance of the empirical literature directed at testing the race to the bottom theory as it applies to state environmental regulation fails to test its central predictions. As Woods states, the literature needs “direct empirical assessment of whether the actions of state policymakers respond to the perceived threat emanating from neighboring states when formulating and implementing policy” (2006, 177). I address this need here. In particular, regulatory competition, and the race to the bottom argument, imply the following two testable hypotheses:"
"12","                              "
"13","State environmental regulatory behavior responds to the environmental regulatory behavior of competitor states—that is, there is strategic interaction in state regulatory practices; and"
"14","The pattern of strategic interaction in state environmental regulation will be one in which states respond to competitor states' regulatory behavior, only when this behavior puts them at a disadvantage for attracting economic investment."
"15","A couple of empirical studies have directly tested for strategic interaction in U.S. state environmental regulation.7Fredriksson and Millimet (2002) find a positive relationship between the environmental abatement costs—their proxy measure of environmental regulatory stringency—incurred by manufacturing industries in competitor states.8 In particular, they find that these interactions occur within a two‐year window for contiguous neighbors and within a five‐year window for more distant states. They also find an asymmetric pattern of responsiveness—states react to changes in abatement costs in competitor states that have initially more stringent environmental policy, but not to states with initially less stringent environmental policy. This result contradicts the race to the bottom argument.            "
"16"," Levinson (2003) extends Fredriksson and Millimet's analysis by examining whether regulatory competition became more severe during the Reagan administration, testing the hypothesis that competition should be more intense during periods of greater state control of environmental policy.9 Levinson replicates their basic finding regarding states' responsiveness to changes in the abatement costs of neighboring states, but he does not find convincing evidence that competition steepened after Reagan took office. Levinson reaches a similar conclusion in tests for regulatory competition in hazardous waste disposal taxes.            "
"17","Collectively, these studies provide some evidence supportive of the notion that states engage in environmental regulatory competition, although they raise doubt about the empirical validity of the race to the bottom argument. However, the measures of environmental regulation used in these studies are not ideal for testing regulatory competition theory. Regulatory competition models predict that state regulatory behavior responds to the behavior of other states with which it competes for economic investment. To appropriately test these theories, therefore, we need good measures of actual state regulatory behavior."
"18","With the exception of Levinson's analysis of hazardous waste disposal taxes, the studies summarized above measure environmental regulation using total state pollution abatement costs data. In particular, scholars have studied two measures: state‐level pollution abatement and control expenditures (PACE) per unit of manufacturing and an index of state environmental regulatory stringency developed by Levinson (2001)—each of which is derived from firm‐level survey data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau.10 These costs data do not reflect actual levers state regulators can use to modify their environmental effort. State‐level aggregation of pollution abatement and control expenditures is the result of an unknown mix of the stringency of regulatory standards and implementation and enforcement practices.11 To address this shortcoming, I consider actual state regulatory actions, and, specifically, state enforcement of federal pollution control programs.            "
"19","Most of the major U.S. pollution control programs have been designed under a model of regulatory federalism, in which responsibility for providing environmental protection is to be shared by multiple levels of government. While the federal government (i.e., the EPA) is generally responsible for setting national standards, the details of implementation and enforcement are left largely to state environmental agencies. The key principle defining this regulatory federalism structure is partial preemption. Under partial preemption, federal officials establish national regulatory standards and the procedures by which these standards are to be enforced. States are then invited or required to develop regulatory programs that are consistent—that is, at least as stringent—with federal standards as a condition for being authorized to enforce these standards within their borders. If a state fails to obtain or chooses not to seek authorization, the EPA carries out the programs itself through one of its 10 regional offices. Although the EPA has attempted to instill some uniformity, there is significant variation in enforcement performance across the states (and within states over time), due in large measure to the discretion states are afforded to determine with how much vigor to enforce federal environmental statutes (Sigman 2003).12"
"20","I compiled data on state enforcement of three federal pollution control programs: the CAA, the CWA, and the RCRA.13 State enforcement of these programs provides a useful setting for studying whether state governments engage in environmental regulatory competition. First, enforcement of these federal statutes is carried out through the partial preemption and state authorization system discussed above. Due to the discretion afforded states, they can use their enforcement effort (or lack thereof) to shape their state's regulatory climate. Second, studying variation in state enforcement of federal programs provides a built‐in control—that is, there is a common framework from which to examine state agency behavior. Third, state‐level enforcement is substantively important. Although the EPA does independently carry out enforcement actions, these largely come in support of state efforts. In 2003, for example, state environmental agencies conducted 96% of the inspections and 88% of the punitive actions in enforcement of the CWA. Last, unlike the pollution abatement costs data used in prior studies, state enforcement actions reflect regulatory behavior that states directly control, and, therefore, is a competitive instrument that states can plausibly use to create a regulatory climate attractive to potential economic investment.         "
"21","I construct two measures of annual state enforcement effort for each of the three programs: (1) the annual number of sampling inspections; and (2) the unweighted sum of informal and formal punitive actions (informal actions include notifications of violation, while formal actions include measures to move violators back into compliance, such as administrative orders, consent decrees, and civil penalties). I standardize each measure by the number (or an estimate of the number) of regulated facilities under the CAA, the CWA, the and the RCRA.14"
"22","I consider these data over the 1985–2000 time period and the unit of analysis is a state‐year.15 In the case of the CWA and the RCRA, I only include state‐year observations for years in which the EPA had authorized the state to administer the programs,16 which means a sample of 593 for state enforcement of the CWA and 657 for state enforcement of the RCRA.17 Descriptive statistics for each of the measures are presented in Table 1. On average, states inspected about 15%, 4%, and 94% of facilities under the CAA, CWA, and RCRA, respectively. This variation in compliance monitoring—particularly between RCRA and the other programs—is largely explained by the much smaller population of facilities coming within jurisdiction of the hazardous waste program. The pattern for the unweighted sum of punitive actions is similar, with there being a higher rate of enforcement actions taken against facilities under RCRA than the CAA and CWA.         "
"23"," Figure 1 presents population‐weighted state averages for each measure over 1985–2000. These data provide a general perspective of how state‐level enforcement of these federal laws has varied over time. There has been a somewhat consistent level of enforcement across the three programs, with a little more variability in enforcement of the CWA (note difference in scales). During this period, there has not been a noticeable overall downward trend in state enforcement effort as might be expected if the strong version of the race to the bottom argument operates. However, these national averages hide state and regional variation, so it is not possible to rule out a weaker form of the race to the bottom argument. Moreover, the temporal variation does not enable an assessment of the degree of state responsiveness to economic competitor states, which is the focus of this article.         "
"24","                 State Enforcement of Federal Pollution Control Programs, 1985–2000 (population‐weighted state averages)                      "
"25","To test for the presence of competition among states in environmental regulatory behavior, I estimate a series of strategic interaction models. This statistical approach models a state's behavior as a function of other states' behaviors.18 The specification is as follows:               "
"26","The variable of primary interest in this model is the strategic interaction or spatial lag term, . This term represents a weighted average of competitors' environmental enforcement effort (created using the same enforcement data used for the dependent variables). I discuss the definition and weights of competitors further below.            "
"27","Detecting the presence of strategic interaction of government behavior among states requires testing for the significance of δ, where a nonzero coefficient suggests that one state's environmental regulatory effort is a function of other states' environmental regulatory efforts. The expectation is that δ will be positive. While a statistically significant, negative coefficient would imply that there is strategic interaction among states, the interdependence would not reflect the type suggested by regulatory competition theories. The null hypothesis is that there is no effect, which would lend support to a lack of regulatory competition, thereby undermining both the race to the bottom and the race to the top arguments."
"28","A state's response to interstate economic competition, of course, is not the sole determinant of state regulatory effort. Rather, each state has its own set of preferences and attitudes toward regulatory matters, and, absent the influence of interstate economic competition, these form the basis for choices about environmental regulatory enforcement. These intrastate factors could, moreover, mitigate downward pressure on regulatory enforcement.19 Studies exploring the empirical determinants of state environmental policy and regulatory enforcement effort have generated few consistent results. Nevertheless, I include several intrastate factors in the Xit vector of state characteristics in Equation (1) to control for other potential determinants of state enforcement effort.            "
"29","First, one must take into account the party affiliation of state‐elected officials. Democrats typically are assumed to favor stronger environmental regulation than are Republicans. This difference is pronounced at the federal level, where representatives of the two major parties have distinct voting patterns on environmental issues (Kamieniecki 1995; Shipan and Lowry 2001). The evidence is more ambiguous at the state level, but some studies have found that partisan control of governors' offices and state legislatures influence decisions about state environmental regulatory behavior (Helland 1998a; Wood 1991). I use two variables to control for partisan differences.20 First, I include a variable that measures the party affiliation of the governor (a dummy variable coded 1 if the governor is a Democrat and 0 if the governor is a Republican). Second, I consider the party composition of the state legislature, specifically, the percentage of representatives in both chambers who are Democrats.21 Since partisanship is not a perfect measure of ideological differences across states (Berry et al. 1998; Erikson, Wright, and McIver 1993), I also include Erikson, Wright, and McIver's (1993) measure of state ideology.            "
"30","I also control for state economic and fiscal conditions. One might expect states to curtail their environmental enforcement effort during difficult economic times. Helland (1998b), for example, found that the health of the local economy was an important predictor of the stringency of CWA inspections. States may be more willing to trade off the benefits of environmental regulation for the benefits of economic development during recessions, particularly if they perceive regulatory hurdles as contributing to poor economic performance. Conversely, during periods of economic prosperity, we might expect state officials to be more willing to impose regulatory burdens. To control for economic conditions, I include the state's unemployment rate in the model.22"
"31","State fiscal conditions too might influence the degree of environmental enforcement effort. Balanced budget and other rules may lead to cuts in expenditures in years in which tax revenues are less plentiful. To control for such budgetary pressure, I include a “fiscal health” variable, which I measure by subtracting total state expenditures from total state revenues, divided by total state expenditures to normalize for the different sizes of state budgets.23"
"32","Another intrastate factor that could influence the pattern of state enforcement is the power of interest groups (Ringquist 1993; but Potoski and Woods 2002). An interest group story would maintain that states with influential industrial interests are likely to resist burdensome regulation and lobby against stringent enforcement practices. I use a proxy measure of interest group strength—the manufacturing share of gross state product in the cases of air pollution and hazardous waste regulation, and the manufacturing and mining shares of gross state product in the case of water pollution regulation.            "
"33","I also control for the scope of the bureaucratic task environment. A simple explanation for the level of enforcement effort put forth by a state is the degree to which regulatory enforcement is necessary. One way to characterize the task environment is the size of the regulated community (i.e., the number of facilities coming under the jurisdiction of a program). I use the number of manufacturing establishments in each state as an estimate of the number of regulated facilities when considering the CAA, the number of active facilities when considering the CWA, and the number of waste handlers when considering the RCRA."
"34","Last, to control for basic state‐level differences in demographics and socioeconomic characteristics, I include several additional control variables—per capita income, population, population density, and urbanization.24 I also use state fixed effects to control for any time‐invariant, state‐specific factors that might also relate to regulatory enforcement effort, as well as year fixed effects to control for any year‐specific phenomena.            "
"35","There are several issues that must be addressed to estimate Equation (1). First, the strategic interaction term, , must be defined. There are two components to this variable. First, an a priori assumption must be made about how to define a state's competitors. There is no accepted convention for defining competitor states, and I use multiple definitions here. Perhaps the simplest definition is geographical contiguity, where it is assumed that states compete with the states with which they share a border. This seems plausible, for example, if firms identify a general region of the country in which they want to locate a facility and then consider additional factors that differentiate states within a region. I also use two regional economic classifications—one developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and one developed by Crone (1998/1999)—as alternative definitions of competitors. These classifications group states in terms of their economic similarity. The assumption here is that states compete primarily to attract more of the same type of industries. The regions defined by the BEA and Crone overlap, but there are some significant differences as well. Table A.1 in the appendix presents each of these classifications.25"
"36","The second component of the strategic interaction term is a weight, which determines the relative importance of each designated competitor. Scholars studying strategic interaction have used various weighting schemes. For example, Fredriksson, List, and Millimet (2004) and Fredriksson and Millimet (2002) each use three different schemes: equal weights, population weights, and income weights. In the models that I estimate here, I use population weights.26"
"37","Another econometric issue that must be addressed to estimate Equation (1) is the obvious endogeneity of the Ejt s. By design, modeling strategic interaction within the same year means that values of E in different states are jointly determined such that the linear combination of the Ejt s is endogenous and correlated with the error term, εit. Stated more simply, if the regulatory effort in state i is a function of the regulatory effort in state j, then the regulatory effort in state j must also be a function of the regulatory effort in state i. Because of this simultaneity problem, OLS estimates will be biased.            "
"38","There are a couple of econometric approaches to addressing this simultaneity problem. First, one could use a maximum likelihood estimation of the reduced form of Equation (1) (e.g., Besley and Case 1995; Brueckner and Saavedra 2001; Case, Rosen, and Hines 1993; Saavedra 2000). Spatial maximum likelihood estimation, however, can be computationally demanding due to the large matrices necessary to estimate the strategic interaction term. A second approach is a two‐stage least squared instrumental variables approach (2SLS‐IV), which is both easier to implement and generates unbiased and relatively efficient coefficients (Franzese and Hays 2004). The 2SLS‐IV approach has been used in numerous studies of strategic government interaction (e.g., Figlio, Kolpin, and Reid 1999; Fredriksson and Millimet 2002; Hernández‐Murillo 2003; Levinson 2003). The standard application of the 2SLS‐IV approach is to instrument for Ejt using a subset of the weighted characteristics of competitor states (Anselin 1988). More specifically, Equation (2) is estimated:               "
"39","I use an instrument set that includes per capita income, population, population density, and urbanization (all population‐weighted)—that is, a subset of the variables included in the Xit vector of state attributes in Equation (1).27 These are appropriate instruments if they affect a state's environmental enforcement effort, but not the effort put forth in competitor states, conditional on the competitor states' efforts. I perform several diagnostic tests to check for the relevance and validity of these instruments.            "
"40","A third problem that arises in estimating Equation (1) occurs when εit includes omitted variables that are themselves spatially dependent. In this case, states may share some unobserved, regional characteristics that are correlated with regulatory effort. Spatial dependence in the errors would bias δ in favor of a spurious relationship, leading one to potentially mistake regional correlations for strategic behavior. For example, there might be a regionally specific economic phenomenon that impacts a set of regional economic competitors. An additional advantage of the 2SLS‐IV approach is that this method generates consistent estimates even in the presence of spatial error dependence (Kelejian and Prucha 1998).            "
"41","Estimating the model represented by Equation (1) will establish whether there is strategic interaction among states. However, the race to the bottom argument suggests a specific asymmetric pattern of state responsiveness. In particular, we should observe a state responding to its competitors only in situations when its own regulatory policy might put it at a disadvantage for attracting economic investment relative to these competitors.            "
"42","I estimate two additional models to test for this hypothesized asymmetry in state responsiveness. The first model considers whether strategic interaction occurs when competitor states' regulatory enforcement this year is less than it was in the prior year:                "
"43","Following Fredriksson and Millimet (2002), I also consider an alternative specification:               "
"44","In this section, I report the results from estimating the models described above. To ease interpretation, I estimate the models after a natural log transformation of both the dependent variable and the strategic interaction term. Thus, the coefficient on the parameter of interest δ is an elasticity.29"
"45","The results when estimating the base model of strategic interaction for state enforcement of the CAA, the CWA, and the RCRA are presented in Tables 2 through 4, respectively. Beginning with the regression results for state actions taken to enforce the CAA, the first thing to note is that there is a strong, positive relationship between a state's enforcement behavior and its competitors' enforcement behavior. As presented in Table 2, the elasticities are positive and statistically significant when using either the BEA or Crone regions to define competitors, although not contiguous states. The coefficients range in magnitude from about .5 to 1.6, which suggests that a 10% increase (decrease) in competitors' enforcement efforts leads to about a 5% to 16% increase (decrease) in one's own enforcement efforts.         "
"46","The coefficients on the state political and economic control variables generally do not support their theorized effects, with several not reaching conventional levels of statistical significance in any of the regressions.30 There is some evidence that the party affiliation of legislators (but not governors) matters—with states with more Democrats in the legislature performing more enforcement. These results, however, are not robust across all of the estimations. State ideology also does not provide much in the way of explanatory power. With respect to the effect of state economic conditions, the coefficient on state unemployment rate reached conventional levels of statistical significance in two of the regressions with the general enforcement actions dependent variable, but the relationship with enforcement is not in the hypothesized direction. Counterbalancing this effect is the proportion of the state economy that is based in manufacturing (my proxy measure of interest group strength)—the more manufacturing in the state, the fewer environmental enforcement actions taken by the state government. It is unclear why these variables would move in opposite directions, and it is worth noting that the coefficient on state unemployment rate is anomalous to the models with this particular dependent variable. Finally, budgetary pressure and the size of the regulated community were not good predictors of state enforcement effort of the CAA.         "
"47","Turning to state enforcement of the CWA, again of primary interest are the coefficients on the strategic interaction terms, which are presented in the first row of Table 3. Across both measures of environmental enforcement, I find strong evidence of strategic interaction (across all three definitions of competitors), with the elasticities ranging from .6 to 1.3.         "
"48","Regarding the control variables, the coefficients on the Democratic governor and Democratic legislature variables are statistically significant in many of the regressions, but suggest that more Democratic representation means less environmental enforcement (with one exception). State ideology again had no discernible effect on state enforcement conducted under the CWA. The coefficients on state unemployment and state fiscal health are statistically different from zero in only one of the regressions. My proxy measures of interest group strength suggest some contradictory relationships. The positive coefficient on manufacturing strength in the range of about 8.5 to 11.1 implies that a state with one standard deviation more of the state economy in the manufacturing sector conducts about 55% to 70% more enforcement actions. The proportion of the state economy comprised of mining, however, suggests an opposite relationship. A one standard deviation difference in mining gross state product suggests about a 40% difference in the number of CWA enforcement actions taken by states. But again, these relationships lack consistency across the models."
"49","Last, Table 4 presents the results for state enforcement of the RCRA. I find strong evidence of strategic interaction when using the economic regions to define competitors, but not when using contiguous states. The elasticities range from about .8 to 1.4. The relationship between partisanship and state enforcement effort here is the same as it was in the case with enforcement of the CWA. The more Democrats in the state legislature, all else equal, the fewer the enforcement actions the state performed. The coefficients for state ideology do not reach statistical significance, as is generally the case for the variables measuring state economic and fiscal conditions and interest group strength.         "
"50","To evaluate the instruments, I performed several diagnostic tests which, while imperfect, provide some indication of their suitability. I report the results of these tests for each model at the bottom of Tables 2–4. First, I consider the significance of the excluded instruments in the first stage regressions, as well as the R2 of the first stage regressions with the included instruments partialled out as recommended by Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995). In most of the estimations, at least three of the excluded instruments reach statistical significance at the p < .05 level.31 With respect to the values of the partial R2s, they range from about .06 to .33 in the models in which the coefficients for the strategic interaction terms were statistically significant. These diagnostic tests suggest that the instruments are relatively weak in many of the estimations, but they do pass the threshold suggested by Staiger and Stock (1997) in 15 of the 18 regressions.32 I also perform Hansen's overidentification test (described by Wooldridge 2001) to test the validity of the instruments and an augmented regression test to check for the endogeneity of the regressors (Davidson and MacKinnon 1993). The models do not perform very well on Hansen's overidentification test; I was only able to reject the null hypothesis in half of the estimations. The models do pass the augmented regression test for endogeneity at the p < .05 in all but five of the regressions, and in all but one in which the coefficient on the strategic interaction term reached statistical significance.         "
"51","There are a couple of things to note regarding these results. The first concerns the poor performance of the control variables. Few of the variables help to explain state regulatory enforcement effort. One possible explanation is that many of the variables do not vary much from year to year within a state, which makes it difficult to tease out their independent effects. In addition, the state fixed effects may introduce collinearity with some of these variables. When I estimate the models without state fixed effects (not reported), the results are less robust when it comes to the strategic interaction term. I do find some evidence of strategic interaction using both enforcement dependent variables across each of the regulatory programs. The magnitude of the strategic interaction is, on average, about a quarter to a half of that of the models that included the state fixed effects. Without state fixed effects, the coefficients on many of the control variables perform better, often reaching statistical significance and more often supporting their theorized effects.33"
"52","A second thing to note is that the strategic interaction models estimated above make a strong assumption that states' choices about regulatory enforcement are near simultaneous. This suggests that interstate influences of economic competition are both identified and acted on rapidly (i.e., within the same year), which requires a fluid flow of information across states.34 This type of quick policy responsiveness seems plausible in the area of regulatory enforcement (compared to regulatory standard setting, which necessitates administrative or legislative action), but it does require that state regulators continually assess the regulatory behavior of economic competitor states. There is some survey research suggesting that state regulators have knowledge about other states' regulatory practices (Engel 1997; Konisky 2006), and that they do evaluate how their own regulatory enforcement behavior compares.35 Moreover, other studies of strategic interaction in state environmental regulation have detected similar degrees of responsiveness (Fredriksson and Millimet 2002; Levinson 2003).         "
"53","Despite this evidence supporting the ability of states to make continuous assessments of the regulatory practices of their economic competitors, one might posit that either information spillovers across states are less fluid or that state policymakers are not able to immediately act on competition from other states. To address this possibility, I also estimated one‐year and two‐year time lags, where I modeled a state's regulatory behavior as a function of its competitor states' regulatory enforcement one or two years ago.36 The results from these models (not reported), however, do not support a time‐lagged explanation. The coefficient on the strategic interaction terms, across the three pollution control programs and across the different definitions of competitors, rarely reached levels of statistical significance.         "
"54","The findings summarized thus far provide relatively consistent support for the notion that states are engaged in strategic interaction in their environmental decision making—that is, regulatory enforcement practices in one state are positively related to the regulatory enforcement practices of the states with which they compete for economic investment. Collectively, the coefficients on the strategic interaction term found in the results reported above provide some support for the regulatory competition hypothesis. However, race to the bottom theory suggests that the pattern of strategic interaction should take a particular form. Specifically, we should observe states engaging in strategic interaction relative to their economic competitors only when their own regulatory effort is putting them at a disadvantage for attracting economic investment."
"55","To test the race to the bottom theory more directly, I first consider the asymmetric effects model represented by Equation (3). Recall that the race to the bottom theory predicts that a state should respond to a drop in competitors' enforcement activities, but not an increase. Therefore, the expectation is that δ0 > 0 and δ1= 0.            "
"56","I estimated this model using each of my measures of state enforcement for the CAA, the CWA, and the RCRA. For succinctness, I only report the coefficients in Table 5 for the parameters of primary interest. Looking across the point estimates for δ0, the coefficients indicate some support for the contention that states respond to competitors' regulatory behavior when the competitor states decreased the vigor of their enforcement efforts from the previous year. The coefficient for δ0 is positive and statistically significant in about a third of the models and ranges from approximately .5 to over 2.0, which implies that a 10% increase (decrease) in competitors' enforcement efforts leads to about a 5% to 20% increase (decrease) in one's own enforcement efforts.            "
"57","However, in all of the regressions that showed some support for the race to the bottom argument, there also appears to be a strong strategic interaction effect in cases where the weighted average of competitors' enforcement increased relative to the previous year—that is, δ1 > 0. Moreover, the elasticities are of about the same magnitude.37 And, in two cases, the only evidence of strategic interaction suggests that regulatory competition is producing more stringent levels of environmental enforcement, which would be consistent with a race to the top in state environmental regulation, not a race to the bottom.            "
"58","The results are much the same when estimating the alternative specification aimed at detecting an asymmetric pattern of state responsiveness. In this model, the δ0 parameter represents the degree of strategic interaction when a state's own enforcement effort is greater than that of its competitors, which is another situation in which race to the bottom theory predicts that states will respond to the regulatory behavior of competitor states. The coefficients from these regressions are presented in Table 6. Again, across each of the federal pollution control programs and for different definitions of competitor states, there is good evidence of strong strategic interaction in cases where a state may be at a competitive disadvantage. I find elasticities ranging from about .6 to 2.0, which suggests a similar degree of responsiveness as I found in the other asymmetric effects model. However, I again find the same type of evidence of strategic interaction in cases where a state's own enforcement effort was lower than of the weighted average of its competitors. The coefficients on δ1 are often positive, statistically significant, and of about the same size as those on δ0.38"
"59","In sum, the evidence from these models does not support the asymmetric pattern of strategic interaction predicted by the race to the bottom argument. While there is support for the idea that states respond to the regulatory behavior of competitor states when their own regulatory practices may place them at a competitive disadvantage, there is also a strong indication that a countervailing effect is operative. This suggests that, at least for some states, regulatory behavior in competitor states pulls their own regulatory effort up, not down. The results from these asymmetric models suggest that, while interstate factors do influence state environmental regulatory behavior, the effect is not uniform across states, and that regulatory competition produces multiple patterns of state behavior."
"60","This article contributes to a growing literature that seeks to directly test the central predictions of regulator competition in general, and the race to the bottom argument in particular. An innovation of this study is that I analyze actual regulatory behavior, rather than proxy measures of state regulatory stringency. I find strong evidence of strategic interaction in state environmental regulatory behavior. Across multiple measures of regulatory enforcement and across three of the main federal pollution control programs, states respond quickly (within the same year) to the regulatory behavior of the states with which they compete for economic investment (defined in several different ways). These results are consistent with the notion that states engaged in regulatory competition in environmental regulation during the period from 1985 to 2000."
"61","Although the evidence of strategic regulatory behavior is robust, the asymmetric effects models do not provide strong support for the race to the bottom argument. I do find evidence that states respond to the regulatory enforcement effort of competitor states in cases where their own enforcement effort may plausibly put them at a disadvantage for attracting economic investment. However, I find just as strong a pattern of state responsiveness when a state's enforcement efforts (or lack thereof) already put it in a “better” position than states with which it competes for economic investment."
"62","One might speculate that this pattern of states increasing their regulatory effort in response to increases by their competitors still reflects economic competition, but economic competition that takes another form. States competing for mobile capital in nonpolluting industries, such as those in the service sector, may want to provide amenities such as environmental protection. States advertise their public education and infrastructure to attract new firms, so perhaps they also highlight their “clean” environments. This pattern of behavior would support a race to the top type of argument. Alternatively, the collective ratcheting upward of regulatory enforcement effort among economic competitor states may suggest policy coordination. There are several examples of states working together to address common environmental challenges, and it may be the case that they do so through their enforcement effort as well."
"63","It may also be the case that the asymmetric response pattern that follows from the race to the bottom argument is too simplistic, as it assumes that all states respond uniformly to interstate economic competition. States may vary in important ways that affect their responsiveness to the regulatory behavior of other states. For example, large states (in economic terms) may not respond to small states, while small states may respond to both other small states and large states. Stated simply, the size of a state's economy may determine a state's susceptibility to interstate influences. Similarly, states that rely heavily on pollution‐intensive industries—that is, industries most affected by how pollution control regulation is enforced—may pay more attention to the regulatory practices of other states, compared to those whose economies are mostly agriculture or service based."
"64","Evidence supportive of these types of asymmetries would indicate that, while a race to the bottom does not accurately describe all states' behavior, race to the bottom type dynamics may nonetheless describe how some states respond to interstate economic competition. In other words, some states may use their regulatory behavior as a competitive instrument, while others do not. The clear next stage in this research, then, is to begin to theoretically develop and empirically test state‐level factors that characterize states responding to the downward pressure on environmental regulation resulting from interstate economic competition."
