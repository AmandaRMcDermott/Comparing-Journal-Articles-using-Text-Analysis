"1","A rich literature in political science examines levels of general political sophistication and knowledge in the mass public and the resulting consequences of variation in sophistication across individuals (e.g., Althaus 1998; Bartels 1996; Converse 1964; Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Goren 2004; Luskin 1990; Zaller 1992). The overriding theme of this research is that the mass public is largely uninformed about politics. Lack of information, in turn, threatens citizens’ ability to link their values and interests with their political choices (Althaus 1998; Bartels 1996; Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; but see Goren 2004). In summarizing the literature in this domain, Bartels argues, “One of the most striking contributions to political science of a half century of survey research has been to document how poorly ordinary citizens approximate a classical ideal of informed democratic citizenship” (1996, 195).         "
"2","Although a broad consensus exists within political science that the general public is politically ignorant, there is no unanimous answer to the question of whether or not a lack of political knowledge leads citizens to make worse political decisions. Instead, many scholars assert that it is possible for ill‐informed individuals to rely on cue taking or heuristics to make decisions roughly equivalent to more informed citizens (Boudreau 2009; Downs 1957; Lupia and McCubbins 1998; Popkin 1991; Sniderman 2000; Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991).         "
"3","The question of whether a lack of political information leads to suboptimal political choices undoubtedly deserves the attention it receives in the political science literature. However, a similarly critical topic—the existence of what Kuklinski et al. (2000) call misinformation—is less well understood. Traditional work on political knowledge focuses on the informed and the uninformed, but work by Kuklinski et al. and others (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler 2010) demonstrates the existence of a crucial third group of citizens: the misinformed. An uninformed public is problematic because its members are unaware of particular aspects of politics. The problem of misinformation, on the other hand, can prove even more insidious. Not only do the misinformed lack knowledge, but they actually believe that they know something when they do not. Because beliefs inform political preferences, misinformation likely causes individuals’ preferences to systematically deviate from what they would otherwise be. Coupled with the fact that misinformation, and therefore the preferences derived from misinformation, is enduring (Nyhan and Reifler 2010), this suggests serious problems for citizen competence.         "
"4","In examining the value of heuristics, then, it is imperative not only to study their potential to make the uninformed act as if they are informed but also to generate misinformation. If citizens rely on heuristics for obtaining knowledge, it is possible that this could systematically increase misinformation and thus threaten the usefulness of heuristics as replacements for substantive knowledge. Some research suggests that heuristics can in fact lead to misinformation or political choices that appear suboptimal based on citizens’ expressed political beliefs (Kuklinski and Hurley 1994; Lau and Redlawsk 2001; Nadeau and Niemi 1995; Rahn 1993). In fact, these scholars come to the same conclusions as numerous psychologists who first introduced the concept of heuristics (e.g., Kahneman 2003; Tversky and Kahneman 1974). Because heuristics are a substitute for actual knowledge, heuristic users are susceptible to a variety of biases that come with using a fast and efficient approach to decision making, such as using the wrong information to make an inference (Fiske and Taylor 2008, 178). As Kuklinski et al. warn, “Using rules of thumb to draw inference or decide preferences on the basis of limited information does not produce rational opinion if the information is wrong. Under conditions of extreme misinformation, in fact, it can lead to worse outcomes than if citizens made random, totally uninformed judgments” (2000, 810).         "
"5","The research that demonstrates the link between heuristic use and misinformation relies almost entirely, if not exclusively, on experimental settings. A key virtue of our approach is that we rely on an observational study that asks voters to evaluate candidates whom they have previously encountered. As Lau and Redlawsk note of their study, “Voters were unfamiliar with all of the candidates before the election began, which at best is not the case when an incumbent is running for reelection” (2001, 967). In addition, Rahn notes that deviating from the party may not be an effective strategy for candidates to appeal to voters given the persistence of party stereotypes in voters’ minds. However, her reliance on hypothetical candidates necessitates the caveat “at least not in the short term” (1993, 493). These studies demonstrate the causal effect of inaccurate heuristics on judgment. Although the authors’ caveats do not detract from this important contribution, they do necessitate an examination of the links between heuristics and misinformation in a nonlaboratory setting."
"6","Relying on observational research allows us to examine the link between heuristic use and misinformation outside the laboratory. This is important because, as scholars of heuristics argue, “Citizens do not operate as decision makers in isolation from political institutions” (Sniderman 2000, 58; see also Boudreau 2009; Lupia and McCubbins 1998). Although experimental researchers work hard to establish realistic political settings, observational research is arguably better suited to test how well heuristics operate in the political and institutional contexts citizens face on a day‐to‐day basis. Our observational design also allows us to examine how individual‐ and contextual‐level factors independently and jointly shape knowledge of senators’ roll‐call votes. This is in contrast to work that explains differences in knowledge largely at the individual level (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Luskin 1990).         "
"7","The focus of this study is a specific type of political knowledge: citizens’ ability to correctly identify their senators’ votes. Although individuals may specialize when it comes to politics (Iyengar 1990), political knowledge tends to adhere to a unidimensional structure (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996). This suggests that correlates of general political knowledge should also correlate with citizens’ knowledge of their senators’ roll‐call votes. To understand differences in knowledge of senators’ roll‐call votes, then, we turn to the existing explanations for variation in individuals’ levels of political knowledge more generally.         "
"8","Studies of citizen competence demonstrate that although the public as a whole tends to know little about politics, there is notable variation in the amount of knowledge people possess. Two sources of this variation are important to our research. The first is contextual factors that reside outside of the control of individuals. For our research, this is the accuracy or inaccuracy of a party cue. Work by Ansolabehere and Jones (2010) shows that when a member of the House of Representatives votes against the majority of her political party (i.e., when she deviates from the party line), citizens are less likely to know their representative's position. In short, knowledge should be affected by the quality of the cues and heuristics used to generate it in the first place.         "
"9","Among the most important predictors, if not the most important predictor, of a citizen's level of political knowledge is her motivation to learn about politics, which is typically measured using a respondent's reported level of interest in politics (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Luskin 1990). The relationship between interest and knowledge is important because the politically interested are also the most politically active (Brady, Verba, and Schlozman 1995). As Prior notes, “Political interest is typically the most powerful predictor of political behaviors that make democracy work” (2010, 747). From a normative perspective, the link between interest and knowledge is reassuring because it signals the most engaged are also the most informed.         "
"10","Political interest and the domain‐specific type of political knowledge we are studying, however, are two distinct concepts. Although it is natural to expect the politically interested to learn more about their elected officials’ votes, there are mental limits to the amount of information even the most attentive citizens can obtain and retain (Lau 2003). Even the most interested segments of the population are therefore likely to lack information on the vast majority of their senators’ roll‐call votes. It is in such situations where we should expect voters to rely on heuristics to fill in the missing information.         "
"11","Although all segments of the public may rely on heuristics, their use, much like political knowledge, is not necessarily distributed equally. There is reason to believe that the politically interested will prove more likely to rely on partisan heuristics when asked how their senators voted. For one, citizens presumably must know (or think they know) where the two parties generally stand on an issue before using party heuristics to infer candidates’ positions. Consistent with such an argument, Lau and Redlawsk (2001) find that when heuristics are accurate, it is the politically sophisticated who use them most effectively. Although polarization has seemingly increased citizens’ understanding of the ideological differences between the two parties (Hetherington 2001; Levendusky 2010), awareness of party differences is still far from perfect. Measures of political sophistication that rely on awareness of party differences find the most interested are more sophisticated (Luskin 1990), suggesting this group of individuals should be better able to draw on party cues. The 2006 CCES corroborates this finding, with just under 40% of the least interested citizens able to place the Republican Party to the right of the Democratic Party ideologically compared to over 91% of the most interested who are able to do so.         "
"12","In addition to a more comprehensive understanding of where the parties stand, the politically interested should also prove more motivated than the less interested to decipher candidates’ issue stands. Nadeau and Niemi (1995, 325–26) argue that when the politically interested answer factual survey questions, they are more likely to provide an answer because they are both more motivated to learn about politics and also more likely to believe they know the answer to a political question, thus venturing an “educated guess.” Although Nadeau and Niemi's study is specifically concerned with answering survey questions, such a process is arguably reflective of the way citizens try to decipher candidates’ positions. The uninterested may simply concede a lack of information while the politically interested are motivated to try and uncover the correct answer (Prior and Lupia 2008).         "
"13","Given the public's increasing awareness of party differences (Hetherington 2001), party labels should provide citizens with a readily available source of potential information on where the senator stands. This leads us to expect that the interested should prove more likely to use partisan heuristics to infer candidates’ positions due both to their knowledge of party differences and motivation to decipher their senator's position (e.g., Nadeau and Niemi 1995). Our expectation that the politically interested rely more on partisan heuristics to sort out where candidates stand on key issues leads us to posit that the relationship between interest and knowledge of senators’ roll‐call votes will depend significantly on situational context.         "
"14","The relationship between an individual's interest in politics and her correct and incorrect knowledge of one of her senator's roll‐call votes should depend on whether or not the senator votes with or against her party. If the interested segment of the public tends to impute their senators’ positions from their knowledge of the parties’ positions, we should expect this to lead to the interested (relative to the uninterested) to have more correct knowledge when the senator votes with the party and more incorrect knowledge when the senator votes against her party. Our theory therefore predicts that not only will misinformation increase when heuristics behave badly but also that misinformation will increase the most among the segment of the public that is the most politically attentive and engaged. In other words, heuristics will, at times, lead astray the very citizens “that make democracy work” (Prior 2010, 747). This counterintuitive expectation derives from our argument that even the most informed are largely ignorant of most votes their senators take, and therefore turn to partisan heuristics as the best available information with which to determine their senators’ positions on a given issue.         "
"15","The theoretical rationale articulated in the previous section leads to two hypotheses about the relationship between citizens’ interest in politics and knowledge of their senators’ votes:"
"16","                        "
"17","Party‐line hypothesis: When a senator votes with the majority of her party, an increase in constituent interest will be associated with a greater increase in correct knowledge relative to incorrect knowledge.               "
"18","Deviation hypothesis: When a senator votes against the majority of her party, an increase in constituent interest will be associated with a greater increase in incorrect knowledge relative to correct knowledge.               "
"19","These expectations embody the link between motivation (interest) and the quality of heuristics. We expect those interested and engaged in politics to be the most likely to be aware of and use heuristics to infer their senators’ positions on salient issues. Because of this, when heuristics are accurate, it is the interested who will have the highest levels of correct knowledge. When the cue goes bad, however, it is the interested and engaged who will prove to be the most misinformed."
"20","We rely on the 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) to test our expectations (Ansolabehere 2006). All respondents are asked the positions they believe each of their senators took on seven key roll‐call votes. The seven votes are (1) withdrawing from Iraq, (2) increasing the minimum wage, (3) increasing funding for stem cell research, (4) extending the capital gains tax cut, (5) banning partial‐birth abortion, (6) granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants, and (7) the ratification of the Central American Free‐Trade Agreement (CAFTA). All roll‐call votes took place in the 109th Congress (2005–2006), with the exception of the partial‐birth abortion vote that took place in the 108th Congress (2003–2004). We rely on these questions to identify correct knowledge, lack of knowledge (the uninformed), and incorrect knowledge (the misinformed).         "
"21","The CCES is a nationally representative sample with over 30,000 respondents.1 The large sample provides us the leverage necessary to estimate models that compare citizens’ knowledge of their senators’ roll‐call votes when they toed the party line and when they deviated from it. This is especially important in our multiple regression models because we model knowledge only for those respondents who have one senator who voted with her political party and one who deviated from the party line on a given issue (a point we expand upon in the next section). For issues where only a few senators deviated from their party line, the CCES provides us with a sufficiently large sample size to estimate our models.         "
"22","Our dependent measure is a three‐category variable coding whether, for a given senator on a given issue, the respondent's answer was correct, incorrect, or he or she did not know how that senator cast his or her vote. For example, respondents in Ohio were asked what position they thought Republican Senator Mike DeWine took on a vote to increase the federal minimum wage, which he supported. They could respond by saying he voted for the increase, against the increase, or that they did not know. Respondents who reported that DeWine voted for the increase were coded as having correct knowledge. Those who reported that he voted against the increase were coded as having incorrect knowledge. One important way our coding differs from other work that relies on knowledge of roll‐call votes is that we treat “don't know” and incorrect responses as distinct while others code “don't know” responses as incorrect knowledge (Wilson and Gronke 2000, 452). Our decision to distinguish “don't know” from incorrect responses is based on the argument of Kuklinski et al. (2000) that there are theoretical differences between correct knowledge, incorrect knowledge, and lack of knowledge (see also Luskin and Bullock 2011).         "
"23","Our primary independent variable is political interest. In the CCES, respondents are asked, “How interested are you in politics and current affairs?” The CCES records four response options: “not much interested,”“somewhat interested,”“very much interested,” and “not sure.” We choose to omit “not sure” responses from our models because they constitute only 0.4% of responses in the study. The result is a 3‐point variable coded from 1 to 3. Our models also include controls for education, age, gender, income, race, strength of partisan identification, and whether or not the respondent shares the same party as the senator about whom he or she is asked (with independent leaners coded as partisans). Information on how these control variables are coded is available in the online supporting information accompanying this article."
"24","In making our argument, we view political interest as part of a larger constellation of attitudes and behaviors that make up what could be referred to as political attentiveness or awareness. We focus here on political interest because we view it as a precursor to knowledge, with the most interested motivated to become politically knowledgeable (e.g., Luskin 1990). We expect that another measure of political attentiveness (such as general political knowledge) would produce similar results. Unfortunately, the 2006 CCES does not contain the knowledge questions political scientists traditionally use to measure sophistication (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Zaller 1992). The CCES does measure respondents’ knowledge of the party of their governor, two senators, and representative. Consistent with our argument that interest is closely related to other measures of awareness, a 5‐point knowledge scale based on the questions about elected officials’ party identification is highly correlated with our interest measure (r = 0.54). Substituting the knowledge scale for interest in the models presented below produces substantively similar results. These models are available in the online supporting information.2"
"25","As an initial test of the party line and deviation hypotheses, we examine the relationship between interest and knowledge absent covariates. Figure 1 presents the relationship graphically for all seven issues. The first column in Figure 1 shows the percentage of respondents across the three levels of interest who provided a correct (solid line), incorrect (dashed line), or “don't know” (dashed line with dots) answer when asked about the position of a senator who voted with the majority of her party. In all seven cases, levels of correct knowledge increase as one moves from low to high levels of interest, with an average increase of 47.3% across the seven issues. In contrast, levels of incorrect knowledge stay relatively flat across the interest categories, with an average increase of only 1.1% in the seven cases. There is strong initial support for the party‐line hypothesis, with the increase in correct knowledge over 40 times greater than the increase in incorrect knowledge as we move from the least to the most interested respondents. The outcomes in the nondeviation cases are therefore consistent with classic expectations of the link between interest and knowledge, whereby the most interested are also the most informed (e.g., Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996). In all seven cases, the modal answer among the least interested is “don't know,” while in six of seven cases the modal response among the most interested is the correct answer.3"
"26","                Percentage of Respondents in Knowledge Categories by Interest and Issue"
"27","The second column in Figure 1 shows the percentage of respondents in each interest category who provided correct, incorrect, or “don't know” answers when asked about a senator who deviated from the party line. Consistent with the nondeviation cases, respondents’ likelihood of saying “don't know” decreases as interest increases. Unlike in the nondeviation cases, however, the likelihood of providing an incorrect answer increases noticeably as one moves from low to high levels of interest. The average increase in incorrect knowledge as we move from the least to the most interested respondents is 31.4% across the seven issues. Notably, the increase in incorrect knowledge is 2.3 times greater than the average 13.8% increase in correct knowledge across the same range. Overall, an incorrect answer is the modal response among highly interested respondents in five out of the seven deviation cases.4 Our initial examination thus provides support for both hypotheses and illustrates that the link between interest and knowledge is contingent upon context.5"
"28","The key benefit to studying political knowledge in experimental settings is the ability of researchers to experimentally manipulate quantities related to knowledge (e.g., the correctness of party cues) and examine how those manipulations causally impact knowledge. By virtue of randomization to various treatment conditions, researchers are able to sever the potentially confounding link between features of individuals and the outcomes under study. For example, Lau and Redlawsk (2001) experimentally manipulate the accuracy of a party cue and find it is the politically aware who are hurt the most by the presence of the inaccurate heuristic. By extension, the problem with relying on observational studies to examine the link between senators’ deviation from the party line and constituents’ levels of political knowledge is that features of individuals could lead them to be more or less likely to have a senator who deviates. Consistent with such an argument, Ensley, Tofias, and de Marchi (2010) find that senators with more ideologically extreme constituencies are less likely to defect from the party.            "
"29","Our solution to this problem is to leverage the fact that respondents in the CCES were asked about the votes taken by each of their two senators. In this section, we examine only those people for whom one senator deviated from the party line and the other did not on a given vote. This allows us, in essence, “to hold constant” unobserved features of individuals that could correlate with senators deviating or not deviating from the party line.6 In practice, the result is that for each roll‐call vote, we run two models. One model predicts knowledge of senators who deviate from the party line and the other knowledge for those who do not deviate. The two models for each roll‐call vote are thus estimated using the same respondents.7 The comparisons in these models are across individuals. They reveal whether the difference in the interest‐knowledge relationship observed in the bivariate case holds up when we focus only on respondents with one senator who deviated and one who did not.8"
"30","Although our modeling technique means we are not relying on a national random sample in this section of our analysis, the respondents in our study are evaluating real politicians. This gives our study an advantage in external validity compared to prior experimental work on heuristics. In addition, our ability to estimate two different models using the same respondents allows us to attribute differences in knowledge to the actions of the respondents’ two different senators.9 If the results are consistent with the findings from the bivariate analysis, which included all cases, and the experimental work on the effect of inaccurate heuristics (Lau and Redlawsk 2001), it will enhance our confidence in the internal and external validity of the findings.            "
"31","Our dependent variable remains three unordered outcomes: correct knowledge, incorrect knowledge, and “don't know” responses. To model this variable, we rely on multinomial logistic regression.10 In all, we estimate 14 logistic regression models: seven (one for each roll‐call vote) predicting knowledge of roll‐call votes for senators who did not deviate from the party line and seven modeling knowledge of roll‐call votes for senators who did deviate from the party line.11 All of the models include state fixed effects, although we omit these from the graphs for clarity.12"
"32","A given coefficient reveals the marginal effect of a one‐unit change in the corresponding independent variable on the log‐odds of one outcome (e.g., correct knowledge) relative to the other (e.g., incorrect knowledge). After presenting the coefficients for each model, we turn to a more transparent discussion of simulated changes in the predicted probability of the outcomes for given values of our independent variables. Because of the large number of models we estimate, we present the coefficients from our models graphically.13Figure 2 plots multinomial logit coefficients with 95% confidence intervals for the Correct versus Incorrect outcome. Figure 3 plots the same information for the “don't know” versus Incorrect outcome. In both cases, the incorrect answer is the base category. Sample sizes in the models range from 995 in the minimum wage model to 7,684 in the immigration models.         "
"33","                Correct vs. Incorrect Knowledge (Base Category)"
"34","                Don't Know vs. Incorrect Knowledge (Base Category)"
"35","Our results provide additional support for our hypotheses. Consistent with prior work on political knowledge (e.g., Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996), we expect that when senators vote with their political party that higher levels of political interest will be associated with higher levels of correct knowledge relative to incorrect knowledge. The interest panel in Figure 2 shows that this is the case, with the coefficient on political interest consistently positive across all seven issues. In five of the models, this effect is statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. In the other two cases, the sign of the coefficient is in the expected direction (positive); however, the coefficient does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance.         "
"36","When senators deviate from the party line, we find that higher levels of political interest are associated with lower levels of correct knowledge relative to incorrect knowledge, which is consistent with the deviation hypothesis. In all seven models, the coefficient for interest is negatively signed, and the coefficient is statistically significant at p < 0.05 in the capital gains and minimum wage models and p < 0.08 in the abortion model. Importantly, for all seven issues, the interest coefficient for nondeviators is statistically distinguishable from the coefficient in the nondeviator models (p ≤ 0.05). It is also important to note that in all 14 of our models, higher levels of interest are associated with a significantly lower chance of respondents reporting that they do not know the vote cast by their senator, which is consistent with prior studies on the relationship between interest and “don't know” responses (Nadeau and Niemi 1995). Finally, we also find a consistent relationship between party identification strength and incorrect knowledge (relative to correct knowledge) in the deviator models. This is consistent with work showing that strong partisans also often have high levels of misinformation (Kuklinski et al. 2000).14"
"37","To better illustrate the effect of interest on levels of correct and incorrect knowledge, we plot differences in predicted probabilities.15 The top panel of Figure 4 shows the predicted probability differences generated from the nondeviator models. The solid triangles and lines show the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals, respectively, for the differences in the predicted probability of providing a correct answer as one moves from the least to most interested respondent with all other variables held at their median or modal values. Across the seven issues, an increase in respondent interest is associated with a positive and statistically significant increase in correct knowledge of the senator's vote. The average increase in correct knowledge across the seven models is 0.39, ranging from 0.17 (CAFTA) to 0.50 (stem cell).         "
"38","                Change in Predicted Probability of (In)correct Answer"
"39","The transparent triangles and solid lines in Figure 4 show the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals, respectively, for the changes in incorrect knowledge as one moves from low to high interest. Note that it is possible for both correct and incorrect knowledge to increase with interest given the sharp decrease in “don't know” answers as we move up the interest scale. While increases in correct knowledge are statistically significant in all seven cases, the increase in incorrect knowledge is positive and statistically significant in only two cases (CAFTA and immigration) and statistically insignificant in the remaining cases. In addition, the average increase in incorrect knowledge across the seven models is 0.04, compared to the 0.39 average increase in correct knowledge. Consistent with the bivariate results, the predicted probability differences from the multinomial logit models indicate that interest is associated with larger increases in correct knowledge relative to incorrect knowledge in the nondeviator cases, which supports the party‐line hypothesis.         "
"40","The bottom panel of Figure 4 displays the relationship between interest and (in)correct knowledge in the deviator models. Unlike in the nondeviator models, where incorrect knowledge showed a statistically significant increase in only two of the seven cases, incorrect knowledge now shows a statistically significant increase across all seven issues. In the case of the capital gains, Iraq, minimum wage, and stem cell votes, levels of incorrect knowledge increase on average by 0.38 as one moves from the least to most interested respondents. The resultant increase in correct knowledge across these four issues is 0.04. In all four of these cases, the increase in incorrect knowledge is larger than the increase in correct knowledge with no overlap in the 95% confidence intervals. Abortion shows a similar effect, with the increase in incorrect knowledge greater than the increase in correct knowledge, although the 95% confidence intervals overlap.16"
"41","The immigration and CAFTA cases differ from the overall pattern, with correct knowledge increasing at the same rate (CAFTA) or a slightly larger rate (immigration) than incorrect knowledge. Interestingly, these are the two issues where party cues are the least clear, with 23 senators deviating from the party line on the CAFTA vote and 27 deviating on the immigration vote. The fact that our hypotheses do not find support in these two cases is therefore not entirely surprising. Since we argue that it is reliance on party cues that drives the increase in incorrect knowledge relative to correct knowledge, we would expect the relationship to dissipate in the face of weak or nonexistent party cues."
"42","In the end, interest is associated with a statistically significant increase in incorrect knowledge in each of the seven deviation models compared to only two of the nondeviation models. In addition, correct knowledge increases at a statistically larger rate than incorrect knowledge in six of the seven nondeviator models, while incorrect knowledge increases at a statistically larger rate in four of the seven deviator models. The pattern of results is largely consistent with the party line and deviation hypotheses. When a senator votes with the majority of her party, her more interested constituents will hold significantly higher levels of correct knowledge about her vote than her uninterested constituents and roughly similar levels of incorrect knowledge. When a senator deviates from the party line, however, the result is a sizeable increase in the number of her interested constituents who are misinformed. Especially in cases where party cues are clear, then, the modal highly interested constituent is likely to be misinformed when his senator deviates from the party line.         "
"43","Given most Americans’ relative lack of information about government and politics, political scientists have looked to heuristics to understand whether citizens can behave “as if” they are relatively well informed. Although heuristics offer the potential to make up for citizens’ lack of political knowledge (Boudreau 2009; Lupia and McCubbins 1998; Popkin 1991), laboratory research in both psychology and political science raises concerns about the potential heuristics possess to mislead individuals (Kahneman and Frederick 2002; Lau and Redlawsk 2001; Tversky and Kahneman 1974). In this study, we illustrate through a unique research design that when salient cues lead voters astray, the result is not merely an uninformed citizenry, but rather one where the least interested are uninformed and the most interested are misinformed. We are not the first to demonstrate empirically that party heuristics may at times lead citizens down the wrong path (Lau and Redlawsk 2001; Rahn 1993). Our observational study is important, however, given researchers’ caution about inferring whether experimental findings translate into campaigns with established candidates (e.g., Lau and Redlawsk 2001, 967; Rahn 1993, 493), and the argument of heuristics’ defenders that existing institutions may make heuristics especially useful (Boudreau 2009; Lupia and McCubbins 1998; Sniderman 2000). Ultimately, our study contributes to the scholarship that demonstrates heuristics are not a panacea but instead a double‐edged sword. Heuristics are useful when correct, but they can also prove detrimental when they are inaccurate (Kuklinski and Quirk 2000; Mondak 1994).         "
"44","A second insight our work provides is that the class of citizens many scholars presume will be the best citizens—the politically interested—are actually the most misinformed segment of the population when heuristics go bad. Thus, it is those who follow political campaigns the closest, pay the most attention to politics, and are most likely to participate who are hurt the most when heuristics are incorrect. Such a finding stands in contrast to the robust, positive relationship between interest and political knowledge that studies typically uncover (e.g., Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; but see Taber and Lodge 2006). In addition, in models of low‐information rationality, the interested are often assumed to play a key role in sounding “fire alarms” to draw the attention of the less engaged and interested to important political events or situations (Popkin 1991, 45–49). The less interested, in other words, can “delegate” the collection and evaluation of information to the more interested (Downs 1957). Such an argument necessitates that we study how well heuristics work among the most attentive segment of the public. Although scholars tend to consider the benefits of heuristics for the least informed (Boudreau 2009; Downs 1957; Popkin 1991), our study illustrates that heuristics can pose problems for the most informed. Combined with experimental research that suggests the most sophisticated are the least likely to “vote correctly” in the face of faulty heuristics (Lau and Redlawsk 2001), the results suggest that heuristics are not a cure‐all.

"45","It is important to note that our findings do not suggest heuristics are uniformly, or even typically, uninformative. Instead, it is when elected officials deviate from expectations that heuristics become not just less useful but actually misleading. The use of the term “deviate,” however, suggests that this condition is not the norm. Party cues serve as a good proxy for actual knowledge of the majority of elected officials’ positions on the majority of issues. Indeed, across the seven votes under study here, senators adhered to the party line 85% of the time. Although we acknowledge that this is the case, it should not detract from the overall thrust of our argument. Our focus here admittedly emphasizes the cases where heuristics “go bad,” but heuristics are not uniformly good or bad. Much of the time they can help citizens simplify the complex political world. In certain circumstances, however, heuristics become more insidious by increasing misinformation among the citizens who care the most about politics."
"46","Recent research finds that how a representative votes affects constituents’ perceptions of her vote, with these perceptions ultimately influencing electoral choices (Ansolabehere and Jones 2010). This is reassuring from a normative perspective, indicating that actual votes translate into real electoral reward or punishment for elected officials. In the aggregate, our results do not fundamentally call such a conclusion into question. Instead, the findings presented here suggest there is heterogeneity across senators in terms of how knowledgeable their constituents are about their votes, and, presumably, how likely the senator is to be held accountable for her positions. Such an argument is consistent with Lau and Redlawsk's (2001) finding that the politically sophisticated are more or less likely to “vote correctly” based on the quality of available cues. Future research could expand on our analyses by examining how senator‐level characteristics moderate the extent to which voters engage—successfully or unsuccessfully—in issue voting.         "
"47","Ultimately, these findings corroborate the point offered by Kuklinski et al. (2000) that there are important differences between information, lack of information, and misinformation. In the face of faulty heuristics, the modal citizen—whether politically interested or not—is unlikely to possess accurate information. Political interest does predict, however, whether a citizen is uninformed or misinformed when faced with a deviation from the political norm. Along with the research of Kuklinski et al. (2000), our findings illustrate that misinformation is often most prevalent among the most interested citizens and the strongest partisans. This is especially true when the cues used by those citizens are inaccurate (Lau and Redlawsk 2001). Whether a lack of information or the presence of misinformation is more consequential for voter decision making is a fruitful venue for future research. For now, two features of misinformation make it an important concern for those who care about the quality of democratic accountability. First, misinformation is enduring in nature (Nyhan and Reifler 2010). Second, and perhaps relatedly, misinformation is at times most prevalent among the most politically engaged citizens.         "
