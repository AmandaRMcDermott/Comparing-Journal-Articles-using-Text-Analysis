"1","In 2000, the average American household received 74 television channels, an 80% increase from 1995 (Bednarski 2001). In a TV environment characterized by ever‐expanding programming alternatives, a politically apathetic and cynical citizenry (Bennett 1986; Nye, Zelikow, and King 1997) possesses both the motive and opportunity to tune out politics. One primary consequence is that an increasing portion of the television audience is unwilling to stay tuned when political news crosses their screen. For instance, thanks in large measure to rising competition from cable and satellite television, the audience for presidential television appearances has declined precipitously (Baum and Kernell 1999), as have those for the major broadcast networks' evening newscasts (Baum 2002a; Lichty and Gomery 1992), and even for local TV news (Pew Center 2002; Rosensteil, Gottlieb and Brady 2000). One survey (Pew Center 2000) found 62% of respondents indicating that they watch news with their remote control in hand, flipping to other channels when they are not interested in a given story. These data suggest political news is an increasingly hard sell for TV broadcasters. They further suggest that traditional avenues of access to the public through the media are being foreclosed to politicians.         "
"2","These trends present a challenge for political candidates. As TV viewers are offered an ever‐expanding variety of programming alternatives, politicians confront a fundamental paradigm shift. No longer can they merely send out a broadcast signal and, in effect, wait for the audience to come to them. Rather, candidates must increasingly seek out an audience. This, in turn, requires repackaging their messages into forms appealing to a populace with little patience for politics and then moving those revamped messages to where the target audiences have relocated. If a substantial portion of the public has switched over to the entertainment media, then so too must the candidates."
"3","But who is likely to encounter political messages presented on an E‐talk show? In fact, the E‐talk show audience is quite large. Ratings for some daytime talk shows rival or exceed those for the evening newscasts of the major networks (Baum 2002a, 2003). But, compared to the traditional news audience, the E‐talk show audience is, on average, less educated, less interested in politics, and more likely to be young, female, and liberal (Baum 2003; Davis and Owen 1998; Hamilton 2003; Pew Center 2000 and 2002; Burns, Kinder, Rosenstone, and Sapiro 2001). According to the 2000 ANES, in turn, they are also more likely to be Democrats (34%) or Independents (40%) than Republicans (26%). And Republicans are more politically aware and more likely to vote than either Democrats or Independents (Baum 2002b).         "
"4","These data suggest that candidates hoping to communicate effectively with E‐talk show audiences, while convincing them to refrain from switching channels, would have to tailor their messages to appeal to audiences less interested in or knowledgeable about politics than the typical audience for traditional news. One increasingly common strategy for doing so entails deemphasizing the partisan content in a candidate's message. This suggests coverage of presidential politics by E‐talk shows may differ significantly from that of the traditional news media, which have, in recent decades, grown increasingly negative (Brody 1991; Groeling and Kernell 1998; Patterson 1996). As a consequence, traditional news outlets are becoming an inhospitable environment for presidential candidates. Due to their personality/human‐interest orientation, E‐talk shows represent a potentially attractive alternative outlet for candidates.         "
"5","There is no reason to believe that E‐talk shows would suspend their entertainment‐oriented sensibilities when political candidates cross their stages. Indeed, it is their relatively apolitical orientation that appeals to candidates seeking refuge from the negativity of the mainstream news media, as well as access to segments of the population that do not typically follow traditional political debates. This, after all, is what makes candidate appearances on E‐talk shows mutually beneficial: talk shows seek to entertain their audiences by offering “fun,” human interest‐oriented interviews with high profile individuals; candidates covet an opportunity to present themselves in a positive light, without having to face hostile questioning from jaded political reporters."
"6","This suggests that we should observe less emphasis on partisan conflict or policy‐oriented topics and themes in E‐talk show interviews, relative to candidate interviews on traditional political programs or campaign coverage on national news shows. Indeed, political candidates would seem to have little incentive to appear on E‐talk shows unless they are confident that they will be able to present themselves in a favorable light, with minimal risk of embarrassment. Given the demographics and interests of most E‐talk show viewers, the hosts of such programs are unlikely to risk alienating their audiences with tough, issue‐oriented questions or partisan debate. Instead, E‐talk show hosts and viewers, as well as presidential candidates, all seem likely to prefer interviews that emphasize the candidates' personal qualities, rather than their political views or issue positions. This suggests several hypotheses:"
"7","                        "
"8","H1: Relative to interviews or campaign coverage by traditional news outlets, candidate interviews on E‐talk shows will include fewer references to political parties, partisan themes, or other potentially divisive images.               "
"9","                        "
"10","H2: Relative to interviews or campaign coverage by traditional news outlets, candidate interviews on E‐talk shows will offer more favorable coverage of the interview subject.               "
"11","                        "
"12","H3: Relative to interviews or campaign coverage by traditional news outlets, candidate interviews on E‐talk shows will offer less emphasis on substantive issues or comparisons of candidate positions on the issues.               "
"13","Of course, the content of E‐talk show coverage is only of interest if it influences voters. If traditional news programs differ materially from E‐talk shows in their coverage of presidential politics, such differences may, in fact, have meaningful consequences for voter attitudes and behavior. Research (e.g., Popkin 1994; Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991) has shown that most individuals rely upon information shortcuts, or heuristic cues, to help them make sense of the political world. The availability of simple heuristics, especially a candidate's “likeability” (Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991, chapter 6) or party identification, makes it possible for even relatively uninformed voters to figure out which candidate best represents their own interests.         "
"14","At the same time, not all individuals rely similarly upon, or respond similarly to, political information. According to the reception‐acceptance model of opinion formation (McGuire 1968; Zaller 1992), individuals at different levels of political awareness tend to have varying propensities to encounter political information and to react differently to information to which they are exposed. The least politically aware individuals tend not to expose themselves to political information. Hence, they frequently have no basis upon which to alter their opinions. The opinions of highly politically aware individuals are also relatively stable, but for a different reason. These latter individuals have well‐formed belief systems as well as, due to their greater attentiveness to politics, a far greater number of accessible considerations regarding typical political issues that they can bring to bear to “counterargue,” and thereby resist accepting, dissonant messages, even if they receive them. I refer to this latter propensity to reject information inconsistent with preexisting attitudes, given exposure, as selective acceptance.         "
"15","One consequence, long recognized by students of voting behavior (e.g., Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Campbell et al. 1960), is that exposure to political campaigns in the media tends to reinforce partisan predispositions rather than challenging them, particularly among highly aware individuals. In other words, such individuals will discount dissonant information (e.g., criticism of their party's candidate or praise of the opposition candidate), while focusing on information that reinforces their predispositions (e.g., praise of their party's candidate or criticism of the opposition candidate).         "
"16","Relative to their highly aware counterparts, low‐awareness individuals are less likely to encounter most political messages, or pay attention to or understand them if encountered in a traditional news context (Baum 2002a; Hamill and Lodge 1986; Hamilton 2003). For these individuals, such information will be relatively inaccessible and hence uninteresting. As a consequence, traditional news coverage of a political campaign is unlikely to influence these latter individuals' attitudes or voting behavior. After all, they can either ignore any such information that might cross the television screen or simply reach for their remotes.         "
"17","While, in turn, it is fairly clear why traditional campaign news will most likely exert only a modest influence on politically unaware individuals, the likely valence of any such effects, however modest, is more difficult to determine. On the one hand, low‐awareness individuals tend to be less strongly wedded to their partisan predispositions (Zaller n.d.), and hence, presumably more amenable to altering their assessments of the candidates and their vote choice. But, on the other hand, as discussed, they are less likely to encounter or attend to any information that might induce them to do so. The net effect of these countervailing tendencies is unclear.         "
"18","Compared with traditional news shows, in order to appeal to their relatively apolitical audiences, E‐talk shows make political information more accessible. This reduces the likelihood that low‐awareness individuals will tune such information out. Yet to the extent that E‐talk shows emphasize candidate personalities, rather than comparing issue positions, ideology, or the political “horse race,” the standard partisan heuristic cues voters use to make sense of politics may be less prevalent, or at least less easily recognizable. Moreover, the key audience demographic for E‐talk shows—relatively apolitical individuals with limited education—is particularly dependent on a relatively small number (compared to highly aware individuals) of highly accessible heuristic cues in making political decisions (Lau and Redlawsk 2001).1 Hence, the relative scarcity of political or partisan cues or issue comparisons seems likely to affect disproportionately the least politically aware members of the public.         "
"19","At the same time, the relative absence of negative or conflictual frames and tones, in favor of softer, personality‐oriented topics and themes, will tend to paint any candidate in a positive light. This suggests that E‐talk shows will tend to prime (Iyengar and Kinder 1987) the candidates' “likeability” (recall the “likeability” heuristic), increasing its prominence to viewers—especially low‐awareness viewers—as a factor influencing their vote choice. For these individuals, a positive portrayal of a candidate may counter any relatively weakly held negative associations based on the candidate's party affiliation. Hence, watching a candidate interview on an E‐talk show is likely to enhance a low‐awareness viewer's regard for that candidate, especially if he or she held a negative attitude ex ante. Moreover, this effect is likely to trump any more critical information about the candidates presented in traditional campaign coverage. After all, as noted, such coverage is relatively unlikely to influence low‐awareness individuals, even if they encounter it.         "
"20","This logic, however, is less likely to apply to highly politically aware individuals, who are better able to identify reinforcing cues, even in a relatively nonpartisan environment. They are also better equipped than their less politically aware counterparts to employ selective acceptance, and thereby discount any favorable coverage of an opposition party candidate. Hence, highly aware individuals will most likely be able to identify and focus on information that reinforces their partisan predispositions, even in the context of relatively nonpartisan E‐talk show interviews."
"21","At first glance, given that many low‐awareness viewers are presumably exposed to similarly positive portrayals of both candidates, one might expect the effects of E‐talk show viewing on such individuals to cancel out. Yet, the default position for the vast majority of Americans—including most low‐awareness individuals—is to support their own party's candidate. For instance, when asked in the pre‐election wave of the 2000 ANES to indicate whom they planned to vote for in the upcoming presidential election, fully 90% of self‐described Democrats indicated that they intended to vote for Al Gore, while 89% of self‐described Republicans planned to vote for George W. Bush. This suggests watching an E‐talk show that portrays their fellow partisan in a positive light is unlikely to substantially increase typical individuals' support for their fellow partisan candidate. In all likelihood, they already supported him or her anyway.         "
"22","In contrast, because party identifiers tend to hold the opposition candidate in much lower esteem, there is simply more room to reevaluate the opposition party candidate upward following a sympathetic appearance on an E‐talk show. Hence, even if most E‐talk show viewers are positively impressed with the performance of their own party's candidate, this is unlikely to produce a substantial increase in support for that candidate. In contrast, if even a relatively small number of viewers are favorably impressed with the opposition candidate or unimpressed with their fellow partisan candidate, this is likely to produce a net increase, all else equal, in support for the opposition candidate. Moreover, given that politically unaware individuals are less intrinsically resistant to changing their positions than their highly aware counterparts (Zaller n.d.), the largest effects are likely to be located among the least politically aware segments of the population."
"23","Unlike their less aware counterparts, highly politically aware individuals are presumably just as effective at counterarguing dissonant information when watching E‐talk shows as when watching the evening news. There is no reason to believe that selective acceptance will operate any less strongly for these latter individuals when watching entertainment‐oriented programming. Hence, for highly aware individuals, the effects of exposure to E‐talk shows and traditional news shows are likely to be comparable. The greater accessibility of campaign coverage by an E‐talk show will matter little to a viewer who finds politics intrinsically engaging. As a consequence, to the extent watching an E‐talk show interview has any effect at all on a highly aware individual, it is likely to reinforce his or her predispositions, rather than undermine them. Given, however, that such individuals typically have relatively strong partisan preferences, and so are likely to already support their party's candidate, we are unlikely to observe a strong reinforcement effect.         "
"24","This discussion suggests that any E‐talk show influence on the voting behavior of low‐awareness individuals can be traced, at least in significant measure, to the effects of such shows on voter perceptions of the candidates' personal qualities in general, and their likeability in particular. This implies that we should anticipate fairly analogous effects on both likeability and voting behavior. A series of hypotheses follow:"
"25","                        "
"26","H4: Among highly politically aware individuals, exposure to traditional news coverage of the campaign will have a relatively modest effect on viewers' perceptions of the candidates' likeability. Any such effects will enhance their assessment of their own party's candidate.               "
"27","                        "
"28","H5: Among politically unaware individuals, exposure to traditional news will have a smaller effect than exposure to E‐talk shows on perceptions regarding the candidates' likeability. It is unclear whether any such effects will raise or lower these individuals' evaluations of the candidates.               "
"29","                        "
"30","H6: Among highly politically aware individuals, exposure to traditional news coverage of the election campaign will have a relatively modest effect on vote choice. Any such effects will increase their propensity to vote consistently with their partisan predispositions.               "
"31","                        "
"32","H7: Among politically unaware individuals, exposure to traditional news will have a smaller effect on vote choice than exposure to E‐talk shows. It is unclear whether any such effects will increase or decrease their propensity to vote consistently with their partisan predispositions.               "
"33","                        "
"34","H8: Among politically unaware individuals, watching E‐talk shows will be associated with an increase in the perceived likeability of the opposition candidate. This effect will weaken as political awareness increases, and may even reverse among highly aware individuals, with E‐talk show exposure being associated with a modest decline in perceived likeability of the opposition candidate.               "
"35","                        "
"36","H9: Among politically unaware individuals, watching E‐talk shows will be associated with an increased likelihood of voting for the opposition party candidate. This relationship will weaken as political awareness increases, and may even reverse among highly politically aware respondents, with E‐talk show consumption becoming associated with a modestly increased propensity to vote consistently with their partisan predispositions.               "
"37","I test my hypotheses through two investigations. The first, which tests Hypotheses 1–3, consists of a content analysis of candidate appearances on E‐talk shows and traditional political talk shows, as well as candidate interviews and campaign coverage by the national news media. The second analysis, which tests Hypotheses 4–9, employs the 2000 ANES survey."
"38","Beginning with the former, I analyzed the content of presidential candidate appearances on E‐talk shows (including Oprah Winfrey, Rosie O'Donnell, Live with Regis and Kelly, Queen Latifah, Jay Leno, and David Letterman), traditional political talk/interview shows and national news programs (including Meet the Press, This Week, the Jim Lehrer News Hour, Hardball, CNN's Morning News and Early Prime programs, and the network evening newscasts of ABC, CBS, and NBC), as well as a random sample of 60 campaign reports by the major network evening newscasts and CNN's primetime news programming. These data include all nationally broadcast E‐talk show interviews with Bush or Gore, as well as all network news and political talk show candidate interviews from the networks and shows listed above, between March 7 and November 6,2000.2 I focus primarily on candidate appearances because they represent the highest‐profile, the most widely watched, extensive and extended (for E‐talk shows), and hence presumably the most consequential, form of campaign coverage. Moreover, unlike most media campaign coverage, candidates are able to control when and where they make personal appearances.3"
"39","For each report, two graduate student research assistants, working independently, counted the number of mentions of political parties and campaign issues (using sentences as the units of analysis), as well as the number of comparisons of the candidates' partisan or issue positions. The former were labeled “partisan cues,” because they provided information relating the candidates to their party, or the opposition party, while the latter were termed “issue cues,” because they compared the candidates' stands on issues. If an interview or report mentioned a substantive issue, but offered no comparison to the other party or candidate, the comment was coded as an “issue mention.” Coders also tallied the number of positive and negative references regarding both major party candidates. These were termed “valence cues.” Any comment or statement that supports a given candidate or his position on an issue, or in some other way presents him in a positive light, or, alternatively, criticizes or otherwise presents his opponent in a negative light, was coded as positive. The coders also noted whether a given positive (negative) reference consisted of praise (criticism) of a candidate or criticism (praise) of his opponent, as well as the source of such praise (criticism). In order to minimize subjectivity, only unambiguous comments or statements were coded. The coding guidelines are summarized in Appendix B. The coding by my two research assistants based on a sentence‐by‐sentence review of each report, correlated at .92. The corresponding Cohen's Kappa score (Cook 1998), measuring overall intercoder reliability, is .93.         "
"40","Turning to the second analysis, the 2000 ANES includes a series of questions concerning media consumption habits, one of which asks respondents how often they watch daytime talk shows. I investigate the implications of watching these programs, as well as national network news shows, for respondents' political attitudes and behavior. To test my hypotheses regarding vote choice, I employ the following question as my dependent variable: “Who did you vote for [for president]?” Responses were coded as follows: 1 = Al Gore, 2 = George W. Bush, and 3 = all other candidates. Because my theory concerns vote choice, rather than the decision to vote, self‐declared nonvoters were excluded.4"
"41","To investigate attitudes toward the candidates, I construct a “likeability” scale from a series of questions asking respondents to name what they like and dislike about each candidate.5 Interviewers coded up to five likes and five dislikes per candidate. From these questions, I created two variables—one for each candidate—based on the total number of likes mentioned as a proportion of the combined total number of likes and dislikes mentioned. The two resulting variables run from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that a respondent mentioned only “dislikes” and 1 indicates that he or she mentioned only “likes.” The likeability ratios have means (μ) of .52 and .49, and standard deviations (σ) of .34 and .35, for Gore and Bush, respectively. Because these indicators are bounded between zero and one, I transform them into natural logarithms.6"
"42","This indicator reflects Zaller and Feldman's (1992) argument that the opinions expressed by typical individuals tend to reflect whichever considerations about a given issue are most accessible at the time they are queried. By employing a ratio, in turn, I avoid any potential bias resulting from the ability of highly politically aware individuals to access more considerations regarding issues or candidates (Zaller 1992; Zaller and Feldman 1992). After all, while low‐awareness individuals may bring fewer considerations to bear in making political decisions, the relative proportion of favorable‐to‐unfavorable considerations they possess concerning the candidates is just as likely to influence their vote choice as that of political sophisticates (Zaller and Feldman 1992).         "
"43","Some research (e.g., Rahn, Krosnik, and Breuning 1994) suggests that people tend to forget exactly why they prefer a candidate, and respond to open‐ended “likes/dislikes” questions with post‐hoc rationalizations for their already‐formed preferences. If so, the likeability ratio might not be an actual cause of respondents' vote choices. Yet, Rahn, Krosnik, and Breuning (1994) find that post‐hoc rationalization is most prevalent among highly politically engaged individuals and those with minimum media exposure, and least prevalent among voters who make up their minds relatively late in the campaign. Hence, this seems least likely to be the case among low‐awareness voters—who tend to hold weaker preferences than political sophisticates—who were exposed to media coverage of the campaign via E‐talk shows. Moreover, since the “likes/dislikes” questions appeared at the outset of the ANES pre‐election wave, respondents could not have been influenced by their answers to other questions regarding their political preferences. Consequently, to the extent likeability and vote choice move in tandem, this represents evidence that the mechanism underlying the predicted effects of E‐talk shows on vote choice—i.e., their effects on viewers' perceptions of the candidates' likeability—is itself consistent with the theory, especially among low‐awareness viewers.         "
"44","The key causal variable, in turn, is based on the following question: “How many times in the last week have you watched daytime television talk shows such as Oprah Winfrey, Rosie O'Donnell, or Jerry Springer?” Because relatively few respondents (9%) reported watching more than three such shows, I collapse this indicator into four categories, coded: 0 = none, 1 = one time, 2 = two times, and 3 = three or more times. Overall, 28% of respondents indicated that they had watched at least one daytime talk show during the prior week. (For the recoded scale, μ= .61 and σ= 1.07.)         "
"45","While this indicator does not explicitly measure exposure to candidate interviews on E‐talk shows, I believe that, in addition to being the best—indeed, to my knowledge, the only—available indicator for testing my hypotheses in close proximity to a presidential election, it is also reasonably valid. There are two reasons for this. First, the more an individual watches daytime talk shows, the more likely he or she is to be watching when a candidate makes an appearance. And second, given that the ANES question asks respondents about their talk show viewing in the week prior to the interview, and given that all but one of the candidates' E‐talk show appearances took place during the pre‐election wave (which began on September 5, 2000), the relationship between watching E‐talk shows and encountering candidate interviews on such shows was far higher during this period than at any other time.         "
"46","The control variables fall into four categories and include many of the most widely employed variables in the study of American voting behavior (e.g., Rosenstone and Hansen 1993, 273–75). These are: (1) demographics (age, education, gender, race, religiosity), (2) political attitudes (party ID, strength of partisanship, ideology, retrospective economic evaluation, strength of candidate preferences, participation in the 2000 campaign, caring about the election outcome), (3) political disaffection (trust in government, external efficacy), and (4) media consumption (national network TV news, local TV news, newspapers, political talk radio, politics on the internet, cable access).7"
"47","I also create an indicator of respondents' political awareness. Zaller defines political awareness as “the extent to which an individual pays attention to politics and understands what he or she has encountered” (1992, 21). In order to capture both parts of Zaller's definition (attention and understanding), I create a scale derived from four elements, assessing (1) interest in government and public affairs, (2) attention to the 2000 election, (3) level of political information, as estimated by the interviewer, and (4) factual political knowledge, derived from a series of 10 questions. All four elements were normalized to a 0–1 interval and then added together to create a summary political awareness indicator. The resulting variable, which combines objective measures with respondents' self‐assessments, runs from 0 to 4 (μ= 2.5 and σ= 1.0).8 To determine whether consuming talk shows or network news has differing effects on the attitudes of different types of respondents, I separately interact daytime talk show and national network news consumption with political awareness and with respondents' party identification.9 (See Appendix A for variable ID numbers and coding.)         "
"48","How E‐Talk Shows Covered the 2000 Election I begin with Hypotheses 1–3. Hypothesis 1 predicts that candidate interviews on E‐talk shows will include fewer references to political parties, partisan themes, or other potentially divisive images, than traditional news reports or candidate interviews. The column in Table 1 labeled “Partisan Cues,” supports this hypothesis. Candidate interviews on E‐talk shows featured an average of one partisan cue every five minutes. The corresponding figures for traditional political programs and national news campaign reports were far smaller: 1.0 and 3.1 partisan‐cues‐per‐minute, respectively. The differences are each significant at the .0001 level or better (based on two‐tailed t‐tests). These results support my first hypothesis.               "
"49","Hypothesis 2 predicts that E‐talk shows will be more sympathetic to their interview subjects than traditional news shows. Table 2 presents the results of my tests of this prediction. Once again, the results support my hypothesis. As shown in the top section of Table 2, during Al Gore's appearances on E‐talk shows, 96% of all valence cues were favorable to the Vice President (i.e., supportive of Gore or critical of Bush). The corresponding figures for Gore's appearances on traditional news and political interview programs, and in national news reports, were only 57 and 58% favorable, respectively. This “favorability” gap is statistically significant at the .05 level (one‐tailed t‐test).10"
"50","Then‐Texas Governor George W. Bush received similarly favorable treatment by E‐talk shows. During his appearances, 95% of all valence cues were sympathetic to the Republican candidate. The corresponding figures for Bush's appearances on traditional news and interview programs, and in national news reports, were 65 and 42% favorable, respectively. Once again, this favorability gap is statistically significant (p < .01). In contrast, neither of the smaller corresponding differences between pro‐Bush and pro‐Gore valence cues in traditional news and interview programs are significant at standard levels, though that favoring Bush (with respect to political interview shows) is nearly so (p < .09)."
"51","The middle section of Table 2 compares the overall volume of positive versus negative content in candidate interviews and national news reports. These data indicate that sizeable majorities of all valence cues in traditional political interviews and network newscasts were critical of the two candidates. During Gore's traditional political interviews, 81% of all valence cues pertaining to the Vice President were negative (p < .02). The corresponding figure for Bush was 66% (insig.). National news campaign reports, in turn, were even more negative, with 83% of all valence cues critical of the candidates (p < .001). In sharp contrast, during Gore's and Bush's E‐talk show interviews, 100 and 95%, respectively, of all valence cues pertaining to the interview subjects were sympathetic. The differences between supportive and critical comments in E‐talk shows are significant at the .02 and .08 levels, for Gore and Bush, respectively.11"
"52","Thus far, these figures do not distinguish between the sources of praise and criticism (i.e., from interviewers or reporters versus from the candidates themselves). Yet previous research (e.g., Lupia and McCubbins 1998; Miller and Krosnick 2000) suggests that evaluations from a trusted or relatively unbiased third party are likely to be more credible to a typical viewer than evaluations by the candidates themselves or their representatives. This is because self‐praise or criticism of one's opponent is cheap talk, whereas praise or criticism from a trusted or less‐biased third party, such as a talk show host or reporter, is, under many circumstances, at least a somewhat more costly signal.               "
"53","In fact, disaggregating the data to take into account the source of valence cues reinforces the picture presented above. As shown in the bottom section of Table 2, the hosts/interviewers of traditional news and interview shows criticized Gore and Bush about once every 2.5 and 6.7 minutes, respectively, during their interviews (or .41 and .15 criticisms‐per‐minute, respectively). Indeed, 88 and 81%, for Bush and Gore interviews, respectively, of all valence cues attributable to traditional news interviewers, journalists, or program hosts were critical of the interview subjects. The differences between positive and negative comments by journalists or interviewers are statistically significant (p < .01 and p < .03 for Gore and Bush interviews, respectively). In contrast, while E‐talk show hosts offered far fewer valence cues, all of those they did interject were supportive of the candidate being interviewed. Not surprisingly, the stark differences between the propensity of entertainment and traditional political program hosts to criticize their interview subjects are highly significant (p < .001 and p < .01 for Gore and Bush interviews, respectively).               "
"54","The picture is similar for national news campaign reports. Overall, 80% of all valence cues attributable to anchors or reporters during national news campaign coverage (excluding candidate interviews) were critical of the candidate(s) featured in the story. Once again, the difference in frequency of positive and negative valence cues is highly significant (p < .0001). In contrast, the relatively rare positive comments by national newscast anchors or reporters were nearly evenly divided between the candidates (.47 vs. .53 for Bush and Gore, respectively). This latter difference is statistically insignificant. Taken together, these results support Hypothesis 2."
"55","Hypothesis 3 predicts that E‐talk show interviews will offer less emphasis on substantive issues or comparisons of candidate issue positions than traditional political talk show programs or national news campaign coverage. The columns in Table 1 labeled “Issue Cues” and “Issue Mentions,” respectively, measure the frequency of comparisons of candidates' respective issue positions and the frequency of mentions of substantive policy issues in which no comparison with the opposition candidate is drawn. (Issue mentions are presumably of less heuristic value to voters than issue cues, since they do not distinguish between the candidates.) Finally, the column labeled “ Valence Cues” measures the frequency of statements supportive or critical of either candidate.               "
"56","E‐talk shows presented an average of .65 issue cues, .23 issue mentions, and .19 valence cues per‐minute during their candidate interviews. The corresponding figures for interviews on traditional news and political interview programs were 1.78, .74, and .80 issue cues, issue mentions and valence cues per‐minute, respectively. National newscasts, in turn, presented an average of 2.25, .31, and 1.29 issue cues, issue mentions, and valence cues per‐minute, respectively. Hence, relative to E‐talk shows, traditional news interviews offered about three times more issue cues and issue mentions and over four times more valence cues, per minute. And national news reports offered about 3.5 times more issue cues, more than one‐third more issue mentions, and nearly seven times more valence cues than E‐talk show candidate interviews. For both issue and valence cues, the gaps between E‐talk shows and traditional news programs (both interview shows and national news stories) are statistically significant at the .001 level or better. With respect to issue mentions, the difference between E and political talk shows is significant at the .01 level, while that between E‐talk shows and national news reports is insignificant. It appears in these data that national news reports nearly always compare and contrast candidate issue positions, rather than noting them in isolation from one another. E‐talk shows, in contrast, simply do not make frequent mention of substantive policy issues, with or without comparisons to the positions of the opposition candidate. These results support Hypothesis 3."
"57","The findings presented thus far are based on data from both daytime and late‐night E‐talk shows. Due, however, to limitations in available questions, the analyses that follow employ as the key causal variable a question concerning exposure to only daytime E‐talk shows. Yet a series of t‐tests revealed that across all 22 categories of political content I investigated in my content analyses, not one substantial or statistically significant difference emerged between daytime and late‐night talk shows. Hence, including both in my content analyses does not bias my substantive findings. Moreover, the audiences for daytime and late‐night talk shows share several key demographic similarities. The median viewer for both program formats is a relatively young (age 18–34), liberal, female, with only limited political interest or knowledge (Hamilton 2003; Pew Center 2000 and 2002). Hence, for my purposes, the differences in audiences for daytime and late‐night talk shows are less important than a key characteristic they share in common: relatively low political awareness.               "
"58","How E‐Talk Shows Influenced Voters in 2000 I now turn to the effects of watching daytime talk shows and national network newscasts on individual attitudes and voting behavior (Hypotheses 4–9). Table 3 presents the results from four OLS and two unordered multinomial logit analyses. The first three models exclude all control variables. These are intended to determine whether any of the results reported below are artifacts of model specification. In fact, most of the key coefficients in the stripped‐down models, though, as one would expect, not identical to the fully specified models, are nonetheless similar. Hence, we can proceed more confidently to the fully specified models. The fourth and fifth models investigate the effects of talk show and national network news consumption on the candidates' likeability, while the sixth replicates the analysis with vote choice as the dependent variable.               "
"59"," Table 4 summarizes the predicted effects of media exposure on Democratic and Republican respondents' likeability ratios and propensities to vote for the two major party candidates. For ease of interpretation I employ a simulation technique developed by King, Tomz, and Wittenberg (2000) to transform the results from the likeability models into linear form and those from the voting models into probabilities, as well as to estimate the statistical significance of the predicted effects. I separately present—for both respondents' fellow partisan candidate and the opposition party candidate—the effects of a maximum increase in exposure to daytime talk shows (from 0 to 3+ talk shows in the past week) and network newscasts (from 0 to 7 days in the past week) as respondents' political awareness varies by one standard deviation, centered at the mean.12"
"60","Hypotheses 4 and 6 predict that exposure to traditional news will have only modest effects on highly politically aware individuals. They further predict that any such effects will modestly reinforce these individuals' partisan predispositions. Beginning with highly aware Democrats, Table 4 indicates that a maximum increase in national network news watching is associated with a statistically insignificant 13 percentage point increase in likeability for Gore (on the 0–1 scale) and a smaller and statistically insignificant 3 percentage point decrease in likeability for Bush. Among these same respondents, a maximum increase in network news watching is associated with a substantively small and statistically insignificant 5 percentage point increase in the probability of voting for Gore and an equivalent decrease in the probability of voting for Bush.               "
"61","Among highly aware Republicans, a maximum increase in national news watching is associated with a statistically insignificant 2 percentage point decrease in likeability for Gore and a much larger 27 percentage point increase for Bush (p < .10). In this case, a comparable increase in national news watching is associated with a statistically insignificant 1 percentage point decrease in the probability of voting for Gore and an identical—in magnitude and insignificance—increase in the probability of voting for Bush.               "
"62","Overall, across all eight possible cases (i.e., Republicans' and Democrats' likeability ratings of, and decisions to vote for, Gore or Bush), and consistent with Hypotheses 4 and 6, as highly aware individuals consume more national news, their propensity to support their own party's candidate increases. Yet, also consistent with my hypotheses, most of these increases are modest, and they approach standard levels of statistical significance in only one of eight instances."
"63","Hypotheses 5 and 7 predict that among low‐awareness individuals, consuming traditional news programming will be associated with smaller effects than consuming E‐talk shows. To evaluate these hypotheses, it is therefore necessary to compare the effects across these two media. Beginning with traditional news, among low‐awareness Democrats, a maximum increase in national network news watching is associated with a statistically insignificant 18 percentage point decrease in likeability for Gore. With respect to Bush, in turn, variations in network news watching have no effect whatsoever on likeability. Turning to vote choice, the corresponding effects are a statistically insignificant 4 percentage point increase in the probability of voting for Gore and an identical—in magnitude and insignificance—decrease in the probability of voting for Bush.               "
"64","Among low‐awareness Republicans, a maximum increase in national network news watching is associated with somewhat larger, though still statistically insignificant, 15 and 5 percentage point decreases, respectively, in likeability for Gore and Bush (though the decrease for Gore is nearly significant at p < .15). The corresponding effects on voting behavior are a statistically insignificant 8 percentage point decrease in the probability of voting for Gore and an identical—again in both magnitude and insignificance—increase in the probability of voting for Bush.               "
"65","Turning to the effects of watching daytime talk shows on low‐awareness individuals, among Democrats, a maximum increase in talk show viewing is associated with a statistically insignificant 18 percentage point decrease in likeability for Gore, and a 15 percentage point increase in likeability for Bush (p < .10). With respect to vote choice, the corresponding increase in talk show viewing is associated with a 16 percentage point decrease in the probability of voting for Gore (p < .15) and an 18 percentage point increase in the probability of voting for Bush (p < .05).               "
"66","Finally, among low‐awareness Republicans, a maximum increase in E‐talk show viewing is associated with a 29 percentage point increase in likeability for Gore (p < .05) and a 21 percentage point decrease in likeability for Bush (insig). With respect to vote choice, the corresponding effects are an impressive 63 percentage point increase in the probability of voting for Gore (p < .01) and a similarly large 56 percentage point decrease in the probability of voting for Bush (p < .01).               "
"67","These results support Hypotheses 5 and 7. The effects of daytime talk show viewing on low‐awareness Republicans' attitudes toward Gore, and their Democratic counterparts' attitudes toward Bush, as well as on the same individuals' propensities to vote for the opposition party candidate, are larger and more significant than the corresponding effects associated with watching national network news. They also offer strong support for Hypotheses 8 and 9, as the strongest effects of watching daytime talk shows emerge among the least politically aware respondents, who are most dependent on such programs for their political information. As predicted, among low‐awareness individuals, increased talk show viewing is associated with a substantial and statistically significant (or nearly so) increase in both likeability ratings and in the probability of voting for the opposition party candidate. The corresponding effects among highly aware respondents are both substantively smaller and run in the opposite direction, consistent with partisan predispositions. To the extent that talk shows matter at all for highly aware respondents, selective acceptance appears to indeed produce the hypothesized reinforcement effect, raising the probability of supporting their fellow partisan candidate.13"
"68","Interestingly, in most instances the reinforcement effect among political sophisticates appears to be stronger for likeability than for vote choice. This may be attributable, at least in part, to the aforementioned post‐hoc rationalization phenomenon, which, as noted, Rahn, Krosnik, and Breuning (1994) found to be most prevalent among political sophisticates. Also most likely contributing to this difference is a ceiling effect (Wright 1993). Fully 90% of highly aware Democrats and 93% of their Republican counterparts indicated that they planned to vote for their fellow partisan candidate. This compares to somewhat less stratospheric average likeability ratios for fellow partisan candidates of about .75 and .82 (on the 0–1 scale), respectively, among highly aware Democrats and Republicans. Hence, there is simply more room for highly aware partisans to raise their estimate of their fellow partisan candidate's likeability than there is for them to alter their vote choice in his favor.               "
"69","Conversely, among low‐awareness respondents, many of the counterpartisan effects are larger for vote choice. This may be attributable to their relatively weakly held partisan preferences. Because these individuals presumably lie closer to the point of ambivalence regarding the candidates, relatively small changes in likeability may be sufficient to alter their vote choice. These patterns are illustrated in Figure 1. The four graphics separately plot the effects of E‐talk show exposure on likeability and vote choice among low‐ and high‐awareness Democratic and Republican identifiers.               "
"70","                 Likeability Ratio* and Probability of Voting for Gore or Bush, as Political Awareness and Daytime Talk Show Exposure Vary                            "
"71","*Plotted values represent linear transformations of dependent variable (not bounded between zero and one)."
"72","A Few Words on Possible Selection Effects It remains possible that my talk show exposure indicator is capturing some internal characteristic of viewers having little to do with their exposure to campaign information. For instance, as noted, compared to nonviewers, typical daytime talk show viewers tend to be less politically engaged, and—presumably as a consequence—to hold weaker preferences over political candidates. Yet my models explicitly control for political awareness, strength of preferences over the candidates, and various other related factors. Indeed, if we compare only low‐awareness talk show viewers—the group that exhibited the strongest effects—to low‐awareness nonviewers, the former group is actually somewhat more likely to hold strong candidate preferences and to care about the election outcome. Hence, it seems improbable that a residual greater willingness to cross party lines among low‐awareness talk show viewers is driving these relationships.               "
"73","This latter pattern, however, raises the possibility that a disproportionate number of individuals who were interested in the election but undecided about the candidates, and who typically do not watch daytime talk shows, elected to tune in to one or two such shows explicitly to help resolve their ambivalence. If so, we would expect that during weeks in which the candidates appeared on daytime talk shows, the audiences for such shows would be at least somewhat different than in periods in which the candidates made no appearances. In particular, one would expect that candidate‐attracted audience members might be more politically aware and involved—after all, in this scenario they would have gone out of there way to expose themselves to campaign information—but less strongly committed to their fellow partisan candidate.               "
"74","Given that the daytime talk show question asks respondents to recall their viewing behavior during the week prior to their ANES interview, it is possible to test this possibility directly. The maximum number of candidate appearances on daytime talk shows in any single week was two. Hence, respondents who reported watching more than two such shows during the prior week could not have done so exclusively to see presidential candidates. To determine whether candidate‐seeking, occasional viewers differed materially from regular talk show viewers, I divided talk show viewers into four subgroups, based upon whether: (1) they reported watching 1 or 2 versus 3 or more daytime talk shows in the prior week, and (2) their interviews took place within seven days of a candidate appearance on a daytime talk show. For each subgroup, I calculated averages for five factors: (1) political awareness, (2) strength of partisanship, (3) campaign participation, (4) probability of having “strong” candidate preferences, and (5) probability of caring about the election outcome. The results (not shown) indicate that there are no statistically significant differences for any of these five factors regardless of frequency of talk show viewing or timing of the interview.               "
"75","Of course, meaningful differences might still emerge among partisan subgroups. In fact, the unusually high ratings for these shows during candidate appearances suggest that at least some self‐selection most likely took place. For instance, Figure 1 indicates that low‐awareness Republicans were far more willing than their Democratic counterparts to reevaluate the opposition candidate. This could simply imply that Gore outperformed Bush in these venues. In fact, some evidence supports this conjecture. Among independents below the mean level of political awareness—the group least likely to report strong candidate preferences—a maximum increase in talk show consumption was associated with a 26 percentage point increase in the probability of voting for Gore (p < .05), and an identical decrease in the probability of voting for Bush (p < .05).               "
"76","Yet, a more effective performance by Gore most likely accounts for only part of this partisan differential. Among daytime talk show viewers interviewed within seven days of a candidate talk show appearance, Republicans were 10 percentage points less likely than Democrats to indicate that they held “strong” candidate preferences. Moreover, while Democrats' likelihood of reporting strong preferences did not vary with their interview timing, Republicans interviewed within a week of a candidate appearance were 14 percentage points less likely than their counterparts interviewed in other time periods to report strong preferences. This suggests that some of the pro‐Gore movement among Republicans may in fact be attributable to greater ex ante open‐mindedness among viewers attracted to talk shows by candidate appearances.               "
"77","Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that the effects of talk show consumption were also substantial and statistically significant among Democrats, whose strength of preferences did not vary according to the timing of their interviews. Moreover, the magnitude of the counterpartisan effects among low‐awareness Republicans substantially exceeds the inter‐ and intrapartisan gaps described above. Consequently, it seems highly improbable that internal differences between candidate‐seeking, occasional talk show viewers and their more‐frequent‐viewing counterparts can adequately account for the relationships identified in this study. Rather, one can adequately account for these relationships only by taking into account the effects of individual characteristics in interaction with variations in exposure to different varieties of campaign information.14"
"78","Important changes are underway in the conduct of national presidential campaigns. Simply stated, if America's political leaders wish to communicate with members of the public who are not predisposed to seek out political information, they must put the information where these potential voters are likely to notice it. In part, this involves tailoring political messages to the sensibilities of E‐talk show audiences. In 2000, the major presidential candidates appear to have begun to learn this lesson. Many Americans who might otherwise have ignored the presidential campaign entirely were, as a result of candidate appearances on a variety of E‐talk shows, exposed to at least some information about the candidates prior to the election. Moreover, as my content analyses clearly demonstrated, Americans who relied on E‐talk shows for news about the campaign received substantially different information than their counterparts who tuned in to more traditional sources of election news.         "
"79","My findings do not, of course, imply that E‐talk show hosts never ask serious questions. For instance, on October 20, 2000, David Letterman greeted George W. Bush with a litany of questions on public policy issues. Yet Letterman's relatively tough questioning, while the norm for traditional news outlets, was so unusual for an E‐talk show that it became the primary headline in news stories about Bush's appearance. Nevertheless, in the opinions of my content coders, none of Letterman's questions were sufficiently pointed to constitute criticism of Governor Bush.         "
"80","By most accounts (e.g., Weiss 2003), in turn, Letterman is the toughest of E‐talk show interviewers. For instance, when Democratic presidential aspirant General Wesley Clark appeared on the show on November 20, 2003, “Letterman wanted to know about bullet wounds, the Kosovo campaign, rebuilding Iraq. He resurrected some of Clark's early campaign woes. He barely cracked a smile” (Weiss 2003). Yet, Weiss also conceded “ … this was not, on balance, the world's toughest grilling. Letterman … asked mostly friendly questions, and gave Clark a free pass on broad assertions. All in all, it was a triumph of sorts for the Clark campaign, the equivalent of a very long biographical ad.” This suggests, consistent with my findings, that the contrast between even the toughest of E‐talk show interviews and typical traditional political interviews is stark.         "
"81","My statistical investigations, in turn, showed that these differences mattered for voter attitudes toward the candidates, and at the ballot box. Politically unaware Americans who watched daytime talk shows considered the opposition party candidate more likeable, and consequently were much more likely to cross party lines, than their counterparts who did not. These effects diminished as respondents' political awareness increased. Presumably, exposure to E‐talk shows matters little for Americans who find politics intrinsically engaging. In contrast, exposure to traditional news programming mattered far less than daytime talk show viewing for low‐awareness respondents. Finally, as anticipated, traditional news programming had little effect on highly aware respondents, though, to the extent such exposure mattered at all for these individuals, it tended to reinforce their preexisting partisan leanings."
"82","These latter findings are consistent with the prevailing wisdom in the media effects literature, which Iyengar and Simon characterize as follows: “ … decades of academic research into the effects of media‐based political campaigns purports to demonstrate that exposure to campaigns mainly reinforces voters' preexisting partisan loyalties. Political scientists still routinely attribute electoral outcomes to structural variables … giving short shrift to the specifics of day‐to‐day campaign events” (2000, 150). While, like prior media effects research, my theory only partially unpacks the psychological processes intervening between information consumption and vote choice, it does hold potentially important implications for future scholarship in this area. In particular, my findings suggest that one reason for the relative dearth of evidence of media effects on campaign outcomes is that scholars have defined the relevant media too narrowly and have underemphasized a potentially important segment of the public. The most common mechanisms by which voters are purportedly able to resist dissonant media messages—such as selective reception, attention and retention (Campbell et al. 1960)—may simply be less applicable to E‐talk shows, at least for low‐awareness voters.         "
"83","These results should be of particular interest to future presidential hopefuls and their campaign advisors, as the mostly apolitical audiences of E‐talk shows represent a large, and traditionally mostly ignored, pool of relatively persuadable potential voters. As discussed, politically aware individuals—a key audience for traditional news outlets—tend to counterargue information inconsistent with their preexisting preferences. This implies that appeals by presidential candidates are unlikely to change the minds of most political news enthusiasts. In sharp contrast, even though they are somewhat less likely to vote, those E‐talk show viewers who do vote are far more prone to be persuaded by properly tailored candidate appeals. Hence, future presidential candidates would be wise to devote a greater proportion of their campaign efforts to appealing to this hitherto largely discounted portion of the electorate."
"84","This lesson has apparently not been lost on recent candidates for political office. During the 2004 presidential primaries, for instance, most of the Democratic candidates appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman, or The Daily Show. During the general election campaign, in turn, the Bush and Kerry campaigns each devoted substantial resources, in the form of advertising dollars, to reaching E‐talk show audiences. According to a report by The University of Wisconsin Advertising Project (Ruttenberg 2004), between March 3 and June 20, 2004, of the 10 TV programs where the Bush and Kerry campaigns placed the most campaign ads, three and four, respectively, were E‐talk shows. These included, for both candidates, Live with Regis and Kelly, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and TheDr. Phil Show as well as, for Bush, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Bush and/or Kerry also made personal appearances on most of these same shows, as well as on The Late Show with David Letterman and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.         "
"85","This trend has even trickled down to state level politics, with California Gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show (on 9/15/03), apparently in order to shore up his support among women. Two days later, TheNew York Times editorialized: “Oprah Winfrey did Arnold Schwarzenegger a big favor … when she had him on her show. Now she needs to do the voters a favor, and extend an invitation to the other top candidates in the California governor's race. For anyone selling a book or a movie—or a political candidacy—‘The Oprah Winfrey Show’ is a coveted outlet. It is viewed by a large number of women, many of whom have great respect for Ms. Winfrey's opinions.”         "
"86","For better or worse, millions of voters make their decisions about candidates based on personal characteristics—the predominant emphasis of E‐talk shows—rather than public policy issues. Indeed, focus groups during the 2000 presidential election found, consistent with my evidence, that candidate appearances on E‐talk shows like The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Oprah WinfreyShow weighed heavily in the minds of many voters as they contemplated their vote choice (Decker 2000). The steady increase in E‐talk show coverage of national politics over the past several presidential election cycles strongly suggests that, for better or worse, this particular blend of politics and entertainment is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. The evidence presented in this study further suggests that this trend may be of significant consequence for American politics.         "
