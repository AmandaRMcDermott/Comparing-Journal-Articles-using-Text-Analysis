"1","Three premises underlie our argument about expressive voting during times of war. Central to each premise is the role of attitudes, since attitudes are the foundation of expressive voting. First, people must hold meaningful attitudes about a conflict, and second, those attitudes, if we are correct, must be responsive to information about combat casualties. Finally, we assume that attitudes about conflict affect political behavior. Taken together, these premises, all well supported in the literature, compose the three pillars of our argument about the role of expressive factors in shaping turnout.1"
"2","In order for casualties to affect turnout, attitudes about international conflict must be meaningfully held. Early studies of foreign policy opinion offered a dour assessment of public opinion (Almond 1950; Lippman 1955). However, the scholarly consensus on the nature of war attitudes began to shift with research on the Vietnam War (see Aldrich et al. 2006). Verba et al. (1967) found that the public was relatively well informed about the Vietnam War and that although lacking ideological or partisan dimensions, foreign policy attitudes were coherent and similar to members of Congress. Yet, it was not until Hurwitz and Peffley (1987) that scholars recognized the public held meaningful foreign policy attitudes organized by broader values including ethnocentrism and the morality of warfare. In recent years, at least in the United States, attitudes toward war have also taken on strong partisan dimensions (Jacobson 2007; Lewis‐Beck et al. 2008), mirroring a broader pattern of partisan attitude polarization in the mass public (Druckman, Peterson, and Slothus 2013; Heit and Nicholson 2010; Levendusky 2009; Nicholson 2012). For example, Lewis‐Beck and colleagues (2008) show that in stark comparison to the 1950s, foreign policy attitudes (e.g., support for the Iraq War) are now clearly structured by ideology and political party.         "
"3","In order for combat casualties to affect turnout, casualties must also inform war attitudes. Mueller (1973) examined this question for the Vietnam and Korean wars and found that support for these conflicts was inversely related to the log of casualties. Mueller (1973) also found that the effect varied over the course of the war: Casualties that occurred early in a conflict mattered more than casualties that happened toward the end. Gartner and Segura (1998), however, found that public opinion responded to unlogged casualties throughout the course of a war. This amendment to Mueller (1973) shows that public opinion responds directly to casualty information. Other studies have shown that under certain conditions, the public is casualty sensitive, but the effect varies greatly. Gelpi, Feaver, and Reifler (2009) show that public perceptions of success and the “moral rightness” of conflict can either mitigate or exacerbate the role that casualties play in attitudes toward war. Others have found that the effect of casualties on war support varies according to casualty trends (Gartner 2008a), framing of the war's costs (Boettcher and Cobb 2009), inequalities in the composition of casualties (Kriner and Shen 2014), and elite cues (Berinsky 2009; Zaller 1992).2Geographical and temporal proximity to casualties, factors that we explore in our analyses, also affect war support (Althaus, Bramlett, and Gimpel 2012; Davenport 2015; Gartner and Segura 1998). By increasing the salience of casualties, recent information about casualties that happen close to home has a greater effect than being informed about those that are temporally and spatially distant. While the causal mechanism may vary, taken as a whole these studies demonstrate that casualties affect public opinion on conflict.         "
"4","The relationship between war attitudes and political behavior is the third, and final, premise underlying our argument. The general question of whether attitudes affect behavior is conditional: “The strength of an attitude‐behavior relationship depends in large part on the degree of correspondence between attitudinal and behavioral entities” (Ajzen and Fishbein 1977). According to Ajzen and Fishbein (1977), the correspondence between attitude and behavior is strong in few circumstances. However, they single out voting as one of the few instances of high correspondence since the behavior—voting—“is little more than an evaluation of the target” (Ajzen and Fishbein 1977, 891), and it has long been established that attitudes about candidates affect voting behavior (Campbell et al. 1960; Lewis‐Beck et al. 2008).         "
"5","Early studies found little to no relationship between foreign policy attitudes and vote choice (see Aldrich et al. 2006). According to Aldrich and colleagues (2006, 488), the bipartisan consensus on foreign policy until 1972 provided limited opportunities. However, since the early 1970s, political elites have expressed greater disagreement, expanding the opportunity for the public to evaluate candidates on the basis of foreign policy differences. Following elite differences in foreign policy since the 1970s, scholars have found foreign policy attitudes to affect evaluations of political leaders and vote choice (Aldrich et al. 2006; Aldrich, Sullivan, and Borgida 1989; Gadarian 2010; Jacobson 2007; Koch 2011; Lewis‐Beck et al. 2008; Page and Brody 1972; Williams, Brule, and Koch 2010).         "
"6","Although scholars have devoted considerable attention to war and vote choice, much less research has focused on voter participation. Some studies have examined turnout in the context of a single conflict or country (Davenport 2015; Karol and Miguel 2007; Kriner and Shen 2010), but to our knowledge no research has examined the effect of casualties on turnout cross‐nationally in established democracies.         "
"7","Leighley (1995) identifies three approaches to the study of turnout: the socioeconomic status model, the mobilization model, and the rational choice model. The socioeconomic status model emphasizes individual characteristics (e.g., resources such as time and money), and the mobilization model stresses the role of political organizations (e.g., get‐out‐the‐vote efforts). The third approach, rational choice, involves the costs and benefits of voting. The cost‐benefit approach of rational choice models informs most socioeconomic and mobilization models since both, implicitly or explicitly, incorporate the costs of voting. For example, in the socioeconomic status model people with more time and money are better able to pay the costs of political participation (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). In mobilization models, political organizations decrease the costs of voting by registering people to vote (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993). In this way, most studies of voter turnout, at least implicitly, emphasize instrumental factors.         "
"8","The benefits of voting also matter in rational choice models, but they have received far less attention because they are, as an empirical matter, nearly zero in large elections. Building on Downs (1957), Riker and Ordeshook's (1968) “calculus of voting” defines the benefits of voting as the difference in benefits voters receive from the election of their preferred candidate over competitors. However, the benefits are typically very small (nearly zero) because they are multiplied by the probability that the voter casts the decisive vote. No matter how large the benefits of voting, then, the very low probability of casting a decisive vote greatly diminishes the benefits. Thus, even minimal costs typically exceed benefits, making it irrational to vote.         "
"9","The rational choice model has contributed a great deal to the study of turnout by highlighting the costs of voting. Yet, it offers a theory that predicts few, if any, people will vote. Since many people do in fact vote, Fiorina (1990, 334) has suggested that voter turnout is “the paradox that ate rational choice theory.” Downs (1957) had recognized this paradox by including the “D” term, the value a person attaches to maintaining democracy. Riker and Ordeshook (1968) redefined the “D” term as citizen duty, a more expansive category capturing the expressive value of voting. Although expressive factors are not instrumental (and therefore not rational), including them provides a more potent empirical account of the decision to go to the polls. Indeed, Fiorina (1976, 410) concludes that “expressive factors probably dominate instrumental factors as an explanation of turnout.”         "
"10","Perhaps no other type of political event offers as much opportunity for expressive factors to affect the decision to vote than war. Scholars have argued that casualties figure prominently in evaluations of war policy (Gartner 2008a; Gartner and Segura 2000; Mueller 1973), but unanswered is why? What makes casualties, above all else, capture public attention? A promising answer to this question is the mortality salience hypothesis, the proposition from social psychology that death‐related cognitions increase group identification or worldview defense (Arndt et al. 1997). A primary focus of this research examines whether mortality salience increases worldview defense, the “vigorous agreement with and affection for those who uphold or share our beliefs (or are similar to us) and equally vigorous hostility and disdain for those who challenge our beliefs (i.e., are different from us)” (Solomon, Greenberg, and Pyszczynski 2004, 23). Although experiments often involve participants considering their own death, mortality salience effects have been found using a variety of stimuli, including gory footage of auto accidents and proximity to a funeral home (Nelson et al. 1997; Pyszczynski et al. 1996). Furthermore, alternative explanations for the mortality salience effect have been ruled out using myriad negative, anxiety‐inducing events (Pyszczynski, Solomon, and Greenberg 2002, 48–49).         "
"11","Of particular relevance to politics is research demonstrating the effect of mortality salience on ingroup identification (e.g., Arndt, Greenberg, and Cook 2002; McGregor et al. 1998). In a particularly creative study, McGregor et al. (1998) found that mortality salience increased physical aggression toward those who attacked a participant's ideology. After reading an essay that was highly critical of their ideology, participants who had received a mortality salience treatment were significantly more likely to be physically aggressive (they allocated a larger serving of hot sauce to a critic who they were told did not like spicy foods) toward the author of the essay. Although the mortality salience hypothesis offers a novel perspective on how casualties affect public thinking about war, prior research yields results consistent with this approach (e.g., Mueller 1973). In particular, Gartner's (2011) research on war images (death related) shows that war support diminishes when participants are provided with pictures that unambiguously depict military loss as compared to pictures that depict militarism. This finding is consistent with research on mortality salience because despite that Democrats responded to images of combat deaths with greater opposition, Republicans responded with greater support for the war, suggesting that the death‐related images invoked worldview defense. In sum, both liberals and conservatives were more likely to behave aggressively toward those who threatened their worldview if they had been reminded of death.         "
"12","By calling to mind thoughts and feelings related to death, casualties may increase the expressive benefit of voting for ingroup candidates. Not all wars, of course, offer a clear choice of hawk or dove candidates. For example, although the Iraq War presented relatively clear choices for U.S. voters in 2008, there was no clear anti‐ or pro‐war candidate in the 1968 U.S. presidential election during the Vietnam War. Although rational actor accounts would predict that the benefit of voting for president in the 1968 election—at least on the basis of the war—would be relatively small since the candidate differential was approximately zero, research on mortality salience suggests otherwise because death‐related information may also increase nationalism, a type of worldview defense that is especially relevant for our purposes. For example, Greenberg et al. (1994) found that priming death increased American participants’ favorable evaluations of essays that praised the United States. Similarly, mortality salience has also been found to increase resistance to the harming of cherished cultural icons such as the American flag (Greenberg et al. 1995). In summarizing their research on the attitudinal and behavioral consequences of 9/11, Pyszczynski, Solomon, and Greenberg concluded that “one of the most consistent findings from our research has been that reminding Americans of their mortality increases the positivity of their reactions to anyone or anything that praises America and the negativity of their reactions to anyone or anything that criticizes America” (2002, 9).         "
"13","In sum, casualties are the most salient and visible aspect of war, invoking death‐related cognitions that heighten group identities, both partisan and nationalistic. For these reasons, we expect casualties to increase the expressive benefits of voting by activating worldview defense. Accordingly, all else equal, we expect higher levels of casualties to increase voter turnout (Hypothesis 1). In the aggregate‐level analysis, we expect an increase in casualties to have a positive effect on turnout cross‐nationally. In the individual‐level analyses, we expect to find that the effect varies across space, time, and individuals. Not surprisingly, some communities experience much greater casualty losses than others, and this difference affects support for war (Althuas, Bramlett, and Gimpel 2012; Gartner 2008b; Gartner, Segura, and Wilkening 1997; Kriner and Shen 2010). While the “proximate casualties hypothesis” predicts that casualties from nearby communities will have a greater effect on war support than national casualties, we extend this logic to voter participation, predicting that geographically proximate casualties will have a greater effect on turnout than national casualties (Hypothesis 2). In addition, we expect casualties to have a greater effect the closer they happen in time to an election. In the literature on war support, some scholars have found that the effect of casualties is fleeting, decaying rapidly over a few weeks (Althuas, Bramlett, and Gimpel 2012; Hayes and Myers 2009), whereas others have found that the effect may persist for a few months (Gartner, Segura, and Wilkening 1997). Given the discrepant findings, we examine two rival hypotheses about recent and accumulated casualties. For the recent casualties hypothesis, we expect casualties that occurred within a month of the election to have a greater effect on turnout than the number of casualties that occur in between elections (Hypothesis 3). On the other hand, the accumulated casualties hypothesis holds that the total number of casualties will have a greater effect on turnout than recent casualties (Hypothesis 4).         "
"14","Lastly, we investigate who is most likely to be affected by casualties. Although some people are keenly interested in politics, most people are not (Converse 1964). Public interest in politics matters because it is an important antecedent to political engagement and voting (Prior 2005; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). Despite their efforts to avoid politics, some political events, especially those that invoke death, are likely to saturate the public conscience, catching the attention of even the least politically engaged. Aggregate awareness levels in elections, for example, can vary considerably across political information environments (Nicholson 2003), suggesting that even the least politically interested sometimes cannot hide from politics. We expect casualties, especially those that happen locally, to increase the probability of voting among respondents with minimal political interest (Hypothesis 5). To be sure, casualties are likely to have an effect on citizens with a strong interest in politics (e.g., more discussions about politics) as well. Nevertheless, the politically interested are already likely to vote, so we expect casualties to increase voter participation among those least interested in politics, given the deep, affectively charged effect of death‐related information.         "
"15","Our statistical analyses examine whether and how casualties affect turnout at the aggregate and individual levels. The aggregate‐level analysis examines whether casualties affect turnout cross‐nationally across 23 established democracies, whereas the individual‐level analyses examine whether local casualties from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars shape the decision to vote in the United Kingdom and the United States."
"16","At the aggregate level of analysis, research highlights three factors that affect turnout: socioeconomic, institutional, and political. For the most part, socioeconomic factors, like population size or urban versus rural population, vary little over time, as do most institutional factors, such as proportional representation or presidentialism. While these more or less static factors have been important for explaining cross‐national variation in turnout (Jackman 1987), they do less well in explaining changes in turnout across time, from one election to another, within specific countries. However, variables that are typically associated with political outcomes often differ from one election to another and should be accounted for (Blais 2006).            "
"17","To test our hypotheses, we examine how the number of cumulative casualties within an election cycle affects voter turnout.3In so doing, we analyze 23 democracies listed in Table 1 between 1951 and 2005, with the unit of analysis being the election.4 Rather than specifying a laundry list of country‐specific factors, we use a panel‐estimated approach including country dummy variables with panel‐corrected standard errors. The country dummies capture the slow‐changing or static variations between countries that may affect voter turnout. We use this modeling strategy because standard regression models assume fixed intercepts across states and uncorrelated error terms, making these models inadequate for analyzing cross‐sectional data.            "
"18","The dependent variable, Voter Turnout, is the percentage of eligible citizens who voted in the election according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. We focus only on national elections in which the incumbent national government was at risk. The key explanatory variable, Casualties, is the total number of logged casualties incurred by the state during the election cycle.5We employ a logged measure because of the substantive difference, for example, between the first 25 casualties and the 4,000th and 4,025th casualties (see Gartner and Segura 1998; Mueller 1973). To be coded as a conflict, there must be at least 25 total battle deaths from any of the participants. The 25‐casualty threshold helps to avoid many of the minor conflicts or disputes that show up in the militarized interstate dispute data (e.g., fishing disputes between the United States and Canada).6Although the key independent variable is logged cumulative casualties, some conflict participants may not incur any casualties. Therefore, we control for Total Conflicts, the number of conflicts a country was involved in during the election cycle. We use the Uppsala Conflict Data Program/International Peace Research Institute (UCDP/PRIO) Armed Conflict Dataset V4 to identify conflicts and determine the number of casualties (Gleditsch et al. 2002) because it includes both interstate and extra‐state conflicts, such as colonial wars of independence.            "
"19","Since cumulative casualties are likely to be correlated with time, we also account for conflict duration. Gartner and Segura (1998) argue that by controlling for duration, logged casualties should be insignificant if the casualty measure is simply capturing duration and its consequences. If the casualty measure retains significance, it implies that casualties, not conflict duration, are producing the results. In addition, longer wars may have different effects than shorter conflicts due to fatigue and war weariness (Blainey 1988). For the variable Conflict Duration, we use the average duration of conflicts in the election cycle, measured in months. If a conflict is still under way during an election, we calculate the months from the onset of the conflict to the election.            "
"20","Several control variables not accounted for by the country dummy variables are also included in the analyses. Disproportionality measures the degree to which the electoral system promotes a one‐to‐one translation of votes to seats. Greater disproportionality is likely to reduce turnout, as it suggests to voters that their vote is less likely to count.7Turnout in electoral systems where elections are called is likely to decline when relatively early elections are called, as people become weary of voting or no longer believe that voting matters. To account for the time left until the next mandated election, we include a measure of the constitutional inter‐election period (CIEP). We also include measures that account for the tenure of the executive to capture the “costs of governing” (Whitten and Palmer 1999) and presidential systems (versus parliamentary; Tavits 2009), both factors that reduce turnout. Lastly, we control for economic conditions by including measures of inflation and unemployment. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 of the supporting information.            "
"21","Table 2 presents the results of the cross‐national analysis. The R‐squared is .87, suggesting a good fit in terms of the overall model. As predicted, the results from Model 1 suggest that as casualties increase, turnout increases. A one‐unit increase in the inter‐election casualties measure increases turnout by about .34%. Substantively, this means that moving from an election cycle with zero casualties to one where 500 casualties occurred would increase turnout by nearly 2%. At the same time, the number of conflicts decreases turnout .84%. Each new conflict demobilizes the electorate by slightly less than 1%. The point at which casualties erase the negative effect of involvement in a conflict is 300 casualties, a threshold that Australia, France, Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom all breach during the years included in the analysis.8"
"22","Although this result may seem peculiar, it is consistent with prior research (Jentleson and Britton 1998; Williams, Brule, and Koch 2010). For example, conflicts can lead to public alienation, feeding voter abstention. The Kosovo conflict is a good example. The NATO–U.S.‐led bombing campaign of Shock and Awe began in March 1999 with the promise to quickly end the conflict. It lasted through June and only ended once the Russians withdrew their support of Serbian forces (Cook 1999). The proportion of Americans who claimed they followed news about the air strikes “very closely” fell from 43% in March to 32% by May (Pew 1999). Under these conditions, it is possible that the public becomes alienated toward government rather than motivated to participate in the political process.            "
"23","Another explanation is that conflict initially silences the opposition (see Allen et al. 1994; Berinsky 2004, chap. 5), but as casualties increase, the opposition is emboldened, producing higher turnout. Studies of vote choice during the Iraq War show that casualties helped Democratic presidential candidates (Hill, Heron, and Lewis 2010; Karol and Miguel 2007), a finding consistent with a mobilization effect. However, the mortality salience hypothesis predicts no difference between ideological or partisan groups since death‐related information produces worldview defense indiscriminately. To test whether casualties disproportionately mobilize opponents, we examined the vote share of all parties running for office and interacted parties out of government with casualties. The results, presented in Table 2 of the supporting information, show that casualties do not increase out‐of‐government party vote share, suggesting that the mobilizing effect of casualties is uniform across war opponents and supporters.            "
"24","Taken together, the results suggest that the effect of casualties on turnout is widespread. However, the aggregate nature of the data provides little insight into the behavior of individuals, the focus of the next set of analyses."
"25","To examine the individual‐level effects of casualties on turnout, we use survey data from the United States and the United Kingdom and combat casualty data from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The goal was to make the U.S. and U.K. analyses as similar as possible, though at times this proved difficult given the inevitable differences in surveys. We first present results from the U.S. analyses."
"26","Data for the U.S. analyses are from the 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies (CCES). The large sample sizes in the CCES surveys are ideal since we examine casualties at the county level. The dependent variable, Voter Turnout, is a dummy variable indicating whether an individual voted. Given the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable, we use random effects probit with the county as the unit of analysis to capture any long‐term factors that may be omitted.            "
"27","The key explanatory variable, Local Casualties, is the number of casualties in a county within an election period (casualties between the 2004 and 2006 elections, the 2006 and 2008 elections, etc.) based on data from the Department of Defense. As discussed, we expect the increase in turnout from casualties to happen among individuals with little or no interest in politics. To capture this distinction, we code Low Political Interest as 1 if the respondent pays little or no interest to politics and 0 otherwise. Since political interest is a highly stable trait (Prior 2010), we consider it an exogenous predictor of turnout.            "
"28","We control for both individual and contextual factors. In addition to standard demographics (e.g., education, age, race, sex, income), we control for strength of party identification, economic perceptions, presidential approval, and attitudes toward the Iraq War. At the county level, based on data from the U.S. Census, we control for unemployment, racial composition, median income (measured in thousands of dollars), and population size. Lastly, we account for the difference in turnout between presidential and midterm elections by including a dummy variable for the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. The coding of variables and descriptive statistics are found in the supporting information."
"29","Table 3 presents the random effects probit results for U.S. casualties and voter turnout in the 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 elections. Again, the expectation is that local casualties will mobilize the least politically interested. To this end, we created an interaction term between low political interest and casualties. As shown in Model 1 of Table 3, consistent with previous research on political interest, the main effect of low political interest is negative and significant, indicating that the least politically interested are unlikely to vote. Although the main effect of casualties is not statistically significant, the interaction term is positive and significant, indicating that the effect of casualties is conditional on political interest. As casualties increase, the probability of voting increases among the less politically interested.            "
"30","Figure 1 depicts the probability of voting for respondents low and high in political interest. When local casualties equal zero, the probability of a person with low political interest voting is almost .4, whereas the probability of voting for those with high political interest is above .8, a statistically significant difference. Across the range of casualties, the probability of voting increases for low‐interest respondents but remains relatively stable for high‐interest respondents. As casualties reach about 30, the probability of the least politically interested voting increases substantially, making them statistically indistinguishable from respondents with high political interest.            "
"31","Although we did not find aggregate‐level evidence that casualties disproportionately mobilize the opposition, the individual‐level analysis provides an opportunity to examine this argument since, at least in the U.S. case, previous research suggests that casualties reduced support for President Bush (Hill, Heron, and Lewis 2010; Karol and Miguel 2007).9Although these studies focused on vote choice rather than turnout, our results may help illuminate whether decreased support for Republican candidates was a product of increased mobilization. By including an interaction term for Party ID and Local Casualties, we offer a straightforward test of this prediction. The interaction term, however, was not statistically significant (see the supporting information). The result is consistent with the mortality salience hypothesis since it holds that death‐related information (i.e., combat casualties) would provoke worldview defense among both Democrats and Republicans.            "
"32","With the exception of presidential year and percent white, all the control variables are statistically significant and in the expected direction. In terms of demographics, education, income, age, gender, and marital status all significantly affect voter participation. Similarly, strong partisanship, economic evaluations, and presidential approval each have positive and significant effects on the probability of voting. At the county level, the higher the median income, the higher the probability an individual will vote, whereas the size of the county and county unemployment reduce turnout. On the other hand, low political interest, (individual‐level) unemployment, and believing the Iraq War was a mistake all decrease the probability of voting."
"33","We also examined the temporal proximity to casualties by looking at casualties that occurred 30 and 60 days prior to the election since previous research would suggest casualties have a greater effect the more proximate they are to the election. The results in Table 3 provide support for the hypothesis that casualties that occur within 30 days before an election increase the probability of voting, but the effects, once again, are conditional on political interest. Over the 60‐day period before an election, we find a similar relationship, albeit the coefficient for the interaction term is smaller in magnitude, suggesting that the effect of casualties is larger the closer they happen in time to the election.            "
"34","To illustrate the effect on turnout of casualties that happened within 30 days of an election, Figure 2 shows that recent casualties have a stronger independent effect on the probability of voting among low‐interest respondents. Holding all other values at their medians, Figure 2 shows that three local casualties within one month of an election increases the probability that a low‐interest respondent votes, making him or her indistinguishable from respondents with high political interest. Taken together, the results of the U.S. analyses suggest that casualties mobilize people who otherwise would likely not vote.            "
"35","The data for the United Kingdom come from the 2005 and 2010 British Election Panel Survey (BES). The dependent variable, Voting, is a 10‐point scale of how likely a respondent is to vote, ranging from 1 (extremely unlikely) to 10 (extremely likely). The key explanatory variable, Casualties, is based on data from the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) fact sheets on Iraq and Afghanistan.10We matched casualties to the 11 administrative regions in the BES data.11We then determined the number of casualties within each region from the start of the conflict to the 2005 election and then from the 2005 election to the 2010 election.            "
"36","As in the U.S. analyses, we also included a variable for political interest. The BES included an 11‐point scale that asked individuals how much attention they pay to politics, the item most similar to the political interest question from the CCES. This variable, Low Political Attention, equals 1 for respondents who chose “no attention” to “a little attention,” and zero for higher levels of attention. As before, we also include variables to account for demographic and political characteristics, including marital status, education, income, age, gender, race, strength of party identification, perceptions of the economy, war approval, and executive approval. We also include district‐level measures of unemployment, percent white, and income. Since the British study is panel data, some respondents are in both the 2005 and 2010 surveys. To account for the lack of independence, we employ a random effects model on each individual since these are not independent observations. Finally, because our dependent variable is a 10‐point scale, we use ordinary least squares and include dummy variables for each of the 11 districts to account for district‐level differences.            "
"37","Table 4 presents the results from the British data. As in the U.S. analysis, we test the effect of local casualties conditional on political attention by including an interaction term. Consistent with the U.S. analyses, the interaction effect between low attention and local casualties is statistically significant. Figure 3 depicts the effect of increasing casualties on voting by political attention. As casualties increase, low‐attention respondents become increasingly likely to vote, whereas voting among those who pay greater attention to politics is relatively insensitive to casualties. At approximately the 60‐casualty threshold, low‐attention respondents become statistically indistinguishable from those who pay greater attention.            "
"38","Among the control variables, the coefficients for sex, age, race, income, marital status, strong party identification, and approval of the prime minister are positive and statistically significant. However, in contrast to the U.S. model, several control variables are statistically insignificant. Notably, war approval and economic perceptions are not statistically significant. Furthermore, among the district control variables, only unemployment has a significant effect. We do not have an explanation for why the results differ in these respects."
"39","We find strong support for the hypothesis that higher casualties increase turnout, both at the aggregate and individual levels of analysis. Controlling for a variety of alternative explanations, the aggregate results demonstrate that the effect of casualties on voter turnout is pervasive across the family of established democracies. The individual‐level analyses not only provide additional evidence that casualties increase turnout, but also demonstrate that the effect of casualties is local and concentrated among the least politically interested. This finding suggests that to reach this nearly unreachable segment of the public, casualties must be, as others have argued (Gartner and Segura 1998), the most salient type of information about war. Our results also show that timing matters. Both local casualties and recent casualties can influence the decision to vote among the politically disinterested.         "
"40","Future research on casualties and voter participation would benefit by examining how information regarding casualties finds its way to citizens. Although the media are likely the dominant source of information about casualties (Miller and Albert 2015), the process may also include political organizations. Parties, candidates, groups, and activists can induce people to participate using the issue of the war as a rallying point. In some circumstances, costly conflicts can provide a focal point (Tilly 2004) that leads to the creation of organizational structures that foster grassroots movements to end the conflict, mobilizing individuals who might not otherwise participate. Such an inquiry would allow scholars to investigate whether individuals are primarily mobilized through new social organizations or whether it is through increased exposure to the conflict through the media or social and familial networks.

"41","The results underscore the importance of examining the role of expressive factors in turnout. In the garden‐variety rational choice model of voter turnout, the benefits of voting vary by the ideological distance between candidates. However, regardless of the candidate differential, the benefits are nearly always trivial in rational choice accounts since a single vote has a near zero probability of affecting the outcome of an election. For this reason, scholars have mostly emphasized the costs of voting because they vary meaningfully across space and time. Understanding differences in turnout has largely become the study of the costs and, by extension, an examination of what factors depress turnout. In contrast, by examining political circumstances that affect expressive incentives, we focus on what increases turnout. Although combat casualties represent a crucial case, politics provides myriad opportunities for expressive voting, and future research should examine such circumstances."
"42","Finally, our results have important implications for theories of international politics. Audience costs arguments rest on the assumption that leaders who do not follow through on threats or public commitments in regard to some contentious issue between states will pay a price at the polls (Fearon 1994). Similarly, Baum (2004) argues that democratic leaders anticipate the public's response to the use of force abroad, informing their preferences about whether to engage in international conflict. While recent research suggests that leaders are unlikely to pay such costs for a lack of consistency over threats or promises (Levendusky and Horowitz 2012; Snyder and Borghard 2011; but see Davies and Johns 2013), our results provide evidence that foreign policy concerns, at least if they involve the human costs of war, can deeply engage audiences, mobilizing even the least politically interested. Thus, conflicts with rising casualties might create more electoral uncertainty as the electorate expands, which could potentially influence election outcomes (Williams and Brule 2013).         "
"43","Our results also speak to research on interstate conflict and leader culpability. Croco (2011) argues that the public holds culpable leaders, leaders who were in power when a war began, electorally accountable for poor policy outcomes. While her research shows that culpable leaders who lose a war are punished at a higher rate than those who win a war, our research suggests that it is not due to newly mobilized voters seeking to punish the leader. For example, the U.S. analysis covers both a culpable (President Bush) and nonculpable (President Obama) president during the Iraq War. Both elections saw increases in voting among the politically disinterested as casualties rose. Casualties are not the same as losing a conflict, of course, but they nonetheless represent an important, highly visible policy failure.         "
"44","Although we found that casualties mobilize the politically disinterested, we found no such effect among supporters and opponents. For every person mobilized to vote against the conflict by casting a vote against a culpable leader, another appeared to be mobilized to vote in favor of the war by supporting the culpable leader. This is not to say, however, that leaders need not worry about electoral retribution at the polls; research on vote choice has found that, at least in the 2004 and 2008 U.S. elections, casualties during the Iraq War helped Democratic presidential candidates (Hill, Heron, and Lewis 2010; Karol and Miguel 2007). However, Koch (2011) found that casualties in the United Kingdom increased the likelihood that nonpartisans would vote for the incumbent. Aside from mobilizing the politically disinterested, our results suggest that the effect of casualties is to harden the resolve of opponents and supporters alike, making it more difficult for wartime leaders to terminate conflicts since they might lose support among supporters. Koch and Sullivan (2010) find this pattern when examining overall approval and within‐party approval and the decision to exit a conflict before victory. Of course, further research using data from other countries and conflicts is necessary before resolving this question.         "
"45","Lastly, our research speaks to recent studies examining variation in political institutions, governing arrangements, and conflict behavior. This research largely focuses on variation in institutions (e.g., presidential versus parliamentary; Leblang and Chan 2003) or the composition of party coalitions (Clare 2010; Koch 2009; Williams 2013), but it may also be fruitful to examine the electorate since the costs of war appear to change its composition. As the human costs of war bring more people into the political process who have been mobilized to defend their values, wartime leaders may be more constrained in their choices, making them less likely to end international conflicts.
