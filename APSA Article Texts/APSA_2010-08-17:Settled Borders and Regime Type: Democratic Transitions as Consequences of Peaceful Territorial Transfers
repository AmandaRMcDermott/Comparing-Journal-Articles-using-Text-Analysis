"1","The democratization literature has traditionally focused on factors within the state as determining the prospects for democracy. Economic development, class inequality, democratic norms and values, and social capital have all been linked to the presence of democracy (e.g., Almond and Verba 1963; Lipset 1960; Moore 1966; Rueschemeyer et al. 1992; Vanhanen 1990). However, recent work by Przeworski and Limongi (1997) and Przeworski et al. (2000) argues that these traditional correlates of democracy do not predict democratization but are instead associated with democratic survival. Transitions to democracy, they argue, are relatively random events, unpredictable by any factors endemic to the state itself.         "
"2","The lack of consensus on internal factors predicting democratization has led scholars to look outside the borders of the state for the causes of domestic change. Prominent in such research are peace‐to‐democracy theories, arguing that decentralization that follows prolonged periods of peace constitutes a necessary condition for the outgrowth of democracy (Thompson 1996). Nevertheless, most large‐N tests of the peace‐to‐democracy hypothesis have not demonstrated that domestic‐level effects are associated with international conflict. Oneal and Russett (2000, 207), for example, find no evidence that militarized dispute patterns influence democratization, and Oneal, Russett, and Berbaum (2003) cannot link democratization processes to decreased conflict. Together, these results seemingly isolate democratic transitions from the dynamics of international conflict and shield the larger democratic peace literature from arguments regarding the endogeneity of peace, democracy, and conflict. Further evidence of this isolation can be found in Reiter's (2001) duration analyses of democratic and autocratic regime survival, which finds regime effects only following war involvement by the state. Militarized disputes have no statistically significant effect on regime survival, democratic or autocratic.         "
"3","As Rasler and Thompson (2004, 884) argue, the failure to confirm the role of international conflict in domestic change is most likely a consequence of research design choice. Different questions asked, different time periods examined, and different samples used have all led to confusion regarding the general thesis that peace causes democracy, even though each work often advances particular theses appropriately. Thus, while tests of conflict in general have produced little or no demonstrable effect on democratization (Oneal and Russett 2000; Reiter 2001), such specific agents as regional democratic peace (Gleditsch 2002; Gleditsch and Ward 2006) and the presence of rivalry (Rasler and Thompson 2004; Thompson 1996) can still have important consequences for state formation and regime change.3"
"4","What is probably most surprising in the peace‐to‐democracy literature is that peace is commonly operationalized as the absence of conflict. Peace is measured as the absence of rivalry, the absence of militarized disputes, or the absence of wars. None of the studies actually examines the role of positive international peace in changing domestic structures (Thompson's 1996 case studies are an exception). This is problematic because, as Galtung (1969) argued, not all types of peace are the same. Measuring peace as the absence of conflict is especially problematic for the peace‐to‐democracy literature since few would suggest that democratization follows the establishment of negative peace. Centralization and autocracy are instead associated with mutual deterrence, and thus, conflating negative and positive peace may mask the overall empirical relationship. Unpacking the heterogeneity within “peaceful” relations and focusing specifically on state borders represents our attempt to advance this literature.         "
"5","We focus our argument on positive territorial peace, a phenomenon we consider to be the most importat component of overall positive peace for neighboring states. In this section we use the recent peace scale concept developed by Klein, Goertz, and Diehl (2008), slightly altered to apply specifically to international territorial conflict. Differentiating our concept of positive territorial peace from other types of dyadic hostility levels and identifying how it comes about is important for the development of the framework from which we will later argue that peaceful territorial transfers are associated with democratization.         "
"6"," Galtung (1985, 145) argued that peace, as a concept, can include harmony among actors, cooperation, and even integration (positive peace). Defined as the lack of conflict, however, peace implies only that no actual violence has occurred (negative peace). These two conditions obviously have vastly different implications for the likelihood of future conflict. Negative peace can easily turn to active conflict should the structural conditions preventing conflict change. For example, if capability distributions in the dyad change dramatically, revisionism by force becomes likely. Positive peace, however, is associated with cooperation, and changes in capabilities would matter little when the relationship affirms the legitimacy of each actor.            "
"7"," Klein, Goertz, and Diehl (2008) have recently developed a systematic conceptualization of Galtung's argument. Using a peace‐scale continuum, Klein, Goertz, and Diehl (2008) differentiate rivalry from negative peace and positive peace according to three sets of dyadic indicators—the level of conflict, the status of issues and communications, and the number and type of peace agreements and diplomacy. Rivals are likely to have conflict, unresolved issues, and lingering diplomatic hostility. Dyads experiencing negative peace have no open conflicts, but some unresolved issues remain in the dyad and tense diplomacy is unable to build constructive settlements. Finally, positive peace is characterized by the lack of unresolved issues in the dyad, institutionalized mechanisms for communications between the two states, and diplomatic coordination between the governments.            "
"8","In Figure 1 we adapt the Klein, Goertz, and Diehl (2008) framework to focus specifically on relations over territorial issues.4 Beginning on the far left of the figure, territorial rivalry relations include those dyads that have frequent disputes in which the principle underlying issue is territorial. Their borders are heavily contested, and violent transfers of territory may have taken place in the past. Both states have actively developed war plans based upon territorial control. Dyads are at negative territorial peace when there are few or even no conflicts in the dyad even though there may be latent territorial claims and the borders remain contested. Dyadic power imbalances, major state alliances, or other factors could be deterring either or both states from initiating their war plans that are focused on regaining or controlling claimed territories. The contested nature of the border could be due to ethnic divisions across the border, poor border specification, long‐standing territorial claims, or even previous violent transfers.            "
"9","                 Applying the                                                            Klein, Goertz, and Diehl (2008)                                                            Peace Scale to Borders and Territorial Issues                         "
"10","Positive territorial peace is found in those dyads that have resolved their border claims to the point where wars over territorial issues have become unthinkable. There are likely to be few restrictions on border passage, and institutions that integrate trade and communication across the boundary may even exist. To get to the point of positive territorial peace, the border needs to be considered highly legitimate. We argue that this happens when both states’ leaders have mutually agreed upon border demarcations through past peaceful transfers of territory."
"11","Territorial transfers are boundary adjustments between two states, where the physical location of the border is changed. Tir (2003, 2006; see also Tir et al. 1998) has identified 114 cases of noncolonial transfer during the 20th century. Sixty‐four of these transfers (approximately 56%) have been performed peacefully, whereas the remainder involved the use of force.5 One example of a peaceful, mutually agreed‐upon territorial transfer concerns the exchange of the Sinai Peninsula from Israeli to Egyptian control following the Camp David Accords. In contrast, Israel seized the same territory by military force (i.e., conquest) during the 1967 Six Day War, and this is considered a violent transfer.            "
"12","That the border altered through a violent transfer remains unsettled and heavily contested is not a controversial point. Violent transfers indicate that the international border is far from agreed upon, as its location has been adjusted by force, without the consent of at least one party. Violent transfers are therefore likely to be associated with an increased level of threat within the dyad. Conversely, peaceful transfers most often demonstrate that the revised border has been accepted as legitimate by the states involved since at least one party is peacefully relinquishing possession of territory it controls6 in favor of future peaceful relations. The country receiving the land meanwhile signals its satisfaction with the altered border and abandonment of the use of force as a means of dealing with territorial problems. That is, by resolving an important issue by mutual consent, the countries demonstrate positive motivation, trust, and credible commitment toward territorial dispute resolution and commitment to foregoing future uses of force. Moreover, given that territorial disputes are commonly dealt with by military force, the shift toward peaceful alterations of borders stands in stark contrast to the power politics historically associated with most territorial acquisitions. In other words, to reach this level of border settlement, the countries must really be committed to the peaceful approach since ceding territory is politically costly (Huth and Allee 2002).            "
"13","Settled borders should lead to the removal of the territorial threat between the two states, according to Tir's (2003, 2006) work on the aftermath of territorial transfers.7 Even after controlling for a variety of factors, Tir's findings clearly show that the manner in which territorial transfers are conducted has considerable importance for the posttransfer relations between participant countries. Specifically, violent transfers are followed by militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) over territory at rates that are two to three times higher than peaceful transfers, while the conflict rate following peaceful transfers is at least similar (and oftentimes lower than) the average global rate of international conflict. It is therefore reasonable to assume that peaceful transfers are linked with a substantially lower territorial threat in the dyad following the transfer.8"
"14","Of course, not every border has been adjusted, peacefully or violently. The amount of threat likely emanating from these “status quo” borders is often difficult to discern. The borders could be viewed as legitimate by both leaders and publics, but the lack of conflict could also mask latent territorial claims. Indeed, adjustments to some of these borders may have been attempted in the past, even through military force. Absent force, publics may harbor irredentist claims over some of the borders, but the leaders are unwilling to act because of relative military weakness or myriad other reasons. Thus, the lack of border alteration does not necessarily imply a settled border, let alone positive peace. Only peacefully altered borders clearly indicate a high degree of trust within the dyad and the motivation to settle their border issues peacefully.9"
"15","More so than questions of policy or ideological difference, the defense or pursuit of homeland territory prompts states to engage in provocative and violent behavior (Senese and Vasquez 2005, 2008; Vasquez 1993, 2009). Using territorial threats to keep and expand their power (Tir 2010), leaders will argue in favor of the creation of large standing armies to defend the homeland. The problem for domestic politics is that the development of these standing armies requires high levels of taxation as well as a broad centralization of authority in order to acquire, arm, equip, feed, and otherwise maintain the troops. Because high levels of military spending and frequent conflict also depress domestic consumption and economic growth, the chief executive requires greater political autonomy to maintain power. Thus, large standing armies are correlated with the rise of large bureaucracies that are dominated by the military and a centralization of political power in the hands of the elites that govern the militarily dominated state. When threat is lower and less consistent, there is little need for large standing armies, the justification for centralized authority is weakened, and decentralization of power follows (see Gibler 2007, forthcoming; Gibler and Wolford 2006; Hutchison and Gibler 2007).         "
"16","That the level of external threat should play a role in shaping forms of military and domestic organization is hardly a new idea, emerging at least a century ago in the work of German historian Otto Hintze ([1906] 1975). Hintze argued that continental states facing persistent threats to their security build highly centralized state apparatuses in order to support the large standing armies needed for security, whereas states protected by geography, like islands, tend to build more decentralized militias and democratic regimes. Hintze's theory has been supported by a large number of important case studies and theoretical arguments that detail the links between peace, decentralization, and the development of democracy (see, e.g., Moore 1966; North and Weingast 1989; Thompson 1996; Tilly 1985).            "
"17","The key to Hintze's argument is the link between the absence of territorial threat and decentralization and democracy. The islands in Hintze's theory were physical islands, isolated from territorial threats to the homeland by ocean waters. Security from the threat of conquest is what allowed state decentralization and explains why a country like Great Britain was one of the first countries to transition to democracy. Mimicking those early island states are their modern equivalent—those states that have settled their borders with their neighbors in a mutually acceptable way. By removing territorial threat to their homelands, these states rest comfortably in islands of territorial peace that allow for decentralization and democratization."
"18","Much like Hintze's ([1906] 1975) argument, and the war‐making/state‐making literature that followed (Desch 1996; Thompson 1996; Tilly 1985), we view the presence of a strong, land‐based military as a threat to democratic competition among groups. This argument is consistent with most of the theoretical literature on democratic transitions. For example, in Olson's (1993) argument, the military helps an autocrat become a stationary bandit, extracting rents from other interests within society. The relative power of the military compared to other interests leads to competition over control of the military in order to dominate the state. Absent a strong military, societal interests are forced to negotiate and compromise in a democratic compact or suffer under anarchy. For Boix's (2003) theory, the presence of a strong military makes repression substantially easier. Redistributive pressures in societies with high wealth inequality are stymied by the repressive ability of large land armies. With the costs of repression low, wealthy elites maintain their stature rather than risk the consequences of democratic transitions. Without the land army, repression becomes more difficult and more costly, and no single actor has an incentive to play an exclusionary strategy against other interests in society.            "
"19","The literature on the development of democracy in England provides perhaps the best case evidence of the link between land armies and domestic power struggles. For example, Barrington Moore (1966, 32) argued that, prior to democracy, the repressive apparatus of the English state was relatively weak, a consequence of the Civil War, the previous evolution of the monarchy, and reliance on a navy rather than on the army. In turn, the absence of a strong monarchy resting on an army and a bureaucracy, as was present in Prussia, made easier the development of parliamentary democracy. Similarly, North and Weingast (1989) describe the importance of military institutions in the bargaining between Crown and Parliament. Had most of the conflicts carried out by the English monarch been local, a repressive land army could have extracted supreme leverage over Parliament. However, since most of the conflicts were foreign and fought by the navy, Parliament could extract democratic concessions from the Crown in return for monies for the various foreign war efforts.            "
"20","Strong land armies are most likely to be found in states that are involved in territorial disputes concerning neighboring rivals. Unlike threats over policy, regime type or economic issues, territorial issues carry the goals of defending, occupying, and controlling land. To do this, initiating states must construct an army capable of defeating targeted states and capturing and holding their territory (see Huth 1996, for a similar argument). Likewise, direct threats to homeland territories force targeted states to construct and maintain equally large standing armies to repel these potential invaders. If borders are mutually agreed upon and settled, however, the maintenance of a large standing army becomes less important and perhaps even unnecessary.            "
"21","Settled borders remove not only the territorial threat but also the pernicious effects of large standing armies from the state. Military subsidies and procurements become less tenable for governments when leaders can no longer rely upon territorial rivalries and threats to the homeland to increase their domestic bargaining position and the repressive capacity of their government. Further, without the standing army, other interests within government and the broader society are better able to check the growth in executive power (Rasler and Thompson 2004). Indeed, without the power of the military, domestic interests have strong incentives to decentralize the power of the government and democratize.            "
"22","The most recent empirical evidence supporting this argument comes from Gibler (2007). In an analysis that emphasized the geographic composition of international borders, Gibler found that borders without clear geographic salients (mountains and rivers but also historically defined colonial and ethnic boundaries) to reinforce boundary lines were more likely to witness territorial conflict. These same unstable borders were also more likely to separate nondemocratic states. Conversely, democracies were more likely to be found across stable borders. One shortcoming of the study is that geographic border features are not an adequate proxy for border legitimacy and mutual acceptance; Gibler is therefore unable to determine whether his stable borders are associated with negative or positive peace. Geographic salients (e.g., rugged mountains) could discourage or deter conflict and thus make the border appear stable, all the while masking latent territorial threats and claims. The true removal of territorial threat potential and emergence of positive territorial peace is only established by the mutual consent of the leaders (and often publics) of both states in the dyad. By identifying borders made legitimate through peaceful territorial transfers, in this work we are able to focus precisely on those countries that have started to establish positive territorial peace with their neighbors. And by differentiating between negative and positive territorial peace, we offer an important development in evaluating the merit of the peace‐to‐democracy thesis.            "
"23","Those states engaged in militarized rivalries across their borders are likely to have large standing armies. In these cases the military serves as a dominant force domestically, providing bargaining leverage for certain interests, including its own interests and those of the elites. Autocracy rules the state. Conversely, peaceful territorial transfers have transformative effects on both interstate territorial relations and the domestic polity. By eliminating active or latent territorial threat through mutual border acceptance, peaceful territorial transfers herald the emergence of positive territorial peace between states. This positive territorial peace eliminates the need for a strong, land‐based military and the centralization of authority, and this in turn brings decentralization, neutralizes the military politically, and allows democratic processes to take hold, assuming the prerequisites of democracy are present within the country."
"24","These causal paths are consistent with almost all theoretical variants of the peace‐to‐democracy argument, which suggest that militarized conflict leads to centralization and authoritarianism, while peace brings decentralization and democracy. As we describe above, all tests of the peace‐to‐democracy argument have operationalized peace as the absence of conflict. But, critically, such conceptualization conflates negative and positive peace. Negative peace includes cases of sporadic MIDs, continued threats to the state, and the existence of war plan contingencies. In this sense, negative peace implies no opportunity for demilitarization across the border because of latent threats. In fact, demilitarization would be foolhardy for the state that acts first because its rival could easily dictate the terms of an imposed settlement."
"25","If we further refine the differentiation between types of peace to focus solely on territorial issues, we also isolate the types of processes likely to inhibit democratization. Hintze ([1906] 1975) and the scholars that followed him have argued that the military can pose a threat to the state because of its ability to repress and shape domestic political bargaining. Navies and air forces have a difficult time doing this, however. As North and Weingast (1989) describe, a land army is the tool that makes domestic repression easiest, and large land armies are the preferred defense against threats to homeland territories. It therefore follows that states experiencing negative territorial peace are likely both to have consistent threats to homeland territories and large armies to protect themselves against these threats. Removing these territorial threats to the state should undermine the importance and need for the land‐based military and foster the domestic decentralization of power and democratization.            "
"26"," Figure 2 outlines this process. States at negative territorial peace (or rivalry) experience consistent threats to homeland territories. This leads to the establishment and/or maintenance of a large standing army to deter the threats. Of course, the presence of the military also becomes a powerful political force domestically. Groups need not bargain with each other for political outcomes; instead, capturing the strong military can enforce their preferences on the other political actors within society. Or, the military can act unilaterally, since repressing the population becomes easier given the increased number of home‐based troops. With the presence of a strong land army, centralization of power in the hands of the elite and autocratization (or the maintenance of autocracy) become likely, even if the prerequisites of democracy (wealth, culture, etc.) are present in the country. Positive territorial peace changes the bargaining structure of domestic politics. Without external threat, calls for a strong military are less effective, and demilitarization becomes likely. Absent the strong political force of the standing army, equal political competition among groups takes hold, and repression by the elites becomes difficult and costly. Decentralization of domestic power follows, and if the prerequisites of democracy are present, then the chances of democratization increase.10 The key is determining when states are at positive territorial peace.            "
"27","                 Paths to Authoritarianism and Democracy                         "
"28","Here we turn again to the peaceful territorial transfer data as evidence of mutual consent on the placement of the border. If our positive territorial peace‐to‐democracy argument is correct, the status of the border greatly affects the level of threat or the type of peace within the dyad. Active or latent territorial threats lead to militarization and centralization and prevent democratization. However, according to our theory, peaceful territorial transfers eliminate territorial threats in the dyad, bringing positive territorial peace, and subsequently encouraging the type of liberalization and decentralization that is linked with democratic transitions."
"29","We operationalize border legitimacy using peaceful interstate transfers of territory. In hypothesis form, our expectations for these transfers follow the path toward democratization we outline above:"
"30","                              "
"31","H1: Peaceful territorial transfers reduce the level of territorial threat."
"32","H2: Peaceful territorial transfers lead to reduced levels of militarization."
"33","H3: Peaceful territorial transfers increase the likelihood of democratization."
"34","One implicit assumption in our argument is that domestic regime type does not affect the likelihood of peaceful territorial transfer. If this were the case, our evaluation of the hypotheses would be complicated by endogeneity issues. We therefore also assess whether the process of peaceful territorial transfer is endogenous to democracy and label this initial hypothesis H0:"
"35","                              "
"36","H0: The presence of democracy does not increase the likelihood of peaceful territorial transfers."
"37","In the next section, we discuss our research design for testing these hypotheses, including how we operationalize each dependent variable."
"38","We begin our analyses by demonstrating that peaceful state‐to‐state territorial transfers are not a function of regime type (H0). This is important because our argument rests on the ability of peaceful territorial transfer to diminish interstate threat and encourage democratization rather than the counterargument that already democratic states are peacefully exchanging territories. To test for potential endogeneity in this process, our first dependent variable is the presence of a peaceful transfer between two states in any given year, derived from the data provided by Tir et al. (1998).11"
"39","We test three separate dependent variables to assess the effects of peaceful transfers on the state. First, if our argument is correct, peaceful territorial transfers should reduce the level of militarization within the state (H1). We measure militarization by using the ratio of military personnel to total population in each country‐year (Singer, Bremer, and Stuckey 1972). Second, we explore the ability of peaceful transfers to decrease the likelihood of a state being targeted by a territorial MID (H2). Positive cases of targeting are coded as those states involved in a MID in which the other state of the dyad is considered revisionist over territory. We only include initiating dyads and not joiners (Ghosn, Palmer, and Bremer 2004).         "
"40","Our third and final hypothesis concerns whether countries that have experienced peaceful transfers in their past are more likely to transition to democracy at some point in their future (H3). Thus, our dependent variable is the presence of a democratic transition in the state, which we label as any case that moves from the range of −10 to 5 to the range of 6 to 10 on the Polity IV scale of democracy‐autocracy (Marshall and Jaggers 2002).12 There are 76 countries that transitioned to democracy after World War II.         "
"41","Since our later analyses examine the regime effects of peaceful transfers once they occur, we first confirm that the peaceful transfer of territory is not endogenous to some long‐term democratization process (H0). To do this, we present results from four Cox regressions (Cox 1975) that predict peaceful territorial transfers. Our sample for this analysis includes all directed, politically relevant dyad years, 1945–2000. We limit the analyses to politically relevant dyads because contiguous and major states are, by far, the states most likely to trade homeland territory (Goertz and Diehl 1992). We employ the Cox model because our dependent variable (peaceful territorial transfer) is sensitive to issues of right‐censoring and the nature of our data (binary cross‐sectional time‐series) warrants controls for time dependence. Table 1 presents the coefficients and standard errors for each predictor in the Cox regression estimates.13"
"42","Our explanatory variables in the first model of Table 1 are the regime scores of each state in the directed dyad, based on a continuous measure of the Polity IV scale. In this model the regime score has no statistically significant effect on the likelihood of peaceful territorial transfer. In Model 2, we collapse each regime score to dichotomous variables representing different types of regime combinations within the directed dyad. Again, we find no evidence of regime type predicting peaceful territorial transfer, as none of the dyadic combinations are statistically significant at any meaningful level.14"
"43","In Models 3 and 4 we add several additional predictors of territorial transfers (Gibler 2007; Kacowicz 1994; Tir 2003, 2006; see also Goertz and Diehl 1992). From data available through the Correlates of War Project, we include the capability ratio of the states in the dyad, measured as the ratio of weaker to stronger Composite Index of National Capabilities (CINC) score (Singer, Bremer, and Stuckey 1972), the presence of a MID (Ghosn, Palmer, and Bremer 2004), and the age of the border (Stinnett et al. 2002). Since Gibler and Wolford (2006; see also Gibler 1996, 1997) note that alliances may also serve as methods of settling territorial disputes peacefully, we include a dichotomous indicator for the presence of an alliance (Gibler and Sarkees 2004). Because the likelihood that a border is altered may depend on whether the contentious homeland territory is contiguous to the states involved (e.g., Alaska, East Pakistan, Cabinda), we include a control for the presence of a noncontiguous territory that is a part of the state's homeland (Fearon and Laitin 2003).15 The addition of the control variables does not affect the coefficients for the different regime types in Models 3 and 4. In neither case does regime type have an effect on the likelihood of peaceful territorial transfer. The additional variables present few surprises as most are statistically insignificant.16 Only alliances and contiguous borders consistently encourage peaceful territorial transfer. If we lower the threshold for statistical significance, the presence of noncontiguous homeland territory is associated with peaceful transfers in Model 3 (p < .10).17"
"44","These results clearly indicate that regime type exercises little influence in bringing about peaceful territorial transfers; the findings also provide evidence countering the claim that popular incentives make democratic leaders more likely to exchange territories peacefully (see Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003, 412–414; see also Kacowicz 1994). Instead, as Huth and Allee (2002) find, democracy may be an impediment to settling territorial disputes since increased audience costs make the necessary concessions for peaceful territorial transfers difficult to provide. For example, these dynamics are clearly apparent in the current territorial dispute between Slovenia and Croatia, both of which are nascent democracies according to our measure. Even though the dispute is relatively minor, the countries have been unable to make much progress in dealing with the issue over the past 16 years. A several‐years‐old agreement between the prime ministers of both countries has not been ratified by either country's Parliament due to weak popular support. The leaders have instead agreed to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice, but Slovenian opposition parties have effectively blocked this move through vocal protests over sending the case to adjudication that could mean a ruling against Slovenia. Croatia's admittance into the European Union may depend on resolution of this issue, as Slovenia is currently blocking Croatian entry until the claim is resolved.         "
"45","Since we have found no evidence that regime type affects the likelihood of participation in peaceful territorial transfers, the next step in our argument assesses the effects of peaceful transfers. If our theory is correct, the positive territorial peace emerging from peaceful transfers should be associated with decreases in territorial MID targeting and militarization and with an increased likelihood of democratization.18"
"46","In Table 2, Model 1, we examine whether peacefully altered borders decrease the territorial threat to the state (H1).19 The presence of a territorial MID is dichotomous, so we therefore once again use Cox regression to estimate the effects of the explanatory variables. Because the peacefully adjusted border likely represents only a portion of the total number of borders for each state, we control for the total number of the state's borders. For other control variables, per capita GDP (from the Penn World Tables) serves as a proxy for development. Power is measured using CINC score, while the presence of recent nonterritorial MIDs captures immediate threats to the state. We control for regime type by including the combined 21‐point democracy‐autocracy scale from Polity IV. Our final control variable in these analyses captures the strength of the regional democratic community; its value is based on the percentage of democracies in each Correlates of War region.            "
"47","The results in Model 1 strongly support our expectations: countries that have settled their borders with peaceful transfers have a significantly lower likelihood of being targeted by a territorial MID. These results are consistent with the dyadic‐level findings reported in Tir (2003, 2006). As for the control variables, countries with a greater number of borders are more likely to be the victims of militarized disputes over territory, as are more powerful countries. Increased development is associated with a decreased likelihood of being targeted. However, the regime score and the percentage of democracies in the region are not statistically significant in this model, and other types of disputes do not increase the likelihood of territorial targeting.            "
"48","In the second analysis we investigate whether peaceful transfers influence the level of militarization in the state (H2). Our sample again includes all states, 1945–2000. Since militarization ranges between 0 and 1, with possible serial correlation, we switch from Cox to generalized least squares regression that corrects for first‐order autoregressive disturbance in the data."
"49","The results in Model 2 confirm our expectation since peaceful transfers decrease the level of militarization in the state. Smaller militaries should correlate with reduced roles for the military, and if our theory is correct, should also encourage liberalization and democratic competition within the state. The association between peaceful transfers and reduced militaries holds even when controls are added for overall state power, regime type, and the level of democracy in the region. As expected, powerful states tend to be more militarized while regional democracy and higher regime scores reduce militarization levels. The remaining control variables have no effect in the model."
"50","In Table 3, we continue our investigation of the domestic effects of peaceful territorial transfer and model the likelihood of observing a democratic transition in any country (H3). We employ the same predictive models as before,20 and our sample includes all nondemocratic states, 1945–2000.21 We again use a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the time until transition. We do this to correct for temporal dependence in the data. Also, by modeling transitions as a duration process, we are able to estimate the effects of peaceful transfers (and the other covariates) on both immediate and long‐term transitions. In other words, the Cox model is semi‐parametric and does not require specification of a baseline hazard rate or an estimation of absolute risk (Jones and Branton 2005).            "
"51","As the results in Table 3 demonstrate, peaceful territorial transfers have a statistically significant and positive effect on the likelihood of a state becoming democratic following the transfer. This finding supports the key expectation of our argument that settling the border removes an important threat to the state and leads to domestic liberalization and eventual democracy. Peaceful transfers are obviously not a necessary prerequisite for democratic transitions. Once peaceful transfers do occur, however, democratic transitions are much more likely. For example, the rate at which transitions to democracy occur in the absence of peaceful transfers is .0115 per year. In the aftermath of peaceful transfers, however, this rate jumps to .0196 per year, which is an increase of 71.3%.22"
"52","Returning to Table 3, few of the control variables seem to affect democratization. An exception is the regional democracies coefficient, which provides evidence in favor of the democratic contagion argument (Gleditsch and Ward 2006). Yet, importantly for our argument, peaceful transfers remain statistically significant even when controlling for the effects of the neighboring democratic community.23 Economic development has a negative effect on democratization in our analyses, but this finding may be due to a selection effect since the sample includes only nondemocracies. Indeed, when we change the dependent variable to autocratic transitions, the direction of the relationship remains the same, so these results likely imply that, at certain points on the Polity IV scale, wealth simply encourages regime endurance.            "
"53","One interesting nonfinding in the model is the lack of association between regime score and the likelihood of a democratic transition. Higher regime scores short of democracy do not predict an increased likelihood of transition since, though positive, the standard error for this variable is almost the size of the coefficient. This lack of association implies that democratization can occur following any type of nondemocratic regime and that transitions do not necessarily follow gradual increases in liberalization within the state.24"
"54","These results provide strong evidence confirming our overall theory. Not only do we find support for the broad implications of peaceful territorial transfers (that borders settled peacefully lead to democratization), but we also confirm the domestic‐level implications of the argument. Assuming militarization is linked with domestic centralization of political authority, we demonstrate that peaceful transfers are associated with reduced territorial threat and demilitarization of the state. Thus, not only do we provide an explanation for democratization, but we also provide some evidence for its likely agents."
"55","The findings presented above shed new light on some well‐known cases. For example, several South American countries had been involved in the 19th‐century War of the Pacific, which resulted in severe and violent border alterations in the region. Yet, by the 20th century, some of the countries involved started to engage in peaceful territorial transfers, sending signals that they were ready to settle the related boundaries and thus decrease the lingering feelings of territorial threat. Eventual democratizations of Peru, Bolivia, and Chile followed. A similar pattern can be found in the border relations between Poland and Germany, Romania and Bulgaria, and Bolivia and Paraguay. Each of these cases experienced violent territorial transfers following various wars—World War II, the Balkan Wars, and the Chaco War, respectively—and each border was eventually settled by peaceful transfer prior to democratization. The peaceful settlements helped alleviate residual territorial fears from the prior conflicts, eliminated irredentist calls from leaders and public, and began the process of liberalization and political decentralization. As a result, these countries are all now democratic.25"
"56","These stories are not unique. Thompson's (1996) case studies suggest democratization follows the acceptance of regional order and the relinquishment of quests for primacy; in other words, the acceptance of international borders within the region. The comparative literature mostly focuses on the dimensions of democratization internal to the state but still emphasizes the role of external threat and the bargaining power of the military, especially with regard to liberalization in England (see, e.g., Moore 1996 and North and Weingast 1989), but also democratization in other major states as well (Boix 2003, chap. 3). These stories tend to converge on the assumption that, as increasing per capita income, strong middle‐class interests, weakened central authority, et cetera, begin pushing the extant regime, the absence of a standing military helps ensure that political bargaining and democratization can take place with no group using the army to dominate other actors and control the state. Below, we follow the path of these other case studies and provide greater detail on the contemporary cases of democratization in Croatia and Serbia. These cases confirm the importance of territorial pacification (across Eastern Slavonia) and again corroborate the relationships argued above.26"
"57","A major consequence of the wars surrounding the breakup of Yugoslavia was the territorial delineation of successor states. For example, Serbia was successful in capturing the region of Eastern Slavonia in late 1991—which the prebreakup administrative borders placed within Croatia's territory. The fighting and subsequent territorial stalemate created a perception of territorial threat in both countries, which correspond well to the territorial rivalry and negative territorial peace concepts in our theory. For Serbia, the danger was that Croatia would attack to take the land back and perhaps push even deeper into Serbia proper to re‐create the World War II–era borders of Croatia. For Croatia, Serbia's occupation of Eastern Slavonia was unacceptable, particularly given the heavy casualties suffered by the Croatian side and the possibility that Serb forces could cross the cease‐fire line to capture at least two nearby major Croatian cities (Osijek and Vinkovci). In fact, numerous maps were being published in both countries that called for “correct” boundaries at the expense of their rival."
"58","The effects of this situation on the polity of the two countries are hard to miss. The initial push for democratization occurred in 1990 (i.e., before the June 1991 breakup of Yugoslavia brought on the issue of territorial division) and included the Communist party's surrender of its monopoly on power, multiparty elections, and the emergence of free media. Yet, in 1991 and the years immediately after, presidents Milosevic of Serbia and Tudjman of Croatia and their respective regimes used the mutual threats to the territorial integrity of their countries to justify their highly inflammatory nationalist rhetoric, manipulate election outcomes, consolidate their power, control the media, and stifle internal dissent. In both cases, the threat and related nationalist frenzy made the population supportive of moves toward centralization of power and authoritarianism. Furthermore, Croatia militarized itself significantly, while in Serbia the Yugoslav Army continued to exercise much political influence."
"59","The situation started to change in late 1995, after Croatia went on the offensive against Milosevic‐supported local Serb rebel forces in Croatia and Bosnia; the results were heavy territorial losses for the Serb side. Perhaps wanting to avoid the same fate in Eastern Slavonia, which was not included in the offensive, and decrease the risk of invasion of Serbia proper by Croatian forces, Milosevic signaled that, under certain conditions, he would be willing to peacefully cede Eastern Slavonia to Croatia. The resulting Erdut Agreement of 1996 stipulated that the territory would be demilitarized and gradually transferred to Croatian control with the help of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES). The peaceful transfer was finalized in 1998, and the major territorial issue between Serbia and Croatia was thus resolved, paving the way toward positive territorial peace between the states. After fighting a war and facing off over a cease‐fire line for years, the two countries demonstrated a willingness to resolve their outstanding territorial issues peacefully. This was a costly signal for both states since Serbia had to cede land it controlled and Croatia, by accepting the land, explicitly accepted its international borders with the final addition of Eastern Slavonia."
"60","The removal of territorial threat to the states had palpable and relatively swift effects in both countries. Their citizens became increasingly unwilling to tolerate the regimes’ repressive and authoritarian policies, as evidenced in frequent antigovernment street protests, civil disobedience, increasingly critical media, elections of regime opponents to local government positions, public criticism of nationalist policies, outright demands for democracy, etc. The prestige of the military diminished significantly in both countries and, with the reduction in funding, the forces literally started to crumble. After Tudjman died in late 1999, Croatian citizens made it clear that they did not want to continue with authoritarianism, most notably by electing a prodemocracy opposition government in 2000; this started the process of democratization in Croatia that continues today."
"61","For Serbia, the path toward democracy has been a bit more complicated, but it started with the massive anti‐Milosevic street protests that ultimately resulted in his arrest in early 2001 and extradition to the Hague; the 2008 election of a pro‐Western government seems to have solidified Serbia's path toward democratic consolidation. In the post–peaceful transfer era, the two countries have normalized diplomatic and trade relations and Croatia has recently offered to help Serbia with its bid for EU accession."
"62","In sum, this case narrative corroborates many of the premises provided in our theory of democratization in which positive territorial peace plays a major role, by making democratization a priority for the citizens and weakening support for the military and repressive policies of the state that could stand in the way of democratic reforms. Given the turbulent and bloody relations of the early 1990s, the removal of the territorial threat by means of the peaceful transfer of Eastern Slavonia was a watershed event. It ushered in a new era of Serbia‐Croatia relations and opened the door to internal societal changes toward democracy."
"63","Our results provide strong support for the argument that settled international boundaries decrease the level of threat to the territorial integrity of states. The reduction in threat provided by peaceful territorial transfers in turn allows countries to liberalize their internal politics, eventually leading to democratic transitions. Principle confirmation of the theory rests in the analysis presented in Table 3, in which we demonstrate that peaceful transfers are prominent among the factors increasing the rate of transitions to democracy (H3). Importantly, our results are not by‐products of the argument that democracy leads to peaceful transfers (H0); our analyses presented in Table 1 clearly demonstrate that the democratic regime type has no appreciable influence on the likelihood of peaceful transfers in the dyad.         "
"64","We also demonstrate that there is empirical support for our argument about how democratization is likely to occur. First, peaceful transfers reduce the chances that a state will be targeted in the future by military force over its border (H1); this confirms our argument that peacefully adjusted borders are indeed more settled. Second, when examining the effects of peaceful transfers, we also confirm a link to substantially lower future levels of militarization within the country (H2). These findings reinforce our contention that settled borders are associated with political decentralization and liberalization within the state.         "
"65","Of course, democratization is likely to be a long‐term process, and the resolution of the border is only one condition among a host of variables needed for democracy to begin. As we stated early on, economic development, class inequality, democratic norms and values, and social capital have all been linked to the presence of democracy (Almond and Verba 1963; Lipset 1960; Moore 1966; Rueschemeyer et al. 1992; Vanhanen 1990). Here, we find that the removal of threats to the state may have similar implications for state liberalization, decentralization, and eventual democratization. An important next step would consider whether and under what circumstances the external factors of democratization contribute to the many domestic correlates of democracy. We believe that settled borders are often necessary for endogenous democratization, which is consistent with Przeworski and Limongi's (1997) and Przeworski et al.'s (2000) argument that the reasons for transitions to democracy have to be found among the factors that are not endemic to the state itself. This would also provide additional evidence that broad tests of the effects of conflict are inappropriate for the peace‐to‐democracy literature (as Rasler and Thompson 2004 have argued).         "
"66","Our argument also helps explain much of the variation in systemic “waves” of democratization (Crescenzi and Enterline 1999; Gates et al. 2003; Mitchell, Gates, and Hegre 1999). When major systemic events occur—the fall of the Soviet Union, dramatic shifts in global trade, technological shifts that lead to globalization, etc.—the countries with borders settled through peaceful transfers have much better chances of becoming democratic. Consider the example of Poland. Despite settling its border with Germany a long time ago, it took the fall of communism to move the democratization process further. Once communism fell, the country became democratic rather than reverting to another form of authoritarianism. In contrast, cases in the former Yugoslavia, such as Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia, illustrate that the collapse of communism did not lead to automatic democratization, in spite of the regional wave. We argue that this was in large part because of unsettled border issues, which have been used by leaders to justify the need for centralization of authority within their countries. The current problem in Kosovo provides additional evidence for this story, as radicals in Serbia seeking to reverse any recent prodemocratic reforms have been empowered by public responses to issues of territorial control.         "
"67","By utilizing the phenomenon of peaceful territorial transfers (Goertz and Diehl 1992; Kacowicz 1994; Tir 2003, 2006), we are able to address King's (2001) criticism regarding the unmeasured heterogeneity in most studies of international conflict and find evidence in favor of Galtung's (1969) early assertions regarding the effects of positive peace. We also provide clear empirical support for the expectations that the settling of territorial issues via peaceful transfers leads to demilitarization, border stability, and, critically, democratic transitions. While many prior works (e.g., Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003; Huth and Allee 2002) have argued that regime type influences how states deal with problematic international issues, including territorial disputes, we demonstrate that the methods used for settling territorial issues instead affect regime type. As our results demonstrate, regime type has no bearing on the method of territorial settlement, operationalized in this study as a peaceful territorial transfer. Thus, our article has important implications for the theory of democratic peace, as it helps demonstrate that both democracy and peace in a dyad may be a function of settling territorial threats to the state.         "
"68","The policy implications of our study are clear. The failure to deal with territorial disputes proactively and constructively—by seeking a peaceful adjustment in existing borders—continues to create conflict between states (i.e., the very real danger of militarization of territorial disputes found by Hensel 2001; Huth 1996; Senese 2005; Senese and Vasquez 2003; Vasquez and Henehan 2001). It also seriously undermines the likelihood of transitions toward democracy. Seen in this light, for example, the African Union/Organization of African Unity's norm against border changes has serious negative and unanticipated consequences. While this norm has prevented all but a few border changes in Africa, it has failed to deliver territorial security for the African states. As Tir and Diehl (2002) show, the norm has not prevented the challenging of Africa's borders by the use of military force. Per our study, the norm can be added to the already lengthy litany of reasons for why so few democracies thrive in Africa, even with massive amounts of aid and Western pressure to democratize.
