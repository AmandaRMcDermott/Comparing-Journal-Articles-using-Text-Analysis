"1"," Mayhew's (1974) concept of the “electoral connection,” and the fear of retrospective punishment by voters which drives it, has played an instrumental role in shaping the development of modern research on Congress. Nevertheless, questions remain as to whether his argument accurately portrays politics outside of contemporary American politics. Though Mayhew is silent on the subject, the conventional wisdom among many students of congressional politics is that the nineteenth century was far too different to accommodate a strong electoral linkage between individual representatives and their constituents (Formisano 1974; Huckabee 1989; Polsby 1968; Price 1975; Skeen 1986; Swift 1987–88). Most legislators were not interested in pursuing a career in Congress (Polsby 1968; Price 1975) and therefore lacked incentives to heed the wishes of their constituency. This was compounded by an electorate disinclined to hold public officials accountable for their individual behavior in office (Formisano 1974) and who evaluated candidates based on party affiliation rather than legislative actions (Skeen 1986).         "
"2","The above arguments are further buttressed by studies suggesting that individual accountability dramatically increased following the adoption of antiparty reforms such as the Australian ballot and the direct primary between 1890 and 1920 (Katz and Sala 1996; Kernell 1977; Rusk 1970). The secret ballot had a profound effect on the electoral environment by giving voters a greater opportunity to punish or reward candidates individually while also giving incumbents the institutional means to develop a personal vote (Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart 2000; Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1992). Although not usually stated explicitly, a direct implication of these findings is that an individual electoral connection was tenuous at best before the progressive reform era.         "
"3","A few students of congressional politics have nevertheless suggested that Mayhew's “electoral connection” may still be valid in this era. In their analysis of the Compensation Act of 1816, Bianco, Spence, and Wilkerson claim that “It is one thing to argue that a congressional career was less attractive or less feasible in an earlier time than it is today, but another to conclude that members of the early Congress were unconcerned about the electoral consequences of their behavior” (1996, 147). Indeed, they find that electorally vulnerable legislators were less likely to support the unpopular compensation plan and those who voted in favor were less likely to seek reelection. The main limitation of their study, as they acknowledge, is that they were precluded from directly testing for electoral sanctions because of existing data limits. Jumping forward a half‐century, Carson et al. (2001) examine the midterm House elections of 1862–63 and demonstrate that, much like modern elections, both national forces (i.e., the course of the war) and district specific conditions (i.e., entry of quality challengers, district‐level war casualties, and the timing of races) affected legislator's electoral fortunes in predictable ways. Their study, however, does not examine whether legislators were held accountable for their individual voting decisions in Congress.         "
"4","Thus, the literature presents us with two different portrayals of electoral accountability in nineteenth‐century American politics. We argue that the election of 1826–27 gives us the opportunity to speak to this ongoing debate and has advantages that previous studies do not. First, we can directly match up “public opinion” data with members' voting on a single issue to systematically examine the accountability mechanism associated with the electoral connection. Second, the timing of the election—providing a mixture of new and returning members—creates a unique set of circumstances which we can exploit to more directly pinpoint what effects, if any, constituency level shirking had on electoral outcomes in this era. Third, as we will argue in the next section, opposition candidates used the presidential question as campaign fodder in the subsequent midterm elections."
"5","If we do not find systematic evidence of electoral accountability on this highly salient vote then this would cast serious doubt on the presence of an electoral connection during this era. Bianco, Spence, and Wilkerson argue “the more salient an issue is to constituents, the more important electoral considerations are to a legislator, and the greater the incentive to vote the constituency” (1996, 151). In his discussion of electoral accountability in the modern Congress, Arnold (1990) indicates that we should expect to find legislators being rewarded or punished for their behavior on only the most salient votes taken in Congress, of which very few occur during any given year. Failing to identify evidence of retrospective punishment in conjunction with this vote would go a long way toward demonstrating that the electoral connection is less applicable than in the modern candidate‐centered Congress.         "
"6","The 1824 presidential election remains one of the most (in)famous elections in American history. The unprecedented four‐way contest between John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, William H. Crawford, and Andrew Jackson ended with none of the candidates able to garner a majority in the Electoral College. In accordance with the 12th Amendment, the U.S. House of Representatives selected from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College (which in this case meant that Henry Clay was no longer in the running). Each state delegation was given one vote where the outcome was decided by a majority vote within each state delegation. For our purposes, the most important point to note is that this process forced each member of the 18th Congress to make a highly public vote for one of the presidential candidates.         "
"7","Balloting for the president took place in February of 1825, which was part of the lame duck session of the 18th Congress. As is well known, John Quincy Adams emerged victorious but not without controversy. Many charged that Adams had “bought” his victory through a backroom arrangement with Henry Clay in which the latter would deliver his supporters to Adams in exchange for being named Secretary of State. Charges of a “corrupt bargain” cast a cloud over Adams' election and became a defining issue in the subsequent congressional election.         "
"8","Whether or not there was actually a bargain struck between Adams and Clay is an open question that has tantalized historians and political scientists alike. Previous research, however, is mixed on whether there was a corrupt bargain, but the most systematic study to date (Jenkins and Sala 1998) concludes that there is little evidence to support this thesis. We are persuaded by Jenkins and Sala's evidence that a backroom deal between Adams and Clay likely did not occur. Indeed, political observers of the time doubted the veracity of the corrupt bargain story (Ratcliffe 2000, 203–04). Nevertheless, charges of a corrupt bargain, and shirking on the part of legislators, served as a potent rallying cry during the subsequent congressional campaigns.         "
"9","Although the determinants of the 1824 presidential election is not the main focus of this article, we want to briefly offer some evidence to suggest that at least some members, while perhaps not engaged in ideological shirking, nevertheless shirked the revealed preferences of their constituency. We can do this by looking at the presidential vote within each district and comparing MCs voting with the preferences of their district. In Table 1, we list the percentage of MCs who voted for a presidential candidate that was different from what the majority of voters in their district voted for.4 Although most MCs voted in line with their district, there is still a substantial number who voted against the majority wishes of their district. In addition, there is a significant difference between MCs who were elected to return to the 19th Congress and lame‐duck MCs. The latter group was significantly more likely to shirk district preferences, which is in line with modern findings on lame‐duck MCs (Nokken 2003).         "
"10","What impact did this constituency level shirking have on the 1826–27 election? There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that opposition leaders and opportunistic challengers discerned that those who voted against the wishes of their district would be ripe targets for ouster. In Ohio, for example, Jackson party leaders created an explicit “black‐list” of candidates who had voted for Adams yet were from districts with strong Jackson support. Legislators who were placed on this black‐list were specifically targeted by the Jacksonians, who pumped numerous campaign resources into those districts and sought to inform voters that the representatives had shirked the will of voters. For instance, Jacksonians published, and widely distributed, a pamphlet entitled The Voice of the People, which directly attacked members of the black‐list for defying their districts and voting for Adams (Ratcliffe 2002, 128).         "
"11","Political observer Hezekiah Niles wrote that in the effort to oust one of these black‐list MCs—John Sloane (OH‐12th District)—“A Jackson press was established, and hundreds of Jacksonian papers were weekly distributed gratis, filled with the vilest calumnies against the administration and Mr. Sloane” (Niles Weekly Register 11/11/1826, quoted in Ratcliffe 2002, 128). Although Sloane hung onto the seat, it was by the slimmest of margins (98 votes).         "
"12","Similar efforts were employed in Illinois, where the lone incumbent Daniel Cook gave Illinois' vote to Adams despite Jackson having won a majority of the electoral vote in Illinois. Cook went on to lose to the state legislator Joseph Duncan who made Cook's defiance the central issue in the campaign (Leonard 2002, 70–71). In Missouri, where Jackson won 10 times the number of votes than Adams, the incumbent John Scott nevertheless gave his vote to Adams.5 He was subsequently tossed out of office (Mering 1967, 10–12). Similar dynamics could be found in Maryland (Haller 1962) and Kentucky (Remini 1963).         "
"13","There is therefore ample evidence to suggest that how legislators voted on this highly visible issue became a central issue in the ensuing congressional campaigns. In particular, those who voted “out of step” with their districts became targets for ouster by the opposition. If there was an electoral connection—where voters sanctioned members who voted against district preferences—then we should expect to see incumbents from districts where Jackson had run strong, but the MC voted for someone other than Jackson, suffer in the subsequent election."
"14","Our main expectation is that members who voted for Adams, yet were from districts with strong Jackson support suffered a significant vote loss in the congressional elections of 1826–27. This would be evidence that legislators were retrospectively sanctioned for shirking the interests of their districts. To test this expectation, we estimate the following model (where we excluded uncontested races):            "
"15","Our dependent variable is the percentage of the two‐party vote received by the incumbent in the 1826–27 election.6 Our data for this variable comes from Dubin's (1998)United States Congressional Elections, 1788–1997. Using this source of candidate information, we were able to collect the names of the incumbent and challengers, the vote totals on which percentages of the two‐party vote were computed, as well as partisan affiliation for each candidate. The latter was supplemented with information contained in Martis (1989).         "
"16","Our key test is an interaction between the district‐level presidential vote and how each legislator voted in the House balloting for president. Since the presidential vote in congressional districts has not been compiled systematically prior to the 1950s, we had to construct it for the 1826–27 elections. To do this, we utilized Dubin's (2002)United States Presidential Elections, 1788–1860 which reports presidential vote data at the county‐level and matched this up with congressional district maps (Martis 1982; Parsons, Beach, and Herrmann 1978). Since districts in this era were typically comprised of one or more whole counties, we were able to match up districts and counties for over 90% of the congressional districts.7"
"17","We are also interested in examining the effects of experienced candidates on incumbent electoral performance. While most scholars of congressional elections agree that the “quality” of the congressional challenger plays an important role in affecting elections in the contemporary era (Jacobson 1989), we know far less about its effect on elections prior to the mid‐twentieth century (but see Carson and Roberts 2005; Carson et al. 2001). This is due to the lack of sufficient data on candidates' political backgrounds across time, thus making it difficult to offer broad generalizations on the effects of candidate quality during this era.         "
"18","We took advantage of the increased amount of turnover in the House during this era by utilizing the online Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, 1774 to Present in an attempt to overcome this limitation. This resource helped us collect information on candidates who either defeated incumbents or served prior to or after the election in question. We supplemented this data with information found on “The Political Graveyard's” website.8 Background data was also collected from the New York Times Historical Index and Google. Utilizing these sources, we were able to collect background data on 75% of the candidates seeking office.9"
"19","We also include Poole and Rosenthal's (1997) first dimension DW‐Nominate scores in our analysis. This variable allows us to control for the ideological extremity of legislators which has been shown to be related to incumbent success in the modern era (Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002). Lastly, we include a dummy variable indicating how each legislator (or their predecessor) voted during the House balloting. This data comes from Martis (1989).         "
"20","To enhance the internal validity of our study, we take advantage of the peculiar timing of the presidential election. Balloting for the election took place in February of 1825, which was part of the lame‐duck session of the 18th Congress. Of those voting on the presidential question, 131 legislators had already been elected to return to the 19th Congress, while 81 were lame ducks (having either been defeated or not seeking reelection). Thus in the subsequent 19th Congress there were two types of representatives—returning members who had voted in the presidential election, and a batch of freshmen who, obviously, did not play a role in the outcome. This dichotomy is important in that it offers us a design with a “treatment” group (those who voted in the presidential election) and a comparison group (those who had not voted on the election).            "
"21","To more clearly see this, consider two hypothetical districts. In the first, the MC served in the 18th Congress, was elected to return to the 19th Congress, voted in February, and ran for reelection in 1826. In this district, evidence of the electoral connection would manifest itself in the form of retrospective sanctions or rewards. In the second district, there is a new member who won for the first time in 1824, did not vote in the presidential balloting, and then served in the 19th Congress and ran for reelection. Rewards or punishment based on shirking in the presidential election—which we capture by looking at how the incumbents' predecessor from that district voted in the presidential question—should not be relevant in this district.            "
"22","This design also allows us to control for any national level forces, such as an anti‐administration or anti‐incumbent backlash, which may sweep across all districts and therefore isolate the individual level consequences of shirking. Thus the strategy we will pursue is to estimate Equation 1 twice—once for returning MCs and then again for new MCs. We briefly considered pooling the two groups together and letting each coefficient vary across groups, but this led to various triple interactions (e.g., District Vote * MC Vote * Returning/New MC), making interpretation difficult and also creating serious multicollinearity problems (Nagler 1991).            "
"23","There are a couple of potential threats to the internal validity of this design that should be acknowledged. The first is that selection into the groups is not random. If those legislators who shirked district opinion bailed out at a higher rate, because they anticipated their behavior would cost them at the polls, then a potential selection bias may enter into our study (Achen 1986). We did not find any evidence, however, to support a strategic retirement hypothesis. Running a logit with “incumbent seeking reelection” as the dependent variable, and the same covariates as in our model, we find that the interaction between district‐level presidential vote and MC voting was not a significant predictor of retirement. The second threat is a potential “regression to the mean” effect. New members may be the beneficiary of a “sophomore surge.” Since little evidence exists suggesting that there were strong incumbency, or sophomore surge (Erikson 1971), effects in the antebellum era, we feel comfortable in treating our two groups as roughly equivalent.10"
"24","The results are presented in Table 2.11 The first column presents results for MCs who served in both the 18th and 19th Congresses. The coefficient on the interaction between district‐level vote and voting for Adams in the House balloting is negative and significant: incumbents who voted for Adams suffered a .38% vote dropoff (−.52 + .14) for every percent of Jackson support in their district. Thus, in a district with 50% of the vote going to Jackson, and the incumbent voting for Adams, we would expect to see the incumbents' vote reduced by 19% in the 1826–27 election, all else equal. We do not find a significant interaction, however, for MCs who voted for Crawford. This is most likely due to the ideological similarity between Jackson and Crawford such that voting for Crawford did not merit the wrath of voters in the same way that voting for Adams did.12 In a separate analysis (not shown) we combined votes for Jackson and Crawford into a simple dummy variable (i.e., Adams/Not Adams). The results are similar.            "
"25","For freshmen legislators (see column two), the interactions are not significant for either Adams or Crawford. MCs who were from Jacksonian strongholds, but where the previous incumbent voted for Adams, were not punished at the polls. This finding further supports the claim that voters were punishing (or in some cases rewarding) MCs for their voting behavior."
"26","Additionally, the main effects of both the district‐level presidential vote and MCs voting on the presidential question are not significant for either group. This result serves to bolster our main hypothesis. We do not see a general reaction against people who voted for Adams or Crawford, per se, nor is there evidence of a general anti‐administration backlash. Instead, the electoral effects of MCs voting are conditional on district‐level public opinion. It is only when MCs voted against district‐level public opinion that they suffered a significant vote‐loss."
"27","Also noteworthy is that the challenger quality coefficient is negative and significant for both groups. The size of this coefficient is quite large (−21.8 and −15.9, respectively), indicating that when a quality challenger entered a race, incumbent vote margins took a large hit. Although this coefficient is significant for both groups it is six points larger for returning MCs. Whether or not the effect of quality candidates is a consequence of challengers directly causing incumbent vote losses, challengers entering strategically, or some combination thereof, is an open question that we do not fully resolve here."
"28","While the previous results are consistent with a story of individual accountability, we further tested for retrospective punishment by more explicitly controlling for factional affiliation. Specifically, we compared the performance of returning anti‐Jacksonians who voted for Adams with freshmen anti‐Jacksonians whose predecessor voted for Adams. Comparing within this subset of legislators allows us to directly hold constant both factional affiliation and MC behavior, while varying how “out‐of‐step” these MCs were with their district (as measured by the district‐level presidential vote). To test for differences in retrospective punishment among these two groups, we interact the district‐level presidential vote with a dummy variable indicating whether or not the representative is a “freshman MC.” If legislators were held individually accountable for voting against their constituents, then there should be a significant difference between returning and freshmen MCs.            "
"29","In Table 3 this is precisely what we find. The coefficient for the stand‐alone presidential vote (here representing districts with “returning MCs”) is negative, while the interaction between the presidential vote and “freshmen MCs” is positive and significant, indicating a substantial difference between the two groups of anti‐Jacksonians. In column two of Table 3, we repeat the analysis for pro‐Jacksonians, comparing legislators who voted for Jackson with freshmen whose predecessor voted for Jackson. Using the Adams district‐level presidential vote as our measure of district preferences, we again find a negative coefficient for returning MCs and a positive and significant interaction for freshmen. Overall, these results further demonstrate that returning members were penalized at the polls for behavior that was “out‐of‐step” with their district.            "
"30","We also consider the prospect of incumbent reelection. In the election, 170 incumbents sought reelection while 32 (18%) were defeated. To determine if the presidential question affected the likelihood of victory, we fit a logit model with “incumbent victory” as the dependent variable and the same independent variables used earlier. The results, shown in Table 4, support the view that incumbents were punished for “shirking” constituency preferences. As before, the coefficient on the interaction between Jackson district vote and MCs who voted for Adams is significant and negative. In probabilistic terms, this would reflect a 10% decline in the likelihood of incumbent victory. Moreover, this interaction is not significant for freshmen.13 In addition, the coefficient for challenger quality is negative and significant, but for both groups.            "
"31","The Jacksonians emerged from the 1826–27 election victorious having taken control of the House with a narrow 113 to 104 majority. To what extent did constituency level shirking contribute to this turnover in partisan control? To investigate this question, we compare the partisan control of the House under two scenarios. First, we estimate election outcomes—the number of seats held by each party—that result from shirking. Then we create an alternative scenario in which no shirking occurred. Comparing the actual outcome with this counterfactual allows us to estimate the impact constituency shirking had on party control of the House."
"32","To estimate this we have simulated elections under two scenarios. First, to serve as a baseline, we use our estimates to rerun the 1826–27 election holding all district‐level variables at their actual values. Second, we examine a simple counterfactual: what would have happened if none of the MCs who voted for Adams had shirked? To construct these simulations we take advantage of the Clarify software which allows us to simulate election outcomes from our results (Tomz, Wittenberg, and King 2000).         "
"33","To create a baseline, we use the model estimated in the first column of Table 1 to create one thousand simulated outcomes of the 1826–27 election (as depicted in Figure 1). Specifically, we set the independent variables to their actual values for each district and then simulate election outcomes across these districts one thousand times in order to generate a distribution of seats won by Adams' party. To assess the magnitude of the effect of a change in constituency, we need to compare the area of the histogram that falls to the right of the 50% threshold across the two scenarios. This critical value reflects the number of cases in which a shift in constituency level characteristics leads to a change in control of the House. If this area increases, this suggests that constituency is exerting a large impact on the partisan make‐up of the chamber.         "
"34","                 Simulating Party Control of the House                      "
"35"," Note: These figures plot the frequency distribution of the percent of Adams MCs in the House for 1000 simulated elections. The simulations were generated using the Clarify software (Tomz, Wittenberg, and King 2000).                     "
"36","The top panel of Figure 1 presents the frequency distribution of the simulated percentages of Adams supporters in the House. The mean percentage of Adams supporters is 49.34% with a standard deviation of 1.62. In this panel, about one‐third of the area lies to the right of the 50% threshold, suggesting that the Adams party becomes the majority party in 33% of the simulated elections.         "
"37","Next we examine a simple counterfactual: what would have happened if MCs who voted for Adams did not have any Jackson support in their district? We did this by again setting all the values of the independent variables to their actual values for each district but this time setting the interaction between Jackson vote in the district and a MC voting for Adams to zero. In other words, we eliminate the possibility for constituency shirking for MCs who supported Adams. Following the procedure above we generate one thousand election outcomes. The results of this counterfactual, presented in the bottom half of Figure 1, are striking. The frequency distribution shifts to the right; the mean percentage of Adams supporters is now 51.43% with a standard deviation of 1.45. Under this scenario, we predict that the Adams party would have been the majority in 79% of the elections (which is greater than our baseline model).14 Thus if there had been no retrospective punishment by voters in the 1826–27 election based on the presidential question, then the Adams faction would quite likely have kept control of the House.15"
"38","In this article, we have used the unique circumstances of the 1826–27 election to provide a test of the connections between representative behavior, voter opinion, and electoral outcomes in the antebellum era. Using presidential vote at the district level, we were able to directly test the linkages between representative behavior and subsequent electoral outcomes. We found that MCs who voted for Adams, yet were from districts with strong Jacksonian support, suffered at the polls in the ensuing congressional elections. Thus, in an era long before the emergence of candidate‐centered campaigns, we have found evidence of individual MCs being punished at the polls for their voting behavior. We also find that the presence of an experienced challenger had a substantial, negative effect on incumbent vote margins. No previous study has ever examined the impact of quality challengers this early in American politics, much less found an effect."
"39","To be clear, we are not asserting that an electoral connection was as important during this era of congressional politics as it is today. Indeed, the evidence presented here concerning a single, exceptional vote taken in the U.S. House of Representatives is insufficient to support such a claim. Rather, we are suggesting that our findings challenge the conventionally held view that these two eras of politics are completely dissimilar. As Bianco, Spence, and Wilkerson note, “the conventional wisdom sees no role for the electoral connection in any analysis of the early Congress” (1996, 168). Our results, however, cast doubt on this perspective by demonstrating that legislators could indeed be held accountable by their constituents during this early era of congressional politics. Future research will be needed to fully determine the extent to which electoral accountability existed on other, perhaps less atypical, roll‐call votes in the nineteenth century.         "
"40","Our findings also shed much needed light on a long‐neglected election. Despite the importance of the 1826–27 election for American political development, there has been no systematic study ever conducted of this historic election. A considerable amount of attention has been given to the presidential elections of 1824 and 1828, and with justification. These two elections traditionally demark the birth place of the second party system, ushering in the “partisan era” that would last until the realignment of 1896 (Aldrich 1995; McCormick 1966; Silbey 1991). The dramatic showdown in the House after the 1824 election, and the subsequent triumph of Jackson in 1828, make for riveting reading. Yet, wedged in between these two presidential elections stands an election largely consigned to the dustbin of history. This is unfortunate. The congressional election of 1826–27 marks the beginning of a pattern—the midterm decline—that would repeat itself over the next 180 years of American political life.         "
