"1","Work in social identity theory demonstrates that people automatically categorize everybody in their social environment into ingroups (groups to which they belong) and outgroups. Laboratory experiments consistently and robustly show that once people feel part of a group, their affect toward that group and its members becomes more positive (De Cremer and Van Vugt 1999; Gaertner and Dovidio 2000; Kramer and Brewer 1984). Even when the attachments are to temporary, superficial, and explicitly meaningless identities, people tend to evaluate the performance of ingroup members more highly and tend to distribute rewards and positive performance evaluations in ways that elevate their group. Experimental subjects manifest this effect even when imposing an intergroup differential comes at the expense of lowering the total amount of rewards that they distribute (Billig and Tajfel 1973; Brewer and Kramer 1985).            "
"2","Social identity theory spawned many intellectual descendants. One, self‐categorization theory (Turner 1985), emphasizes the multiplicity of identities that people can adopt and how easily different identities can become salient. Later work made an extremely important discovery. When people recategorize others from being members of an outgroup to being members of a shared ingroup, the same biases that increase the positive evaluations of ingroup members will be directed toward these new members of their ingroup. This is particularly important for intergroup relations because it is often more feasible for people to emphasize certain identities than for people to cease perceiving and using social categories. Gaertner et al. make the point well:            "
"3","                              "
"4","When the salience of the categorized boundary is reduced but members are left with a superordinate or one‐group representation, the cognitive and motivational processes that initially brought in‐group members closer to the self could be redirected toward the establishment of more positive relations with the former out‐group members. With a one‐group representation, bias should be reduced primarily because the social distance with former out‐group members has decreased and the social distance with former in‐group members has remained relatively close. (Gaertner et al. 1989, 240)                  "
"5","Similarly, based on several studies, Kramer and Brewer conclude that “salience of a collective or common social identity may result in greater weight being given to joint (collective) gains over individual gains alone. Inclusion within a common social boundary acts to reduce social distance among group members, making it less likely that they will make sharp distinctions between their own and others' welfare” (1984, 1045). Other research also shows that ingroup biases can be redirected to benefit those who were previously considered part of an outgroup by forming or emphasizing a broad identity that encompasses both the previous ingroup and outgroup(s) (Gaertner et al. 1999; Smith and Tyler 1996).2"
"6","The conceptualization and operationalization of identity used in this research is drawn from an intellectual descendant of both social identity and self‐categorization theories: the Common Ingroup Identity Model (CIIM; Gaertner and Dovidio 2000; Gaertner et al. 1999). The Common Ingroup Identity Model distinguishes between subgroup identities and superordinate identities.3Subgroup identities have boundaries that define other people as members of outgroups (i.e., exclusive boundaries instead of shared or nested identities). Research shows that when subgroup identities are salient, people will evaluate distributional decisions from the perspective that only one group will benefit (Smith and Tyler 1996), and they will want that group to be their own. Superordinate identities are broad identities with potential outgroup identities nested within them. Identity‐based theories predict that when a superordinate identity is salient, people will emphasize whether the proposal will benefit the broader group as a whole when making decisions about common resources and policies (Kramer and Brewer 1984; Smith and Tyler 1996). These predictions have important implications for political attitudes and choices.            "
"7","For example, according to these theories when a subgroup identity is salient (e.g., one's home state), people will focus their considerations of spending on bridges and highways on how much will be spent in their state. If the public works will be in their state, they are more likely to support the spending, and if the public works will not, they are more likely to oppose it. When superordinate identity is salient (e.g., the nation), people will focus on whether the spending will improve the infrastructure and efficiency of the country as a whole. Support and opposition to the spending will be based more on the proposal itself rather than on the location of the direct beneficiaries (Smith and Tyler 1996). This subgroup/superordinate framework maps nicely onto American race relations. Black and white racial identities can operate as subgroup identities or be subsumed under a superordinate American identity.            "
"8","Applying social identity theory to American race relations is especially interesting because it may provide an explanation of policy particularism.4 The politics‐centered approach to explaining racial policy preferences claims that most Americans do not process racial issues very differently from other political issues (Sniderman and Carmines 1997). Instead, this approach claims that racial policy attitudes are best understood as extensions of the common struggle in American politics between liberalism and conservatism. According to their argument, in the case of racially relevant policies like affirmative action, it is the design and implementation of the programs that generate opposition. Specifically, research by Sniderman and Carmines (1997) suggests that policy particularism is the driving force behind white opposition to programs like affirmative action. The authors point out that many of the programs intended to implement racial equality restrict their benefits to African Americans. They argue that this exclusive quality causes the gap between whites' principled commitments to racial equality and their support for the programs intended to implement those principles (Schuman et al. 1997). In Sniderman and Carmines' (1997) terms, the programs lose support because they are particularistic.5 From a social identity perspective, this makes perfect sense. Exclusivity creates the perception of group boundaries. It could well be that social identity theory describes the psychological underpinnings of policy particularism.            "
"9","The School Tax Experiment is one of the empirical building blocks of Sniderman and Carmines' (1997) theory of policy particularism. In the course of a telephone survey,6 respondents were informed that they were about to be asked a question concerning whether “taxes need to be raised to take care of pressing national needs.” Half of the respondents were then randomly assigned to be asked whether they would be willing to have their taxes raised “to improve educational opportunities for minorities.” The other half of the respondents were asked if they would be willing to have their taxes raised “to improve education in public schools.”Sniderman and Carmines (1997) found that 65% of their white respondents supported the tax in the public schools condition and 46% supported the tax in the minority opportunity condition. They argue that the particularism of the minority policy proposal creates the difference because the public schools version is “race‐neutral” but the version that mentions minorities is “race‐specific.”7"
"10","The current research seeks to understand the relationship between identity salience and policy particularism. If a positive attachment to American national identity can diminish the salience and importance of subgroup boundaries, then that attachment has important implications for the study of racial policy preferences. Specifically, it implies that particularism's effects can be moderated (Baron and Kenny 1986) by identity salience.            "
"11","Synthesizing these theories leads to an interesting question. If a person with a salient superordinate identity faces a decision about a particularistic program, which factor will have more influence, particularism or the superordinate identity? This research varies both of these influences and tests whether the identity salience effect is a fragile and/or weak effect that only matters in the lab or is potent enough to erase an established causal influence on a deeply entrenched division in American society: race. The survey experiment described below was designed to sort out these theoretical expectations by testing the following hypotheses:"
"12"," H1: (Superordinate Identification Salience) When a superordinate identity is salient there will be more support for the proposed tax because each respondent's ingroup biases will be applied more broadly.         "
"13"," H2: (Particularism) There will be less support for the particularistic version of a program than for a broader version to the extent that the particularistic version does not directly benefit the respondent's subgroup.         "
"14"," H3: (Identity‐Particularism Interaction) When a positive attachment to a superordinate identity is salient, the difference in support caused by policy particularism will be diminished (or erased).         "
"15","H3a: (Increased Closeness) The gap between support for the broader and particularistic programs will close because of gains in support for the more particularistic program, not by reducing support for the broader program."
"16","Hypothesis 1 follows from the CIIM and other identity‐based approaches by expecting broader identification to lead to more willingness to contribute to public goods, common resources, and other collective resources (Kramer and Brewer 1984). Hypothesis 2 states that I expect this survey experiment to replicate the particularism effect found by Sniderman and Carmines (1997). Hypothesis 3 concerns the interaction between identity salience and particularism. This hypothesis claims that American identity will operate as a superordinate identity, and as predicted by the CIIM, whites' national ties to minorities will be accentuated over racial and ethnic differences. Hypothesis 3a is derived from the process of recategorization described by Gaertner and colleagues' work (1989, 1999; Gaertner and Dovidio 2000). Specifically when members of an outgroup are recategorized into a shared superordinate identity, affect and attitudes toward the (newly recognized) ingroup members become more positive. Additionally, De Cremer and Van Vugt (1999) find that superordinate identities increase support for public goods by increasing the value that people place on the public goods. Hypothesis 3a would be disconfirmed if the gap closed because affect and attitudes toward the members of the initial ingroup became less positive and affect and attitudes toward the former members of the outgroup remained the same.         "
"17","The data come from a survey experiment embedded in the Minnesota Multi‐Investigator Survey (MMIS), which was a random sample of a major metropolitan area (Minneapolis‐St. Paul and the surrounding counties) in the summer of 1998 (see the appendix).8 To ensure comparability with the School Tax Experiment and the validity of the identity treatments, the analyses that follow were restricted to respondents who self‐identified as whites and as American citizens.9"
"18","Priming the different identities was done by randomly assigning the respondents to one of two questions designed to prime the respondents' identification with either a subgroup identity or a superordinate identity (see Chong, Citrin, and Conley 2001 for a similar use of questions‐as‐treatments as well as the School Tax Experiment itself).10 Half of the respondents were randomly assigned to be asked, “How close do you feel to your ethnic or racial group?” in order to make a subgroup identity salient.11 The other half were randomly assigned to be asked, “How close do you feel to other Americans?” to make a superordinate identity salient.12"
"19","Using questions‐as‐treatments accomplished two things. First, by asking people to think about their closeness to a certain group, it brought the respondents' thoughts and feelings about their relationship to that group to the “top of their heads” (Zaller 1992), and in doing so raised the salience of that identity. Second, by asking people whether they feel close to that identity, each question‐as‐treatment measured the degree to which people felt attached to the identity they were asked about.            "
"20"," Figure 1 shows the hypothesized effect of the identity treatments. When people's racial or ethnic group is made salient (the left side of Figure 1), the boundary between their subgroup and any other subgroup(s) is more salient, as signified by the dark lines of the subgroup identity boundaries. The shared national identity still exists, but it is not salient. The right side of Figure 1 shows the hypothesized effect of the American national identity treatment. Here the national identity boundary is thick and heavy. By making national identity salient, subgroup boundaries fade from perception and in importance.            "
"21","                 Identity Treatments                         "
"22","This identity treatment was immediately followed by the question‐as‐treatment that served as both the particularism treatment and as the dependent variable. These questions are exact copies of the items used in the School Tax Experiment. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the following two questions: “Some people have said that taxes need to be raised to take care of pressing national needs. How willing would you be to have your taxes raised to improve education in public schools?” or “Some people have said that taxes need to be raised to take care of pressing national needs. How willing would you be to have your taxes raised to improve educational opportunities for minorities?”13 Respondents had four response options: very willing, somewhat willing, not very willing, or not at all willing. The content of the question (mentioning public schools or minorities) serves as a particularism treatment, and their response to the question serves as the dependent variable in the analyses that follow.            "
"23","The stem shared by both versions of the dependent variable made the proposals rather challenging to support.14 The question explicitly mentions an unpopular feature: taxes (Edsall and Edsall 1992; Schuman et al. 1997). Additionally, the respondents are not reacting only to taxes in the abstract; they are asked how willing they would be to see their own taxes increased. Compared to the weighty matters of race and taxes, the mere difference of thinking about a certain identity seems unlikely to be able to influence these decisions, yet it does.            "
"24","The four‐category dependent variable was recoded to range from zero to one. As hypothesized (H1), there is greater willingness to have taxes increased among the people who were asked how close they feel to other Americans (ordered probit b = .19, s.e. = .12, p < .10). Interestingly, the particularism treatment is basically the mirror image of the identity treatment. There is less support for the taxation among the respondents who received the minority opportunity form of the question. The difference in support is marginally significant (ordered probit b = ‐.19 s.e. = .12, p = .100). This pattern of results replicates the School Tax Experiment, and there are several points to be drawn from this analysis. First, Hypothesis 2 is supported at the p < .10 level of significance.15 Second, it shows that the treatment succeeded in creating a particularism effect with which the identity salience effect can be compared.               "
"25"," Table 1 shows the effects of both of the experimental treatments. The highest and lowest levels of support are in the cells that one would expect after synthesizing identity‐ and politics‐centered explanations. These are the only two cells that significantly differ from each other. That is, the mean score (.46) for the respondents who received the subgroup identity treatment and the minority opportunity condition of the particularism treatment is significantly less than the mean score (.57) of the respondents who received the superordinate identity treatment and the public schools condition of the particularism treatment (two‐tailed t = 2.22, p < .05). The other mean differences are not statistically significant.               "
"26","The purpose of the identity treatment was to induce one of two mental states in each respondent: either closeness to the respondent's ethnic/racial group or closeness to the respondent's national identity. The pattern of results in Table 1 masks an important interaction between the treatment to which people were assigned and the respondents' reactions to the identity treatments. Since the treatments were done as questions, we know both to which treatment the respondents were assigned and how they reacted to that treatment. The data reveal that the intended mental state (positive attachment to either a subgroup or superordinate identity) was not always induced. Some respondents16 said that they felt “not very close” or “not at all close” to the identity to which they were assigned. This creates an opportunity to study both attachment to, and rejection of, a given identity. When people express an attachment to the group which they were offered, the predictions of the CIIM should hold. When people deny an attachment, they instead regard the group in question with indifference or perhaps as an outgroup. If the latter is the case, we do not expect to see the ingroup effects predicted by the CIIM; in fact rejecting an identity should have the opposite effect of embracing one because it amounts to explicitly endorsing an outgroup boundary (see Huddy 2001).               "
"27","A hypothetical example illustrates why respondents' reactions to the identity questions‐as‐treatments are relevant to testing hypotheses about identity salience. Consider a study that randomly assigned half of its subjects to eat a low‐carbohydrate diet and left the other half as a control group. If some of the subjects in the low‐carbohydrate treatment condition fail to follow the diet under study, their results will obscure rather than illuminate the effects of the diet being studied. Researchers can learn about the combined feasibility and effectiveness of implementing the diet by analyzing the treatment group as a whole, but to isolate the effects of the diet they should focus on the subjects who complied with their assignment to the diet under study. In this example, mean differences between the treatment and control conditions (or the lack thereof) conflate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the diet being studied.               "
"28","The situation in the MMIS experiment is actually starker than the scenario described above. The respondents who denied feeling close to their assigned identity did not simply fail to accept the primed identity, they explicitly rejected it. They are not just untreated, as in the hypothetical diet study; if anything they entered the opposite of the intended mental state. To continue the diet‐study analogy, they did not just fail to follow the low‐carbohydrate diet; instead they binged on carbohydrates. Looking back at Figure 1, people who do not express closeness to the primed identity are denying an attachment to the group.               "
"29"," Table 2 isolates the effects of positive identity salience (rather than just exposure to an identity prime) by showing the means for the respondents who said that they feel very or somewhat close to the identity to which they were assigned. That is, it incorporates a manipulation check into the analysis. Table 2 shows the effect predicted by Hypothesis 3. In the subgroup identity condition, the particularism treatment appears to induce lower support for minority opportunity (.44) than for the public schools (.54).17 In the superordinate identity condition, there is very little difference. Mean support for minority opportunity is .55 and .53 for the public schools.18 Moreover, across the two identity conditions, there was almost no change in support for the public schools (.54 vs. .55).               "
"30","The particularism effect was eliminated by a marginally significant increase in support for the minority opportunity tax (from .44 to .53, two‐tailed t = 1.63, p = .11). As predicted by Hypothesis 3a, it appears that when people felt attached to the superordinate identity, the former outgroup members came to be psychologically processed more like ingroup members. Importantly, this shows that the identity effect is not the product of a zero‐sum game. The increase in support for the “new” ingroup members does not mean losses for the former ingroup members."
"31","My claim is that embracing or rejecting an identity that has become salient matters. Therefore I hypothesize that acceptance of an identity prime modifies the prime's effect. While isolating cases is one way to test this hypothesis, another way is to explicitly model an interaction between identity acceptance and the identity effects. The following analysis uses all available cases and models identity acceptance as a preexisting construct that moderates the interaction between identity salience and particularism."
"32","I created an identity‐acceptance variable by combining responses to the two identity questions‐as‐treatments into one variable that measures the intensity of each respondent's attachment to the identity to which they were assigned.19 Regardless of which identity question a respondent encountered, the identity‐acceptance variable indicates the degree to which that respondent reported that he or she was experiencing the intended positive association with that identity.20 In Jaccard's (2001) nomenclature, the focal variable is policy particularism. The identity salience treatment is a first‐order moderator (testing whether identity salience affects the strength of policy particularism), and acceptance of the identity treatment is a second‐order moderator (testing whether acceptance of the assigned identity affects identity's effect on policy particularism). One way to interpret the coefficient on the three‐way interaction term is that it tests whether at higher levels of identity acceptance the superordinate identity prime (Identity = 1) alters the effect of the particularism treatment when respondents decide whether to support minority opportunity (Particularism = 1).               "
"33","The identity‐acceptance variable was used in the following model, which was estimated with ordered probit:"
"34","Support for Tax Increase =b0+b1 Identity Condition +b2 Identity‐Acceptance +b3 Particularism Condition +b4 Identity‐Acceptance * Identity Condition +b5 Identity‐Acceptance * Particularism Condition +b6 Identity Condition * Particularism Condition +b7 Identity‐Acceptance * Identity Condition * Particularism Condition + Controls (in models 2 and 3) + error. (1)               "
"35","The treatments are dummy variables. The acceptance variable is centered on the mean for white citizens as are the control variables (Aiken and West 1991; Jaccard 2001). Recall that H3 predicts that superordinate identity will increase support in the minority opportunity condition, but only for people with a positive attachment to their experimentally assigned identity. Therefore H3 can only be properly tested by making a superordinate identity salient, so the three‐way interaction term, which is positive when the three conditions are met and zero otherwise, is a critical test of the hypothesis.               "
"36","The results are shown in model 1 of Table 3. The positive and significant coefficient on the three‐way interaction supports Hypothesis 3.21 The coefficient means that willingness to pay the proposed tax in the minority opportunity condition increases when respondents receive the superordinate identity treatment and accept their attachment to that superordinate identity.22 (Three‐way interactions are difficult to visualize. The pattern of results will become clearer when the predicted probabilities are graphed in the next section of the article after a brief discussion of the validity of the identity‐acceptance analysis.)               "
"37","This analysis introduces a variable, acceptance of the assigned identity, that is not randomly assigned. There is a possibility that effects that appear to be results of the experimental treatments are actually the result of preexisting attitudes.23 Fortunately, the MMIS measured variables that allow me to test for threats to the internal validity of the survey experiment.               "
"38","It could be that the experimental effect is actually a product of stable differences in group identification and that the degree of acceptance, not the assignment to one identity or another, drives the identity findings.24 By treating the data as two parallel surveys, I can examine the direct effects of strength of attachment to each identity on willingness to support the tax. Using only the cases that were asked about how close they feel to other Americans, an ordered probit shows no evidence of a significant relationship between closeness to other Americans and support for the tax increase (ordered probit b = ‐.17, s.e. = .38, p = .66). Similarly, white citizens' closeness to their ethnic or racial group does not significantly predict support for the tax increase (ordered probit b = ‐.15, s.e. = .29, p = .61).               "
"39","It could also be the case that the acceptance variable is serving as a proxy for some other construct. Models 2 and 3 of Table 1 add control variables to model 1 in order to address concerns about the identity‐acceptance variable being confounded with preexisting attitudes. Model 2 (“Full Model”) contains all of the plausible control variables that were available in the MMIS. Specifically, egalitarianism, the respondent's age, their ideology,25 a scale of factual political knowledge, party identification, and the respondent's favorability toward whites, blacks, Americans, and the federal government were added.26 Model 3 is a trimmed model designed to give the most efficient estimates of the experimental and control variables' effects.               "
"40","Both the full and the trimmed models show no evidence that identity acceptance is serving as proxies for the effects of preexisting attitudes. Highly plausible candidates like favorability toward whites, blacks, and “Americans” are not significantly related to the dependent variable.27 The three‐way interaction coefficient changes little across the three specifications. In all three models it is positive and significant. This suggests that even though some of the control variables are significantly correlated with identity acceptance, these correlations do not drive the relationship between the identity treatment and the dependent variable.28"
"41"," Figure 2 shows the predicted probabilities generated from model 3 in Table 3 (the trimmed model). The various panels show the relationship between the particularism treatment and the probability of supporting the tax increase across both identity treatments and by identity acceptance. The identity‐acceptance variable was dichotomized for ease of presentation, and the control variables were set to their mean values.29 The y‐axis shows the probability of respondents saying that they are somewhat willing or very willing to have their taxes raised.               "
"42","                 Probability of Supporting Tax by Particularism, Identity Salience, and Identity Acceptance                            "
"43","Taken as a whole, Figure 2 supports the hypotheses drawn from the CIIM and self‐categorization theory (H1, H3, and H3a). Panel 4 (the lower right) is the critical condition (especially in comparison to panel 2). It shows the degree to which the particularism treatment affects the probability of supporting the tax for respondents who received and embraced the superordinate identity. Unlike the other panels, there is barely any change across particularism conditions. As hypothesized, attachment to the superordinate identity eliminates the particularism effect. When a positive association with American identity is salient, support for taxes on behalf of minority opportunity barely differs from support for taxes on behalf of the public schools. The particularism effect that is so apparent in past research and in the other conditions disappears. As predicted by H3a, the line in the lower right‐hand panel is flat because of an increase in the willingness to support the taxes in the minority opportunity. Comparing the two panels on the right, the probability of supporting the tax for the public schools is .64 in both identity conditions. However, the probability of supporting the tax in the minority opportunity condition climbs from .5 in the subgroup condition to .61 in the superordinate condition.               "
"44","The other panels suggest how the content of the primed identities and the respondents' acceptance of those identities affect attitudes toward the proposed tax. The upper‐left panel shows the predicted probabilities when white respondents reject their racial or ethnic group identity. In this identity condition, respondents are more supportive when the proposed taxes are for minority opportunity than when they are for the public schools. Perhaps respondents reject whiteness to express solidarity with nonwhites. Conversely, when whites embrace an ethnic or racial identity (upper‐right panel), they are less likely to support the proposed taxes when they are targeted for minorities. The lower‐left panel is quite striking. Whites who reject their bonds with other Americans show much less support for the proposed taxes in the minority opportunity condition than they do in the public schools condition."
"45","The two panels on the left (1 and 3) should be interpreted with caution because the estimates are based on far fewer cases than panels 2 and 4. However, the pattern of results supports several of Huddy's (2001) contentions. As Huddy suggests, there are individual differences in receptivity to identity priming. Additionally, real‐world identities bring with them history and “baggage.” Some people do not feel positively toward some identities, and it appears that rejecting an identity is more powerful than embracing one. Since acquiescence bias and social norms would encourage respondents to accept a bond to their fellow Americans, rejecting this identity is a particularly vigorous act. However, the small number of cases in the conditions shown in panels 1 and 3 means this is almost purely speculation. Further research is needed before drawing this conclusion.               "
"46","These results suggest several substantive points. First, priming a positive attachment to a superordinate identity reduced the differences in support for the two policies created by the particularism treatment. This suggests that when the perceived relationship between whites and minorities is one of a shared identity, particularism loses its power to diminish whites' support for programs that benefit only minorities. That is, the particularism effect is contingent on the salient identity of the respondents. Second, the importance of particularism has been reinforced by this replication in a fresh data set.30"
"47","This study draws on social identity theory and research from social psychology, but is designed to have greater external validity than laboratory experiments. This addresses some of the concerns of political scientists who have noted that social identity theory's applicability to politics may be limited by the existing literature's heavy reliance on laboratory experiments and relative neglect of existing (and politically potent) identities (Huddy 2001). The artificiality and low stakes of the identities in laboratory studies raises concerns about the degree to which findings will generalize to the actual practice of politics.31 This study, on the other hand, uses “real‐world” identities, including racial, ethnic, and American national identity. Thus, the identity treatments used in this survey experiment lend greater external validity to claims about political implications of changes in identity salience. In addition to working with real‐world identities, this research did not pit identity against a null hypothesis of no identity effect whatsoever. Instead the survey experiment compared the strength of identity effects with the influence of an empirically established causal factor: policy particularism (Sniderman and Carmines 1997). Since the particularism effect was so thoroughly removed by the identity effect, there is some support for the idea that social identity processes underpin particularism.            "
"48","The sample used in this study also gives this research several advantages over much of the work done on identity in social psychology. Unlike laboratory studies done with samples of convenience in unfamiliar settings (Sears 1986), this sample is a random sample drawn from a major metropolitan area and the experimental treatments were administered to people in their typical milieu. Thus we have good reason to believe that variation in the salience of different identities matters for mass opinion and for policy attitudes.            "
"49","Finally, this research shows the importance of incorporating the valence and strength of people's identities into identity‐based research. Priming an identity can have different effects depending upon people's preexisting attitudes and affect toward that identity. It is particularly important to note that the identity prime on its own did not significantly alter the particularism effect, and the strength of the respondents' identification did not significantly affect their willingness to support the tax increase. The hypothesized effects only appear when both the strength and salience of identities are incorporated into the analysis. This supports Huddy's (2001, 2002) suggestions that social identity researchers pay more attention to the meanings individuals attach to their identities.            "
"50","In this study, identity acceptance/valence was not experimentally varied. It would be useful for future researchers to randomly assign positive or negative feelings toward identities as well as vary their salience. This would be a challenge with real‐world identities because people's preexisting attitudes and affect may not be easily changed. There may be an inherent tradeoff between artificial, but theoretically pure, identities and existing identities."
"51","Patriotism surged after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. American flags, “United We Stand” bumper stickers, and other displays of American national identity became ubiquitous. Popular culture and journalistic commentary was filled with references to Americans' new attachment to their identity as Americans. Some wondered how impulses toward exclusion and impulses toward inclusion would be affected by the strengthened attachment to American identity."
"52","Either an increase in inclusion or exclusion would be plausible. Serious external threats can exacerbate internal conflicts (e.g., Japanese internment and McCarthyism), and increased threat is one of the most potent sources of intolerance (Altemeyer 1988, 1996; Feldman and Stenner 1997; Marcus et al. 1995; Sullivan and Transue 1999; Sullivan et al. 1981). Conversely, threats can draw people together and cause them to unite against a common enemy. When people unite, other disputes are deemphasized (Klinkner 1999; Kramer and Brewer 1984; Traugott et al. 2002).         "
"53","This research finds that priming American identity erased the difference between whites' support for tax increases on behalf of the public schools and support for improving educational opportunities for minorities for those who felt close to other Americans. In this case, the evidence supports research from social psychology that shows that attachment to broader identities reduces intergroup bias rather than with theories that predict that raising the salience of national identity would lead to hostility toward outgroups. The general point that broader identities change the perception of distributional policies also fits with research in political science that suggests that broader political units can reduce ethnic conflict when properly designed (e.g., Horowitz 1985). By no means does this research dispute that nationalism can lead to intolerance, but it does serve as a reminder that national identification can also be a force for inclusion.         "
"54","These results also have interesting implications for the study of race and politics. When respondents' bonds to their ethnicity or race (both of which are subgroup categories) are uppermost in their minds, the pattern observed by Sniderman and Carmines (1997) emerges: the broader goal of improving the public schools generates more support among whites than the narrower goal of improving educational opportunities for minorities.32 This finding is easily extended to the pessimistic conclusion that racially relevant programs are always vulnerable if they are particularistic and that targeted programs will always struggle. From this, one could conclude that public policy can only advance racial equality as a byproduct of broad programs and policies, and that principles are ignored if they lead to intergroup transfers.         "
"55","However, this research finds that when people are reminded of a legitimate superordinate identity that subsumes racial differences, and they do not reject that identity, the particularism effect can be erased. Further, closing the gap did not come at the expense of support for a broader program. This suggests that it is not just a matter of who benefits from programs, but a matter of the perceived relationship between a person bearing costs and the beneficiaries. A reminder of common nationality appears to blunt the distributional implications of targeted programs, perhaps by changing the perception of the program from a zero‐sum transfer to one of a more cooperative relationship enhancing the shared national community."
