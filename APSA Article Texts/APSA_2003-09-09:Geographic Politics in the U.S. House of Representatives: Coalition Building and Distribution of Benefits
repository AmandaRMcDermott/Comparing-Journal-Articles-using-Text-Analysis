"1","House districts are nothing but electoral entities. With the exception of the seven states with only one congressional district, House districts are not administrative or governmental units. Under the equal population requirements imposed by the Supreme Court, most House districts are not even coterminous with existing governmental units, subdividing cities and cutting across county lines. Because they are not governmental units, House districts per se are not and cannot be the direct recipients of federal intergovernmental grants of any kind; instead, most federal grants‐in‐aid go to state governments. There is thus a mismatch between the type of geographic unit represented in the House and the type of geographic unit that directly receives most federal grant money. This mismatch has three important effects on House members' incentives when they consider programs to allocate funds geographically."
"2","First, House members often lack a bottom line. Because House districts are not administrative units in the federal system, systematic data on the amount of money they receive in federal grants is difficult to obtain. The Office of Management and Budget maintains records of the amounts states receive under all federal grant programs and has regularly published this information as the Budget Information for States. Nothing equivalent exists for congressional districts.1 Such bottom line figures are central to Senate debates over geographic allocation. Any senator proposing a change in a formula grant program is expected to provide a chart showing how much each state would receive under the proposal, and senators vote accordingly (Lee 2000). Unlike senators, House members cannot easily compare the total dollar amount their district will receive in grants with the amount that other districts will receive or with the amount their district received in the past. This lack of bottom‐line data obscures House members' individual parochial stakes when they consider the overall design of intergovernmental grants.         "
"3","By comparison, House members can easily see whether a bill contains an earmarked project located in their district. The amount of money involved in such earmarks is often trivial. But even if trivial relative to the overall program, the earmark's presence gives a House member a clearer, more visible parochial stake than an amount of dollars allocated to his state's government. Obtaining the earmark demonstrates that the member is “working hard” on his constituents' behalf. The small size of the grant does not diminish its political value—few constituents have enough knowledge to contextualize any dollar figure in light of overall program spending.1"
"4","Second, this mismatch between House districts and the federal grant system creates more than an informational problem for House members; it also affects their ability to claim credit for funds allocated. States often enjoy wide discretion in the expenditure of federal grants.1 In many cases, this discretion is so broad that the grant‐in‐aid is better viewed as a “funding stream” for state governments than as a “federal program” (GAO 1998, 15). As one state official explained, “These aren't federal programs, they are state programs that receive federal funds” (GAO 1998, 16). As a result, even though House districts may be affected by the amount of funds the state receives overall, there is no necessary connection between the two. Rep. James L. Oberstar (D‐Minn.) explained the problem as follows:         "
"5","                        "
"6","A statement was made earlier in this debate, decisions [about geographic allocation] should be made by the States, who know what the needs and priorities are. … But let me tell my colleagues what kind of wisdom there is in state government. There was a stretch of highway in my district on which, over 15 years, 57 people have died. Where did that appear on the State priority list? (Cong. Record 1998, H2015)               "
"7","From the point of view of a House member, it is often not clear that working to increase the state's allocation will benefit his constituents. The benefits to the state may not trickle down to his individual district."
"8","Third, most House members face a collective action problem when considering state‐level allocations. The median House member represents a district in a state with twelve other congressional districts. All else being equal, a House member's district is likely to benefit from increased funding for his state, but this is a collective good for all members of the state delegation. Any credit‐claiming opportunity created by state‐level benefits is available to any of the state's House members. In this sense, there are twelve potential “competitors” (Arnold 1990, 75) claiming credit for the achievement. Political scientists have often focused on the collective action problems that occur at the level of national policy: individual members are held electorally accountable only by local constituencies and thus focus on particularized benefits, neglecting the wider national interest (Fiorina 1989, 107–8; Jacobson 2001, 241). Collective action problems can also occur when the House considers distributive policies if House members focus on the small projects earmarked for their own constituents rather than the much larger allocations that go to state governments. In this sense, even pork barrel politics is vulnerable to the problem of collective accountability.         "
"9","In sum, most federal grant‐in‐aid dollars are distributed at the state level, but the best credit‐claiming opportunities for House members come in the form of special projects and earmarks, which are rather inconsequential to overall federal spending. This mismatch between the structure of House representation and the structure of the federal grant‐in‐aid system is likely to affect distributive politics in the House of Representatives. Even though project grants account for only a small percentage of federal domestic assistance funds, House members value them because of the credit‐claiming opportunities they afford. By contrast, House members may care deeply about the larger allocational decisions from a policy perspective, but funds that go to state governments give them little tangible evidence to demonstrate that they are working hard on behalf of their constituents."
"10","Given these incentives, we should expect to find two patterns in House distributive politics. First, the distribution of earmarked projects in the House will be more influenced by political factors than the overall distribution of federal grant‐in‐aid funds. Second, the coalition‐building process in the House should focus more on the allocation of earmarks than on the overall distribution of funds. If earmarks have greater electoral value to House members, they will serve as a better tool for coalition leaders to build support for the bill than manipulating the funding distribution to states."
"11","I test this argument with a study of the politics and distributive policy outcomes of the 1998 House reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs. In reauthorizing these programs, the House simultaneously considered the formula allocating transportation funds to states, a host of earmarks requested by individual members, and the discretionary programs administered by the federal Department of Transportation.1 This reauthorization provides a good test of these expectations about House incentives for three reasons. First, it permits a direct comparison of the politics of earmarks with the politics of overall state allocation while holding the program type constant. The earmarks and the state‐level grants did not serve different policy goals. In fact, the earmarked projects would have been eligible for funding out of the state's overall allocation (although those projects might not otherwise have been prioritized by state officials). If distribution patterns dramatically differ between these two methods of distributing funds, it strongly suggests that House members regard them differently for political, as opposed to policy, reasons. Second, it provides an opportunity to study coalition building in distributive policy. Because both the state‐based formula programs and the earmarks were authorized in the same legislation, it is possible to directly compare how House members' receipt of projects and increases in overall state funding relate to their support for the legislation. Third, transportation policy is important in its own right as one of the federal government's largest domestic assistance commitments. Surface transportation programs alone consistently account for at least 20% of all the federal government's grants‐in‐aid to state and local governments.1"
"12","Data on the allocation of funds to states is easily available. Charts showing the amounts states would receive under the House bill were circulated in Congress and printed in the Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report (Gettinger 1998, 1068; Hosansky 1997b, 1067). Locating the congressional district for each of the 1,506 earmarks in the House bill was more difficult. Some of these were identified by finding the member who had requested the earmark in hearings before the committee (House 1997). When the city or county designated to receive the earmark was represented by a single member of Congress, the congressional district could be determined using the Congressional District Atlas (Department of Commerce 1993). The remaining projects were identified on maps that showed both highways and congressional district lines, which were generated with geographic information software.1 In cases where the project was located in more than one congressional district, each district was counted as receiving a grant, and the total dollar amount for the project was divided between them.         "
"13","Determining whether Congress allocates funds on the basis of substantive policy or political considerations (or some combination of the two) must begin by identifying the major policy goals relevant to geographic distribution.1 According to Rep. Bud Shuster, chair of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, a top priority of the legislation was to increase investment in the infrastructure that “tie[s] our country together,” particularly the federal‐aid mileage that bears most of the interstate traffic (Cong. Record 1998, H1886). A second goal was to guarantee states a better return on their federal gas tax and highway trust fund contributions. A GAO study (1995) has recognized highway trust fund contributions as a valid measure of state need for transportation spending because they closely reflect use of the transportation network in the state.1 Two variables—Number of Federal‐aid Highway Miles and Return on Trust Fund Contributions1—are included in the analysis to account for the effect of these goals on geographic distribution.         "
"14","Committee power has long been recognized as a source of political influence in distributive politics (Arnold 1979; Ferejohn 1974). Three variables account for committee members' influence on geographic distribution: Committee Leader, Republican Committee Member, and Democratic Committee Member. In the district‐level models, Committee Leader indicates that the district is represented by a chair or ranking member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee or the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation. In the state‐level models, Committee Leader indicates that a House member from the state holds one of the committee leadership posts. The committee membership variables are measured in the same way, indicating in the district‐level models that the district is represented on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and in the state‐level models that at least one House member from the state is a committee member.         "
"15","More recently, scholars have focused on the parties' role in distributive politics (Carsey and Rundquist 1999; Cox and McCubbins 1993; Levitt and Snyder 1995). If members of Congress believe that credit claiming for distributive benefits helps them get reelected, “then the majority party should not regard minority party members as full partners in distributive coalitions” (Balla et al. 2002). Accordingly, majority party leaders should be especially concerned that their most vulnerable party members receive distributive benefits (Denemark 2000). Two variables measure the importance of party: Party Affiliation and Percent of the Vote in 1996 * Party. In the district‐level models Party Affiliation is coded 1 when the district is represented by a Republican member, otherwise 0; in the state‐level model, the variable refers to the percentage of the state delegation that is Republican. Percent of the Vote in 1996 * Party is an interaction term to determine if the majority party targets benefits to its marginal members. In the state‐level models, this variable reflects the percentage of each state's Republican delegation that won reelection by less than 55% of the vote in 1996.1"
"16","Geographic distribution may also be affected by differences in members' incentives and abilities to obtain funds. Senior members of Congress may enjoy advantages in the distributive politics game, simply because they are more effective in legislative politics generally (Hibbing 1993, 80). Marginal members may have stronger than average incentives to seek local benefits (Bickers and Stein 1996; Levitt and Snyder 1997; Stein and Bickers 1995). Two variables are included to account for these sources of political influence on distribution, a member's number of Years of Service and the member's Percent of the Vote in 1996.1"
"17","House apportionment may also influence the distribution of funds to states. Populous states have more representatives in the House, and in theory this could affect policy outcomes. If state delegations cooperate on behalf of the whole state, then populous states may be advantaged. As discussed above, however, a collective action problem may inhibit effective cooperation among larger delegations. If so, populous states will receive no advantage and may even suffer a disadvantage relative to smaller states. To test for this effect of House apportionment, a variable Number of Districts in the State is included in the analysis of state‐level allocations.         "
"18","House apportionment may also shape the incentives of members representing single‐district states. Such members can claim credit for the much larger sums obtained by increases in state‐level funding, and it may even be politically beneficial for them to forego projects. By not participating in the pork barrel game that so many editorialists deplore, these members can assume the mantle of “fiscal responsibility.” To test for this effect on the models of project distribution, a dummy variable One District State was included (coded 1 for members elected at large and 0 for all others).         "
"19","The 1998 transportation reauthorization provided funds to every state; in addition, an overwhelming majority of congressional districts—86% of House districts (374)—received at least one earmark.1 In this sense, coalition leaders appear to have followed “a policy of universalism,” in which “every member, regardless of party or seniority has a share in the benefits” (Mayhew 1974, 88). But a universalistic coalition need not be egalitarian. Some members of the coalition may receive a larger share than others, and the geographic distribution of earmarks clearly illustrates this.1"
"20"," Tables 1 and 2 show OLS regression analyses of the number of earmarked projects congressional districts received and the dollar value of those projects.1 The results are calculated both with and without the policy variables included. Given that only a small percentage of transportation funds were allocated in earmarks, it is perhaps not surprising that members did not use these to carry out the broader policy goals of the legislation. Neither of the policy variables had the expected effect on the geographic distribution of projects.         "
"21","Both these tables show, however, that political factors clearly influenced the distribution of earmarks. First, there is a substantial premium for committee members and leaders. The multivariate regression results reveal that, all else being equal, committee members of both parties receive about $20 million more in projects than the average noncommittee member and about three more projects each. Committee members received around twice as many projects and twice as much allocated for them as noncommittee members.1 The bonuses for committee leaders are even larger.1"
"22","Second, there is a solid advantage for the majority party in the distribution of project dollars. Controlling for other factors in the model, Republicans received an estimated $16–$17 million more than the average Democrat (p < .05). The partisan effect is not quite as apparent on the number of projects; in these models the coefficient for party affiliation is positive but not statistically significant.1 Interestingly, these results are consistent with the conclusion of Balla et al.'s “partisan blame avoidance” account of pork barrel politics: “by giving the minority some pork, the majority inoculates itself against charges of wasteful spending, but by granting the minority a smaller share of the federal pork pie, the majority party boosts the electoral fortunes of its own members” (2002, 524). The findings also suggest that marginal Republican districts did come in for special treatment. In Table 2 the interaction term Party * 1996 General Election takes a negative, statistically significant (p < .05) coefficient—meaning that Republicans who won their last election by narrower margins received more funds for their districts' projects than other members.1"
"23","Individual member abilities and incentives also have an effect on the distribution of projects. Marginal members generally received a larger number of individual projects (p < .05), but there is no statistically significant effect on the amount of money allocated to their projects. As expected, the seniority variable is positive in each model; however, it only has a statistically significant effect (p < .05) on the dollar value of projects. Speaking on the House floor, Rep. Steve Largent (R‐Okla.) indicated that the benefits to marginal members were part of a conscious political strategy: “I want to say that I am opposed to the bill … . I would ask the question, is it right that the campaign committee chairmen are consulted before the special road projects are given to Members who live in or represent politically sensitive districts where they have tough races coming up in November?” (Cong. Record 1998, H2013).         "
"24","House apportionment appears to have an impact on the incentives of at‐large members to seek special projects. The variable generally takes a negative coefficient, revealing that the seven members who represent one‐district states were less likely to receive projects. The coefficient reaches statistical significance (p = .02) in one of the models of the number of earmarked projects. Only two states, Montana and Delaware, received no earmarked projects in the transportation bill and both have only one House district. In fact, Delaware Rep. Mike Castle held a press conference denouncing the earmarks in the House bill, and—as a consequence—came in for special criticism on the House floor when Shuster singled him out during a tirade against the hypocrisy of members who “feel that nobody's cause but their own is worthwhile” (Cong. Record 1998, H1887).         "
"25","Overall, these findings reveal a strong imprint of political factors on the distribution of earmarks. Committee power, partisan motivations, and individual members' abilities and incentives all have a measurable impact. However, only a small amount of federal money was distributed with these projects relative to the overall authorization. Eighty‐eight percent of the authorized funds were directed to state governments."
"26"," Table 3 examines the effect of policy goals and political factors on the geographic allocation of these grants to states. The dependent variable in the model is the percent increase (or decrease) in the state's allocation under the House bill compared to existing law at the time.1 Unlike the earmarked projects, these funds were not distributed at the district level, and so the model must be estimated with state‐level data.1 Each of the variables thus reflects the characteristics of the state's House delegation.         "
"27","As shown in Table 3, political factors left virtually no imprint on the distribution of funds to states in the House bill. The only political variable with a statistically significant effect in the expected direction (p < .01) was the average seniority of the House delegation. Although the coefficients on the committee representation variables are generally positive, none is statistically significant. It is thus not possible to conclude that a state's representation on the House committee on Transportation and Infrastructure yielded any consistent benefits in overall state funding. Similarly, being represented by a more Republican delegation produced no statistically significant effect on overall distribution. Finally, there is no evidence that larger state delegations successfully cooperate to produce extra gains for their states. Instead, the policy factors account for most of the variation in the allocation of funds to states. States with more federal‐aid highway miles and lower returns on their trust fund contributions gained larger funding increases.         "
"28","In sum, the distribution of state funds does not reflect the political influence or incentives of the state's House delegation. The dramatic difference between these findings and those from the analysis of earmark distribution may partly stem from the different levels of analysis. House members may have a tacit understanding of how their districts will be treated by their state departments of transportation, so that even if their state overall does not receive large funding increases their districts' interests will still be protected. However, there is strong reason from the Congressional Record to think otherwise. Many House members—including some of the most influential members on transportation issues—complained that they did not know where transportation funds would be spent in their states and feared that their districts' needs would be neglected.1 Members defended the use of earmarked projects for precisely this reason. If House members were able to provide for their districts and claim credit for projects without the use of earmarks, it is difficult to see why they would have incurred editorialists' wrath by including more than 1,500 such projects in the bill.         "
"29","Taken together, these findings are compatible with the idea that the basis of representation in the House affects members' incentives in geographic distribution. Funds earmarked for projects in congressional districts provide House members with credit‐claiming opportunities; members thus perceive them as a “political commodity.” As such, they are distributed on a political basis in the House, and members advantaged by committee and majority party status secure more. Funds allocated to states, however, do not generate the same kind of credit‐claiming opportunities. While House members care about the distribution of these funds from a policy perspective, they do not appear to distribute them as a political commodity."
"30","The 1998 transportation bill also provides a good opportunity to examine which sort of geographic benefit provided a stronger incentive for members to support the committee's bill and to resist amendments that undercut it. Transportation bills almost always pass by a wide margin in Congress, but this does not mean that coalition leaders face no challenges in winning approval of their proposals. In 1997 and 1998 the top priority of House legislators involved in drafting the bill was to dramatically increase spending on transportation, and the 40% boost they sought exceeded the budget resolution's limits by $16 billion (Weisman 1997). This goal put committee leaders at odds with the Republican leadership of both chambers as well as President Clinton (Hosansky 1997a). The process of building a successful coalition took 16 months, during which time the committee suffered one major defeat on the floor1 and had to recommend a six‐month extension of program funds to avert construction stoppages.1"
"31","House committee leaders had two kinds of distributive resources to expand support for their bill: they could allow individual House members to designate high‐priority transportation projects in their districts, and they could manipulate the formula that allocated most of the funds so that House members would see increases for their states.1 They took both approaches from the start of the process. When the House committee began to markup a bill for the first time, the formula distributions to states had already been revised. In addition, in January 1997—long before they began drafting a bill—the leadership of the committee invited all House members to submit written requests for individual projects for “transportation needs in their districts” (Cong. Record 1997, E90).         "
"32","Which approach had a bigger impact on House support for the bill?Evans (1994) has shown that earmarked projects are effective as “side payments” to sway members to support the broader legislative goals of committee leaders. The question posed here is whether such projects had a larger effect on House members' support for the committee's bill than the decisions about state‐level funding, which are far more significant for the geographic distribution of transportation funds overall.         "
"33","If the basis of representation in the House affects members' incentives in the hypothesized way, members are likely to view changes in state‐level spending as not closely connected to their parochial or electoral interests. State‐level increases will constitute one policy consideration among others that members take into account as they weigh their support for the proposal, but they provide little credit‐claiming opportunities that members can use to shore up their electoral support. As such, they do not constitute “side payments” for members who need extra incentive to go along with the committee. By contrast, projects earmarked for particular congressional districts clearly impact House members' parochial interests and provide easy credit‐claiming opportunities. They thus offer a more direct appeal to members' electoral self‐interest. If this argument is correct, House members' receipt of earmarked projects will be more closely connected to their support of the legislation than state‐level funding increases."
"34","To assess the effect of geographic benefits on House members' support for the bill, I analyze members' voting behavior on the legislation. From the point of view of committee leaders, five significant roll‐call votes took place on the 1998 transportation reauthorization.1 The votes are briefly described below, and a + or – symbol next to each indicates whether the committee's proposed funding increases for a member's state or district should increase or decrease a member's willingness to vote yes.         "
"35","                        "
"36"," Shuster Amendment to the Budget Resolution: Would increase outlays for surface transportation programs to $137 billion, one of the committee leadership's highest priorities. Defeated 214‐216.                  "
"37"," Spratt (D‐S.C.) Amendment to Extend ISTEA: Would reject the committee's bill and extend the existing highway programs for two months. President Clinton favored this amendment. Defeated 106‐312.                  "
"38"," Graham (R‐S.C.) Amendment to Strike High Priority Projects: Would remove all provisions that provide funds for earmarked projects. Defeated 79‐337.                  "
"39"," Kasich (R‐Ohio) Amendment to Turn Back Federal Funds to States: Would return federal transportation dollars directly to the states and reduce the federal gas tax over a four‐year period. Defeated 98‐318.                  "
"40"," Surface Tranportation Reauthorization (BESTEA): Passage of the bill authorizing $219 for surface transportation over six years, a 40% increase. Adopted 337‐80.                  "
"41","Logistic regression analyses of these votes were conducted in order to measure the influence of geographic benefits on members' voting behavior. The dependent variable is coded 1 for members voting (or pairing) in support of the committee leadership's position and 0 for members voting (or pairing) in opposition. Three variables in these models account for the effect of earmarked projects and overall funding increases: Number of Projects, Dollar Value of Projects, and Percent Funding Change for State.1 Other influences on members' votes were also included as control variables. Member of the Committee (coded 1 for members, otherwise 0) takes into account the likelihood that members of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee will be more willing to support the leadership of the committee. Party (coded 1 for Republicans, otherwise 0) captures the partisan influence on the vote.1Percent of the Vote in 1996 is included to account for the possibility that marginal members face different pressures than other members.         "
"42"," Table 4 reports the maximum‐likelihood estimates of the regression coefficients for each of the roll‐call votes. Because there is no consensus on the best measure, goodness‐of‐fit in these models is reported in three ways: percent reduction in error, percent of cases correctly predicted, and the Nagelkerke R2 (Pampel 2000, 48–53). As expected, the control variables in the models have some predictive power. Members of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee tended to support their committee's leadership more than other members. The coefficients on Party reveal that the committee generally drew more support from Democrats than Republicans.1 Although the effect is not great, marginal members were somewhat more likely to oppose the committee and to favor the “anti‐pork” position taken by editorialists (even though they received more earmarked projects than average).1"
"43","On every roll‐call vote, members who received earmarked projects were more likely to support the committee's position, and in each model the coefficient for Dollars in Projects was statistically significant in the expected direction (p < .001).1 Similarly, receiving a greater number of such projects increased the likelihood on every vote that a member would support the committee; the effect of this coefficient (Number of Projects) was statistically significant (p < .05) for three of the five roll‐call votes. However, proposed increases in overall state funding in the bill did not make members more likely to support the committee's position. In fact, the coefficient for Percent Funding Change for the State took the wrong sign in every model. Members who received larger increases for their states were actually less likely to support the committee than members who received smaller funding increases; this unexpected coefficient is statistically significant (p < .01) for one of the models.         "
"44"," Table 5 examines the bivariate relationship between support for the committee and the geographic benefits conferred through earmarks and formula allocations to states. As shown here, in every case the states of opponents of the committee's position would actually receive larger percentage increases than the states of supporters of the committee. The opposite pattern prevails on the relationship between House members' support for the committee position and the value of projects they received. On every vote, members who supported the committee position received larger allocations in earmarks—at least $10 million more on average—than members who opposed the committee.         "
"45","If House committee leaders believed that overall funding increases for states would lead individual members to support their legislative proposals, they were mistaken. The committee's position on the formula distribution to states clearly had enough appeal in the House as a whole to prevail, even among members receiving lower than average increases. But members who received larger benefits for their states were not more inclined to support the committee's position."
"46","There is evidence, however, that House members perceived the earmarked projects—not the increased funds to states—as committee leaders' most important strategy for swaying additional votes. Indeed, substantial controversy erupted on precisely this point. Opponents of the committee accused Shuster and others of “buying members' votes” with earmarks—“pure and simple bribery” (Cong. Record 1998, H2014).1 Rep. David Obey (D‐Wis.) put the matter in stark terms, “There is only one reason you have this many projects in the bill, and that is to pass a budget busting monster … . So you are going to see a lot of folks vote for that bill tomorrow because they have gotten a tiny little bit for their district” (Cong. Record 1998 H3720).1 Shuster heatedly denied that there was any quid pro quo between receipt of projects and support for the legislation (Cong. Record 1998 H1553, H2013). Some members who received projects did refuse to support the committee, as shown in Table 5; if these projects were “bribery,” some members did not stay “bought.” Perhaps the best way to understand the use of these projects is not as a simple economic exchange (votes for projects), but as an investment in building support by committee leaders which may (or may not) net the desired profit in individual cases. The data on voting behavior, however, provides strong evidence that these projects were generally good investments for committee leaders.         "
"47","Like the patterns in the distribution of geographic benefits, these findings support the hypothesis that the basis of apportionment in the House of Representatives affects distributive politics. House members perceive their electoral and parochial interests as more closely tied to their districts than their states. As a result, coalition leaders who want to increase support for their legislative proposals found funds earmarked for members' districts more effective as “side payments” than those granted at the state level, even though the vast majority of the money went to states. After all, only 5% of the funds were allocated in earmarks, and these went disproportionately to committee members and leaders whose support for the committee's proposal was surely less in doubt. Despite this, the receipt of earmarked funds was a far better predictor of a member's support for the committee's position than the receipt of state‐level increases, even after controlling for other factors likely to affect the vote."
"48","Political scientists usually look to the structure of power within Congress—committee, seniority, and party—as the key factor in accounting for the geographic distribution of federal funds. This article argues that scholars need to take the structure of House representation itself into account in understanding the politics of distributing federal funds. House districts are not administrative units and cannot be the direct recipients of intergovernmental grants. This fact has a systematic effect on the incentives and credit‐claiming opportunities available to House members when they consider the geographic distribution of federal funds."
"49","Most federal grant‐in‐aid funds are allocated to states; in such programs, House members face uncertainty about how much their constituents will receive and, at least as importantly, obstacles to claiming credit. As a result, House members do not perceive these state‐level programs as a “political commodity” that advances their reelection goals. Earmarked projects are the only grants that closely approximate the classic definition of “distributive policy”—“highly individualized decisions that only by accumulation can be called a policy” (Lowi 1964, 690)—and they are the type of geographic benefit that most clearly impacts individual House members' electoral interests. Although earmarks account for only a tiny proportion of federal spending, they are the type of program on which one would expect to find the deepest imprint of House members' power and electoral interests.         "
"50","To test this argument about House incentives in distributive policy, this article examined the politics and policy outcomes of the 1998 House reauthorization of surface transportation programs. I found two different patterns in the geographic distribution of these funds, depending on whether the funds were allocated to states or on an individual project basis. Funds that were allocated on an individual project basis were distributed in clearly “political” fashion: House members serving on the committee of jurisdiction secured more of these, as did members advantaged by seniority or majority party status. Electorally vulnerable members—especially those of the majority party—also received an added bonus. These patterns were not present in the distribution of funds to states, however. States that received additional funds did so for policy‐related reasons, and none of the political variables had a statistically significant effect on the distribution of these funds."
"51","In addition, I found that the small amount of funds distributed as earmarks were more useful as a coalition‐building tool in the House than the large amount distributed to states. Members who received individual projects in the House bill were more likely to support the committee's position on roll‐call votes, whereas increases for members' states in the bill had no positive effect on this support. This finding suggests that—by comparison to the project grants—House members tend to view the amount that their state receives as a general policy consideration largely separate from their individual electoral interests."
"52","These findings suggest two important points. First, the theory advanced in this article has a different set of implications for the Senate than for the House. Senators do not face the same informational and credit‐claiming constraints when considering intergovernmental grants. Even if the funds provided to states are block grants or “funding streams” over which state governments exercise total control, senators—unlike House members—can still claim credit for providing those funds to their constituents. Senators represent states, and states are by far the most important administrative units in the intergovernmental grant system. Senators will thus have a stronger parochial interest in the distribution of funds to states, and distributive politics in the Senate should be affected accordingly."
"53","Second, scholars should not expect to find political effects on the distribution of federal funds across the board, because not all such funds provide credit‐claiming opportunities for members. Even within the system of intergovernmental grants—one of the most fertile fields for credit claiming—individual House members often find themselves unable to “peel off pieces of governmental accomplishment” (Mayhew 1974, 53) to demonstrate that they are taking care of constituents. The structure of representation creates (and closes off) opportunities to claim credit in the House and the Senate, and scholars should be sensitive to these opportunities when theorizing about the geographic allocation of federal funds.
