"1","The 2013–2014 anti‐government protests in Maidan Nezalezhnosti in central Kyiv, Ukraine, and the ensuing removal of President Yanukovich, raised much speculation within the academic and policy communities. Despite media reports of Russian involvement, the Russian government never officially acknowledged providing assistance in repressing the protesters. The general opacity of the Russian government and their notoriously poor record‐keeping suggest that the details of the interactions between Yanukovich and Russia may never become publicly available. As a result, even several years later, much of the international community and researchers are left with more questions than answers. What were possible incentives for Russia's involvement? What types of third parties may try to influence domestic crises of other states? What are the consequences of such influence? Does Yanukovich's removal indicate that Russia's involvement was a failure? Or did Russia gain from involvement, despite Yanukovich's removal?"
"2","There is ample evidence that similar third‐party attempts at influencing domestic crises are not rare. U.S. and Soviet direct and indirect involvement in their respective spheres of interest throughout the Cold War, as well as Russia's interest in the outcomes of popular protests and revolutions in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, constitute only a few prominent examples. Regan and Meachum (2014) find evidence of some level of third‐party involvement in approximately one‐third of country‐years identified as “at‐risk” for experiencing armed conflict in the reasonable future between 1955 and 2003.1 Third parties have also provided overt government support in approximately one‐third of protest campaigns (Chenoweth and Stephan 2011).         "
"3","In many of these cases, third‐party involvement was expressed in the form of consultation, economic and military aid, and weapons sales. Some instances of third‐party involvement, however, happen in secrecy, behind closed doors. In countries with stricter record‐keeping practices and greater government accountability, such as the United States, some information is usually eventually revealed to the public (Forsythe 1992, 385). Other cases may never move beyond the realm of speculation. Despite the pervasiveness of third‐party involvement, this lack of systematic data presents a considerable challenge for empirical research. We overcome this challenge by using available information from the literature and news coverage to develop a game‐theoretic model that allows for analyzing the interaction between the government, the protesters, and an interested third party.         "
"4","The resulting model is a generalization of the traditional two‐player game between the government and the protesters through an introduction of a third player—an interested third party.2 In our model, the onset of conflict between the government and the protesters is possible as part of a pure strategy equilibrium, in contrast to traditional two‐player games that treat such conflict as either an off‐equilibrium outcome or part of a mixed strategy equilibrium. The pure strategy explanation for protests and repression, provided by our model, is more intuitive than mixed strategy equilibria, which occur under rather restrictive parameter conditions. These parameter restrictions are also somewhat incompatible with the empirical prevalence of government repression against protesters. A pure strategy explanation provided by our model, in contrast, holds for a much larger parameter space, which is more consistent with the commonality of protests and instances of state repression.         "
"5","Our core finding is that third‐party involvement may result in repression of the protesters, and even the removal of the protégé leader, in cases that could have ended peacefully in the absence of a third party. The key to this finding is that, unlike much of the literature, which attributes third parties with neutral goals (e.g., mediation, concern for human rights) or at least neutral means (e.g., avoid repression), we relax these assumptions and explore the resulting variation. Our model allows for neutral third parties, interested third parties that are averse to repression, and third parties that are explicitly interested in the use of repression. Building a reputation as a coercive third party, as in the latter case, may have some benefits, such as using repression to create a “scarecrow” for future protests. For example, the images of repression at Maidan are frequently invoked as arguments against civil disobedience within Russia and its sphere of influence (Peterson 2015; Whitmore 2017). Other instances of “scarecrow” tactics include the 1956 Soviet‐sponsored repression against workers' protests in Poznań, Poland, and student demonstrations in Budapest, Hungary, as well as the massacres of the Eritrean‐led opposition by the Soviet‐supported Mengistu regime in Ethiopia.         "
"6","Relaxing the assumption that the third party is motivated by a specific set of goals allows us to derive a set of very general predictions and some counterintuitive insights, as well as explain a variety of third‐party involvement/noninvolvement scenarios, such as pressure from a “neutral” third party to avoid repression, an interested third party's decision to stay out due to anticipated costs, or a repressive third party's decision to bankroll repression for the sake of deterring future protesters. The latter scenario, in particular, has received little scholarly attention despite its rather common occurrence, especially within the Russian sphere of interest. We use Chenoweth and Stephan's (2011) data on protest campaigns, as well as some original data, to evaluate some of the predictions.         "
"7","Repression research has focused on domestic political institutions. Proponents of the domestic democratic peace argue that democratic governments are less likely to repress protesters than authoritarian regimes (Davenport 2007; Richards, Webb, and Clay 2015), although repression by democracies, especially in response to violent dissent, is also not uncommon (Conrad and Moore 2010; Davenport and Armstrong 2004; Davenport, Armstrong, and Moore 2008; Hill and Jones 2014; Ritter 2014; Ritter and Conrad 2016). Others have suggested the murder‐in‐the‐middle hypothesis, which points to semi‐democracies or semi‐autocracies as the most likely hot spots for observing violent repression of protests (Pierskalla 2010; Regan and Bell 2010).            "
"8","This literature rarely focuses on the international determinants of domestic repression (although see Gartner and Regan 1996; Moore 1995). Leaders of political regimes, however, rarely act independent from influences of outside third parties. Minor powers often rely on regional or great powers for support (Lake 2009; Nieman 2016); in other cases, third parties claim (explicitly or implicitly) regional “spheres of influence,” acting as de facto arbitrators within those areas (Lemke 2002). Lake (2009), for example, argues many governments make a conscious strategic choice to enter an informal (hierarchical) relationship with a (usually like‐minded) major/regional power, essentially as a form of an “insurance” arrangement: smaller power supports the major power's international policy agenda, while the major power enhances the smaller power's economic or military security (Martinez Machain and Morgan 2013). The degree of the smaller power's dependence on this relationship may range from a military alliance or an economic partnership to a full‐on puppet regime that has no power beyond that given to it by the major power. While such language invokes images of the United States, USSR/Russia, or China (and their traditional spheres of interest), one can also think of less obvious examples, such as Saudi Arabia's or Iran's roles in Yemen and Syria. Such informal arrangements between domestic governments and international third parties may have important effects on domestic policy outcomes of the protégé state.            "
"9","The role of international third parties in domestic crises is better understood within the related civil war literature (Aydin 2012; Bapat 2006; Findley and Teo 2006; Gent 2008). Involvement of a third party with an independent stake in the issue may affect conflict duration (Aydin and Regan 2012; Cunningham 2010). The probability of conflict, for instance, may decrease as a result of involvement by third parties with strong ties to one of the conflict participants (Regan 2002). Conflict outcome may also depend on whether the third party supports the government, supports the challenging group, or has a separate interest in the issue (Kydd 2006; Regan 2002).            "
"10","This article extends the literature in two ways. First, we extend research on third‐party involvement in civil wars to explore the effects of observed and unobserved third‐party influences on the onset of protests and the government's decision to use repression. Second, unlike much of the prior literature, our model relaxes the (implicit) assumption of the legitimacy or neutrality of a third party's goals and means. Rather than assuming any specific goals and means, the third party's broader involvement incentives are modeled via an unrestricted parameter (β), which may represent a variety of goals and considerations, such as ending conflict (Regan 1998), preventing human rights violations (Gartner and Regan 1996), pursuit of economic and geostrategic goals (Findley and Teo 2006), or even the goal of repression for its own sake. These broader third‐party goals are referred to as “milieu” goals (Wolfers 1984) and are distinct from the policy goals that are immediately at stake in any given domestic crisis. Milieu goals may include establishing a certain reputation or a sphere of influence, promoting international law or particular economic models, and so on. Milieu goals are, of course, not equivalent to normatively positive goals and depend on the outlook and aims of the leadership of the third party: thus, milieu goals of a repressive regime may include supporting/legitimizing undemocratic governments in other states. Russian President Putin's support for Assad in Syria, for example, may partially stem from his own domestic insecurities (Hill 2013).            "
"11","In addition to the nature of their milieu goals, third parties also differ in their legitimacy of means, that is, whether they consider coercion as an acceptable means for the pursuit of their milieu goals. Whereas some third parties view coercion as an acceptable if undesirable means, others may find it completely unacceptable (e.g, Gorbachev famously refused to support coercion against protests in East Germany in 1989, whereas his predecessors assisted in suppressing protests in Hungary and Poland in 1956.) We refer to a third party's acceptance of coercion as a means of achieving its milieu goals using the terms marginal (coercion is an acceptable means) versus legitimate (coercion is not an acceptable means) third party. An obvious complication is that the content of milieu goals is not always independent of the means that the third party may view as acceptable. A reputation as a coercive third party may have its benefits: Brutality and massacres have long been used as effective tools for deterring future challenges in authoritarian regimes. And vice versa: a third party may derive an additional benefit from pursuing its goals through noncoercive means.            "
"12","Third parties pursue their policy and milieu goals within their spheres of interest using “the power of the purse”: they may attempt to “sweeten” the government's policy concessions with grants or favorable‐term loans, military equipment, expertise, or even personnel to back those policies (Bueno de Mesquita and Smith 2007; Licht 2010). Consider, for example, the agreement between Ukraine's Yanukovich and Russia, in which Russia agreed to lower natural gas prices as well as purchase $15 billion in Ukrainian‐issued bonds. Notably, the signing of this agreement coincided with Yanukovich's announcement to withdraw from negotiations of Ukraine's association status with the European Union (EU; Interfax‐Ukraine 2013). Similar patterns are observed in Russia's efforts to legitimize the longtime rule of Belarus' Lukashenka through regular diplomatic missions, generous foreign aid, oil subsidies, and debt forgiveness (Ambrosio 2006).            "
"13","Our game focuses on the interaction between three actors: Government (G), Protesters (P), and a Third Party (T). The government is the ruling leader(s) who has the executive decision‐making power in the state. The protesters are made up of activists within the society. Finally, the third party is a foreign entity, such as a major/regional power (e.g., France in West Africa) or a neighboring state. The third party and government have the same preference ordering regarding the policy outcome, disputed by the protesters.         "
"14","We assume that the government and third party are in a quid pro quo relationship, such that the government trades some of its policy autonomy in exchange for the third party's resources, security guarantees, or other benefits. In the extreme, such a policy dependency between the governments of asymmetrically empowered states results in a “puppet” regime in the weaker state. A more general example of such a relationship, however, is that in which the state leader fulfills the role of a protégé of the third party; that is, she has significant autonomy over her country's domestic policies, yet consults or defers to the third party on particular issues. Many developing states defer to the United States on economic policies. Similarly, many post‐Soviet states, such as Belarus or Kazakhstan, while exercising relative autonomy on their domestic policies, tend to consult Russia on foreign policy."
"15","We further assume that, although the third party and the ruling government are in agreement regarding the policy outcome on the particular issue disputed by the protesters, the broader interests of the third party and the government are not in perfect alignment (Lake 2009; Nieman 2016). Specifically, we assume that, all else equal, the third party prefers that its protégé leader remain in power (i.e., is not overthrown by the protesters), but this preference may be outweighed by the third party's milieu goals. Throughout the twentieth century, for example, the United States had to balance its relationships with a number of corrupt governments in Latin America and the Middle East (e.g., the Somozas of Nicaragua, Mubarak of Egypt) with its broader goals (e.g., international law, liberal economic policies).         "
"16","The status quo distribution of benefits in the society privileges the government and its supporters and disadvantages the group represented by the protesters. These societal cleavages may be based on specific policy disagreements, as well as other factors (e.g., ethnicity, religion, access to resources). For the sake of parsimony, we abstract away from the precise source of these disagreements and simply assume that the protesters and the government disagree over policy x. The disputed policy outcome is modeled as an indivisible zero‐sum good of value normalized between 0 and 1, so that the party that obtains its preferred policy obtains the benefit of 1, whereas the party that does not obtain its preferred policy outcome gets the payoff of 0.3 The third party is assumed to possess the resources to influence the resolution of the disagreement.         "
"17","The scope of protesters' demands is thus narrowed to issues that concern broad swaths of the population and/or multiple societal layers—hence the interest and involvement of a third party. Such demands may require major institutional reform (e.g., empowering a disenfranchised group), administrative change (e.g., autonomy), or a major policy orientation (e.g., the 1975 Lebanese Civil War started as a movement against the pro‐Syrian policy orientation of the government).4"
"18","The game starts with Nature (N) determining the type of protesters, who are Strong with probability α and Weak with probability . The protesters' type is conceptualized as strong or weak relative to the government. If repressed, Strong protesters (SP) will overthrow the government, whereas Weak protesters (WP) will be defeated. Protesters know their own type, but the government and third party have to form a set of beliefs about the type of protesters they are facing. After N moves, the protesters have to decide whether to challenge (C) the government or not ().         "
"19","If the protesters do not challenge, the game ends with the Status Quo outcome. In this outcome, the government receives a payoff of 1, associated with implementing its preferred policy; the protesters receive a payoff of 0, as they do not get their preferred outcome; and the third party, whose preferred policy outcome aligns with that of the government, obtains a payoff of 1.         "
"20","If the protesters decide to challenge and take to the streets, this sends a signal regarding their type to the third party, and the third party responds by choosing a level of assistance  that it is willing to give the government to help repress the protesters and compensate it for a possible loss of office. The game ends with the government's choice of whether to repress the protesters (R) or not (). Assume  is the cost of repressing the protests, which may include paying the internal police, buying the necessary weapons, and so on. Then the total government expense on repressing equals , as the third party pays the cost k.         "
"21","The government's use of repression against Weak protesters results in the Successful Repression outcome. Third‐party assistance increases the level of repression against the protesters by k (e.g., through availability of superior weapons or adding to the size of the internal police). The protesters fail to obtain their preferred policy and pay the cost of repression, which yields them a payoff of .5 The third party obtains its preferred outcome minus the assistance amount k. Should the third party get involved in a domestic crisis in its protégé state, its payoff also includes the milieu goals parameter β.6 The direction (positive/negative) of β depends on the third party's legitimacy of means: a marginal third party that views coercion as an acceptable tool has a negative β‐parameter (), whereas a legitimate third party that decries coercion has a positive β‐parameter (). The absolute value (size) of β, however, depends on both the importance and benefits of getting involved in a particular case in pursuit of milieu goals minus the expected costs, such as risk of economic sanctions or conflict with other third parties. As a result, the absolute value and, to a lesser extent, the sign of β may vary on a case‐by‐case basis, as the same third party may have different milieu‐related incentives to intervene in different cases. For example, due to shared history, language, and ethnic origin, Russia may have different values of β for intervening in Ukraine than for intervening in Kyrgyzstan. Although likely negative in both cases (as Russia has long demonstrated its acceptance of coercive means), Russia's β may be larger in absolute value in the case of Ukraine than in the case of Kyrgyzstan. Analogously, Britain, France, and the United States may have all had negative β during the height of the Cold War (as evidenced by their general acceptance of coercive means to fight communism), but the size of their β may have varied from case to case, depending on, for instance, geostrategic importance, risk of Soviet involvement and economic and cultural ties to the location (Carment and Rowlands 1998).         "
"22","Finally, if a third party is uninterested or indifferent toward the outcome of a case, then its β‐parameter is 0. This would happen, for example, if a state is unimportant to the pursuit of the third party's milieu goals (a state without geostrategic or economic importance) or the benefits of getting involved do not outweigh the costs (e.g., Russia's benefits from intervening in a NATO member, like the Baltic states, may not be worth the possible costs of conflict with its NATO allies). In either of these scenarios, , which means that the third party would have nothing to gain, on balance, from helping the government repress the protesters.7"
"23","As a result, the use of repression against Weak protesters leads to a payoff of  to the third party. Since the third‐party's ability to promote its milieu goals is conditional on its involvement in the crisis, the parameter β is multiplied by an indicator variable I, which takes on a value of 1 when , and 0 otherwise. If the third party does not get involved (), then it derives no cost or benefit related to its milieu goals. Finally, the government obtains its preferred outcome minus the costs of repression plus the third‐party assistance, for the payoff of .         "
"24","The use of repression against Strong protesters results in the Removal from Office outcome. In this case, the protesters obtain their preferred policy outcome minus the cost of repression .8 The third party's payoff from this outcome equals . As earlier, β is multiplied by an indicator variable , so that only the third party's reputation is affected should it provide nonzero assistance k. Finally, the government pays the cost of repression, r, as well as that of removal from office, y, (), obtaining the payoff of .         "
"25","If the government does not repress () (whether Weak or Strong protesters), the game ends in the Accommodation outcome. In this case, the protesters obtain their preferred policy outcome for a payoff of 1, whereas both the third party and the government obtain the payoffs of 0. If the government chooses , then the third party's assistance k is not disbursed (i.e., the third party keeps it). The government, in other words, cannot choose to accept k and forego repression. For example, when, during the Orange Revolution, Ukraine overturned the results of the fraudulent 2004 election and installed a pro‐Western leader, Russia responded by removing Ukraine's natural gas subsidies (Nygren 2008). The structure and payoffs of the game are presented in Figure 1. To help keep track of notation, Table 1 provides a summary of all the parameters and their constraints.         "
"26","The full solution to the game is presented in the supporting information. The game has three pure strategy equilibria: Leader Removal, Deterrence, and Accommodation.            "
"27","The Removal equilibrium is summarized as               "
"28","In this equilibrium, we observe the onset of protests only when protesters are of the Strong type (Weak protesters are deterred); the government uses repression, irrespective of the protesters' type; and the third party provides the government with an assistance  to help offset the expenses associated with repression and/or the cost of losing office.            "
"29","This equilibrium only exists in the presence of a marginal third party , and it does not exist in the two‐player version of the game (see the supporting information for Lemma 2). The dynamics of the game that correspond to this equilibrium, therefore, constitute the core of the article's contribution and help one to understand the previously unexplored effects of involvement by a third party. In less technical terms, the Removal equilibrium occurs when the third party is of the marginal type: it stands to gain a lot from involvement (β is large in absolute value) and is not averse to bankrolling repression in pursuit of its goals (β is negative). An additional condition is that the costs of repression, r, and leader removal, y, are low to moderate. Third parties that derive a benefit from building a reputation as coercive powers that are not to be challenged, such as the USSR/Russia, fit these requirements especially well.9 When these conditions are met, a marginal third party would provide sufficient resources to repress the protesters.            "
"30","In the game, protesters can anticipate this outcome, and, hence, only Strong protesters—those who are prepared to fight—challenge the government. The use of major repression against Strong protesters is, of course, risky from the perspective of the leader. For example, although the initial protester demands in Maidan were related to the country's pro‐EU orientation, the first use of repression resulted in cries for Yanukovich's resignation and prosecution. Live images of government brutality against the protesters in Maidan attracted international attention, which further increased the stakes for the Yanukovich regime. Importantly, within the game, these increasing stakes for the leader are recognized by both the leader and the third party: The third party chooses to bankroll repression despite the increasing risk of the removal of their protégé leader. In this equilibrium, brutal repression, which helps accomplish its milieu goals, is more important to the third party than the policy at stake and keeping their protégé in power. The protégé leader also recognizes the risks, but since her tenure in office and post‐tenure fate depend on the third party's continued support, she uses repression if such is the preference of the third party, even despite the risks.            "
"31","This logic is supported by empirical evidence. Using Chenoweth and Stephan's (2011) data on protest campaigns from 1899 to 2006, Table 2 provides a cross‐tabulation of government use of major repression, based on whether it received overt third‐party support.10 It shows that third‐party involvement substantially increases the probability of major repression—a 7 percentage point difference. Additionally, these results are likely to be conservative due to a lack of data on covert third‐party support.            "
"32","For further empirical evaluation, we expanded the subset of cases of major repression in the presence of overt third‐party support (cases in the bottom right cell of Table 2) from Chenoweth and Stephan's (2011) data to include several additional variables, such as whether the protests resulted in the removal of the leader, the post‐tenure fate of such leaders, and the country name of the third party.11 First, we find that in the presence of third‐party support, engaging in major repression results in a rather high rate of leader removal from office (approximately 70% of the cases).12 Next, Table 3 summarizes the post‐tenure fate of protégé leaders who were removed as a direct result of using repression against protesters. Consistent with the model, the third party seems to compensate their protégés for a loss of office: A large majority of such leaders—76%—enjoys a safe retirement in their own country, the third‐party state, or another friendly state.13"
"33","Of course, this equilibrium only occurs for marginal third parties (Lemma 2), so a more accurate evaluation of empirical evidence would account for third‐party type. As preliminary evidence, Table 4 breaks up the cases based on the (primary) sponsoring third party and temporal period. Although it is admittedly difficult to devise an accurate measure of third‐party type β, the temporal period may serve as a proxy for an increase in β for the United States and Britain, due to their increased post‐1990 emphasis on human rights. Consistent with the model's expectations, we see a substantial decrease in the number of repressive leaders sponsored by the United States in the post‐1990 time period, whereas the corresponding number for Russia is still high: There are seven cases in which repressive leaders, sponsored by Russia, found a safe retirement in the post‐1990 years, in contrast to only two cases for the United States. In the pre‐1990 period, both superpowers tended to engage in much more sponsorship of repression in third‐party states, guaranteeing a safe retirement to 11 (USSR) and 12 (United States) leaders.            "
"34","The Deterrence equilibrium is summarized as               "
"35","The Accommodation equilibrium is summarized as               "
"36","Taken together, the three pure strategies equilibria help explain the known empirical regularity that protest campaigns are overwhelmingly successful. The overall success rate of protest campaigns is 54%, which increases to 60% when the government receives overt support from a third party (a summary of Chenoweth and Stephan's 2011 data).15 The intuition is that potentially unsuccessful cases of Weak protesters are deterred from challenging the government in both of the equilibria in which the government uses repression (Removal and Deterrence). Weak protesters, therefore, only challenge the government as part of the Accommodation equilibrium, which results in government concessions. Protest failures, in other words, are less likely to be observed and recorded in the data than protest successes.            "
"37","The game clarifies the causal mechanisms behind the observed outcomes of repression, removal, and accommodation, as well as the frequently unobservable outcome of deterrence. In what follows, we zero in on two types of insights: those linking the outcome with the type of third party, and those exploring the effects of domestic institutional variation."
"38","We now turn to T's decision regarding the amount k that it allocates to G. Since T is an uninformed actor, selecting which type of equilibrium will occur in the game boils down to the exogenous parameter values in T's expected utilities. There exist ranges of β that allow for each of the pure strategy equilibria or preclude the existence of certain equilibria. The first insight is that a negative β is a necessary but not sufficient condition for either the Removal or the Deterrence equilibrium: the third party's acceptance of coercive means does not, by itself, guarantee that it is willing to bankroll repression in any particular case.            "
"39","To illustrate this, Figure 2 displays the parameter spaces for each equilibrium as a function of the cost of repression, r, on the horizontal axis, and third‐party type and interest, β, on the vertical axis, while holding the cost of leader removal at a moderate value (). Figure 2 shows that the game provides unequivocal pure strategy predictions regarding the outcome of the interaction between the three players, for any set of parameter values. The parameter space that allows for Accommodation exists under all, even very negative values of β, although its area increases/decreases with changes in β. If we think of the costs of repression as proportional to the spontaneity and size of the protests, this insight may explain why even coercive third parties are known to back down when faced with spontaneous massive protests (Chenoweth and Stephan 2011). For example, the United States promptly withdrew its support for Marcos's regime in the Philippines, faced with the overwhelming size of the protests in 1986. The value of the United States' β, although negative (as it continued to prop Marcos despite instances of previous repression), was not large enough in absolute size to justify the enormous costs of repressing a massive protest. Instead, the United States stayed out of the conflict and the protesters obtained their demand of Marcos's resignation. In contrast, had the protest been less spontaneous, Marcos might have been able to use U.S. aid to prevent its occurrence in the first place.            "
"40","A similar logic may also explain why Russia did not assist with repression during the Orange Revolution in 2004, but did during the Maidan protests in 2013–14. Although Ukraine has consistently been at the center of Russia's milieu goals (large absolute value of β), and Russia is generally accepting of coercion in its domestic and foreign policies (), the Orange Revolution, which was the first large‐scale and spontaneous protest campaign in post‐Soviet Ukraine, took Russia by surprise (Beissinger 2013). Having learned from the experience of the Orange Revolution, Russia was more prepared for a popular protest when its long‐term protégé, Yanukovich, backed out of signing the EU Association treaty, at Russia's insistence. Maidan protests, in other words, may have been as large in size, but they were less unexpected by the Russian government: Since the cost of repression on longer notice is lower than that on shorter notice, the resulting equilibrium outcome shifted from Accommodation in 2004 to Removal in 2014.            "
"41","A second insight is that the threshold value of β that rules out the two coercive equilibria (Deterrence and Removal) actually falls below zero. This insight challenges the basic intuition that marginal third parties () will always bankroll repression. This finding also provides an intuition of what type of third parties may act as neutral; why even marginal third parties may act neutral in some cases; and why the same third party may act as neutral in some, but not all, cases. In particular, as long as β exceeds a certain negative threshold , the third party's milieu benefits do not outweigh its costs of bankrolling repression, in which case it prefers to act as an indifferent bystander (do nothing), or even a neutral mediator (e.g., provide noncoercive assistance).            "
"42","One implication, in particular, is that the third party's decision to stay out of a domestic crisis is not necessarily indicative of its lack of interest () or unacceptability of coercive means (). If we were to draw a horizontal line at , the area below that line and above the diagonal line  corresponds to the parameter space in which a marginal third party with an interest in the interaction () will act indistinguishably from a neutral or a legitimate third party (i.e., will provide no assistance with repression). This happens when the cost of bankrolling repression does not outweigh the milieu benefits: for instance, Egypt was forced to withdraw its aid to Yemen's al‐Sallal regime after its devastating losses in the Six Day War, which moved the outcome from a possible Removal equilibrium to the Accommodation equilibrium, in which al‐Sallal was removed in a “bloodless coup” (Bidwell 1994). Another example is the United States' decision to withdraw support from its long‐term protégé, the Somozas of Nicaragua: although not fully averse to repression, the United States did not view a repressive outcome as a milieu benefit in itself (negative, but small absolute value of β), and, hence, gave up Somoza as his regime's brutality started attracting international and domestic attention. The United States' withdrawal of support for Mubarak in response to 2011 mass protests serves as an example of a legitimate third party with an important and not selfless stake in an interaction acting indistinguishably from a neutral third party. This insight fits nicely within the existing research on mediation that argues that “neutral” third parties frequently have ulterior motives (Findley and Teo 2006).            "
"43","The theoretical model also speaks to institutional explanations for protest–repression interactions. In particular, our model sheds light on the effect of two important institutional features—the cost of repression, r, and the cost of removal from office, y. Both of these parameters are proxies for institutional features known to affect the probability of protests and repression. The costs of repression may serve as a proxy for regime transparency; Bell, Clay, and Murdie (2012), for example, find that the presence of human rights organizations may decrease repression by increasing the government's cost through publicizing the abuses. Conrad (2014) similarly shows that a leader's cost of repression increases in the presence of independent judiciaries.            "
"44","The second institutional feature—leader's cost/punishment as a result of a removal—has been previously linked to a leader's level of institutional constraints. Leaders of less institutionally constrained regimes, such as personalist autocrats, face higher costs of removal than more constrained leaders. For example, while removal from office is rarely accompanied by additional punishments in democracies, deposed leaders of nondemocratic regimes frequently face additional penalties, such as exile, imprisonment, or even execution (Debs and Goemans 2010).            "
"45","The model helps one to understand the interplay between these two parameters and the outcome of the protests. To highlight this aspect of the model, Figure 3 provides a visualization. The x‐axis displays a range of possible repression costs, r, and the y‐axis displays a range of costs of removal from office, y, while β is constrained to the range associated with a marginal third party,16 and the probability that the protesters are strong, α, increases as we move from left to right between subfigures.            "
"46","First, the figure highlights that, as long as the costs of repression are high, otherwise repressive regimes may appear nonrepressive and accommodate rather than repress protesters. The Accommodation equilibrium exists for any value of the cost of removal from office. If we think of the costs of removal from office as a proxy of whether a regime is democratic, this prediction would suggest that both authoritarian and democratic regimes may accommodate protesters if the cost of repression is sufficiently high (e.g., the regime is monitored by human rights organizations).            "
"47","Next, the figure shows the combination of parameters for the Deterrence equilibrium, in which the presence of a marginal third party helps deter protests against the regime through the threat of repression. Holding the third party's preference for repression constant, we see that whether the parameter space is conducive to the Accommodation or the Deterrence equilibrium largely depends on the probability that the protesters are strong, α: as this probability increases (i.e., moves from the left subfigure to the right subfigure), so does the area associated with the equilibrium in which the protesters obtain the concessions, despite the government's relationship with a marginal third party. When the probability that protesters are strong is moderate or high (e.g.,  in the right subfigure), both authoritarian and democratic regimes accommodate the protesters' demands.17 When the probability that protesters are strong is low (e.g.,  in the left subfigure), a regime may act in a repressive manner (i.e., deter protests through the threat of repression).            "
"48","Third, the model speaks to the literature on individual leader outcomes (Goemans 2008; Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009). As the separating equilibrium is the only equilibrium in which protests, repression, and leader removal are part of the observed outcome, our model helps identify the parameter space that increases the risk of a leader's removal. According to the logic of the model, the separating equilibrium is observed (1) when strong protesters have a positive expected utility, even after accounting for the costs of repression, ; (2) when the third party is of the marginal type, ; and (3) when the third party and the government expect challenges only from the strong protesters, . As highlighted in Figure 3 and conditions (1)–(2), this equilibrium is possible when both the cost of leader removal, y, and the cost of repression, r, are relatively low, that is, are justified by the milieu benefits for the third party.            "
"49","The second of the above conditions implies that leaders are most likely to be removed from office when the costs of repression are low for the third party. Costs of bankrolling repression, for example, may be lowered by close collaboration and interconnectedness between the internal police and security apparatus of the third party and its protégé governments (e.g., close cooperation between Russian and Ukrainian internal security forces). Greater degrees of dependence between the third party and its protégé make it easier (less costly) for the third party to bankroll repression, and also install a new protégé leader in the future, should the current leader be removed as a result of repression. This prediction sheds light on the motivating example of Ukraine, as well as on a number of other cases of removal of leaders propped up by third parties."
"50","State responses to popular protest have traditionally been modeled as a domestic phenomenon. Such studies often treat international influences in structural rather than strategic terms (e.g., control for proximity to a major power). Growing empirical evidence, however, suggests that, in a significant number of cases, the domestic‐level interaction between the government and the protesters may be affected by involvement of an outside third party with its own stakes in the matter. The current study zeroes in on third‐party involvement with the goal to affect the protesters' decision to challenge the government and the government's response to such a challenge."
"51","The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between state leaders and their domestic audiences in cases where the leader herself depends on support from an outside third party. Approaching the interaction from a game‐theoretic perspective, we identify the conditions under which the leader may choose to engage in inefficient repression against the protests, even at the risk of her own removal from office. We show that this puzzling outcome is possible when the leader's response to protests is influenced by an outside third party with broader regional or systemic goals. In the motivating example of Ukraine, Yanukovich is the protégé leader, and Russia acts as his third‐party sponsor. Yanukovich's abrupt withdrawal from the EU Association treaty, a policy highly sought by a significant part of the population, triggered the Maidan protests. Despite every indication of the protesters' strength—their large numbers that reached hundreds of thousands, their willingness to brave the cold of Ukrainian winter, and the threat of police brutality—Yanukovich made no serious attempts at accommodation, choosing instead to repress, despite the high risk of removal. We explain this outcome by zeroing in on Russia's role in the crisis, in light of its chief concern with creating a “scarecrow” to help prevent other “Maidans” within its sphere of influence. Russia provided Yanukovich with both the means to carry out repression against the protesters and the safe option to flee the country into a comfortable retirement."
"52","Our study also contributes to the game‐theoretic literature on the onset of protests and repression, much of which has treated inefficient repression as off‐equilibrium behavior (for exceptions, see Pierskalla 2010; Ritter 2014). We can certainly treat Yanukovich's decision to turn Kyiv's Independence Square into a bloodbath as a terrible blunder. While plausible, such an explanation, however, is rather unsatisfying. Moreover, given what we know about the close relationship between Yanukovich and Russia, a more satisfying explanation would help provide insights regarding the reasons for, and implications of, possible Russian involvement.         "
"53","Some research treats repression as part of a mixed strategy equilibrium, in which strong protesters challenge the government with some positive probability, and the government mixes between opting for repression and accommodation. One way to think of the mixed strategy equilibrium is that, from time to time, governments accept some risk of losing office and incur the costs of repression in order to deter some future protests. For example, Maidan was a calculated risk on the part of Yanukovich in an attempt to intimidate future protesters. Mixed strategy equilibrium explanations, however, are rather nonintuitive. For cases with evidence of third‐party involvement, repression as a part of pure strategy equilibria, as in our model, is both more intuitive and satisfying."
