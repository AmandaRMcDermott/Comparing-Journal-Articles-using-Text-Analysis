"1","Our analytical framework allows for causal effects to vary over units in the population. In addition, we presume that the analyst is limited in her ability to characterize such effect variation, whether because some determinants of such variation are unmeasured or the correct specification is unknown. Given the types of causal phenomena that political scientists study, this is the typical scenario for empirical research, and these two conditions establish external validity as a relevant concern."
"2","Suppose that we begin with a population of interest and draw a sample indexed by . We assume that the sample is self‐weighting and representative—each member of the population has an equal probability of being selected. Such a sample requires no special adjustment (e.g., via weighting) to be made representative of the population.2 In some applications, it does not make sense to think in terms of sampling from a population. An example is international relations studies with data sets that contain all countries in the world. In these cases, one may assume that the conditions that we see in the countries in our data set are but one of the set of possible realizations that could have materialized given that nature is stochastic. This latter formulation is known in the methodology literature as a “super‐population” assumption. All of the results in this article continue to apply if we substitute sampling from a fixed population with the super‐population assumption.3 For all i that appear in the sample, we measure (a) a causal factor of interest, or “treatment,” , which may be continuous or binary; (b) a K‐length row vector of control variables, , that exhibit no perfect colinearities or measurement error; and (c) an outcome, . The sampling or super‐population assumption implies that , , and  are random variables, although not necessarily independent.         "
"3","Our goal is to measure the causal effect of  on . In the current social science literature, a common and extremely clarifying approach to analyzing causal effects is to use “potential outcomes” (Holland 1986; Neyman[1923] 1990; Rubin 1978). The idea is very simple: for every potential value of , each unit i is assumed to possess a well‐defined response. Thus, if  can take on the values  , then unit i's potential outcomes are given by the corresponding values . Causal effects for unit i are formalized as comparisons (e.g., differences or ratios) between potential outcomes. The average causal effect for a population is the average of these unit‐level causal effects for units in this population. The potential outcomes framework is highly general, and even researchers who operate within the conventional regression‐based framework “are working within a [potential outcomes] basis either implicitly or explicitly” (Morton and Williams 2010, 109).4"
"4","Our primary interest in this article is to study the representativeness of linear regression estimators. To this end, we impose assumptions on the underlying causal model that satisfy four criteria: (a) they are as generous to multiple regression as possible, (b) they establish situations in which external validity concerns are present, (c) they stay close to assumptions that are implicit in current practice, and (d) they can in principle be satisfied exactly or approximately in a typical regression analysis. We could use more general assumptions, but this would only make regression look worse by combining issues of primary concern here (generalizability and external validity) with other issues (inadequate control of confounders and therefore problems of internal validity). The only way that our assumptions could be more restrictive would be to assume either that causal effects are constant for all units or that all sources of effect heterogeneity have been modeled. Such additional assumptions are very heroic and most likely unrealistic, but if they do hold, there would be no reason to worry about the types of external validity problems that we discuss here."
"5","Based on these four criteria, we suppose that potential outcomes take the following form:            "
"6","We allow for the control variables in  to be temporally predetermined relative to  and the baseline6 value, , but potentially correlated with both  and .7 However, we assume that the control variables in  are indeed sufficient for removing any confounding in the relationship between  on , so that            "
"7","Readers should avoid misunderstanding the point of assuming linearity in Expressions 1 and 3. It provides a very favorable scenario for researchers who want to use multiple regression to estimate causal effects. The linearity restrictions allow us to focus precisely on the issue at hand—questions of external validity and the generalizability of linear regression estimators. Working with more general types of potential outcomes and confounding would require that we also deal with questions of internal validity and regression model misspecification. If the linearity assumptions were not valid, then the consequences for multiple regression would only be worse than what we obtain below.         "
"8","The goal is to estimate the average causal effect for the population. This is simply the expected value of the unit‐level causal effects:            "
"9","By combining a few well‐established results in linear regression theory, we can determine the effective sample that contributes to the estimation of a causal effect via regression. The effective sample takes into account the multiple regression weight given to each sample member in constructing the estimate. For example, if one begins with a sample of 50% women and 50% men, but then women are given three times as much weight as men in producing the estimate, the effective sample would be 75% women and 25% men. We develop these results in the context of linear regression model fit via ordinary least squares (OLS). What we refer to as “multiple regression” is a regression of the scalar outcome, , on a set of regressors—in this case, the scalar treatment, , and the control vector, . We explain how the results apply to nonlinear models fit via maximum likelihood and random coefficient models.         "
"10","As an analogy to the causal relationship given in Equation 1, we might consider estimating the linear regression model,               "
"11","The concern about omitted variable bias leads us to consider the following linear regression model:               "
"12","We fit Model 6 using OLS to obtain estimates of the parameters, , , and . The estimate  is our regression estimate of the causal effect of . However, fitting Model 6 via OLS induces a weighting scheme that implies that contributions from sample members are used differentially. The weights can be characterized completely via the regressors and do not depend on the outcome. Applying results from partial regression (Greene 2008, 27–29) along with Conditions 1 and 3, multiple regression generates a weighted average of causal effects of the form               "
"13","The result may seem to resemble the expression for the “leverage” statistic, but the leverage, as defined by Davidson and MacKinnon (2004, 77–79), measures unit i's overall distance from the center of the data in terms of all of the predictors,  and , and therefore characterizes the effect of dropping i on the overall coefficient vector (, , and ). By contrast, the multiple regression weight  measures only the contribution of unit i's effect, , to the construction of . In fact, units with high leverage may have low multiple regression weights, and vice versa. (Appendix B presents some clarifying examples.) It is precisely  that is the appropriate measure of the extent to which  incorporates the effect associated with unit i.            "
"14","Our analysis has focused on the case of one treatment and a vector of control variables. If one is estimating causal effects for multiple treatments in a single regression model, then one should compute a separate set of multiple regression weights for each treatment. Effectively, one takes each treatment one‐by‐one to be  in the expressions above, and for the purposes of computing the multiple regression weight for that treatment, considers all other treatments as components of . It is not generally the case that a unit's weight will be the same for each of the treatments. (The leverage would obscure this fact.)            "
"15","One may use the multiple regression weights (and not the leverage) to characterize the effective sample that gives rise to a causal effect estimate. Knowing the effective sample is what allows one to relate effect estimates to units' background characteristics and to evaluate for what kind of population the estimated effects are relevant. For example, suppose you have reason to suspect that the effects of a treatment vary on the basis of certain background characteristics. It is precisely the effective sample that you need in order to compute summary statistics for such background characteristics and to see whether the effective sample differs from the population on the basis of these characteristics.12"
"16","Expression 7 implies that the effective sample is given by reweighting the original sample by the multiple regression weights—the s. We may estimate each of the multiple regression weights with the estimator , where  is the residual from a regression of  on . Then, much as we compute summary statistics for the nominal sample, we may use the multiple regression weights to estimate summary statistics for the effective sample. We can estimate the mean of a covariate  in the effective sample with            "
"17","In a world of effects that are heterogeneous, characterizing the covariate profile for the effective sample is crucial. We learn about the type of population to which our effect estimates apply. The multiple regression weights provide the basis for doing this. When some types of observations have multiple regression weights of zero, this means that the covariates completely explain their treatment condition. Such units do not contribute to the estimate that we obtain from the study, and therefore there is no statistical basis to conclude that the results of the study are applicable to them. When some types of observations have multiple regression weights that are very small relative to other observations, it means that they are poorly represented in the effective sample from which the effect estimate is obtained. Without further assumptions, we have a weak statistical basis for claiming that our effect estimate is applicable to them, as their contribution is overwhelmed by the contribution of those with larger weights.         "
"18","We had assumed above that  confounded the relationship between  and , but it is instructive to stop and think for a moment what would happen were this not the case. That is, suppose that  were randomly assigned, as would be the case in a well‐executed randomized experiment with equal assignment probabilities. Then  would be independent of  as well as , in which case  would be independent of . As a result, the weights in Expression 7 would effectively cancel out, and  would converge to .15 (See Corollary A.1 in the appendix.) While controlling for  was not necessary to deal with confounding, doing so could help to make the estimate of  more precise. This is how the marriage of random sampling, random assignment, and regression can work to produce internally valid, representative, and precise estimates of causal effects (Lin 2013).16"
"19","Randomized experiments are rare in political science, which is the reason that we consider methods of covariate control to eliminate confounding. The implicit weighting of multiple regression can lead us away from our target, . In particular, it is the potential for association between  and  that causes the distortion. The regression estimate, , may incorporate contributions from sample members in a way that departs substantially from equal representation among the population of interest. The effective sample may be a gross distortion of the type of population that one intends to characterize.            "
"20","Here we consider implications of our result for other regression‐based estimators, namely, estimates from nonlinear maximum likelihood estimators and from random coefficient models. We show that these estimators apply the same multiple regression weights that OLS does, either exactly or approximately."
"21","The results for linear regression carry over directly to nonlinear regression models fit via maximum likelihood. This includes the class of generalized linear models, such as logit, probit, multinomial logit or probit, Poisson regression, and parametric or semiparametric (e.g., Cox) duration models (Long 1997; McCullagh and Nelder 1999). For example, consider a logistic regression that is analogous to the linear regression that we developed above:               "
"22","Readers may wonder whether the reweighting associated with OLS is somehow ameliorated by random coefficient models, which in principle account for coefficient heterogeneity. There are many varieties of random coefficient models, and so to make the analysis more precise, consider the foundational model of Swamy (1970), which serves as the basis of many more computationally sophisticated models (Hsiao and Pesaran 2008). Suppose a unit i is a member of one of G groups indexed by g, where we use  to denote unit i's group. Then the Swamy model supposes that               "
"23","We can illustrate how these results apply to actual studies. We consider two examples. The first is based on Jensen (2003), who studies the effects of political regime type on inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). This example shows how one may use our results to analyze a cross‐national, time‐series cross‐section study. The second is based on Gerber and Huber (2010), who study the effects of partisanship on economic assessments. This example shows how one may use our results to analyze a survey‐based study. Our purpose with these examples is not to expose flaws in the studies. Both studies are very well executed and, as a result, well cited. Rather, to the extent that we take unmodeled effect heterogeneity seriously, the goal is to illustrate how the multiple regression weights allow us to understand more precisely the scope conditions for the results from these studies. We find that the studies differ quite markedly in the extent to which the nominal samples reflect the effective samples used to generate key findings.         "
"24","Jensen (2003) studies the effects of regime type on FDI using cross‐section, time‐series cross‐sectional, and other regression analyses of a set of 114 countries observed over the years 1970 to 1997. The results suggest that “democratic political institutions are associated with higher levels of FDI inflows” (588). The geographic distribution of the nominal sample is shown in the left panel of Figure 1. Our illustration focuses on the time‐series cross‐section analysis, and specifically on Model 10 in Table 1 of the published article. The specification incorporates country and decade fixed effects, lagged FDI, and a set of control variables including lagged values of market size, development level, growth, trade, budget deficit, government consumption, and democracy. The resulting estimate implies that a one‐unit increase in the Polity score corresponds to a 0.020 increase in net FDI inflows as a percentage of gross domestic product (p < 0.001).            "
"25","Example of nominal and effective samples from Jensen (2003)                        "
"26","Note: On the left, the shading shows countries in the nominal sample for Jensen (2003) estimate of the effects of regime type on FDI. On the right, darker shading indicates that a country contributes more to the effective sample, based on the panel specification used in estimation.                        "
"27","Of course, there is no way to randomly assign regime types to countries, and so estimates of the effects of regime types rely on the unexplained variation in regime type that the world provides us. That being said, not all countries contribute equally to such variation. The multiple regression weights measure such contributions. We first regress the FDI variable on the various control variables (including the country and decade fixed effects) and then extract the residuals. The multiple regression weights (the s) equal the squares of these residuals. To measure the extent to which a given country contributes to the effect estimate, we compute the analogue to the left‐hand side of Expression 9, taking the sum of the weights for that country (summing over all time periods) and dividing it by the sum of all the weights in the sample. The right panel in Figure 1 shows the results. Darker shading means a larger contribution by that country, and white shading means a small or negligible contribution. From the sample of 114 countries, 12 contribute over half (51%) of the weight used to construct the estimate of the effect of regime type on FDI, and 32 contribute 90% of the weight. The top 12 contributing countries, in descending order of their weights, are Uruguay, Hungary, Niger, Philippines, Argentina, Madagascar, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Poland, Peru, Lesotho, and Belarus. Importantly, the lowest‐contributing 14 countries combine to contribute less than 0.05% of the weight used to construct the effect estimate. These lowest‐contributing countries, in ascending order of their weights, are Central African Republic, Albania, Germany, Russia, Haiti, Benin, South Africa, Yemen, Honduras, DR Congo, Czech Republic, Lithuania, China, and Latvia.            "
"28","These results are useful for two reasons. First, they provide a precise statement on the scope conditions for the findings. We see that the findings are driven primarily by the experiences of Latin American, Eastern European, and African cases, the exceptions being the Philippines and Pakistan. A substantively important finding is that none of the fast‐growing economies of East Asia (the “Asian Tiger” economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, along with Indonesia, Malaysia, or Thailand) are major contributors to this estimate, even though they may be countries of interest for this study. In addition, large and theoretically interesting countries such as Russia, China, and Germany are essentially not represented at all in the estimate of the causal effect. Second, the results help in determining which cases one may want to investigate further to check the accuracy of one's interpretation of the quantitative results. This provides a refinement to the nested mixed‐methods strategies proposed by Lieberman (2005) for using quantitative results to select cases for qualitative investigation.            "
"29","Gerber and Huber (2010) study the effects of partisanship on economic assessments by analyzing data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey (CCES) collected just before and just after the 2006 midterm election. The research design took advantage of the unexpected Democratic takeover of the House and Senate as a result of the election. As such, the authors claim that correlations between partisanship and economic perceptions can be interpreted in terms of the differential effects of the partisan change in control of Congress on Republican‐ versus Democratic‐leaning partisans. To rule out spuriousness with respect to other factors that affect economic perceptions, Gerber and Huber control for gender, race, age, union membership, income, and education. They find that Democratic partisans appear to be substantially more upbeat about economic conditions.            "
"30","We focus on regression Model (4) in Table 4A of their article, which uses a behavioral indicator of economic assessments: the natural log of the change in respondents' predicted vacation spending over the pre‐ and post‐election waves of the survey. The nominal sample is a subsample of 1,469 subjects from the overall CCES sample. The CCES sample included 2,000 respondents selected from a pool of Internet users matched to the characteristics of a national random‐digit dialing sample. The subsample of 1,469 includes members of the panel for whom data were complete for this regression model. The characteristics of this nominal sample are shown in the second and third columns of Table 1.18 Gerber and Huber(2010) estimate that a unit change in a respondent's party identification scale in the direction of “strong Democrat” is associated with a 0.077 increase in log change in projected vacation spending (p < .05), implying about a 20% increase.            "
"31","To what extent does the nominal sample differ from the effective sample that generated this particular estimate? That question is answered in the fourth and fifth columns of Table 1, which show summary statistics for the effective sample as produced by regression. To compute these summary statistics, we regressed the party identification variable on all of the control variables, extracted the residuals, and took the squares of these residuals to obtain the s. The summary statistics for the effective sample are the weighted means (weighted by the s) for each of the variables, computed using the left‐hand side of Expression 9. In this case, we see small differences between the nominal and effective samples. The reason is that party identification, the causal factor of interest, exhibits a high degree of unexplained variation relative to many of the demographic controls considered in this analysis. For controls that are more prognostic of party identification (e.g., the indicators for race and union membership), there is very little variation to start with in the nominal sample, and so reweighting on these controls is minor when we consider demographic shares in absolute terms. In this example, the nominal sample rather accurately characterizes the population for which the effect of partisanship has been estimated.19"
"32","Researchers may want to do more than accept what regression offers in terms of multiple regression weighting and produce an estimate of , the average causal effect for the target population represented by the nominal sample. There is a large current literature on identification and estimation of average causal effects, and it is beyond the scope of this article to detail all of the results from this literature. We describe the basic conditions required to estimate representative causal effects, provide references that explain in more detail various approaches to operationalizing such conditions, and explain how multiple regression compares.         "
"33","So far, we have used a causal model that is very favorable to regression, assuming both locally linear unit‐level effects (Expression 1) and linearity of  with respect to the control variables (Expression 3). Under these assumptions, we find that multiple regression produces a causal effect estimate that incorporates unit‐level contributions on the basis of conditional variance of the treatment variable. One idea might be that we could just weight by the inverse of such conditional variances to recover . This would require obtaining consistent and stable estimates of the conditional variances. (We cannot weight by the inverse of the s because the unit‐level weights may be arbitrarily close to zero, even as .) However, this inverse‐variance weighting procedure is no less onerous than are the steps required to estimate average causal effects under assumptions much less restrictive than the two linearity assumptions.         "
"34","Thus, let us consider identification and estimation of average causal effects under a more general model of treatment assignment and unit‐level effects. The target quantity is again , as defined in Expression 4; however, we now drop the assumption of local linearity, as stated by Expression 1. We instead define causal effects over arbitrary potential outcomes:            "
"35","Under this highly agnostic model of causal effects, estimation of  requires that a strong “positivity” condition holds over the whole population.20 Positivity, loosely speaking, requires that, for all values of  that appear in the target population, there is some probability of observing different values of . If, for example, all units with a given covariate profile always have the same treatment condition, then one cannot estimate causal effects for these units. When positivity fails, then the best that one can do without introducing more assumptions (that provide a basis for extrapolation and interpolation) is to estimate a representative causal effect for the subset of the target population for which positivity does hold (Petersen et al. 2011). Formally, the positivity assumption is as follows:            "
"36","Given unconfoundedness and positivity, the average causal effect for the target population is defined by            "
"37","We can draw a connection between the positivity assumption and the results that we obtained above for multiple regression. The positivity assumption implies that  for all values of x. Thus, when a multiple regression places (either approximately or exactly) no weight on a set of units with a given covariate profile, this result implies that positivity is violated and representative causal effects cannot be estimated for the target population without assumption‐based extrapolation or interpolation. Examination of the effective sample provides insight about what can be learned from any given study. In the Jensen (2003) study, many substantively important countries—including Russia and China—cannot be included in estimates of the causal effects of regime type on FDI. No consistent, extrapolation‐free estimator of  is available for any  if our interest is in the average over the entirety of the 114 countries in the nominal sample. This is not due to any fault on Jensen's part; it is an implication of the variation that nature has provided. However, in other studies, such as Gerber and Huber (2010), positivity appears to hold, and thus estimation of representative average causal effects is straightforward. Of course, the effective sample that multiple regression generates is one for which positivity holds by construction. In conjunction with the linearity assumptions embodied by Expressions 1 and 3 (assumptions that are with little loss of generality when  is binary), regression facilitates estimation in a manner that reflects the regions of the data where causal inference is possible.         "
"38","A key argument for using regression on representative samples to estimate causal effects rather than experiments or quasi‐experimental methods using instrumental variables, discontinuities, or matching is based on the presumption that one can avoid problems of external validity. From the results above, we see that this argument is not generally valid even under circumstances that are highly favorable to regression. The mechanics of regression adjustment are such that calculation of effect estimates is based on sources of identifying variation in the data. The weighting that this implies may not map onto the population that the researcher sets out to study. Running a regression without considering the steps involved in the estimation obscures the nonrepresentative nature of the effects that have been estimated. Experimental and quasi‐experimental methods are more transparent in that regard. This is to say nothing of the differences in the degree of internal validity that the different approaches achieve."
"39","But our results are not nihilistic. To the extent that a regression has adequately controlled for confounding, we have demonstrated how to characterize the effective sample. In a world of heterogeneous effects, characterizing the effective sample is critical to the scientific enterprise of creating generalized knowledge about the effects of causal factors. Such generalized knowledge requires that we understand how effects vary across different types of populations. We can only understand how effects vary across different types of populations if we know the profile of the samples that gave rise to our effect estimates. The multiple regression weights are precisely what one needs to characterize the profile of the effective sample that gave rise to an effect estimate from a regression study. The thousands of well‐specified regressions that populate our journals are not without value. It is just that the scope of their applicability is probably more limited than what we have been led to believe in the absence of knowing the multiple regression weights. Researchers building on such past work would do well to investigate such scope conditions using the methods outlined in this article, creating maps and summary statistics that provide a clear picture of the effective sample. We may find that effects differ across effective samples that also differ in their covariate profiles. Such information on effects and associated effective sample characteristics provides the basis for building theories to explain effect heterogeneity and produce a generalized understanding of the effects of causal factors."
"40","Readers may be disappointed that we have not proposed a statistical “fix” to generalizability problems for a given study. But it is crucial for researchers to understand what really is being estimated with the statistical methods that they use and that statistical methods themselves cannot overcome limitations of the data. We have shown that achieving knowledge about causal effects for a given population is more difficult than running a conventional multiple regression on a sample representative of that population. Estimates from a randomized experiment are only directly informative for the subpopulation whose treatment status can be manipulated by the investigator. Estimates from an observational study can only be directly informative for the subpopulation that exhibits some unpredictability in their treatment status after accounting for control variables."
"41","Do these limits doom us to a world of idiosyncratic knowledge? The answer depends on the manner in which we conduct and interpret our empirical work. Abandoning experiments and quasi‐experiments for regressions on representative samples is not a solution. As Imbens (2010) suggests, there are principled ways to move beyond merely accumulating idiosyncratic findings and analyzing effect heterogeneity across different studies. Furthermore, by understanding the effective sample for a study, one can inform theory. The effective sample for a study may give a lot of weight to units that existing theory suggests should not be affected by the treatment. If a substantial effect is nonetheless found, this creates an opportunity for refining current theories. It may be more fruitful to think about the theoretical traction that a study's sample offers rather than evaluating it against some illusive generalizability ideal. Regardless of the approach taken, an understanding of the effective sample is the first step in placing effect estimates into a broader context.         "
