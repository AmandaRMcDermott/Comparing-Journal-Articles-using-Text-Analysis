"1","In their emphasis on the good as the overarching aim of virtue, Aristotle's current students take their inspiration from his account of the highest good in Book I of the Nicomachean Ethics, but they tend to ignore or understate his treatment of the authoritative place of the political community and of law (nomos) in ordering human action. Indeed, throughout the Nicomachean Ethics and Politics, Aristotle underscores the comprehensiveness and weight of politics and law in human affairs (1134a35–b1, 1138a5–7, 1138a5–11, Pol. 1282b1–6, 1287a16–32; see also Ruderman 1997, 412; Morrison 2001, 223–24). After a highly provisional discussion of the highest good in Book I of the Ethics, moreover, he turns to his account of moral virtue in Books II through V having firmly established that the political community is the “architectonic power” that orders the human good and that law is the “authoritative” voice of “right reason” in the education to virtue (1094a24–28, b5–11, 1102a5–13, 1103b2–6, 31–34; see also 1138a5–11).3"
"2","In its dual role as guardian of the common good and educator, the political community seeks to instill virtues that make citizens law‐abiding and good (1102a7–10, 1103b3–6). Aristotle's approach in delineating these virtues is also more complicated than that of his current students, both liberal and communitarian, who define the virtues in terms of an overarching notion or principle of the good. According to Aristotle, “the good” in the realm of action is given first in the principles held by the morally serious (spoudaios) and prudent (phronimos) human being: the person who, having been “nobly raised,” identifies “living well” and “acting well” with “noble and just” action, and so with moral virtue (ēthikē aretē) as the proper disposition with respect to action (1094b14–19, 1098a14–18, 1099a22–31). In contrast to his students today, then, Aristotle begins by defining the human good in terms of moral virtue, and not the reverse.4 More precisely, he conditionally defines the good as an activity of the soul in accord with reason, and action in conformity with this, and he adopts the morally serious perspective in identifying moral virtue as the perfection of that part of the soul—the desiring and longing part—from which action issues (1098a13–18).            "
"3","Accordingly, Aristotle proceeds to the discussion of the particular virtues on the supposition that moral virtue is our proper end in the realm of action, and he offers a provisional definition: with respect to the passions and actions, moral virtue is a perfection in being a “mean” (meson) in relation to two vices, which are the excess and deficiency concerning what is fitting (deon), and it is a mean that accords with the rational principle (logos) defined by the prudent human being (1106b36–1107a6). Aristotle's definition remains provisional since he postpones the question of the rational principle or right reason that underlies moral virtue until his account of intellectual virtue in Book VI (1103b31–34). For the moment, it must suffice to say that immediately prior to turning to Book VI, Aristotle offers his strongest statement that the law is the voice of right reason (1138a5–11).            "
"4","As guardian of the common good and educator, then, the law strives to make citizens obedient to the laws and “noble and good,”kalos k'agathos, the two terms also often used in Greek to describe the exemplar of virtue. The particular virtues are Aristotle's precise specification of the perfection at which the law aims, and in his opening discussion of courage, the first of the virtues, he confirms the horizon of his investigation by explicitly identifying the end (telos) of virtue not with happiness but with “the noble” (1102a5–7, 1115a4–5, 1115b11–13). In identifying the noble with the end of virtue—a formulation that recurs throughout the discussion of the virtues—Aristotle's account of courage illuminates the ground upon which virtue becomes an end in its own right.5 The first important, though strangely overlooked, fact is that “the noble” in the case of courage immediately points to sacrifice and self‐forgetting as the essential aspect of good action.6 Defining courage as “noble death in battle” and recalling the many honors that grateful nations pay to those who die in battle, Aristotle insists that the noblest deaths occur in war because war “contains the greatest and noblest danger” (1115a24–32). By this measure, courageous action acquires its nobility in being done for the sake of a good that is “nobler and more divine” than that of any individual: the good of the city and nation (cf. 1094b24–32; Aspasius 1889, 18). It is nobility in this sense—as manifest in action on behalf of a higher end or good—that first elevates virtuous action as an end worthy of our dedication.            "
"5","Aristotle elucidates the full complexity of moral motivation, however, by also insisting that the truly courageous individual acts not for the sake of the political community alone or for the honors it bestows. Rather, in “showing his prowess as a man” or “dying nobly,” if it is necessary to die, this individual is willing to endure death only in an action that demonstrates his own virtue (1115a35–b6). The courageous human being is thus distinguished neither by simple altruism, nor by the hope of some good extrinsic to the act, but by the dedication to virtue itself. To the courageous man, Aristotle observes, it is courage that is noble, and those who act for the sake of any other end, including civic honors, possess a courage that is a mere appearance of the true thing (1115a32–35, b20–24, 1116a17–21). This view is not only acknowledged but cultivated by the political community: while the political community may seek its own security through the honors its confers upon courage, these same honors point to courage as the noblest and best aim for a human being.7 As the portal through which we enter his inquiry into the morally serious life, then, Aristotle's discussion of courage locates the nobility and goodness of this life in its dedication to virtue as an end in itself. This discussion thereby preserves the noble as virtue's aim and affirms Aristotle's claim in his introduction to moral virtue that an action is virtuous only if, among other things, it is chosen for its own sake (1105a30–34).            "
"6","Nevertheless, courageous action in particular involves a difficulty, the resolution of which will inform the discussion of the virtues that follow. In performing a noble deed, the courageous human being is shown to perform a deed that is at once selfless, in being for the sake of a higher end, and self‐regarding, in being for the sake of his own virtue. But in the case of courage, this same action is problematic in entailing also the cessation of the activity and life that its presence as a virtue makes choice‐worthy: “the more a man possesses complete virtue and is happy,” Aristotle notes, “the more death will be painful to him, because especially to this sort of man, to live is worthwhile” (1117b9–12). As one who is dedicated to virtue above all, nevertheless, the man of true courage will “choose the noble thing in war” instead of his own “greatest goods,” and he does this in awareness of his sacrifice and so with pain (1117b12–15, a33–34). In contrast to his great medieval interpreter Aquinas, who allows for a courage that finds its reward in the hereafter, Aristotle underscores the sacrifice involved in the act by his denial in the discussion of courage of the possibility of an afterlife: “for the dead, there seems to be nothing, neither good nor evil” (1115a27, cf. Aquinas 1964, I:590). The very loss that ennobles courage thus makes its action deeply problematic and raises the question whether there is a kind of noble action more consistent with self‐concern. In fact, the concern for our self‐preservation and well‐being comes so much to the fore in the next virtue, moderation, that “the noble” as an end almost recedes from view. Yet moderation, which has no action of its own, proves instrumental to the virtue that follows it, liberality, whose noble giving clearly entails a loss, but not a fatal one (1121b1–12).            "
"7","Aristotle presents in liberality a noble deed consistent with a certain self‐concern. Like courage, liberality is hard because it entails a loss for the giver, who gives of his own material goods (chrēmata) or money. The liberal person gives with pleasure, nevertheless, because he achieves his end, and he acts entirely in accord with his choice or preference since he prefers noble action over money (1120a23–25, 30–33). While the courageous man acts with pain and is even “unwilling,” then, the liberal person remains cheerful in the face of his loss (cf. 1117b7–9 with 1115a20–22). He so much loves to give, in fact, that he has a tendency toward prodigality, one of the virtue's associated vices, and he is so easygoing with money that he is vulnerable to being cheated (1119b34–1120a4, 1120b4–6, 1121a4–6).            "
"8","But while the liberal person's noble activity is consistent with self‐concern, it raises a new question with respect to virtue: the question of the means needed for its action. The problem in the case of liberality is that in the absence of a lucky inheritance or winning lottery ticket, a person who seems otherwise unconcerned about money must acquire and preserve it if he is to have goods to give. Yet, as Aristotle is quick to note, acquisition is governed not by liberality as a virtue but by justice. In observing that liberality pertains to the good use of wealth, he is precise in insisting that the use of wealth involves giving and spending as opposed to taking and preserving, which have more to do with its acquisition, and his precision is prompted by the fact that justice too pertains to material goods or money, and specifically their acquisition (1120a4–11, 18–23).8 The action of giving is governed by liberality, then, but constrained by justice, and the problem of this constraint underlies the abstraction from the requirements and concerns of justice that begins in the discussion of liberality.            "
"9","Aristotle indicates the problem this constraint presents in a wry digression: “We do not call tyrants prodigal,” he observes, “for it does not seem to be easy to exceed in gifts and expenses the amount they possess” (1120b25–27). The means of liberal action, that is, are most amply at the disposal of a tyrant, who may be said to own the entire city (cf. Pol. 1276a6–16, 1287a1–3). From the point of view of the person who loves to benefit others by giving, and whose specific action and pleasure can be fully indulged only with the requisite means, then, the tyrant is the most fortunate of men. Liberality is possible, of course, for those of modest means, and Aristotle indicates that a liberal person, who is disposed to give, is not likely to “take from the wrong source” (1120a32–33, b28–35). But, as he reiterates at the end of his account of liberality, because the actions associated with acquisition fall under the government of justice, the clearest constraint on a virtuous person who loves noble giving and yet has limited means is that obtaining the resources for giving on a grand scale would entail actions that are “wicked, impious, and unjust” (1122a3–7). In the case of magnificence and magnanimity—the virtues that follow liberality and that involve great actions—the problem of this constraint will necessarily become more acute, and yet Aristotle's presentation of these virtues will completely abstract from the activity of acquisition and so from the considerations of justice.            "
"10","In the longing for the noble, there is a natural directedness toward great acts that the movement from liberality to magnificence captures: to benefit one person is good, to be sure, but to be the “cause of the greatest good” by benefiting the city as a whole is nobler and even divine (1094b7–10, Pol. 1253a30–31).9 Like liberality, magnificence pertains to money, but more precisely to giving and spending “on a grand scale” (1122a21–23). The one who acts in accord with magnificence longs to produce a noble and great work (ergon), and he seeks especially to undertake the “most honorable” works, those of public or common (koina) concern (1122b19–23, 1122b33–1123a5). In both his private and public expenditures, the one who possesses magnificence acts with pleasure and “for the sake of the noble,” which is “common to the virtues,” and he possesses a kind of knowledge in doing what is fitting both to the occasion and to his own virtue (1122a6–9, b6–8, 34–35). The products of magnificence, therefore, are not only noblest and most honorable, but also the “ornament” (kosmos) of their patron's own great virtue (1122a6–9).            "
"11","Because it pertains to great works, however, magnificence is clearly outside the reach of all but the wealthy. In fact, Aristotle suggests, magnificence is typically contingent on “birth,” not least for the money it requires (1122b26–35). The problem is that the longing for the noble that ties magnificence to the other virtues is not itself a function of birth, so that the question of acquisition must be addressed. Yet this question has been completely dropped: the virtue of magnificence pertains only to expenditures and not to acquisition on a grand scale. Of the vices associated with such grand acquisitiveness—namely, wickedness, impiety, and injustice—none are extremes associated with magnificence. Aristotle presents magnificence, then, in abstraction from the activity on which it depends, and so from the virtue that pertains to this activity, justice. It may be said that as a part of complete virtue, magnificence is necessarily perfected or “completed” by justice, but this suggestion is forestalled by the movement of Aristotle's discussion to magnanimity, the first peak and completion of the virtues."
"12","As a peak and completion of virtue, magnanimity occupies a central place in Aristotle's treatment of the morally serious life. While recent commentators have rightly drawn attention to the ambiguities of Aristotle's account of this virtue, and particularly to its “ironic” or critical aspects, they have tended to ignore the important sense in which magnanimity is indeed a completion of moral virtue.10 Magnanimity as a virtue is said to pertain to “great things,” and especially to great honor, but we quickly learn that magnanimity's relation to honor is mediated by its connection with virtue. Because the magnanimous man possesses “what is great in each virtue,” according to Aristotle, he “is worthy of great things” and “regards himself as worthy of great things,” and especially of “the greatest of the external goods,” honor (1123b29–30, 20–21, 34–35). Such an individual represents a peak and completion of virtue, then, both in possessing each of the virtues and in assigning to virtue the “prize” of honor as its proper desert (1123b16–20). Like the great works of magnificence, the honor that the magnanimous man assigns to his own nobility and goodness (kalokagathia) makes magnanimity the ornament (or crown, kosmos) of the virtues (1123b34–1124a5).            "
"13","As virtue's exemplar and champion, moreover, the magnanimous man identifies it not only as his highest end, but as his greatest good. Even honor, the greatest of the external goods, pales by comparison, for “no honor could be commensurate with perfect virtue” (1124a5–9, cf. 1134b6–7). The magnanimous man's singular devotion to virtue is especially manifest in his sense of self‐sufficiency and admirable beneficence.11 He is moderately disposed with respect to every external good and thereby largely undisturbed by the sway of fortune to which they are naturally exposed (1124a13–16). He is eager to aid another, but typically declines aid because it belongs to his virtue “to be in need of no one or scarcely so” (1124b17–18). He also tends not to dwell upon past evils or to hold grudges; he is not given to flattery or complaints; and he is little concerned with profit or utility (1125c3–5, cf. 1124b12–15; 1125a9–10, 11–12). His very deportment reflects his self‐possession: he moves slowly, and his voice is deep and steady, “for the one who takes few things seriously is not prone to haste and the one to whom nothing is great is not excitable” (1125a12–16).            "
"14","Indeed, as several commentators have noted, there is a gentle measure of caricature in Aristotle's portrait of the magnanimous man so that we may rightly wonder whether this portrait is in part a fiction rather than a representation of an actual human being (Howland 2002, 31–33; Arnhart 1983, 265–67; Hardie 1978, 74; Joachim 1951, 125; Burnet 1900, 179 and 181). This suspicion might begin to be allayed by the fact that magnanimity is the only virtue for which Aristotle offers examples—except that neither of the examples is of a single great man: the first example is Zeus, and the second, the Athenians (1124b15–17). The unusual step of adducing examples, that is, would seem to corroborate our suspicion.            "
"15","But what, then, are we to learn from this somewhat fictionalized peak of virtue? Is this fiction, as commentators have argued, intended as a critique of the magnanimous man's overweening ambition or of his error with respect to his true self‐sufficiency (Smith 2001, 116–21; Howland 2002, 32, 46–49; Tessitore 1996, 31–35)? In the first place, I suggest, Aristotle's portrait of magnanimity and of the magnanimous man's elevation of virtue to the place of the highest human good represents the fullest expression of virtue as an independent end. For in contrast to the courageous man, who still distinguishes virtue as an end from his own “greatest goods,” the magnanimous man now wholly identifies virtue as the greatest of his goods. This identification is the peak of the morally serious human being's devotion to virtue, with the result that all other goods, including life itself, diminish in significance. In contrast to courage, then, magnanimity represents a more perfect if still problematic union of self‐awareness and self‐forgetting. The magnanimous man will not take small risks, since he honors few things, but he will take great risks, and when he does so, “he is unsparing of his life, on the grounds that living is not at all worthwhile” (1124b6–9).12 Indeed, Aristotle is intent on drawing our attention to the fact that to the magnanimous man, for whom virtue is best, “nothing is great,” a phrase repeated three times. This sense of the insignificance of all but virtue supports the magnanimous man's disinclination to act basely or unjustly: “for the sake of what does he do shameful things, he to whom nothing is great?” (1123b31–32). Except when a great honor or work appropriate to his virtue is at stake, his singular dedication to virtue makes him tend toward inaction and idleness (1124b24–26). The magnanimous man is unlikely even to fill the time in study or thought: since “nothing is great to him,” he is “not given to wonder” (1125a2). In short, the “activity” of magnanimity, about which there is much debate, could be described most simply as the magnanimous man's self‐contemplation of his own perfect virtue.13"
"16","But Aristotle thus shows that in reaching its peak in magnanimity, moral virtue also reaches an impasse that reflects the abstraction from the requirements and concerns of justice. For even if most things are not worth doing, let alone pondering, at this highpoint of virtue, the greatest and noblest of actions—the great risks on behalf of which the magnanimous man is willing to throw away his very life—remain most choice‐worthy. As Aristotle will insist in Book IX, the serious man (spoudaios) would prefer “to live nobly for a year than in an indifferent way for many, and to do one noble and great deed than many insignificant ones” (1169a22–25; cf. the account of Dion at Pol. 1312a21–39). And, as we have seen, the action of the virtues from courage through magnanimity issues from an admirable longing on the part of the virtuous person to exercise his virtue. Even in the face of death on the battlefield, the truly courageous man longs to perform a courageous deed, and at the peak of the virtues, the magnanimous man will “throw away” his life in a great deed that accords with his great virtue. Yet, in the absence of the necessary “resources,” the longing for noble action that distinguishes the morally serious human being requires him either to remain idle or to acquire the means to exercise his virtue.14"
"17","The problem that this choice presents has already been pointed to by Aristotle's discussion of liberality: the means to the greatest scope of noble action are open only to the tyrant. In explicitly confronting this problem in his introduction to the best regime in the Politics, Aristotle suggests that it might indeed cause us to wonder whether, for the person who loves noble action, “having authority over all is best, for in this way one would have authority over the greatest number and noblest of actions” (Pol. 1325a34–37). The argument Aristotle marshals in support of this view insists that the only clear‐sighted course for the one who believes that the most choice‐worthy life is the one in accord with noble action is to forgo all obligations of justice, and even of family and friendship, in order to rule over others (Pol. 1325a36–41).15"
"18","But as Aristotle also indicates in the discussion of liberality and explicates more fully in the Politics, this argument leaves the virtuous person in a terrible quandary. Obtaining the conditions of his own activity will require such deviations from virtue as he could never make up for later. In particular, the one who would seek the greatest scope of noble action would need to deviate so far from justice—in wresting rule from those who possess it and who may have an equal claim to it—as to degrade his own virtue. For justice too is a virtue; it is, more importantly, the other complete virtue, understood as “the sum of the virtues” and as “directed toward another” (1129b29–33).            "
"19","Aristotle's complex picture of moral virtue is made still more complex by the presence of two peaks and completions of virtue that must be reconciled. Magnanimity is in part a fiction because it wishes for a self‐sufficiency and superiority that abstracts from the demands and concerns of justice.16 Indeed, the magnanimous man demands as virtue's prize the honor that Aristotle reserves in Book I for the truly self‐sufficient and divine things, the gods and happiness (1101b13–27, b35–1102a4). By contrast, as human beings, we live in community with others, and our perfection must therefore also take account of justice—as a matter of moral or right action, and not simply, as current students of Aristotle emphasize, of our happiness or flourishing (cf. Smith 2001, 153, 211–16, 225–29; Howland 2002, 50–53; Ward 2001, 80–82). Aristotle indicates that even in the case of less than perfect regimes, the weight of law and the importance of the common good are such that some consideration of justice must be made (1128b21–26, 1129b11–19, 1134a24–32; Pol. 1253a30–39, 1269a12–24, 1276b27–35, 1282b14–18). Yet, as he also suggests in the Politics, perhaps there is one regime—the best—in which the virtues of the good man will coincide with those of the good citizen (Pol. 1278b1–5). To formulate this possibility in terms of justice: in the best case, perhaps our full moral perfection is truly to be found in community with others and in action “toward the good of another.” Aristotle's discussion of the second peak and completion of virtue, I suggest, explores the full scope of this possibility and, in doing so, confronts the problem of its limits.            "
"20","As a principle of the political order, justice is the focus of much scrutiny in contemporary political theory, yet even among neo‐Aristotelians, there is little attention paid to justice as a characteristic or virtue of the individual.17 Aristotle, by contrast, begins his inquiry by emphasizing that justice is like the other virtues in constituting a characteristic that disposes us to act well, namely, “to do just things, act justly, and wish just things” (1129a3–11). His first task, then, is to examine justice as a virtue that constitutes our perfection. The immediate complication is that justice has two meanings that are similar but not the same, for “the lawbreaker is thought to be unjust,” but so too is “the one who takes more than his share [pleonektês] and is unfair [lit. unequal, anisos]” (1129a32–34). In short, justice may mean either “lawfulness” or “fairness,” alternatives that Aristotle classifies under the respective headings of general and particular justice (1129a34–b1). Accordingly, there exist two different, though related, characteristics in the case of justice. General justice as lawfulness is complete virtue, understood as the sum of all the virtues directed toward the good of another (1129b26–30). Particular justice as fairness is the proper disposition concerning the good things—security, money, and honor—in which all who belong to the political community must share (1130a32–b5).         "
"21","In exploring the full range of justice as a virtue, Aristotle addresses the question raised by magnanimity: whether the devotion to the common good can be reconciled in the best case with the dedication to one's perfection in virtue simply. The limits of justice in this regard first become apparent in Aristotle's discussion of particular justice. In brief, the requirements of particular justice understood as fairness prove to be grounded in a standard other than the one that Aristotle himself establishes as that by which an individual ought to choose the good things. This standard is one's true benefit or harm—in the best case, the possession and activity of the virtues that pertain to the good things simply. One ought to choose the goods that contribute to one's perfection in this sense and avoid those that are detrimental (1129b3–6; see also 1124a26–31). Aristotle's discussion of particular justice shows that, in contrast to the other virtues, justice as a mean is not defined in relation to our good condition or perfection, but in terms of a principle of equality that establishes what is equal or fair in relation to the common good and that accords with the equality constituting the “regime” (politeia). For this reason, Aristotle will settle the question of justice as a virtue only after he has investigated the “proportionate reciprocity” at the origin of the political community. After first setting forth Aristotle's accounts of general and particular justice as perfections, then, I turn to his discussion of reciprocity for the light it sheds on justice's limits as a virtue.         "
"22","General justice is complete virtue in being all the virtues “summed up in one” and “directed toward another,” and complete virtue in this sense is properly understood as justice first in its connection with the law (1129b26–30). As Aristotle observes, “all the lawful things are somehow just” not only because they have been “laid down by the lawgiver” but more importantly because they have a comprehensive scope and end: the laws “make pronouncements on everything,” and they seek the common advantage, understood in terms of the variety of regimes as “the advantage for all in common or for the best or for those who hold power in accord with virtue or in some other such way” (1129b14–17). Complete virtue is justice, then, because the law commands the deeds of virtue and forbids bad acts in order to “produce and preserve happiness and its parts for the political community” (1129b17–19). With this end in view, for example, the law commands courage in requiring that soldiers not break ranks in battle; moderation, in prohibiting adultery or outrage; gentleness, in forbidding assault or slander (1129b19–24).18 The law thus strives to instill all the virtues or general justice in every citizen.            "
"23","The orientation of general justice toward another constitutes its unique power—“justice alone of the virtues is thought to be the good of another” (1130a3–5, my emphasis)—and as a result of its orientation, justice attracts very high praise as “the greatest [kratistē] of the virtues” (1129b27–29). Indeed, the case for justice as the best or highest of the virtues is the one Aristotle offers here. Citizenship in a community means that any action, including a virtuous action, has a dual aspect: it can be understood from the point of view of either one's own perfection or another's benefit. Justice would appear to be the most complete of the virtues, then, because, in obvious contrast to the pride and self‐sufficiency of magnanimity, it comprises both the sum of the virtues and the “use” of this perfection in its orientation toward the good of another (cf. Aquinas 1964, I:910). General justice, by this account, constitutes both another's good and our true perfection, a conclusion Aristotle encourages in saying that virtue and justice are the same, but “in their being [to einai],” they differ: “in being in relation to another, it [the characteristic] is justice, but in being a certain characteristic simply, virtue” (1130a10–13).19"
"24","Having lavished such praise on general justice, Aristotle turns to particular justice, which he tells us is the true focus of our investigation (1130a14, 1130b18–20). Like the other virtues, particular justice is a part of the law and so of general justice: it is therefore its own perfection as a virtue and a part of that complete virtue commanded by the law with a view to the common advantage (1130b8–16). Like general justice, however, particular justice is also distinguished from the other virtues in having its specific character defined by its orientation “toward another,” and the investigation of particular justice begins to illuminate the problematic consequence of this orientation for justice as a mean and a virtue."
"25","Whereas commentators who treat particular justice in the Nicomachean Ethics tend to focus on its technical terms—the proportional equalities of its two forms, commutative and distributive justice—Aristotle's own first order of business is to prove that particular justice is in fact like the other virtues in being a characteristic and a specific perfection.20 His very efforts in this direction suggest room for doubt, and his case in favor of this view begins to bring out the difficulties with particular justice. He argues that certain bad actions, even some that may appear to issue from a vice other than injustice, actually stem from the desire “to get the larger share” (1130a16–22). The coward may flee from danger, for example, a stingy person may begrudge a loan, or an immoderate human being may commit adultery. But none who act from these specific vices do so with a view to profit or gain strictly speaking; indeed, they may even suffer a loss as a result of their deeds (1130a24–28). By contrast, the one who is unjust in wanting more of the good things without consideration for others would do all these same deeds simply from the desire for gain. Particular justice is thus distinguished both from the other virtues and from complete justice as the perfection that pertains specifically to gain (1130a24–25, 32–33).            "
"26","As virtues that both “possess their power in being in relation to another,” general and particular justice are similar, but as the perfection pertaining to gain, particular justice consists more narrowly in the proper disposition toward the goods of another (1130a32–b5). The just human being in this sense will be disposed to take only his own fair or equal portion of the goods that human beings necessarily share as members of the same political community (1130b4). The crucial question for particular justice, then, is how to define the equality in accord with which one must choose, and it is in connection with this question that justice's difference from the other virtues begins to emerge."
"27","The formal definition of particular justice is offered in Aristotle's discussion of its two kinds: distributive and commutative justice. Aristotle presents a mathematical account of these equalities, each of which involves a minimum of four terms: the shares of the good to be allotted and the persons to whom these shares are to be assigned (1131a15–20). Distributive justice is concerned with equality in the distribution of the common goods understood as “honor, money, or any of the good things of which there is a part for those who share in the regime” (1130b30–32), and it employs a geometric proportion to measure all the terms of the equation because it assigns goods in accord with a principle with which “everyone” agrees, which is merit or desert (1131a25–26). Commutative justice pertains to contracts or transactions, “voluntary and involuntary,” and because it is blind to the differences with respect to merit, it employs an arithmetical proportion to restore the parties involved in an unjust transaction to the correct equality by compensating the plaintiff and imposing a penalty (or punishment, zêmia) on the wrongdoer (1131b32–1132a18).21"
"28","The crucial difference between justice and the other virtues emerges, then, as Aristotle links the assignment of the equal in particular justice with the definition of justice as a mean and virtue. For the just mean represents not our good condition with respect to two extremes, deficiency and excess, but the principle of equality established by law in relation to which the extremes—taking more and receiving less than this equality—are then defined (1131a10–15). Moreover, in its distributive form, this equality is the object of a dispute that points to the problematic significance first of distributive justice and finally of the regime in defining justice as a mean and a virtue (cf. 1130b30–32). For, as Aristotle acknowledges, there exist deep divisions concerning what constitutes desert or merit in the distribution of the common goods: “democrats say it is freedom; oligarchs, wealth; others, noble birth; aristocrats, virtue.” The “fights and accusations” that break out when there is a perceived inequality extend not only to the distribution of security, money, and honor (1131a22–29), but, as Aristotle will indicate in his discussion of reciprocity, to the defining distributive principle of the political community, the regime. As the distribution of ruling offices determined by the authoritative element of the city and by the end for the sake of which this element rules, the regime reflects the fundamental equality in accord with which one is just (Pol. 1278b10–15, 1279a25–b10).            "
"29","Aristotle leaves the full resolution of the dispute connected with ruling offices to his Politics (Pol. 1280a7ff.), but his discussion of reciprocity points to the necessary and problematic role of the regime in establishing justice as a mean and a virtue. As Aristotle's final step in clarifying the limits of justice in this regard, this discussion also begins to illuminate a tension within moral virtue between the two ends that demand our devotion as morally serious human beings: the common good, on the one hand, and our perfection in virtue as an end in itself, on the other.            "
"30","Aristotle's discussion of reciprocity presents itself largely as an analysis of the conditions for economic exchange necessary for the common life of individuals seeking the good. Yet this analysis also raises the more fundamental question concerning the foundation of political rule.22 While rejecting the “Pythagorean” view that simple reciprocity (or “retaliation,”antipeponthos)—suffering what one has done to another—is justice, Aristotle insists that a certain proportionate reciprocity is necessary if human beings are to come together in a political association (1132b21–34). There is the necessity of “exchange” in the case of both evils and goods, since if people cannot requite evil for evil, they are regarded as slaves, and without an exchange of goods, there is no community (1132b34–1133a2). Accordingly, reciprocity in the form of an original equality among individuals must exist if a community is to exist. Indeed, this equality, however it is ultimately elaborated, is the ground of law, since law is natural only among those “for whom there is equality in ruling and being ruled” (1134b14–15).            "
"31","Now, in the case of economic exchange, the natural standard by which goods are valued is “need,” and the “measure”—the term which represents need, makes the value of goods comparable, and acts as a “guarantee of future exchange”—is, by general agreement or convention, money (1133a19–31, 1133b10–12). By equalizing goods in this manner, money thus makes possible a relation of exchange that, as the ground of a common advantage and life, holds the community together as a community. But every political association must agree also upon the distribution of political goods, the most fundamental of which are ruling offices. The arrangement of these offices is determined by the distributive principle with which everyone agrees: to each in accord with merit. Not need but merit, then, establishes commensurability, and honor, not money, is the respective currency when it comes to the distribution of political offices (cf. Pol. 1278b8–17, 1279a22–32, 1280a7–21, 1281a28–39).            "
"32","In determining what or who is to be honored in the matter of ruling, however, we are thrown back on the dispute over what constitutes merit: freedom, wealth, noble birth, or virtue. With respect to the question of rule, the fights and accusations that break out concerning the distribution of shares are the most pressing issue for justice, and Aristotle points to this issue in the example he offers as evidence against the Pythagorean view that simple reciprocity is justice. For if, he observes, a ruler strikes one who is ruled, the ruler should not be struck in return; if the reverse were to happen, however, then the one who is ruled should not only be struck in return but “punished in addition” (1132b28–30).23 As this example pointedly recalls, justice must preserve rule and account for the compulsion and punishment necessary for ensuring the obedience to law. In acknowledging the necessity for such coercion, in fact, Aristotle draws our attention to his general reticence to speak of force and punishment throughout the account of justice. His mathematical treatment of distributive and commutative justice not only downplays the dispute over rule but also virtually ignores the role of anger and retribution in the punishment of harms (see Winthrop 1978, 1203–04; Ritchie 1894, 190). Even as he acknowledges the need for the “exchange of evil for evil” in his analysis of proportionate reciprocity, he focuses on the exchange of goods and thereby on the more voluntary pursuits that bring human beings together in community. Nevertheless, the role of reciprocity at the origin of the political community reminds us that justice involves an agreement or convention concerning the most fundamental question of rule, and even Aristotle's studied avoidance of the issue of force cannot fully cover over the partly compulsory character of this “agreement” and so of the defining principle of the political community, the regime, in accord with which justice is a mean and a virtue.            "
"33","Once he has clarified the origin of the political community in proportionate reciprocity, Aristotle acknowledges that justice is not a mean with respect to two vices. Rather, justice “belongs to a mean,” and the person whose “choice accords with the just” is one who “does not assign more of the choice‐worthy to himself and less to his neighbor, or the reverse of harm, but assigns equal shares in accord with proportion” (1134a1–6, my emphasis). As a characteristic and a part of general justice, therefore, particular justice disposes a person to abide by the mean established in law, and the law itself accords with the equality consistent with the common advantage of those who “share in the regime” (cf. 1130b30–32).            "
"34","In light of the conclusion that the just choice accords with the mean established in law and more fundamentally the regime, we are now in a position to consider the status of justice with respect to the other standard for choice pointed to by Aristotle. This standard was the good—in the best case, the possession and activity of virtue. In the best case, that is, it would seem that one ought to choose the things necessary for the perfection of one's character and the exercise of virtue. Yet the difficulty now appears that the requirements of the good in this sense would entail particular injustice. For the law must also meet another standard: it must care for the common advantage and accordingly require that we abide by the mean established by distributive and commutative justice for the sake of the common advantage. Aristotle's analysis of justice as a virtue has therefore raised the question of whether, even in the best case, the law can reconcile the two ends to which it demands our devotion as morally serious human beings: the common good, on the one hand, and our perfection in virtue as an end in itself, on the other.24"
"35","Aristotle proposed a preliminary answer to this difficult question in his discussion of particular justice as a characteristic: justice is the specific perfection that pertains to the desire for gain (see again 1130a16–32). To choose in accord with the just and the law, by this account, is to act in accord with the virtue with respect to gain. But in the course of providing evidence that there is a characteristic we identify with particular justice, Aristotle reminded us that there are other characteristics pertaining to gain. In the case of the good that human beings tend to love most, money, the obvious one is liberality (1130a16–19, 1120a15–18, 1121b15–16, 1122a13–16), and Aristotle has also identified courage and magnanimity as the respective virtues pertaining to security and honor, the other goods associated with particular justice. In light of these other virtues, then, how can it be said that justice constitutes the proper perfection pertaining to gain?"
"36","Aristotle suggests an answer to this question by making particular justice a part of complete justice: particular justice constitutes the proper mean pertaining to gain in relation to the common good. But this answer, we can now see, merely begs the question. For justice's status as a virtue is on the table precisely because the mean in the case of justice is established not by reference to our good condition regarding gain—not, that is, by the standard Aristotle pointed to in saying that one ought to take those of the good things that are necessary for the education to and exercise of virtue (1129b1–11). Rather, the mean in the case of justice is determined by the equality or proportion established by law concerning parties contending for the good things. If in its connection with the common good, particular justice is not a mean with respect to two vices, then by this very fact, it is also not like the other virtues in being an “extreme in accord with the best and that which is done well” (1107a6–8; cf. O'Connor 1991, 148–55). Just action accords with law and what is fair or equal, and not with the good judged by any other standard.            "
"37","We are confronted by the difficulty, then, that particular justice as a mean is necessarily defined by a standard other than the good condition of the individual with respect to moral virtue. For in determining the distribution of goods among equals, justice must guard the good of the community as a whole, and even in the best case—the regime in which merit is defined by virtue—not only are there competing claims of merit, but the goods human beings generally pursue, including those necessary for the education to and exercise of virtue, are limited and must be shared.25 Indeed, by definition, the “equal” as a measure for particular justice, and as the necessary ground of law, exists to adjudicate competing claims with regard to the good, and the very “nature of justice” is to be this principle of equality by which limited goods are distributed, and are not the property of one (1134a14–16, 1134a24–b2; cf. Ritchie 1894, 191–92; Winthrop 1978, 1205). It is for this reason also that justice can never be wholly separated from compulsion.            "
"38","The problem presented in the case of particular justice mirrors the problem for justice generally, since in being oriented toward the general advantage of the community, the virtues as complete justice must take their bearings from an end other than themselves. The difficulty for the virtuous individual is most striking in the situations in which the community's good and the activity of moral virtue are most at odds: for example, when the common good requires ignominious surrender rather than noble action in battle; when a generous or magnificent act would mean robbing from one to give to another; when the defense of the country calls for deception or fraud or even the betrayal of a friend; when justice demands punishments at which reason balks. In seeking to handle this difficulty, and to preserve the law's full moral authority and goodness, one might be tempted to redefine virtue solely in terms of the common good: if surrender is necessary for the preservation of the community, for example, then surrender is the truly courageous or noble act. Yet, Aristotle's own investigation of moral virtue indicates that this temptation should be resisted. For, in addition to his insistence that each virtue, such as courage, has its precise definition and is an end in its own right, he shows that the law itself looks to more than the requirements of the political community in defining our perfection and that the morally serious person understands this perfection not simply in terms of the common good, but in terms of his or her own nobility. Even in the case of a community as intimate and grounded in affection as the family, Aristotle suggests, should a base act be required for the “noble end” of its preservation, the act itself does not cease to be base, and the choice of a virtuous person in such a situation is therefore made under compulsion (1109b35–1110a19). Although the law and the good human being may bow to the necessity of actions that preserve the common good, then, neither would wish to redefine as virtue, for example, such deception, fraud, or betrayal that the common good may require, but moral virtue itself abhors."
"39","In sum, the deepest difficulty that Aristotle points to in his account of particular justice is the tension within moral virtue itself between its orientation toward the common good and its requirements and activity as an independent end. Accordingly, when he cautions early in his discussion of justice that the education of the citizen (the education “with a view to the community [koinon]”) may not be the same as the education of the good man (anēr) simply (1130b25–29), he is pointing in the first place not to a tension between civic or moral virtue and some other possibility, but to a tension within moral virtue (cf. Smith 2001, 60–62; Tessitore 1996, 39–42; Burnet 1900, 212). He thus clarifies the problem at the heart of civic education that the two ends that necessarily demand our devotion as morally serious human beings cannot be fully reconciled.26 In this way, Aristotle's account of the virtues in the Nicomachean Ethics both describes the political community's noblest pedagogic aims and, on the basis of this community's own standards, establishes its limits.            "
"40","Aristotle's insight into the tension within moral virtue raises the difficult question of the standard to which both the law and the morally virtuous human being look in determining right action (1103b31–34, 1138b18–34). For this insight has revealed that although the law and moral virtue seek to be authoritative with respect to human action, neither on its own terms can provide guidance concerning the correct hierarchy of ends for a human being (1145a6–11, 1152b1–2, see also 1137b34–1138a3). When Aristotle concludes the account of the particular moral virtues to turn to intellectual virtue, this question forms a new horizon in the Nicomachean Ethics (1138b13–14). His first indication of this transition is that he immediately returns to the subject of right reason he had earlier postponed (1138b18–20). The investigation of right reason, he suggests, is inseparable from a consideration of the target (scopos) at which the virtues aim and the boundary (or limit, horos) within which the mean is identified (1138b21–25, 32–34). In the absence of such a consideration, Aristotle acknowledges, the definition of virtue—as in accord with the mean defined by the prudent human being (phronimos)—is true but unclear.         "
"41","Despite the apparent urgency of this task, however, Aristotle does not approach it directly but undertakes a lengthy treatment of the characteristics of the rational or intellectual parts of the soul. While we might then expect his discussion of prudence—the rational characteristic that governs deliberation in the realm of action—to shed light on the question of right reason, this discussion proves to complicate rather than illuminate the matter. In short, we learn that prudence is required for perceiving the right thing to do in a particular situation. But in tackling the question of how prudence makes this perception, Aristotle concludes both that prudence requires moral virtue to set the end and that it completes moral virtue by bringing right reason to bear on the actions taken to achieve the end and on the end itself (1144a28–b1, 1145a2–6, 1144b14–25). He thus leaves unclear the most urgent matter: what right reason is and what the standard is by which the end is determined."
"42","Nevertheless, at the close of the discussion of intellectual virtue, Aristotle begins to lay the groundwork for clarifying this standard by redrawing the horizon within which it will be explored in his continuing investigation of the good in the Ethics. For he reiterates that moral virtue must finally be understood not in terms of itself, but in terms of its contribution to the proper target or end: the highest human good understood as the perfection of a human being. But now Aristotle no longer defines this target in terms of moral virtue, as he did in adopting the morally serious perspective in Book II; rather, he insists that the highest good necessarily includes, if it is not wholly constituted by, wisdom (sophia). He is even so bold as to claim that it is wisdom that constitutes the health of the soul and happiness and that has authority over moral virtue, which seeks to bring wisdom into being (1144a3–7, cf. 1137a9–17; 1145a6–9).         "
"43","Now, these are claims Aristotle must more fully elucidate and defend, but in order to do so, he will have to step outside of the horizon of the law and moral virtue. His account of the particular moral virtues has justified such a move first by acknowledging the authoritative status of the law and moral virtue, and then by showing that they nevertheless require guidance in establishing the hierarchy of ends for a human being. When Aristotle turns to Book VII of the Ethics, therefore, he explicitly begins anew, and this new beginning points to the “political philosopher,” as compared to the law, as the “architect of the end toward which we look in calling one particular thing bad and another good simply” (1145a15–15, 1152b1–3; cf. 1094a22–28 and 1141b23–27). In the investigation that follows, Aristotle expands the range of characteristics that pertain to action, and, against the dismissal of the life of pleasure as slavish in Book I, he investigates it as potentially the highest human good (Bk. VII); he also offers a lengthy treatment of friendship as the community, as compared to the polis, within which the good works most deserving of praise are done (Bks. VIII–IX); and he explicitly defends the view that the contemplative or theoretical life, and not the political or moral life, is the best one for a human being (Bk. X). This fuller account of the human good and the emergence of the theoretical life as best form the new horizon within which virtuous action must find its final end and definition.         "
"44","Against the authoritative claims of the political community, not to say its divine origins, Aristotle is thus able to suggest the necessity of political philosophy as a guide for good action and to posit the possibility of wisdom as our final end. At first glance, the need for such an effort, and its significance, may be opaque to a modern liberal audience that, Kant notwithstanding, professes to view politics and law with much less reverence. Yet the current doubt about the liberal state's neutrality with respect to moral education and the human good, as well as the efforts to restore an appreciation of civic education and virtue, suggests that we are not so free of authority or reverence as we may assume. Even or especially for us, Aristotle's account of the virtues is necessary in illuminating the authoritative place of moral virtue with respect to the human good and in clarifying the deepest problem of civic education. This problem is not, as the current debate suggests, the relation between the common good and individual flourishing, but the tension within moral virtue between its orientation toward the common good and its independence as an end in its own right. It is precisely out of a consideration of this problem, Aristotle also helps us to see, that the question of the human good, first answered by the political community's authoritative voice, reemerges as a matter of investigation, and that wisdom proves necessary to this good and potentially constitutive of it. From the point of view of the political community, then, the most fundamental difficulty connected with civic education is the potential tension between the end it authorizes as our complete perfection, justice, and the end Aristotle posits at the conclusion of Book VI, wisdom."
"45","In positing wisdom as our good, of course, Aristotle has not made the case for its claim; nor has he suggested that justice and wisdom are simply in tension with one another.27 The account of the virtues opens the door to these questions without resolving them. Indeed, Aristotle devotes two of the four remaining books of the Ethics to a discussion of friendship, a mere sketch of which shows that these questions remain fully in play. For friendship is a community that itself is so cherished a good that “no one would choose to live without friends, even if he had all the rest of the goods” (1155a5–6, my emphasis). At its best, moreover, friendship would seem not only conducive to the pursuit of wisdom but to promise a perfect common good or “justice in the fullest sense” that legislators seek to emulate in instilling a common vision of the good (homonoia) in citizens (1155a22–28). In such a community of friends, therefore, justice and wisdom would appear to be potentially coherent. On the other hand, in contrast to the political community, the primary question for friendship is not whether its end or activities are just—done with a view to another's good—but whether they are in accord with the true health and happiness of a human being.28 As such, friendship can be grounded in “self‐love,” the good human being will seek as his true friends only those who are truly good for him, and, in the end, Aristotle will not hold the “wise man's” essential self‐sufficiency—the fact that he is “able to contemplate even by himself”—against him, but, to the contrary, will count this self‐sufficiency as a mark of his superior virtue (1168b28–34, 1169a3–6, 1172a8–14, 1177a27–b1). Accordingly, while Aristotle's account of the virtues shows that civic education aims higher than his liberal students admit, it also prepares us to consider whether this education can hit as high as his communitarian students suggest.         "
"46","The final books of the Ethics thus grapple with the question that is most serious for Aristotle and that he suggests is at the heart of civic education and virtue: the question of the best way of life. The account of the virtues makes clear that a complete consideration of this question emerges only from a careful and open‐minded examination of the political community's highest and noblest pedagogic aims. In our own efforts to restore an understanding of civic education and virtue, then, we may be helped by Aristotle to see not only why the question of the best life is central to politics and political philosophy, but also why the full and fair examination of this question is necessarily bound up with an investigation of justice and wisdom.         "
