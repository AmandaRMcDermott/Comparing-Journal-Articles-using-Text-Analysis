"1","I analyze tobacco and alcoholic beverage PAC donations to sitting House members from 1975 to 2000. The PACs were identified by one or both of two methods. First, for every election cycle, I searched the FEC's PAC database utilizing names and terms that I knew to be common in each industry. By the second method, for every cycle from 1979 to 80, I searched for PACs in Public Disclosure Inc.'s FEC Info web site by examining the Census of Manufacturers' standard industrial classifications (SIC) that covered each industry.2 The 57 PACs used in the study are listed in Appendix A. Data for each PAC's contributions were collected from the FEC database, the Center for Responsive Politics web site, and Public Disclosure Inc.'s FEC Info web site.2 Each House member was then assigned a per Congress total for each individual industry.         "
"2","I use two dependent variables in my analysis. First, I use the inflation‐adjusted (or to be more precise CPI‐adjusted) raw contribution in 1999 dollars. This allows me to compare giving across Congresses. Second, because tobacco and alcoholic beverage PACs have greatly increased their giving over the 1975‐to‐2000 period, I also utilize the standardized raw cumulative industry donations to a member during a Congress. This was done by subtracting from each observation the mean industry contribution for a Congress and dividing by the standard deviation. The variable is designed to measure a member's receipts relative to those of current colleagues only. Because, with very few exceptions, the basic fundamental findings were identical, I report only the results of models with CPI‐adjusted contributions."
"3","Four independent variables test whether these contributions shift to reflect the apparent rise of CPG in the House. These measure legislator affiliation with important House institutions: the majority party, majority leadership, committee/subcommittee chairs, and members of standing committees with jurisdiction over tobacco and alcoholic beverage matters. In all four cases, membership in these institutions is coded ‘1’ and nonmembership ‘0.’"
"4","Identifying members of the House majority is simple enough. Defining the majority leadership is more difficult. I define the leadership as the speaker, the majority leader, the majority whip, the chair of the caucus/conference, the chair of the Rules Committee, and the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) or National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). The first four individuals are considered part of the leadership as a matter of convention, but the latter two are important components as well. The chair of Rules is appointed by the Speaker to occupy an important veto point in the legislative process, and the chair of the DCCC/NRCC is specifically charged with raising money for and distributing it to House majority party candidates."
"5","As for committee membership, I identify, for each electoral cycle, two standing committees that most influence legislation of interest to each of the industries. These committees were selected by examining formal jurisdictions and the committee referral of legislation concerning issues connected to the industry as revealed by the Congressional Quarterly Almanac. In all cases, except for tobacco in the post‐1989 period, it became readily apparent as to which two committees had the most impact upon an industry's interests—they were: for tobacco, Agriculture and Ways and Means and for alcoholic beverages, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce (called Interstate and Foreign Commerce in 1975–80 and Commerce in 1995–2000). I identify three committees for the analysis of tobacco contributions from 1989 to 2000—the additional committee is Energy and Commerce (called Commerce in 1995–2000).         "
"6","Given the considerable influence they have over internal committee proceedings, it is appropriate to create a variable that indicates the committee and subcommittee chairs important to the making of legislation of concern to tobacco and alcoholic beverage PACs. This variable codes the chairs of the committees I identify above, as well as the chair of the subcommittee charged by the full committee to deal with tobacco or alcoholic beverage issues.2"
"7","Remember that these PACs ought to invest in members who exercise veto power in the legislative process. Critical to CPG, of course, is that such veto points are not static. To capture the dynamism of veto points in the legislative process, I interact the majority, majority leadership, committee, and committee/subcommittee chair variables with a measure of CPG. CPG is measured here as the distance between party median first‐dimension DW‐NOMINATE scores for a Congress (Poole and Rosenthal 1997).2 The hypothesis is that CPG has a conditioning effect on contributions, as it increases tobacco and alcoholic beverage PACs should give relatively more to members of the majority and its leadership and relatively less to the leaders and members of the relevant committees.         "
"8","I also employ several control variables. We know that conservative lawmakers are darlings of tobacco (Stone 1996; Wilkerson and Carrell 1999). I therefore control for the preferences of a recipient by utilizing first‐dimension DW‐NOMINATE scores.2"
"9","Corporate PACs also give to legislators with constituencies in which they have a considerable financial presence (Hersch and McDougall 2000; Wright 1989). Here the contributions are largely a product of “the alliances, formal or informal, that PACs and their parents have with local groups, officeholders, and voters in concern over a local industry, a local crop or the more general local or regional economy” (Sorauf 1988, 104–5). Such geographical motivations for giving are controlled for using a measure that is the number of jobs connected to the industry that are within a member's district. These data are collected from Congressional Quarterly's books on congressional districts in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The data provide some measurement problems but are generally good indicators.2"
"10","I also use variables designed to measure the demand for tobacco and alcoholic beverage PAC money. I employ variables which indicate whether or not a member is retiring—retiring members can do little for PACs (and are coded ‘1’ in a 0‐1 dichotomy)2—and the size, in percentage points over the second‐placed candidate, of the member's victory in the last general election. Here, the larger the margin of victory, the less the demand for campaign contributions. In addition, I utilize a measure that is the log of the federal government's budget deficit in the Congress. The variable is used because, as I revealed in my description of post‐1975 tobacco and alcoholic beverages politics, large deficits have placed considerable pressure on Congress to increase excise taxes on the two industries' products. The thinking here is that this, in turn, persuaded affiliated corporate and trade PACs to increase their giving to federal legislators.         "
"11","Finally, I use variables to control for Republican majorities. Given that we know corporate and trade PACs generally give to Republicans (Grier and Munger 1993), elevated contributions to members of the majority and majority party leadership during the last three Congresses may not be fully explained by rising CPG. Instead, if we observe such a phenomenon it may vindicate an argument based upon the partisan predispositions of the two industries and the parties‐as‐cartels model of House organization. Tobacco and alcoholic beverage PACs, predisposed to support Republican policies, may give disproportionately more to Democrats when that party is in the majority but dramatically increase giving to the majority when they know Republicans are in control of veto‐wielding institutions. I therefore integrate into the models two interaction terms that are membership in the majority and majority leadership multiplied by a dummy coded ‘1’ when Republicans control the House.2 Summary statistics of all the variables are shown in Appendix B.         "
"12","The models of inflation‐adjusted contributions are run using Tobit to censor observations because there are a large number of members who receive nothing from tobacco or alcoholic beverages during an electoral cycle. The zero dollar observations are considered censored because tobacco and alcoholic beverage PACs would presumably prefer to take money from many of these members if they could (Sigelman and Zeng 2000). Still, using Tobit under such circumstances is not uncontroversial, so I ran the models using OLS regression as well.2 The basic findings are negligibly different, and I report only the Tobit results here.         "
"13","I show two models of alcoholic beverage PAC contributions. The first is of all Congresses, the second of just 1981–2000 (or the 97th to 106th Congresses). This is because, unlike tobacco, giving by alcoholic beverage PACs is discernibly different in the late‐1970s than it is in the 1980s and 1990s. During the 94th to 96th Congresses, alcoholic beverages gave very little money to very few members of the House. In Congresses from 1981 to 2000, at least 47% of the institution's membership received financial support from the industry.2 The model without the first three Congresses is therefore added because if the industries pursue the tactic of “buying off” committees first during the 1970s—as adherents of investor strategies under low CPG should—then the performances of the committee‐related interactions in the alcoholic beverage model of the entire 1975‐to‐2000 period are predisposed to confirm the basic hypothesis.         "
"14"," Table 1 reveals the results. Notice the generally robust performances consistent with hypotheses of legislator preferences, industry jobs, victory margin, and, at least in the case of tobacco, deficit variables. It is, of course, the variables that measure institutional memberships within the House in which we are particularly interested. In this regard, two things are especially noticeable.         "
"15","First, the tobacco model seems to vindicate CPG. The interactive effect of CPG on members of the majority party and leadership results in higher contributions, while the CPG‐committee chair variable is not statistically significant. It must be noted that contrary to a hypothesis inferred from CPG, the CPG‐committee interaction coefficient is positive and statistically significant. In the only real important substantive difference between analyses of the two dependent variables, however, this coefficient was not statistically significant in a regression model of standardized contributions from tobacco. The results of this model are shown in Appendix C.         "
"16","We can further illustrate differences between party and committee interactions in the tobacco model if we examine changes in predicted values for the dependent variable after manipulation of certain independent variables.2 Here, I compare predicted values for leaders, majority members, committee members, and chairs at the lowest value these individuals can have for the respective CPG interactions with those at the highest value. When I examine the leader‐CPG interaction, the leader main‐effect variable is held at ‘1,’ and the same is done for the main‐effects in the analyses of the three other institutions. All other variables are held at their means.         "
"17","Whereas values when manipulating committee variables start at roughly three times those of the majority (642 to 217), at the highest value of the interaction the difference is minimal (5,287 for committee, 5,231 for majority). Similarly, the predicted values in the manipulation of the leadership interaction rose from 2,167 to 13,505, for the chair interaction from 4,629 to just 6,942."
"18","That the tobacco model corroborates CPG is also revealed by the performance of the leader and majority interactions with Congresses of Republican control. The performances of these variables are very similar in an unreported specification which does not include the CPG and CPG interaction variables. Moreover, CPG stands up well in Table 2. It shows a model, without interactions, of tobacco contributions during the 103rd Congress—the last with Democratic majorities and one characterized by relatively high CPG. Again, the majority party and leadership coefficients are more robust than the committee and committee chair variables.         "
"19","Absent interaction terms, we can cleanly interpret the substantive meaning of the Tobit coefficients in the tobacco model of the 103rd Congress. This is done using a decomposition technique (Maddala 1983, 149–60; McDonald and Moffitt 1980).2 The procedure provides us with a tangible understanding of how much membership of the majority, leadership and committees was worth members who received tobacco money. Whereas majority status was worth $5,846, being a leader was worth $14,207 and being a member of a tobacco committee was worth $4,877 (remember these are CPI‐adjusted figures). This suggests that during high CPG tobacco was interested in contributing to a Democratic majority and its leadership.         "
"20","The second result of note from Table 1 is the difference in the performance of the tobacco and alcoholic beverage models. In the case of alcoholic beverages, several hypotheses inferred from CPG are not corroborated. The coefficients of the committee and chair interactions are positive and statistically significant and that of the majority‐CPG interaction is not.         "
"21","This begs the question: If tobacco and alcoholic beverage PACs pursue similar legislative goals, why have they altered their patterns of giving in such different ways? A possible answer consistent with CPG is that the issues have been subject to differing levels of salience. Advocates of CPG have admitted that party does not do a particularly good job of explaining congressional behavior on minor, uncontroversial, and low‐cost distributional issues that engender little publicity (Aldrich and Rohde 2000; Rohde 1994). Instead, such issues are characterized by logrolling in Congress and are not dealt with in party conferences or directly on the floor (Maltzman 1997). As Deering and Smith put it, “The less salient the issues, the more Congress relies on committees and the less it relies on parties… to make decisions” (1997, 5). If CPG can help explain differences in the patterns of giving by the two industries studied here, we ought to find alcoholic beverages have been a less conspicuous issue than tobacco.         "
"22","In an adaptation of Epstein and Segal's (2000) work, I present, in Figure 1, the number of days the tobacco and alcoholic beverage issues were on the front page of the New York Times by year from 1975 to 2000.2 The New York Times, as a national newspaper and one with a fairly consistent “sense of news” (Epstein and Segal 2000, 72; Mayhew 1991, 9), is a good indicator of what are the principal issues on the federal government's agenda. According to this widely used measure of salience at least, it is clear that the tobacco issue becomes dramatically more prominent in the 1990s while the coverage of the alcoholic beverage issue rises a little in the early 1980s—mainly over the push to increase the drinking age to 21—but then settles back to its earlier lower level.         "
"23"," Days Stories on Tobacco and Alcoholic Beverages Have Been on the New York Times Front Page, 1975–2000                      "
"24","If the cause of the difference between tobacco and alcoholic beverages is salience, then hypotheses inferred by CPG may not be corroborated by a specification of the tobacco model that includes only data from Congresses when tobacco was not a particularly striking issue. As Table 3 shows, this is indeed the case. Tobacco contribution patterns between the 94th and 102nd Congresses reveal the committee and chair interaction coefficients to be positive and statistically significant and the majority interaction not to be statistically significant. In this specification, as well as the alcoholic beverage models, it may be that CPG is behaving as a surrogate for time. As aggregate alcoholic beverage contributions have grown, for example, so recipients in institutions of importance to the industry have increased their share.         "
"25","Congressional scholars are engaged in a debate about what model best explains the contemporary House of Representatives. This article contributes to the discussion by testing CPG utilizing campaign contribution data. Specifically, I explained donation patterns from tobacco and alcoholic beverages because these industries have sought to block changes in public law during the 1975‐to‐2000 period and should have altered contribution habits to mirror changing institutional arrangements in the House. CPG suggests that throughout this time majority party—as opposed to committee—institutions have emerged as best placed to veto legislation. The model therefore presents us with the hypothesis that, as CPG has grown, so tobacco and alcoholic beverages should have given increasingly more to members of the majority party and its leadership and less to members of the relevant committees and theirs."
"26","I find CPG to be vindicated by the habits of both industries. Tobacco may prefer Republicans, but it has increasingly given to the majority, regardless of hue, as partisan differences and cohesiveness have grown. Alcoholic beverages reward committee institutions as CPG grows, but this seems to be a function of the fact that, in the 1990s, alcohol has not been as salient as the much‐publicized tobacco issue in the 1990s. Advocates of CPG and, indeed, members of PACs interested in low‐profile policy recognize that legislative vehicles for more mundane issues are still killed or propelled onto the floor by standing committees acting relatively autonomously (Aldrich and Rohde 2000; Maltzman 1997; Rohde 1994).
