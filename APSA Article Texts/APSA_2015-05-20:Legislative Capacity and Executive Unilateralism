"1","An executive order is a unilateral directive issued by the president to executive branch officials and agencies on how to implement the law. They are generally viewed by the courts as having the force of law, unless they clearly and explicitly violate the Constitution or an existing statute (Cooper 2002). They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as to respond to an economic or international crisis, to implement a law, or to create and implement policy initiatives.         "
"2","Presidents can use executive orders to significantly impact policy. The ability of the president to shape policy with executive orders comes through discretion derived specifically from some statutes or the interpretation of vague language in other statutes and the Constitution (Cooper 2002; Howell 2003; Mayer 2001). While presidents can base their authority to issue executive orders on either statutes or the Constitution, the majority appear to rely on specific statutes (Rudalevige 2012).         "
"3","The first recorded executive order was issued by President Lincoln in 1862. However, they were not frequently used until the beginning of the 20th century, as shown in Figure 1. The largest peak of order issuance occurred during the 1930s, reflecting a period of large government growth during the Great Depression. Their use has gradually decreased ever since, although with variation across time. Systematic records of executive orders were not maintained until 1905, the year in which the State Department requested that agencies submit all records of presidential orders to a newly created repository. All executive orders submitted by this year and subsequent orders issued were assigned numbers. On the other hand, those orders not submitted by 1905 are considered unnumbered. Following the passage of the Federal Register Act of 1935, executive orders have been published annually in the Federal Register. The CIS Index to Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders reports both numbered and unnumbered executive orders, though there is wide consensus that there is no substantive difference between the two (Mayer see 2001). Accordingly, we choose to report all executive orders, including numbered and unnumbered, in Figure 1 and in later empirical analyses.2"
"4","The empirical research devoted to explaining this variation in executive order use has focused primarily on presidencies in the modern era. As a result, little attention has been given to the historical uses of executive orders, even though their peak usage occurred prior to World War II. A central question in this research is whether the president uses executive orders to bypass a hostile Congress or if Congress instead constrains presidential use of this unilateral tool. These analyses, however, have yielded somewhat mixed results. Some studies find that divided government (Deering and Maltzman 1999; Mayer 1999, 2001; Mayer and Price 2002) or the seat share of the president's party in Congress (Krause and Cohen 1997, 2000) has an insignificant or inconsistent impact on the use of executive orders. Conversely, others find that divided government as well as the size and strength of the majority party in Congress are related to significant decreases in orders (Bailey and Rottinghaus 2014; Fine and Warber 2012; Howell 2003, 2005; Young 2013). Relatedly, some studies find that the president's legislative success significantly increases executive orders (Krause and Cohen 1997; Shull 2006; Young 2013), and others find the president's seat share in Congress significantly increases orders (Gleiber and Shull 1992). Finally, previous studies find that the president also issues more executive orders when his public approval is low (Mayer 1999, 2001; Shull 2006), when the executive branch is large (Krause and Cohen 1997), during his final month in office (Mayer 1999, 2001), during international crises (Young 2013), and on foreign policy issues (Marshall and Pacelle 2005). While these studies explore the impact of ideological and political factors in influencing executive order use, they do not examine the role of institutional capacity in conditioning these relationships. We explore this topic in the next section.         "
"5","As previously discussed, the key concern in the unilateral policymaking literature is whether the president is constrained by an ideologically opposed Congress. Though conventional wisdom and the media portray an unconstrained president, many studies actually find the opposite—that modern presidents issue fewer executive orders under divided government. Howell (2003) offers a formal model of the president's strategic use of executive orders as one explanation for this counterintuitive finding. In this model, following an executive order, Congress can pass legislation to alter or reverse it. Thus, presidents will decrease order use when faced with an ideologically opposed Congress more likely to retaliate. Additionally, the president is limited by how far he is permitted to move policy with an executive order by an exogenously determined discretion parameter, based on authority given to him by the Constitution and previous statutes. Thus, while the president can use executive orders to obtain more favorable outcomes, he is limited by the threat of being overturned by the courts if he exceeds his granted discretion.3"
"6","Building off Howell's (2003) theory, we also argue that presidential use of executive orders is dependent on both the ideological position of Congress and the discretion the president is given. However, we argue that this discretion is not exogenous, and it is not constant over time. Instead, we argue that changes in congressional capacity to constrain the president impact the level of discretion he is granted to move policy with executive orders.            "
"7","The following sections present our new theory of executive orders and legislative capacity. In the development of this theory, there are two questions that we seek to address. First, how do grants of discretion impact the president's use of unilateral tools? Second, how have institutional changes in Congress's ability to write low‐discretion laws and to conduct effective oversight affected patterns in presidential behavior?"
"8","We begin by laying out the assumptions underlying our theoretical argument. First, consistent with previous literature (e.g. Krehbiel 1998), we assume that both the president and Congress are primarily motivated by ideology when bargaining over policy outcomes and seek to move policy as close to their ideal policies as possible. Our second assumption is that presidents face nontrivial transaction costs when issuing an executive order, due to the often lengthy bargaining time with agencies when drafting orders (Rudalevige 2012). Third, we assume that the executive branch has an informational advantage over Congress regarding how policies result in outcomes, due to its expertise in often specialized areas.            "
"9","Fourth, we assume Congress will give more discretion to the president when the two actors are ideologically aligned (Epstein and O'Halloran 1999). While Congress would like to delegate to the more informed executive, it must consider the possible loss in utility from presidents who wish to implement a distant policy. Thus, when Congress faces an ideologically opposed president, it is less likely to delegate in order to minimize policy losses. Conversely, presidents aligned with Congress are more likely to implement favorable policies and will therefore receive greater discretion.            "
"10","Next, following Howell (2003), we assume that the president will not move policy further than what his granted discretion allows in order to avoid being overturned by the courts. Previous court cases have demonstrated the federal judiciary's ability to overturn executive orders that have exceeded statutory and constitutional limits (e.g., Youngstown v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)). As such, to avoid costly court challenges and possible policy loss, the president wishes to adhere to the limits of his discretion.            "
"11","Finally, consistent with Huber and Shipan (2002), we assume that Congress's ability to write legislation that constrains the president is limited by its capacity. In particular, when congressional capacity is low, the cost of writing a statute that considerably constrains the president is more difficult. For instance, if Congress lacks staffers who can research policies and draft long pieces of legislation, then it is not feasible for it to write constraining legislation, even when faced with an ideologically opposed president.            "
"12","Given these assumptions, we turn our attention to how changing capacity and discretion relate to unilateral politics. First, when Congress is low in capacity, it faces high costs to writing statutes that limit the executive, leaving much discretion to the president and the bureaucracy in implementing the policy. Even though ideologically distant congresses may want to write more constraining laws, it is not feasible given their capacity constraints. To maximize ideological gains, the president is likely to use executive orders to move policy closer to his preferred position. He stands to gain the most from moving policies passed by ideologically opposed congresses. Thus, in periods of low legislative capacity, the president issues more executive orders when Congress is ideologically distant."
"13","Conversely, during periods of high legislative capacity, it is less costly for Congress to write constraining legislation. Thus, it can limit the discretion it grants to ideologically opposed presidents and give greater discretion to aligned presidents. As before, the president issues an executive order when the ideological gains outweigh the costs of issuing the order. A president ideologically opposed to a high‐capacity Congress receives limited discretion and therefore refrains from issuing an executive order. Yet, when faced with an aligned Congress, he is given more discretion to move policy. Thus, we expect that during periods of high congressional capacity, the president issues more executive orders when Congress is ideologically allied."
"14","In the remainder of this section, we examine the development of Congress's capacity during the twentieth century. We argue that the Congress of the mid‐1940s looked very different than it did at the beginning of the twentieth century. A series of institutional changes in the first half of the twentieth century enhanced congressional access to policy information as well as the staff capacity of the institution."
"15","The end of the nineteenth century featured a massive growth in the size and complexity of the American administrative state. The number of federal employees boomed from just 50,000 in the 1870s to over 500,000 in the 1920s. The federal budget grew 10 times in the same period (Schick 1983). In addition to sheer size, the scope of the functions carried out by the federal government increased dramatically. The federal government embraced new responsibilities during this period, ranging from food inspection to conservation to the increased regulation of business.            "
"16","This growth in executive branch complexity, however, was not matched by commensurate growth in Congress. Congressional staff size and committee staff growth were negligible until the 1940s (see Figure 3). In 1914, the committee staffs of the Senate and House combined numbered only slightly more than 300. Today, there are over 3,000 committee staffers. The members' personal staffs were even smaller, and in some cases nonexistent. In 1914, there were only 72 Senate (noncommittee) staffers. In 2005, there were nearly 4,000 (Ornstein et al. 2014). Staff members, particularly committee staffers, play an important role in the drafting of statutes, development of policies, and congressional oversight of the executive (Aberbach 2001; Malbin 1980; Manley 1968).            "
"17","The ability of Congress to gather independent information about policy and truly constrain the executive was further hindered by the fact that prior to the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, Congress typically “borrowed” expert staff directly from the federal bureaucracy (Galloway 1955). We argue that this lack of resources, relative to the task of legislating for and overseeing a quickly growing executive branch, hampered the ability of Congress to write legislation that could seriously constrain the executive. As Schick (1983, 158) writes:               "
"18","Perhaps the most decisive factor in the loosening of legislative constraints was the growth of the national government and its administrative structure. … As the number of expense items grew, the individual line items receded in importance; as the number of administrative appointments increased, congressional involvement diminished; as international trade expanded, it became steadily more difficult to decide all tariff rates in laws; as the number of pensioners and their claims multiplied, Congress sought relief from pressure for special acts."
"19","Consistent with our theory, it appears that presidents, particularly at the turn of the twentieth century, recognized and took advantage of Congress's loosening grip on the increasingly complex administrative state. In particular, President Theodore Roosevelt's second term is cited by many as the beginning of a resurgent executive energy (Skowronek 1982). Roosevelt himself expressed his willingness to use unilateral actions to “get around” Congress, writing in his autobiography:               "
"20","The most important factor in getting the right spirit in my Administration … was my insistence upon the theory that the executive power was limited only by specific restrictions and prohibitions appearing in the Constitution or imposed by the Congress under its Constitutional powers …. Under this interpretation of executive power I did and caused to be done many things not previously done by President and the heads of the departments. I did not usurp power, but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power. (Roosevelt 1913, 197–98)                  "
"21","Thus, Roosevelt apparently saw opportunities for executive expansion in the paucity of detailed constraints from Congress. Many argue that he played an important role in institutionalizing the use of unilateral power, which continued for presidents through Franklin D. Roosevelt (see, e.g., Dodds 2013). Teddy Roosevelt's actions set a precedent for future presidents, as evidenced by the spike in executive orders following his presidency and continuing into the 1930s (see Figure 1).            "
"22","In sum, Congress, in the face of a large, complex, and expanding administrative state in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, was a low‐capacity legislative institution. It was unable to write low‐discretion laws that effectively constrained presidents and the federal bureaucracy. Presidents in this era viewed executive orders as an effective means of circumventing Congress. Although executive orders are costly, presidents during this time were able to offset these costs with high policy gains. Thus, in the early twentieth century, when congresses of all ideological stripes faced difficulties writing constraining legislation, we expect that the number of executive orders issued should increase as the ideological distance between Congress and the president increases—which is greatest under divided government. This leads to our first hypothesis:               "
"23","During periods of low legislative capacity (prior to the mid‐1940s), the president issues more executive orders under divided government."
"24","Though slow to start, Congress eventually began to adapt to the burgeoning American administrative state and developed institutions that allowed it to generate policy‐related information independent of the executive branch. This information, combined with the increasing staff capacity beginning in the mid‐1940s, made it much less costly for Congress to write constraining legislation and to more effectively oversee the executive branch.4 In particular, the creation of the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) and the Legislative Reference Service (known today as the Congressional Research Service), in addition to the passage of the Federal Register Act and the Administrative Procedures Act, gave Congress access to independent information that could be used in designing policies and statutes. This increased capacity fundamentally altered interbranch relations at the dawn of the “modern” era.            "
"25","Created by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, the original purpose of the General Accounting Office (GAO) was to monitor and audit agencies. In creating the GAO, Congress sought to move these responsibilities from a Cabinet department (Treasury) to a more independent agency insulated from presidential control.5 Central to Congress's motivation for creating the GAO was the need for independent information because it lacked the informational ability to control how agencies used their appropriated money (Trask 2011). Notably, the Bureau of the Budget, which increased the capacity of the presidential office, was created at the same time. We discuss the implications of this in greater detail in the empirical analysis. Additionally, the Congressional Research Service (CRS), first known as the Legislative Research Service beginning in 1946, was created to provide independent information to the legislature (Brudnick 2011). Since its creation, the CRS has served as an important source of information for members of Congress on a wide range of issues, and its studies have informed the formulation of myriad statutes.            "
"26","In addition to the creation of these institutions, two important pieces of legislation were passed that also contributed to the increase of Congress's capacity to constrain the executive. First, the Federal Register Act of 1935 required the Government Printing Office to publish all executive orders, proclamations, and agency rules. Prior to 1935, presidents were able to issue thousands of directives without the immediate knowledge of Congress, leaving the legislative branch unaware and ill equipped to deal with the growing administrative state and to react to presidential policymaking. The passage of this act informed Congress of the actions of the executive branch, allowing it to more effectively oversee and constrain executive policymaking (Howell 2005).            "
"27","Additionally, the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) of 1946 imposed serious constraints on the federal bureaucracy, most notably, by requiring formal notice and comment periods before many major administrative actions. Administrative procedures have the effect of slowing bureaucratic actions, giving Congress time to act in the case of significant interest group or constituent complaints about an agency action that might arise during the comment period (McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1987). Thus, in this way, comments serve as another source of congressional information, both about the proposed policy and constituent opinion.            "
"28","Finally, in order to utilize this information in a way that leads to the drafting of low‐discretion laws, Congress requires an ample staff. As previously discussed, staff sizes were relatively small through much of the first half of the twentieth century. Staff sizes did not begin to increase until the early to mid‐1940s (see Figure 3). Indeed, prior to the Legislative Reorganization Act (LRA) of 1946, only two committees had staffs that were considered to be “expert” and enjoyed low turnover (Dechert 1966). The act mandated that each committee should have up to four “professional” staff members, and it resulted in a near doubling of the number of committee staff between 1946 and 1950 (Galloway 1955). The legislation was a bipartisan effort to counter the enormous growth of the executive branch, particularly during the Great Depression and World War II (e.g., Schickler 2001). The committee reports for the LRA make clear that the legislation was an attempt to “modernize” Congress in the face of a burgeoning executive branch, noting:               "
"29","Congress has long lacked adequate facilities for the continuous inspection and review of administrative performance. We often delegate the rule‐making power …without making any provision for follow‐up to see if administrative rules and regulations are in accord with the intent of the law. (Special Committee on the Organization of Congress 1946)                  "
"30","In sum, we argue that throughout the first half of the twentieth century, Congress recognized its informational disadvantage and sought to lessen the legislative‐executive imbalance with regard to policy‐relevant information. Four institutions in particular—the CRS, the GAO, the Federal Register Act, and the APA—all contributed to the ability of Congress to generate information necessary to develop detailed policies and statutes that would constrain the executive branch. These new informational institutions, in combination with increasing staff sizes in the 1940s, helped Congress transform into a high‐capacity legislative institution. As a result, it could write legislation capable of effectively constraining the executive branch and overseeing its implementation of policy. These developments allowed Congress to constrain ideologically opposed presidents who rely on discretion for issuing executive orders. Thus, this leads to our second hypothesis:               "
"31","During periods of high legislative capacity (after the mid‐1940s), the president issues fewer executive orders under divided government."
"32","The key dependent variable in the analysis is the count of executive orders (both numbered and unnumbered) by year between 1905 and 2013, obtained from the CIS Index to Presidential Executive Orders & Proclamations. In order to isolate the policy‐related directives, we exclude the executive orders used for ceremonial purposes. Such examples include orders creating flags or seals. While some studies of executive orders devise coding schemes to isolate “significant” orders (Howell 2003; Mayer 2001), others examine only nonceremonial orders, finding similar empirical results (Krause and Cohen 1997). Following this research, we also focus on nonceremonial executive orders.               "
"33","Our main independent variable of interest is an indicator for divided government. Years are coded as being under divided government if the president and the majority party in either the Senate or House of Representatives are of different parties."
"34","We also control for a number of other factors that could influence executive order use over time."
"35","We include a control variable for instances of war, based on previous arguments that greater deference is given to the president on foreign policy issues or in times of war (Canes‐Wrone, Howell, and Lewis 2008; Cooper 2002; Howell, Jackman, and Rogowski 2013; Marshall and Pacelle 2005; Wildavsky 1966). Thus, controlling for this variable should account for increases in executive order use related to the war effort, particularly seen during World War I and World War II.6"
"36","Additionally, we control for beginning‐ and end‐of‐term effects, based on arguments that presidents issue more executive orders during these times (Mayer 2001). The “administration change” variable is coded as a binary indicator for whether the year marks the first year of a presidential administration following an outgoing administration of the opposing party. The “lame duck” year is coded as 1 in the final year of an outgoing president's term.               "
"37","We include a control variable for the inflation rate in a given year. In economically hard times, presidents may wish to bypass Congress to take quick action. Indeed, Presidents Nixon and Carter issued several high‐profile unilateral directives to address flagging economic conditions. Previous studies find that the president issues more executive orders during times of economic distress, particularly under high inflation (Krause and Cohen 1997, 2000).7"
"38","We also include a measure of federal spending as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). This variable is meant to control for the growth of the federal government over time. As the size and scope of the federal government grow larger, the president has more opportunities to use executive orders."
"39","Finally, we include a linear time trend in all of the models to account for any effects of time on the number of executive orders issued each year. Note that the results of the analysis do not change with the exclusion of this control variable.8"
"40","As an initial test of whether presidents' unilateral behavior has undergone changes based on developments in congressional capacity, we identify two different time periods based on our theoretical expectations: 1905–1944 and 1945–2013. Although the first recorded executive order was issued in 1862, we choose to begin our analysis in 1905. This date is appropriate for two reasons. First, as described above, executive orders were not systematically accounted for by the federal government until President Roosevelt mandated that they be cataloged by the State Department in 1905. Thus, we are most confident in obtaining accurate yearly counts of executive orders after this repository was created. Second, executive orders issued prior to the Roosevelt presidency tended to be more ceremonial and less substantively broad, frequently focused on alterations to the civil service. Dodds (2013) describes how the executive order became regularized as a policy tool during the Roosevelt administration, and his example in this regard was followed by subsequent presidents. Given that our theory is meant to explain the use of the executive order as a policy tool, we believe it is best to focus on periods in which it is understood as such and its use is institutionalized. For these reasons, we believe that 1905 is a suitable starting date for our analysis.            "
"41","As discussed above, we argue that the mid‐1940s should be associated with a shift in executive unilateral behavior given the changes in capacity that we identify. Therefore, we chose to break the time series at 1945 and conduct the analysis separately on the periods 1905–1944 and 1945–2013. The latter time period also corresponds to previous work on executive orders, which often takes 1945 as the starting point for the analysis (see, e.g., Howell 2003). Thus, our division at 1945 provides an important contrast to the results from the modern presidential era upon which most scholars of unilateral politics have focused. Note that none of the results that we report below are dependent upon the choice of 1945. In the supporting information, we offer the results of our analysis using a variety of other break years in the mid‐1940s, none of which change the substantive conclusions of this analysis. Furthermore, in our direct test of the capacity mechanism in Section “Testing the Mechanism”, we remove this break from the analysis, which should obviate concerns that our conclusions are based on this particular modeling choice.            "
"42","With these identified time periods, we present an analysis of executive order use in both of these periods using negative binomial regressions with president fixed effects. This analysis allows us to properly deal with the overdispersion of the dependent variable.9 Additionally, the inclusion of fixed effects allows us to control for any possible differences in executive order use by individual presidents, which previous studies have demonstrated can be significant (e.g., Krause and Cohen 2000). We report robust standard errors clustered by presidential administration.            "
"43","Table 1 shows the results of this analysis in each time period. We find strong support for our theory during the first period. Between 1905 and 1944, we find that divided government significantly increases executive orders. More specifically, a shift from unified to divided government during Period 1 is associated with a 55% increase in the number of executive orders issued in a given year. This effect is illustrated in Figure 2.10 As previously argued, the years prior to the mid‐1940s are characterized by low congressional capacity and thus associated with a time in which the president is able to bypass hostile congresses with executive orders.            "
"44","Effect of Divided Government on Executive Order Usage"
"45","Note: This figure graphs the percentage changes in executive orders moving from divided to unified government with 95% confidence intervals.                        "
"46","Differing from the first period, but consistent with our theory and previous studies (e.g., Howell 2003), we find that divided government significantly decreases the president's use of executive orders in the second period. Thus, between 1945 and 2013, a shift from unified to divided government is associated with a 10% decrease in the number of executive orders. In line with our theoretical expectations, this negative impact of divided government in the modern era reflects an increase in the capacity of Congress to constrain the executive through statutes and oversight. As previously discussed, this post‐WWII period ushered in an era of increased congressional resources.11"
"47","In an alternative specification, we pooled the entire time period and interacted the divided government variable with a dummy variable indicating whether the year was in Period 1 or Period 2. Those results are nearly identical to those presented in Table 1. Furthermore, this model confirms that the effect of divided government is significantly different in the two time periods (the p‐value of the interaction term is .01).            "
"48","Finally, war and lame duck years are associated with significant increases in executive orders, consistent with previous theories of executive lawmaking. Additionally, higher levels of inflation and government spending correspond to more frequent use of executive orders, but only in the modern era."
"49","In addition to the ideological alignment between the president and Congress, some scholars posit that the president is more likely to issue executive orders when Congress is less capable of passing legislation (Howell 2003). That is, when the threat of a congressional response to executive orders is diminished, particularly when Congress is ideologically fragmented, then the president can issue executive orders with less worry of subsequent retaliation. In order to examine this possibility, we include one of Howell's (2003) measures of fragmentation, the size of the majority party in Congress. In particular, we average the size of the majority party in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Using either chamber's majority size alone or both yields similar results.12"
"50","The results of this analysis are exhibited in Table 2. Notably, the effect of divided government remains significant and in the expected direction for each time period. Majority party size itself seems to have an insignificant impact in both periods. Overall, these results demonstrate that even when accounting for the internal fragmentation of Congress, the impact of divided government still significantly increases executive orders in Period 1 and decreases them in Period 2, providing further support for our theory.            "
"51","In the supporting information, we report the results of the analysis with a size‐unity ratio as an alternative to majority party size. Following Bailey and Rottinghaus (2014), this variable captures the strength and cohesion of the majority party in Congress. Similar to the legislative potential for policy change (LPPC) scores utilized by Howell (2003) to test the legislative fragmentation hypothesis, the size‐unity ratio is another variable used to measure Congress's ability to pass retaliatory legislation against the president. As Table 6 in the supporting information shows, this variable has an insignificant impact on the issuance of executive orders and does not substantively change the impact of divided government or the other control variables. Therefore, these results provide further support that Congress's ability to pass legislation does not change the impact of divided government across both time periods.            "
"52","In sum, this analysis of executive orders has revealed a significant amount of heterogeneity in presidential use of unilateral actions over time. While other studies have focused on the modern era and found that preference divergence between the president and Congress leads to a decrease in the number of executive orders, we find that the opposite relationship holds in the first half of the twentieth century. This suggests that the theories developed to explain modern uses of executive orders appear to be specific to that era and that there is significant variation in the role Congress plays in constraining presidential unilateral action over time. In the next section, we seek to demonstrate that this time dependence is indeed related to congressional capacity."
"53","While the previous analysis provides strong evidence for our theory, it still leaves the question of whether changes in the impact of divided government on executive order use by time period are actually conditioned by changes in legislative capacity as we suggest. To further test this mechanism, we directly examine the extent to which the effect of congressional‐presidential ideological divergence on executive order use is conditional on congressional resources.13 We argue that the growth of these resources contributed to Congress's ability to constrain executive discretion through legislation and oversight. We examine two measures of congressional resources—legislative expenditures and committee staff size.         "
"54","First, we use legislative expenditures as a measure of its resources. Growth in expenditures reflects an increase in the size and capacity of Congress and its development as an institution (Krause 2002). As seen in Figure 3, the changes in legislative expenditures over time correspond to the previously discussed changes in congressional capacity. In particular, expenditures were relatively stagnant before the mid‐1940s. Subsequently, there was a marked increase following the passage of the Legislative Reform Act, one of the key institutional reforms in increasing Congress's capacity during this time. We collected these data from the Statistical Abstracts of the United States for 1905–2013. All expenditure amounts are in 2009 dollars (billions).         "
"55","Congressional Staff and Legislative Expenditures over Time"
"56","Note: Both staff sizes and expenditures remain stagnant until the mid‐1940s, in line with our earlier discussion.                     "
"57","Source: Ornstein et al. (2014) and the Statistical Abstracts of the United States.                     "
"58","One potential criticism of the expenditure measure is that it includes some items that are not directly related to the legislative capacity of Congress, such as expenses for the U.S. Botanic Garden. Thus, in order to confirm the robustness of the results from the expenditures analysis, we also consider a specific dimension of capacity—the size of committee staffs. Committees are thought to be the repository of policy expertise in Congress (e.g., Krehbiel 1992; Malbin 1980). The responsibility of developing this expertise and translating it into policy and legislation falls largely on staffers. We argue that the growth in committee staffs over time allowed Congress to write statutes that constrained presidents in their use of executive orders. Furthermore, larger staffs allowed Congress to learn policy information and incorporate it into legislation and oversight. In order to test this mechanism, we collected data on congressional committee staff sizes from 1905 to 2009 (Ornstein et al. 2014). Unfortunately, these data are not available on a yearly basis for some parts of the sample, particularly prior to the 1970s. For years in which there is no data, we employ a linear interpolation, using data from adjacent years with recorded staff sizes.14 As with expenditures, staff sizes did not see large increases until after the passage of the LRA, as demonstrated in the left panel of Figure 3.15"
"59","With these data, we examine the extent to which the effect of ideological divergence is conditional on congressional capacity, as measured by legislative expenditures and staff size. As before, we use negative binomial regression models with presidential fixed effects. The key difference is that instead of breaking the data into time periods, we analyze the entire span of years in one pooled analysis to assess the extent to which the changes in legislative capacity condition the effect of divided government since that is our hypothesized mechanism for the differing results in each period. As such, the key variable of interest is the interaction between divided government and the natural logarithm of either legislative expenditures or the number of committee staffers. In addition to the previous control variables, we also include an indicator variable for the years after the passage of the LRA, which drastically increased staff resources."
"60","The results of the analyses with legislative expenditures are reported in Table 3. The interaction between expenditures and divided government is negative and significant, providing support for our theory. Figure 4 illustrates this interaction effect. When expenditures are small, divided government significantly increases executive orders. As previously argued, these are the times in which the president is less constrained by a congress unable to effectively limit executive discretion. Thus, when faced with legislative opponents, the president can unilaterally bypass them with executive orders. However, as the capacity of Congress increases, as measured by expenditures, the influence of divided government on executive orders is dampened and actually becomes negative and significant. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the president becomes less able to use these orders in the face of an unfriendly congress that has a greater capacity to constrain him.         "
"61","Effect of Divided Government at Different Levels of Legislative Expenditures"
"62","Note: This graph plots the difference in the predicted number of executive orders moving from unified government to divided government as legislative expenditures increase. The shaded area corresponds to 95% confidence intervals around the effect. As can be seen, at low levels of expenditures, presidents are predicted to issue significantly more orders during periods of divided government. This effect is reversed, however, as the level of expenditures increases, with the president predicted to issue fewer executive orders during years of divided government. The tick marks along the x‐axis correspond to observed levels of legislative expenditures in our data set.                     "
"63","These results also hold when using congressional staff size as a measure of capacity. Overall, this analysis provides support for the theory's argument that legislative resources have a significant impact on the relationship between ideological divergence and presidents' use of executive orders. As resources increase, Congress, through statutes, investigations, and other means, appears better able to constrain the unilateral actions of an ideologically opposed president. Further, these results also demonstrate that the support for our argument is not dependent on the individual years chosen as break points between periods, but is instead driven by changes in congressional capacity and thus provides further empirical support for the theory."
"64","In this article, we shed light on a central question in unilateral policymaking: Is the president constrained by Congress in his use of executive orders? The answer to this question has important implications for understanding the limits of executive power more generally. While the media portrays an unconstrained president issuing executive orders to bypass an ideologically hostile Congress, the political science literature yields the opposite finding in the modern era. To help resolve this fundamental question, this article offers an alternative mechanism to explain executive order use in both modern and premodern periods. We demonstrate that changes in legislative capacity to limit executive discretion over time have influenced the way presidents have used unilateral actions. In short, executive power can be constrained; however, it requires a legislature with not only the will but also the ability to do so."
"65","We find that divided government is associated with a decrease in the use of post‐WWII executive orders. However, we demonstrate that this finding is exclusive to the modern era, conditioned by the capacity of Congress. Consistent with our theory, yet counter to the findings and expectations of previous literature, we argue that between 1905 and 1944, Congress's capacity to constrain executive power was limited. Thus, presidents were able to use unilateral actions to bypass a hostile Congress. However, following massive growth in congressional capacity in the mid‐twentieth century, its ability to constrain the executive through statutes and oversight also grew. These developments fundamentally altered the nature of congressional‐executive politics during this period. With the growth of its capacity came the ability of Congress to constrain the president's use of executive orders through limitations in statutory discretion and oversight."
"66","Overall, this article deepens our current understanding of separation‐of‐powers politics as well as the historical development of executive‐legislative relations. We demonstrate how the use of presidential power has changed over time based on changes in legislative capacity. These findings suggest that existing theories of presidential power focused on the modern era may not necessarily apply to earlier time periods. Instead, they call for the reevaluation of this literature to account for the changing separation‐of‐powers dynamics over time. Indeed, a better understanding of historical patterns of congressional‐executive relations can not only illuminate historical periods but also deepen our understanding of politics as it is practiced today."
"67","The theory developed in this article could be extended to explain the exercise of executive branch powers beyond executive orders. Here, we have examined one of the president's most visible tools, executive orders, but these are by no means the only way presidents exercise unilateral power. Memoranda, proclamations, signing statements, national security directives, and regulations all serve as vehicles for presidents to potentially circumvent the legislative process. Currently, we know little about how presidents use all of these tools as a part of a unified unilateral strategy. To be sure, all have different purposes (e.g., proclamations are directed outside of the government, whereas executive orders and memoranda are directed at internal governmental actors) and vary to the degree they can be cataloged (e.g., national security directives and memoranda are not always published, making it difficult to know when presidents use them and when they do not). Nonetheless, the future of unilateral work may well focus on the complementarities of unilateral tools and the ways they combine with other presidential strategies for interacting with Congress and directing agencies."
"68","Further, given the rich variation in legislative capacity and gubernatorial powers across states as well as over time, future studies could also examine the implications of the theory on the subnational level. This theory could also apply to other separation‐of‐powers studies that might consider how institutional capacity is critical to understanding policymaking, beyond just the focus on ideological divisions."
"69","In sum, we demonstrate that policymaking is not solely dependent on the ideological relationships and conflicts between political actors. Instead, this relationship is conditional on the capacity of these actors to check one another. These concerns have animated debates in political philosophy and institutional design for centuries. In the United States, the framers of the Constitution deeply feared the aggrandizement of power in one branch or political actor and the potential abuses it could bring. Indeed, the separated system was designed to prevent the accumulation of power. As Madison writes in Federalist 51, “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition” (Rossiter et al. 1961, 322). However, at various times throughout U.S. history, this balance has been disrupted. This article suggests that ambition alone is not enough to ensure these protections. Rather, institutions must also have the capacity to carry out these checking functions. This point has significant implications not only for the development of politics at the federal level in the United States but potentially for other countries with separated systems as well.
