"1","The relationship between dissent and discretionary review in the judicial hierarchy has a long lineage in judicial politics (see, e.g., Tanenhaus et al. 1963; Perry 1991). Why are non‐unanimous cases more likely to be reviewed by higher courts? For one, dissents may indicate that a case is more controversial, important, or difficult. A dissent may also explicitly indicate that the majority made a decision contrary to precedent or a higher court's preferences.         "
"2","In evaluating the informational role of dissent at different levels of the judiciary, it is useful to distinguish between the core functions of the en banc process and the Supreme Court's certiorari process. Whereas the Supreme Court does not usually engage in error correction (focusing almost solely on law creation and rule modification), the en banc process is designed to function in large part as an error‐correction institution, in which errors may be understood as either technical mistakes, or failures to comply with the preferences of higher courts (George 1999). Thus, en banc review is more likely to focus on weeding out non‐compliance by three‐judge panels than the certiorari process (Oliphant 1991; Note 1989; Banks 1999).         "
"3","Formally, en banc review allows the full circuit to rehear a case after a three‐judge panel has decided it. Litigants may petition for en banc review; any judge on the circuit—including both those on the three‐judge panel and those not on the panel—may also suggest to his colleagues that they review a decision en banc. The active judges on the circuit then vote, by majority rule, on whether to take the case. Since whistleblowing is fundamentally about exposing non‐compliance, dissents that serve a whistleblowing function are more likely to be influential in en banc review, compared to Supreme Court review. Indeed, the weight of evidence suggests that judges on the Courts of Appeals strategically use dissents—in certain situations—to signal to full circuits that a panel majority's decision is worthy of review.2 Moreover, Kim (2008) and Kastellec (2011) find that the voting behavior of panels of the Courts of Appeals is conditioned by the panel's relationship to the full circuit.         "
"4","Accordingly, when thinking about the relationship between dissents and discretionary review, we can place dissents into two broad categories. We can think of one category of dissents as “whistleblowing dissents” that are intended by a judge to signal non‐compliance to a higher court (Cross and Tiller 1998). “Non‐whistleblowing dissents” are all other types of dissents, including “expressive” dissents in which a judge's goal is solely to voice disagreement with a decision by a panel majority. (We elaborate more on this distinction below.) Most studies of en banc review, however, have pooled all dissents together (see, e.g., George 1999; Clark 2009). While these studies have convincingly shown a substantial additive effect of dissent on en banc review, they do not allow this effect to differ across judges (or dispositions).         "
"5","Two exceptions are noteworthy. First, Giles, Walker, and Zorn (2006) find that while dissents increase the probability of en banc review, there is no additional effect of dissent in cases decided against the preferences of a circuit majority. Beim and Kastellec (2014), however, find that more conservative circuits are more likely to review liberal decisions with dissent than conservative decisions with dissent, while liberal circuits are more likely to review conservative decisions with dissent than liberal decisions with dissent. However, while both of these studies allow the effect of dissents to differ across dispositions (or case outcomes), neither allows the effect to differ across the ideology of the dissenting judge.         "
"6","In addition, among the many studies of discretionary review (including both en banc and certiorari on the Supreme Court), there has been little research connecting the review decision with the decision whether to reverse. This is surprising because the theoretical models explaining case selection necessarily have implications for the likelihood of reversal, conditional on review.3 For example, the seminal formal theory of certiorari developed in Cameron, Segal, and Songer (2000) predicts which cases should be reversed, yet only the model's predictions with respect to review are tested.         "
"7","In developing predictions about which types of whistleblowers might be most likely to trigger en banc review, this article relates to a large literature showing how biased information may be more useful than unbiased information (Calvert 1985). Given preference divergence between two actors in a signaling framework, a signal that is biased against a sender's preferences will have more credibility than one that is biased toward them. Thus, in some instances, actors who must infer the meaning of signals under conditions of imperfect information may prefer to have biased senders. For exposition, we call signals sent by biased actors “counter‐preference signals”—those that run counter to one's preferences.            "
"8","The logic of this argument is nicely illustrated in a recent study of the influence of newspaper endorsements by Chiang and Knight (2011). They find that the interaction between the predisposition of a newspaper and the ideological direction of an endorsement determines how strongly that endorsement will influence vote choice among readers. If a left‐leaning paper endorses a Republican candidate, Democratic voters are more likely vote for that candidate, and vice versa.            "
"9","Similarly, the value of biased information has been demonstrated in research on discretionary review in the judicial hierarchy. In the formal theory presented in Cameron, Segal, and Songer (2000), a higher court that is uncertain about the compliance of a lower court can infer that the lower court complied if the decision is biased against the lower court, given the relative preferences of the two courts. Cameron et al. call this the Nixon goes to China result—“if a cold warrior like Nixon goes to China it must be time for a change in American policy.” The logic of this result has been extended to the study of en banc review by Giles, Walker, and Zorn (2006) and Clark (2009). Both articles find that full circuits are most likely to review decisions by ideologically distant panels that likely do not conform with the preferences of the full circuit—that is, decisions that do not run counter to the relative preference of the three‐judge panel. No study, however, has examined how counter‐preference signals from dissenters (or potential dissenters) may also provide information to a full circuit deciding whether to review a case. Are certain dissenters more credible messengers of non‐compliance than others? If so, why?            "
"10","To generate theoretical predictions about signals and counter‐preference signals in the judicial hierarchy, we use the whistleblower theory developed in Beim, Hirsch, and Kastellec (2014). The theory models dissent as motivated by the desire of a lower court judge to blow the whistle on her colleagues about non‐compliance with a higher court's preferences in order to trigger review and reversal. Other plausible motives for dissent are outside the model, although we account for some of these in the empirical analysis.         "
"11","In the theory, a lower court hears a case in the shadow of potential review and reversal by a higher court. The judge whose preferences are most aligned with the higher court can be thought of as a potential whistleblower, in that she can choose to report non‐compliance by her colleagues through a whistleblowing dissent, which can potentially trigger a review and reversal. Alternatively, she can choose not to dissent, creating a unanimous decision. For ease of presentation, we henceforth refer to the potential whistleblower as simply the whistleblower, with the understanding that this label describes her potential to act as a whistleblower, but not always her actual behavior. This distinction is important because both the presence and absence of a dissent by the whistleblower are informative to the higher court.         "
"12","In our empirical application, we treat the median of the three‐judge panel as the lower court majority, and the median of the full circuit as the higher court. Accordingly, we refer to the lower court as the panel (or panel majority), and the higher court as the full circuit (or simply circuit) from this point forward."
"13","In the theory, cases exist on a continuum according to the facts of the case (e.g., the intensity of a search in a Fourth Amendment case). For a given case, the panel makes a binary decision that the case should receive the “liberal” or “conservative” outcome. Initially, these case facts are known only to the panel judges, but the full circuit can make inferences about them based on the panel judges' actions. After making these inferences, the circuit can then choose to review the panel's decision (at some cost), at which point it learns the true facts of the case, and can reverse or affirm the decision. If the circuit reverses the panel, then the judges in the panel majority suffer a sanctioning cost."
"14","Each judge's preferences over dispositions given a set of case facts are modeled as an indifference point, which can fall anywhere on the continuum of case facts. A judge prefers that cases to the right of his indifference point be decided liberally, and cases to the left of his indifference point be decided conservatively. Importantly, judges care more about the disposition of some cases than others; the further a case falls from a judge's indifference point, the more intensely he cares about getting the “correct” outcome. Thus, the circuit will care more about “severe” non‐compliance—the panel ruling liberally in cases that are far to the left of the circuit's indifference point—than less‐severe non‐compliance.         "
"15","Figure 1 depicts preferences and actions in the theory when the panel is more liberal than the circuit (we maintain this assumption throughout the presentation of the theory, although our empirical analysis accounts for all possible configurations of judges). The indifference points of the panel and the circuit are depicted with solid circles (we discuss the location of the whistleblower below). Given these preferences, there exists a “conflict region” between the panel and the full circuit. In cases in this region, the panel prefers to rule liberally, but the circuit would instead prefer a conservative ruling. The panel must decide whether or not to issue a non‐compliant liberal ruling in the shadow of a potential threat by the whistleblower to dissent, and the review and reversal that dissent may trigger.         "
"16","Summary of Theory"
"17","See text for details."
"18","In the equilibrium of the model, the behavior of the panel majority is governed by a cutpoint, depicted with a solid vertical line in in Figure 1. It chooses the conservative ruling when the case facts fall below this cutpoint (Region 1), and chooses the liberal ruling when the case facts fall above it (Regions 2–4). In the theory, the full circuit always agrees with the disposition when the panel rules conservatively because the panel is more liberal than the circuit. A conservative decision by the panel is thus a perfect signal of compliance, and we therefore label it as non‐suspicious. In the theory, non‐suspicious decisions are never reviewed, nor reversed. In addition, because the whistleblower in the theory is assumed to be solely motivated by her desire to trigger reversal, she also never makes a costly and fruitless dissent from such rulings.         "
"19","In contrast, a liberal decision may or may not be compliant. Sometimes the case facts are in the conflict region, and the panel prefers the liberal disposition when the circuit does not (Regions 2–3). Other times, both courts prefer a liberal decision (Region 4). Since the circuit cannot observe case facts without reviewing, from its perspective compliant liberal rulings are pooled with non‐compliant ones. We therefore term such rulings suspicious, because upon observing them the circuit is uncertain about whether non‐compliance occurred.         "
"20","This uncertainty presents an opportunity for the whistleblower to provide additional information through a dissent. Like the panel majority, the whistleblower's behavior is governed by a cutpoint, which describes when she dissents from a suspicious liberal ruling by her colleagues. Figure 1 depicts the behavior of a whistleblower who is more conservative than the panel majority (the whistleblower can be either less or more conservative than the circuit). Such a whistleblower will pay the cost of dissent only if both non‐compliance occurred (since there is no point in triggering a review of a compliant ruling), and the case facts are sufficiently far from her indifference point to make the chance of triggering reversal worthwhile (Region 2). Consequently, when the circuit observes a whistleblowing dissent, it is certain that non‐compliance occurred, but uncertain about exactly how severe that non‐compliance was. It will therefore only sometimes review the case (if it is worth the time), but always reverse upon review. Crucially for our empirical tests, how likely the circuit is to review after a whistleblowing dissent depends on the credibility of the judge issuing it. As we detail below, some whistleblowers will be more credible messengers of severe non‐compliance than others, and therefore, be more effective at triggering review and reversal.         "
"21","Finally, there are some non‐compliant decisions in which the whistleblower disagrees with the panel majority, but does not find it worthwhile to dissent (Region 3). In such instances, the probability that the full circuit will review is lower compared to when there is a dissent—and the full circuit will only reverse if it discovers that non‐compliance actually occurred."
"22","Having summarized the model, we can now generate theoretical predictions about en banc review and reversal. In the model, the full circuit would only like to expend the cost of review on cases in which non‐compliance is particularly severe, because its time is valuable. Imagine, at the extreme, that the whistleblower were to always dissent whenever the panel ruled against the preferences of the circuit. Then the circuit would have no way of discerning the severity of non‐compliance across different cases—dissents would not be informative as to severity (though they still would be informative of non‐compliance). Conversely, a whistleblower who only dissents from the most severe instances of non‐compliance provides a much stronger signal that review is warranted. Thus, dissents signal severe non‐compliance most convincingly, and are most effective at triggering review, when they are rare.            "
"23","Which types of judges are likely to dissent the most, thereby diminishing the impact of their dissents? A whistleblower's incentive to dissent is driven by her desire to see decisions with which she disagrees overturned because this incentive comes mainly from her preferences over case outcomes. As a result, whistleblowers who are farthest ideologically from the panel majority (i.e., the panel median) will have the most incentive to dissent “too often,” and will be least effective at triggering review. On the other hand, whistleblowers who are closer to the panel majority (i.e., those who have cutpoints more to the left) who nevertheless choose to dissent will be much more credible messengers of severe non‐compliance.            "
"24","To see the intuition for this effect, suppose that a very conservative judge dissents from a liberal ruling by a liberal panel, as depicted in Case 1 in Figure 2A. While the circuit can be sure that the panel median indeed made a non‐compliant decision, the circuit does not know whether the non‐compliance was egregious or minor. This is because the conservative whistleblower has an incentive to dissent from a liberal decision whenever the case facts lie anywhere in the shaded interval, which covers the entire conflict region.4 Thus, while the circuit can be sure upon observing a dissent that non‐compliance occurred, it cannot know whether that non‐compliance was egregious or minor.            "
"25","Illustrating the Logic of the Review Predictions"
"26","See text for details."
"27","In contrast, suppose the dissenting judge was instead moderately liberal, as depicted in Case 2 in Figure 2A. Being generally friendly to liberal dispositions, such a judge is only willing to dissent in the smaller shaded region, which contains only the most severe instances of non‐compliance. Consequently, the moderate judge's dissent is a much stronger signal of severe non‐compliance, and will be more effective at triggering review, compared to a dissent by a very conservative judge. Intuitively, if even a moderately liberal judge dissents from a liberal ruling, a conservative circuit will likely want to review it. We call such dissents “counter‐preference signals.”            "
"28","The same intuition generates a less obvious prediction about unanimous cases—a whistleblower's silence can be as informative as her dissent. Consider a conservative circuit deciding whether to review a unanimous liberal decision. As the whistleblower moves away from the panel majority and toward the full circuit, the absence of dissent becomes a stronger signal that the circuit would agree with the liberal decision, which decreases the probability of review. Intuitively, if even a conservative judge agrees with a liberal ruling, a conservative circuit will likely not want to review it. As a result, the preferences of whistleblowers affect the likelihood of review, even when no whistle is observed. This leads to:               "
"29","Figure 3A depicts this argument graphically; it shows the theoretical predicted probabilities of review of cases both with and without dissent as a function of the whistleblower's location (relative to the panel majority). Both functions are highest when the whistleblower is an ideological doppelgänger of the panel majority, and then weakly decrease as the whistleblower moves in the direction of the circuit median.            "
"30","Graphical Presentation of the Review and Reversal Hypotheses"
"31","See text for details."
"32","Next, consider the full circuit's decision of whether to reverse a decision, conditional on having granted review. Figure 3C depicts the probability of reversal, conditional on review, in cases with and without dissent, as the location of the whistleblower varies. Because the whistleblower only dissents in instances of non‐compliance (though possibly very minor ones), if the full circuit reviews a case with a dissent the model predicts that it will always reverse. Conversely, in unanimous cases the full circuit will sometimes discover upon review that the liberal disposition was actually compliant. As the whistleblower moves farther away from the panel, this scenario becomes more likely; thus, the probability of reversing a reviewed unanimous decision decreases. This leads to:               "
"33","While the location of the whistleblower is important for understanding discretionary review and reversal, the ideological distance between the full circuit and the panel majority is also crucial. Indeed, this principal‐agent relationship has been the focus of most studies of interactions between higher and lower courts (Cameron, Segal, and Songer 2000; Clark 2009; Giles, Walker, and Zorn 2006). In our theory, a whistleblowing dissent is most effective in generating review when the panel majority is far from the full circuit (see Case 1 in Figure 2B—we do not depict the whistleblower because the key condition is the presence of a dissent). Under these conditions, the panel majority makes many liberal decisions, and the ones from which the whistleblower dissents are more likely to be severely non‐compliant relative to unanimous liberal decisions. Consequently, the circuit is much more likely to review decisions with dissents, and the marginal effect of dissent is large. In contrast, when the panel is near the circuit (see Case 2 in Figure 2B), the disagreement region is small. Most of the panel's decisions are compliant, and when they are not, the degree of non‐compliance is minor. Consequently, the full circuit is less responsive to dissent. This leads to:               "
"34","The effect is illustrated in Figure 3B. The vertical axis again depicts the probability of review, while the horizontal axis depicts the location of the panel median, moving left‐to‐right from farther from the full circuit to closer to it. A similar logic also applies when considering the effect of the location of the panel median (relative to the full circuit) on the probability of reversal in unanimous cases, which leads to:               "
"35","Finally, the theory makes predictions about the relative likelihood of both review and reversal of suspicious rulings with and without a dissent. Beginning first with the former, for any fixed distance between the panel median and the whistleblower, or between the panel and circuit medians, the probability of review following a dissent is always higher than the probability of review following a unanimous decision. This is because in the theory, dissent always signals more severe non‐compliance, while unanimous (suspicious) decisions signal less severe non‐compliance or compliance. This leads to:               "
"36","As noted above, when the full circuit reviews a case with a whistleblowing dissent, the theory predicts that the probability of reversal is 1, since whistleblowers only dissent from non‐compliant decisions. This prediction is surely too strong, given that both dissents and en banc review occur for reasons outside the model. But, as both Figures 3C and 3D show, the likelihood of reversal is always higher in cases with whistleblowing dissents than in unanimous cases. This leads to:               "
"37","Table 1 collects and summarizes all the hypotheses.            "
"38"," To test these predictions, we use both existing and original data on cases heard on the Courts of Appeals. Complete details of our data collection can be found in the Supplemental Appendix; we provide a brief summary here. Testing the theory requires a sample of cases with a sufficient number of en banc reviews to conduct meaningful statistical analysis. We follow the lead of other studies and employ a choice‐based approach in which we oversample cases reheard en banc (Giles, Walker, and Zorn 2006; Clark 2009; Beim and Kastellec 2014). Specifically, our dataset includes a stratified random sample of Courts of Appeals cases decided between 1986 and 2002 that were not reheard en banc, as well as the universe of three‐judge panel decisions in this period that were reheard en banc.               "
"39","After removing cases with missing observations, our dataset contains 5,589 panel decisions (distributed roughly evenly across all 12 circuits), 792 of which were granted en banc review. Note that combining a random sample with a universe of cases requires each observation to be weighted accordingly; the details of the weighting procedures are also described in the Supplemental Appendix. The overall rate of en banc review is about 1%, meaning only about 1 out of every 100 (published) Courts of Appeals decisions is reviewed en banc.               "
"40","Of the 792 cases granted review, the full circuit reached their own decision in 772 cases (in the remaining cases, en banc review was terminated before the circuit reached a decision). For these 772 cases, we coded whether the full circuit reversed the panel or not—see the Supplemental Appendix for details on how we coded reversals. Because this set of cases comprises the universe of en banc decisions in this period, we do not need to employ weights for the analysis of reversal decisions. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset comprises the largest number of en banc cases—both in terms of the review decision and the reversal decision—to be subject to a case‐level analysis of review.5"
"41"," To code case dispositions, we rely on the coding protocol in Songer (1999) and code each panel decision as liberal or conservative. If the decision was accompanied by a dissent, we record which judge dissented. For judicial preferences, we rely on the approach of Giles, Hettinger, and Peppers (2001). The GHP scores, higher values of which indicate that a judge is more conservative, are based on the Common Space score of a judge's appointing president and/or home state senators.               "
"42","Testing the theory requires estimates of the preferences of the full circuit, the panel, and the whistleblower. We define the full circuit's indifference point by using the GHP score of the median active judge on the circuit at the time a case was heard (we call this variable “circuit median”). Similarly, we define the panel majority as the panel median: the median GHP score of the three judges on the panel. To measure the preferences of the whistleblower, we use the following procedure. If the panel median is more liberal than the circuit median, define the whistleblower as the most conservative judge on the panel. If the panel median is more conservative than the circuit median, define the whistleblower as the most liberal judge on the panel. The whistleblower is thus the panel judge most ideologically biased against the disposition favored by the panel majority, relative to the full circuit. Importantly, this operationalization depends on the exogenous preferences of the relevant actors and their relative configuration, rather than the endogenous votes that they cast.6 So, as in the theory, the judge we identify as the whistleblower may or may not actually dissent.               "
"43","With these measures in hand, we can define the relevant distance measures in the theory. First, Panel‐circuit distance is the absolute value of the distance between the panel median and the circuit median. Second, given our operationalization of the preferences of the whistleblower, panel‐whistleblower distance is simply the absolute value of the distance between the panel and the whistleblower.7"
"44","Next, the theory makes predictions about the circuit's review and reversal behavior as a function of whether the panel made a suspicious decision, and whether the whistleblower dissented.8 We define a suspicious decision as one in which the full circuit cannot be sure if the panel's decision is compliant. Specifically, define a decision as suspicious if either a panel that is more liberal than the circuit makes a liberal decision, or a panel that is more conservative than the circuit makes a conservative decision.9 Next, we define a whistleblower dissent as a dissent by the judge who we have defined as the whistleblower.10"
"45"," The theory solely models what we have called whistleblowing dissents —dissents by a whistleblower that are intended to signal non‐compliance and trigger review and reversal. Accordingly, such dissents occur only from suspicious decisions. This scenario is depicted in Figure 4A. Let W denote the judge we identify as the whistleblower, and J1 and J2 the remaining two judges on the panel, with J2 being the median of the panel. In the example, all three judges are more liberal than the circuit.11 In Figure 4A, the two most‐liberal judges vote liberally, thereby creating a suspicious decision, from which W dissents.               "
"46","Illustrations of Dissents Both Consistent and Inconsistent With the Theory"
"47","See text for details."
"48","In reality, however, judges dissent for many reasons, and connecting theory to data requires accounting for such behavior that is outside the theory yet present in the data. This includes dissents from non‐suspicious decisions, which never occur in the theory (since a non‐suspicious decision is a perfect signal of compliance). For example, in Figure 4B, the judge we identify as the whistleblower joins the median in deciding the case conservatively, thereby creating a non‐suspicious decision. The most liberal judge casts a liberal dissent, perhaps to assert her sincere opposition. In Figure 4C, the most liberal and most conservative judges on the panel join to cast a suspicious liberal decision. The panel median dissents, perhaps on technical grounds, even though based on ideology alone she should prefer a liberal decision whenever her more conservative colleague does.12 Finally, in Figure 4D the whistleblower dissents from a non‐suspicious decision; in theory, she should both agree with such a disposition, and expect that her dissent will not trigger a review anyway. We employ flexible model specifications that allow us to distinguish among these different scenarios. In doing so, we can validate our empirical results by demonstrating that the effects of preferences are only present in circumstances in which the theory predicts that such effects should occur.               "
"49","We begin by testing the review predictions, and then turn to evaluating the reversal predictions. The first three models in Table 2 present weighted logit models of en banc review, where the dependent variable is coded 1 if a circuit voted to rehear a case en banc, and 0 otherwise. (Models 4–6 are models of reversal—we return to them below.) Each model contains our core specification, as follows. The theory predicts that a) the preferences and behavior of the whistleblower will influence the probability of review, but only on suspicious decisions; and b) these effects will be conditioned by the distance between the panel median and the circuit median. Accordingly, for our main empirical test, we include the following predictors: whistleblower dissent, suspicious decision, panel‐whistleblower distance, and panel‐circuit distance. To test our hypotheses, we include the three‐way interactions between: a) whistleblower dissent, suspicious decisions, and panel‐whistleblower distance; and b) whistleblower dissent, suspicious decisions, and panel‐circuit distance. We also include all the two‐way interactions among the respective three‐way interactions as their own constituent terms in the model.13 Model 1 includes only these predictors.         "
"50","As noted above, dissent and en banc review also occur for reasons outside the theory. Thus, in Model 2, we include several additional predictors. First, we define an additional variable non‐whistleblower dissent as a dissent by a judge who we did not identify as the whistleblower. We allow this variable to enter the model as a main effect; to the extent that dissents by judges other than the whistleblower may boost the likelihood of review, this variable accounts for that. Next, whether the three‐judge panel reversed the district court decision (or agency decision) has also been shown to be a strong predictor of en banc review (George 1999); to account for this, we include the variable panel reversed lower court. Finally, as a robustness check, Model 3 adds fixed effects for circuits and years to account for any heterogeneity across time or space, or both. We also include fixed effects for issue areas—following Clark (2009), we classify each case into one of four categories: civil rights, criminal procedure, economic issues, and miscellaneous.         "
"51","Due to the number of interaction terms in a non‐linear model, the coefficients on the key predictors are not readily interpretable. We thus move to examining substantive quantities of interest to test the theoretical predictions. Looking across models, we see that the coefficients and standard errors are very similar. The AIC measures, which assess model fit while accounting for the number of covariates, suggest that Models 1 and 2 are superior to 3. We use the results from Model 2 going forward. To present the results of the model, we calculate “average predicted probabilities” using the observed values in our data (Gelman and Pardoe 2007; Hanmer and Kalkan 2013). In addition, we use simulations of the coefficients from the model (based on variances and covariances) to compute 95% confidence intervals on all of our quantities of interest.14"
"52","We begin our analysis of review decisions by evaluating the counter‐preference signaling predictions, which are that the probability of review of suspicious decisions, in both cases with whistleblower dissents and in unanimous cases, decreases as the whistleblower moves farther away from the panel median. Figure 5A presents the test of the Counter‐preference Signaling Review Hypothesis. The vertical axis depicts the probability of review, while the horizontal axis depicts the distance between the panel median and the whistleblower. (One can think about this by assuming the panel is less conservative than the circuit: The whistleblower “slides” away from the panel and toward the circuit as it moves to the right.) The shaded region around the line shows the 95% confidence interval.               "
"53","Predicted Probabilities of En Banc Review                           "
"54","A) How the probability of review changes as the distance between the panel median and whistleblower increases, in suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents and in unanimous suspicious decisions B) How the probability of review changes as the distance between the panel median and circuit median decreases, in suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents and in unanimous suspicious decisions. C) How the probability of review changes as the distance between the panel median and whistleblower increases, in non‐suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents. D) How the probability of review changes as the distance between the panel median and circuit median decreases, in non‐suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents."
"55","Beginning with suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents (the solid line in Figure 5A), the results clearly support the Counter‐preference Signaling Review Hypothesis. The largest probability of review occurs when the whistleblower is closest to the panel median, and declines as the whistleblower moves farther away. The effect is substantively large. The predicted probability of review when the ideology of the whistleblower equals that of the panel majority is .17 (95% confidence interval of [.10, .26]), a strikingly high rate given the rarity of en banc review (recall the overall rate of en banc in our data is about .01). When the whistleblower is most distant from the panel majority, the predicted probability of review declines to .03 [.01, .05].               "
"56","How does the location of the whistleblower affect review in unanimous decisions? The dashed line depicts the probability of review in suspicious decisions from which neither the whistleblower nor any other judge dissents. Consistent with the Counter‐preference Signaling Review Hypothesis applied to unanimous cases, the rate of review does decline at a statistically significant rate as the whistleblower moves away from the panel median.15 However, Figure 5A reveals that the effect is not substantively meaningful for the simple fact that the average predicted rate of review for cases without dissent is always very small.16 Even when the whistleblower has the same ideology as the panel median (meaning the entire panel is equally distant from the circuit), the probability of review is about .009 [.007, .012].               "
"57","We now turn to analyzing the Panel‐circuit Distance Review Hypothesis, which predicts that whistleblower dissents are more likely to trigger review when the panel majority is further from the full circuit. Figure 5B presents the results of this test. The vertical axis again depicts the probability of review, while the horizontal axis depicts the distance between the panel and circuit medians, moving closer from left to right.               "
"58","The results support the Panel‐circuit Distance Review Hypothesis. Recall that this hypothesis is a prediction about changes in the marginal effect of dissent on the probability of review as the panel majority moves closer to the full circuit. When the panel is the maximum distance away from the full circuit, a unanimous suspicious decision has about a .05 [.03, .08] probability of being reviewed. This shows that full circuits do review suspicious unanimous decisions by very distant panels at a substantial rate (compared to the baseline probability of en banc review). For the same panel, however, a whistleblower dissent increases that probability of review of a suspicious decision all the way to .51 [.28, .71], a huge increase of 46 percentage points. Even when the panel is only .4 units (the 75th percentile) away from the full circuit, the differences are dramatic. For such panels, the probability of review increases from .007 [.006, .009] in a unanimous suspicious decision to .11 [.08, .16] with a whistleblower dissent. Finally, when the panel median approaches the same ideology as the circuit median, the probability of review is effectively zero (.003) in a unanimous case; it increases to .04 [.02, .06] in the presence of a whistleblower dissent. Thus, a whistleblower dissent is most likely to trigger review when the panel median is distant from the circuit, and the marginal effect of dissent is also largest when this occurs, as our theory predicts.               "
"59","Finally, we evaluate the Dissent versus Unanimity Review Hypothesis, which predicts that suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents are more likely to be reviewed than unanimous suspicious decisions. Consistent with the hypothesis, Figures 5A and 5B, respectively, show that for any given distance between the panel median and the whistleblower or the panel and circuit medians, the probability of review of a suspicious decision with a whistleblower dissent is always higher than the probability of review of a unanimous suspicious decision. Thus, we see that whether there is a dissent—as well as who dissents—is a key driver of en banc review.               "
"60","According to our theory, non‐suspicious decisions should not be reviewed en banc, nor should whistleblowers dissent from them. However, such reviews and dissents do occur, for reasons outside the theory. This allows us to validate our claims that the dynamics examined by our theoretical model are driving the results in Figures 5A and 5B. We do so by demonstrating that these effects of ideology do not hold for non‐suspicious decisions.               "
"61","First, Figure 5C illustrates the effect of the distance between the whistleblower and the panel median on the probability that a non‐suspicious decision with a whistleblower dissent will be reviewed. It shows that there is no relationship between this distance and the likelihood of review. The confidence intervals around the line do not include zero, indicating that whistleblower dissents in non‐suspicious decisions do increase the overall the probability of review. But, as our theory predicts, this increase in the probability of review does not vary in the location of the whistleblower. Intuitively, this means the following: consider a panel composed of two liberal judges and one conservative whistleblower, deciding a case in a conservative circuit. If the conservative judge dissents from a conservative decision, this increases the probability of review—cases with any type of dissent are more likely to be reviewed than unanimous decisions. But, unlike the effect in suspicious decisions seen in Figure 5A, the effect is the same regardless of how conservative the whistleblower is.               "
"62","The same is true for the effect of panel‐circuit distance in non‐suspicious decisions. Figure 5D presents a parallel result to that presented in Figure 5B. It depicts the probability that a non‐suspicious decision with a whistleblower dissent will be reviewed, as a function of the distance between the panel and the circuit median. Again, such dissents significantly increase the chance of a case being reheard en banc. Here the slope of the line is negative and marginally significant (there is a 90% probability the leftmost point on the line is higher than the rightmost). But the increase in probability is only meaningful in panels that are very distant from the full circuit. In addition, the magnitude of the effect of a whistleblower dissent on review is substantially smaller than the corresponding magnitudes in whistleblower dissents from suspicious decisions. Finally, while we do not depict this in the interest of clarity, the probability of reviewing a non‐suspicious unanimous decision is always less than 1%, as we would expect.               "
"63","Next, we analyze the full circuit's decision whether to reverse or uphold the panel's decision in the cases that are reheard en banc. In our data, the full circuits reversed 68% of the decisions they reheard en banc. Models 4–6 in Table 2 present models of reversal that parallel Models 1–3 in terms of the predictors included in each model. We use Model 5 to generate predicted probabilities, which are plotted in Figure 6. We focus solely on the probability of reversal in suspicious decisions because the theory predicts that non‐suspicious decisions should not be reviewed, and thus, makes no predictions about how the full circuit should treat such cases, should they be reviewed.17 We test three reversal hypotheses: the first about the effect of the whistleblower's distance from the panel majority, the second about the effect of the distance between the panel and the full circuit, and the third about the effect of whistleblower dissents as compared to unanimity. Because the probabilities of reversal in cases with and without dissent are more similar than the comparable probabilities of review, we plot the estimates of reversal without uncertainty in Figures 6A and 6B for both the Counter‐preference Signaling and Panel‐circuit Distance predictions. We then plot the difference between the two estimates, along with the 95% confidence intervals around that difference.         "
"64","Predicted Probabilities of En Banc Reversal                     "
"65","A) How the probability of reversal changes as the distance between the panel median and whistleblower increases, in suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents and in unanimous suspicious decisions. B) How the probability of reversal changes as the distance between the panel median and circuit median decreases, in suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents and in unanimous suspicious decisions. C) The difference in the probability of reversal in suspicious decisions with a whistleblower dissent versus unanimous suspicious decisions, as the distance between the panel median and whistleblower increases, along with 95% confidence intervals (i.e., the difference between the two lines in [A]). D) The difference in the probability of reversal in suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents versus unanimous suspicious decisions, as the distance between the panel median and circuit median decreases, along with 95% confidence intervals (i.e., the difference between the two lines in [B])."
"66","We begin by evaluating the Counter‐preference Signaling Reversal Hypothesis and the Panel‐circuit Distance Reversal Hypothesis. These predict that the probability of reversal should decline in unanimous suspicious cases both as the whistleblower moves farther away from the panel median and as the panel median moves closer to the full circuit, respectively. The dashed lines in Figures 6A and 6B depict the probability of reversal in unanimous suspicious decisions. As predicted, the probability of reversal is decreasing in both distances. However, the negative slope is statistically significant only with respect to the distance between the panel and circuit medians (there is only a 70% probability that the slope of the line for panel‐whistleblower distance is negative). Thus, the data do not support the Counter‐preference Signaling Reversal Hypothesis. However, with respect to the Panel‐circuit Distance Reversal Hypothesis, the magnitude of the effect of panel‐circuit distance is sizable. When the full circuit reviews a unanimous decision by a maximally distant panel, the probability of reversal is .82 [.65, .92]. This declines to .56 [.46, .67] when the panel median has the same ideology as the full circuit—this is well below the average probability of reversal across all cases.         "
"67","Turning to the probability of reversal in suspicious decisions with a whistleblower dissent, it is easy to see from the solid lines in Figures 6A and 6B that such decisions are not always reversed, contrary to the theory's strong prediction. As noted above, the fact that this prediction fails is not surprising, given that both dissents and en banc review occur for reviews outside the model. In fact, the probability of reversal declines across both panel‐whistleblower distance and panel‐circuit distance in suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents. (Both of the negative slopes are statistically significant.) While this is outside the scope of the model, it is notable that the highest likelihood of reversal occurs when a whistleblower most credibly signals severe non‐compliance—when she is close to the panel median, and when the panel median and full circuit are far apart.         "
"68","Finally, consistent with the Dissent versus Unanimity Reversal Hypothesis, Figure 6 reveals that the probability of reversal is always higher in cases with whistleblower dissents than in unanimous cases. Figures 6C and 6D show that this difference in probabilities is significant across the majority of the range of panel‐whistleblower distance and virtually all of the range of panel‐circuit distance. Thus, conditional on review, suspicious decisions with whistleblower dissents are more likely to both be reviewed and reversed than unanimous suspicious decisions.         "
"69","Oversight is inherently difficult in large hierarchies, and the judiciary is no exception. Most cases that reach the federal courts end at the district courts. Of those appealed to the circuit courts, only a fraction are reheard either en banc or by the Supreme Court. On its face, this would suggest an insurmountable principal‐agent problem. Yet our article shows that this pessimism is unwarranted—full circuits can successfully delegate decision making to three‐judge panels. While our article does not provide a comprehensive account of every aspect of en banc review, our results do suggest that the combination of well‐known preferences and informative signaling aid full circuits in selecting cases in which the panel's decision is truly worth reviewing. And while judges are not “whistleblowers” in the traditional sense, dissents operate as meaningful “whistles” with which judges can signal potential non‐compliance to their colleagues in the full circuit.         "
"70","While the importance of dissent within studies of the judicial hierarchy has long been understood, we show here that not all dissents are equal—some whistleblowers are more influential than others. Based on a formal theory in Beim, Hirsch, and Kastellec (2014), we identify nuanced, novel predictions that describe which dissents will be most likely to lead to discretionary review. We show that a whistleblowing dissent is most effective when the panel majority is furthest from the full circuit—an intuitive prediction. We then show a more nuanced and surprising result. The effect of a whistleblower's dissent on the likelihood of review is strongest when she is ideologically closest to the panel, while the effect of her silence is strongest when she is ideologically most distant from the panel. We show, further, that these effects exist only when a panel makes a decision of which the full circuit is suspicious ex ante. Thus, we find that strategic communication is conditional on the relationship between the receiver and the sender and on the material being communicated. While other work has found such asymmetries with respect to full circuits and panels, our work is the first to show that the power of dissent is also conditional in this manner, and it is the first to empirically identify which whistleblowers' dissents are most likely to be heeded.         "
"71","More broadly, our results help clarify how important dissent is as a communication device in the judicial hierarchy. As we noted earlier, a wealth of previous studies have shown a strong and systematic relationship between dissent and discretionary review. However, one explanation for this finding is that dissent is simply correlated with other factors that also increase the probability of discretionary review, and thus, the causal effect of dissent might not be as large as suggested by this literature—or even exist at all. (A similar debate has arisen over whether amicus curiae briefs really have a causal effect on the Supreme Court's case selection; see Caldeira, Wright, and Zorn [2012].) However, our finding that the impact of dissent is mediated by the preferences of judicial whistleblowers suggests that at least some of this relationship is due to the signal of dissent itself. The reason is that, given random assignment on the Courts of Appeals, the assignment of a judge with a particular preference to a panel is effectively random (conditional on circuit). Thus, the fact that different dissenters create different probabilities of review, and not simply the act of dissent, makes it unlikely that other unobserved characteristics of cases are driving our results.         "
"72","In addition, our study goes beyond most existing work by connecting the review and reversal decisions with an integrated formal and empirical model. We show that the same decisions that are most likely to be reviewed are also those most likely to be reversed, particularly suspicious decisions with dissenting opinions. This result is consistent with higher courts relying on informative dissents to relay non‐compliance by three‐judge panels."
"73","At the same time, our study focuses on a particular role for dissent, and thus, there remain many open questions about its importance—both at the en banc stage and across appellate courts more broadly. We argued earlier that en banc review is mainly a mechanism for error correction, and our results suggest this is correct. Yet, it is well known that law creation is another important component of full circuit review. What is the role of dissent when the law is unformed or unclear? This question is even more pertinent with respect to the Supreme Court, given the priority the justices place on law creation over error correction when weighing which cases to review. How do signaling and counter‐preference signaling inform appellate court decision making when judges are creating and modifying the law? Finally, how do judicial reputation and prestige affect the ability of a judge to communicate via dissent either up or down the hierarchy (Bhattacharya and Smyth 2001; Klein and Morrisroe 1999)? Theoretical and empirical work on these fronts would further increase our understanding of the importance of dissent in the judicial hierarchy.         "
