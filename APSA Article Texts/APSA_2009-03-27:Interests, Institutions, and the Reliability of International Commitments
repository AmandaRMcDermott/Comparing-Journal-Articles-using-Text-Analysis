"2"," For my part, I have no hesitation in saying that in the control of society's foreign affairs democratic governments do appear decidedly inferior to others… . [A democracy has a tendency] to obey its feelings rather than its calculations and to abandon a long‐matured plan to satisfy a momentary passion …                "
"3","While most recent scholarly attention to the links between domestic political institutions and international relations has hailed the benefits of democracy, for instance, for preserving peace and facilitating open trading relations (e.g., Russett and Oneal 2001), concerns remain that democratic governments have difficulty making stable, long‐term commitments. Gartzke and Gleditsch write, “Since democracies must be responsive to be democratic, democracies fluctuate more in their policies than politically stable autocracies” (2004, 780). Gartzke and Gleditsch go on to state, “We expect that the foreign policies of democracies display inherent instabilities… . For an ally, cycling necessarily makes democracies less predictable (and thus less reliable) as a partner” (781).         "
"4","On the other hand, many scholars have argued that the institutions associated with democratic governance improve the ability of a state to make credible commitments over the long run, as they mitigate against anything other than incremental change and consensual policy choices (e.g., Gaubatz 1996; Leeds 1999; Lipson 2003; Martin 2000). While the rules for making policy commitments vary across democracies, treaty‐level commitments often require agreement from a wide range of domestic actors. Thus, democracies will only be able to make strong international commitments on issues of broad domestic consensus. And once a treaty becomes law, there are specific institutional procedures required for changing that law, and perhaps, negative repercussions for executives who do not adhere to established law. Because executives in democracies share power with other institutions and formal procedures exist for altering existing law, it is less likely that a new leader can generate abrupt policy change. While leadership turnover may occur regularly in democracies, the impact of leadership change on formal commitments should be attenuated, at least in comparison to similar leadership changes in societies without constraining political institutions. Lipson, for instance, writes, “The machinery of democratic governance is designed to make long‐term commitments that are readily discernable, hard to revoke, and therefore credible to partners” (2003, 101–2).         "
"5","Of course, the fact that democratic commitments are hard to revoke is not always desirable. It is certainly possible to imagine scenarios in which the public would be better off if the government revoked a previous commitment, and it is far from impossible for a democracy to change course. Yet, the constraints that make policy change difficult for democracies do help them to reap the benefits of international cooperation, as they reassure partners against opportunism. Due to the costs associated with changing course, democracies violate commitments only in cases where interests change fairly dramatically. Several existing analyses in different issue areas have shown evidence that democracies tend to meet their international obligations and are perceived as credible by international actors (e.g., Choi 2003; Leeds 2003; Mansfield, Milner, and Rosendorff 2002; Schultz 1999).         "
"6","The vast majority of scholars now believe that variance in domestic politics does have some effect on foreign policy behavior and international outcomes. There is also considerable agreement that foreign policy is affected by both the prevailing interests of societal groups with political power and by the political institutions that translate these interests into policy (e.g., Frieden 1988). Yet, there are few, if any, systematic empirical tests that appropriately evaluate the comparative effect of changes in the societal interests with political power on foreign policy in different domestic institutional settings. Existing tests are inadequate for three reasons. First, examining the impact of leadership change alone does not distinguish between cases in which a new leader beholden to the same interests takes power from cases in which a new leader who depends on different interests assumes power. We expect domestically motivated policy change only in the latter case. Second, a comparative evaluation requires that we examine the effects of leadership change—and changes in supporting coalitions and their associated foreign policy interests—across both democracies and nondemocracies. Third, the effect of domestic changes must be included in a model that controls for other factors that affect decisions to abrogate international commitments. In this study, we provide a test that meets all of these criteria.         "
"7","Our argument relies on several core assumptions. First, we assume that a state's international goals and interests are affected by both international and domestic factors. If international interests were determined only by the international system, domestic political change should never have an independent effect on foreign policy."
"8","Second, we assume that domestic groups within societies benefit from the pursuit of different policies, and that political competition results, in part, from these different interests. This claim extends to foreign policies; while there are some shared interests among all citizens—for instance, defense of the homeland—there are many aspects of foreign policy over which groups within a society have different interests."
"9","Finally, we assume that leaders wish to stay in power, and that in order to stay in power, every leader must maintain the support of a particular segment of society. As Bueno de Mesquita et al. write, “Every leader answers to some group that retains her in power: her winning coalition” (2003, 7). Thus, leaders are likely to pursue policies that benefit their core supporters.         "
"10"," Bueno de Mesquita et al. distinguish between a leader's selectorate, “the set of people with a say in choosing leaders,” and a leader's winning coalition, “the subgroup of the selectorate who maintains incumbents in office” (2003, xi). The institutional rules of politics within a society determine the size of the selectorate—who can participate in politics—and the size of the winning coalition—what proportion of the members of the selectorate must support a leader for that leader to be in power. Within many selectorates, however, there are multiple possible winning coalitions, and different winning coalitions may have different interests. For instance, in the contemporary United States, the large selectorate includes two considerably different possible winning coalitions. Leaders from the Democratic Party have a winning coalition that (1) is more concentrated in the geographic areas of the Northeast and the West Coast, (2) is less economically advantaged, and (3) has a higher proportion of minorities than their Republican counterparts. Leaders operating within the same institutional system but beholden to one winning coalition might pursue different policies than leaders beholden to a different winning coalition in the same system.         "
"11","A number of scholars have shown that different domestic groups have different preferences regarding economic policies and that these preferences affect leaders' decisions regarding trade and monetary cooperation (e.g., Dai 2006; Haggard 1990; Milner 1997; Rogowski 1989; Simmons 1994). But even in the area of high politics, for instance in deciding whether to conclude and maintain military alliances, different economic groups may benefit from different policies.         "
"12"," Narizny (2003a) argues that conservative governments tend to favor alliances over internal mobilization, while leftist governments are more likely to increase defense spending. He attributes this to the fact that defense spending requires higher tax rates and has negative effects on the income of wealthier citizens. Lobell (2004) further specifies which businesses should favor alliances: export‐oriented and banking industries. Not only are alliances a relatively cheap way of ensuring security, but they also protect these groups' gains from international trade and investment. On the other hand, those employed in import‐competing industries and the public sector may oppose alliances; these citizens have less of a stake in stable international economic relations and may be wary that alliance commitments might limit their government's autonomy. Narizny (2003b) argues that this logic extends beyond simply whether to ally and helps to explain who states ally with. Narizny writes, “Those employed in sectors that export to or invest in a single powerful state should be predisposed to align with that state, so as to protect their sources of income and foster bilateral cooperation over economic issues” (2003b, 190).         "
"13","Economic interests are certainly an important determinant of different domestic groups' alliance preferences, but other factors may also play a role. Ethnic ties may affect alliance choices. A leader representing a domestic group with ethnic ties to a neighboring country may support an alliance with that country, but if this leader is replaced by a leader who derives her support from different domestic groups, the alliance may be at risk of being terminated. Ideological affinity may also play a role. For instance, in some countries during the cold war leftist voters were more likely to advocate closer ties to the Soviet Bloc, while right‐wing voters preferred alliances with democratic states with free market economies. Whatever the source of divergent alliance preferences, it appears that “in any country, whether a democracy or autocracy, parties or factions hold different ‘philias’ or ‘phobias’—different preferences for alliance with particular other states” (Snyder 1997, 132).         "
"14","In Malta during the cold war, for instance, politics was dominated by two major parties—the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party. The Labour Party represented workers and embraced a socialist agenda, advocating economic policies involving income redistribution and government intervention. Its foreign policy emphasized nonalignment and some anti‐Western tendencies which particularly manifested themselves in the conclusion of alliance agreements with the Soviet Union and Libya. The Nationalist Party, on the other hand, represented the middle class and promoted Christian democratic values, free trade, and a pro‐Western outlook (Redmond 1993, 106). Thus, it comes as no surprise that when the Nationalist Party returned to power after 16 years of Labour rule, it undid some of the Labour government's international commitments. In particular, it immediately abrogated Malta's alliance with the Soviet Union.         "
"15","While divergent preferences may lead to the abrogation of existing international commitments if a leader with a different supporting coalition than her predecessor comes to power, preference change does not always equal policy change. Rather, the extent to which changes in foreign policy preferences translate into observed policy changes is influenced by political institutions."
"16","First, political institutions influence the range of citizens who serve as a supporting coalition. Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003) demonstrate that the size of the winning coalition and the selectorate have systematic influence on the policies adopted by leaders; different institutional rules encourage different behavioral patterns on the part of leaders. In particular, Bueno de Mesquita et al. argue that leaders operating in systems characterized by large selectorates and large winning coalitions (for example, democracies) are more likely to have incentives to provide public goods, whereas leaders in small winning coalition systems are more likely to concentrate on providing private goods to their supporters. Since all democratic leaders must maintain the support of a majority of the voting population, their incentive is to pursue policies with broad appeal; even leaders relying on different core groups of support may find similar policies desirable. Variance in policy choice should be more dramatic in small winning coalition systems, since there is considerably more variance in particularistic private goods policies than in policies that maximize the public good.         "
"17","Second, institutions mediate the translation of interests and preferences into policy, and some institutions are designed to moderate the effect of changes in interests on changes in policy by making policy change more difficult. Separation of powers, federal systems, and well‐established legal systems make policy change more difficult and are aimed at encouraging continuity in policy outputs (e.g., Choi 2003; Gaubatz 1996; Leeds 1999; Lipson 2003; Martin 2000). Because most democratic leaders cannot govern effectively without cooperating with other officials who may draw support from other segments of society (for instance, legislatures, governing coalition partners, leaders of subnational political units), policy outputs are more likely to represent compromise and drastic redirection is difficult.         "
"18","This is particularly likely to be true when policy has been codified in a formal legal document like an international treaty. International treaties are typically subject to ratification, and ratification procedures often require approval from a wide range of domestic actors. The United States is an extreme case, requiring a two‐thirds vote of the Senate, which in practice means all treaties must have bipartisan support. Other countries may require a simple majority in both houses of the legislature (Germany, Belgium) or in one house of the legislature (France, Portugal)."
"19","Furthermore, once a treaty has been ratified, it becomes much harder to modify or abrogate the existing commitment, both politically and legally. First, some scholars have argued that democratic publics tend to favor the maintenance of existing international commitments due to their reverence for the rule of law and that leaders who ignore or violate international commitments will suffer with their publics (Gaubatz 1996). Using experiments, Tomz (2008) confirms both that voters object to policies that violate international commitments and that policymakers believe that following through on existing international commitments is important. Thus, the notion of pacta sunt servanda plays an important role in democratic politics.         "
"20","Second, once a treaty is ratified, ending it requires adherence to domestic legal procedures. These procedures often require the leader to garner support from other domestic political actors. For example, the Constitution of the Netherlands specifies that “the King [shall not], except with the consent of the Parliament, terminate any international treaty entered into with the consent of the Parliament” (Art. 19.1, Elkins and Ginsburg 2007). When new leaders representing different interests come to power, they may have an incentive to terminate existing international commitments, but their ability to do so will be limited by the need to follow domestic rules for the termination of treaties. It is difficult to make a formal international commitment in a democratic state, and it is also hard to break such a commitment once made.         "
"21","A number of high‐profile examples provide anecdotal support for our claims that (1) political competition within societies sometimes includes debates over international commitments, with different segments of society supporting different courses of action, and that (2) the effects of leadership turnover on treaty abrogation is weaker in democracies than in nondemocracies. The case of the West German Ostpolitik demonstrates how difficult it is both to make and break international commitments in a democracy. In the 1970s, the SPD‐FDP government negotiated a series of agreements with the GDR, the USSR, the CSSR, and Poland. In these agreements, West Germany recognized the GDR as a legitimate state and formally accepted its postwar borders. The agreements were highly contentious domestically. Young, left‐oriented SPD voters wanted to move away from the anticommunist stance of the previous generation and sought a better relationship with the Eastern Bloc (Haftendorn 2006, 170). Furthermore, business owners, traditionally FDP voters, were hoping for better access to East European markets (Patton 1999, 64). On the other hand, older, more conservative CDU/CSU voters regarded the agreements as a betrayal of German interests. Particularly strong resistance came from a powerful and well‐organized group of conservative voters, German expellees from Poland, East Prussia, and the CSSR; the 11 million expellees did not want the government to give up former German territories (Haftendorn 2006, 165; Patton 1999, 69).         "
"22","Given their constituency's stance, the CDU/CSU vigorously fought the agreements. The party unsuccessfully appealed to the Constitutional Court, tried to bring down the government in a constructive vote of no confidence, and abstained from or voted against ratification of the agreements. Ostpolitik remained an important campaign issue for the Christian Democrats throughout the 1970s (Clemens 1989, 206). Thus, when the CDU/CSU finally resumed power under Chancellor Kohl in 1982, some Eastern European governments expected that the agreements would be denounced (Hacke 1988, 368). Yet, Kohl declared, “A modus vivendi with the East has been agreed to. We stand by these treaties, and we will use them as instruments of an active peace policy” (Clemens 1989, 231).         "
"23","While Ostpolitik was heavily opposed by Christian Democratic voters, no attempt was made to abrogate the existing treaties when a CDU/CSU‐led government regained power. Historians and political analysts note two explanations for this, both of which are commensurate with the broader argument we make in this article. First, the CDU/CSU needed the support of other parties, particularly the FDP; in democracies the need for cooperation among officials moderates policy change (Clemens 1989, 249). Second, many officials, including Kohl and the more conservative Franz Josef Strauss, appealed to the doctrine of pacta sunt servanda, arguing that it was important for Germany to respect established treaties in good faith (Clemens 1989; Hacke 1988, 368).         "
"24","On the other hand, there are many examples of leadership changes in nondemocracies that are accompanied by significant, immediate realignment of foreign policy. This is not surprising for two reasons. First, leaders in autocratic systems have incentives to produce policies that create private goods for small constituencies. As a result, alliances formed by such leaders are likely to be seen as benefiting small portions of the population and may well be unpopular with new coalitions that come to power. Second, new leaders have more freedom to make dramatic changes to existing commitments in autocratic systems."
"25","When a coalition of students, workers, peasants, urban poor, and nationalist public servants led riots that resulted in the resignation of the Tsiranana regime in Madagascar in May 1972, the new Ramanantsoa government responded to the coalition's demands to end “neo‐colonialism” by abrogating a number of agreements (including an alliance) with France. The French alliance was seen as enabling an unpopular government to maintain control (Allen 1995, 61; Melkote 1994, 37). In Iraq in 1958, when nationalist forces staged a coup that ended the Hashemite Dynasty, one of the new government's first acts was to end an alliance with Jordan. In his proclamation ending the agreement, the new Prime Minister stated that the alliance was meant “to consolidate the corrupt monarchical system as well as to disrupt the unity of the emancipated Arab [people] and to realize the interests of the clique of rulers who did not come to office through [the choice of] the people and who did not work for the realization of their aspirations” (Khalil 1962, 92).         "
"26","The plausibility of these examples leads us to pursue a more systematic evaluation of the effects of domestic political changes on the maintenance of international commitments. While our argument applies to many areas of foreign policy in which states make formal international commitments, we choose to focus our initial empirical analysis on one particular type of international commitment, military alliances. Following Leeds and Mattes, we define a military alliance as “a formal agreement among independent states to cooperate militarily in the face of potential or realized military conflict” (2007, 185). Alliances are, by definition, formal international commitments, and alliance agreements often specify their duration and the conditions for legal renegotiation or termination. Thus, the decision to end an existing alliance commitment in violation of its terms (for instance, by failing to comply with obligations of the agreement, announcing that one's state will no longer be bound by the obligations of a treaty, or by severing relations with an ally) is a costly, active decision; it is also a decision taken at the highest level of government. These characteristics make alliance politics a good area for an initial investigation of our argument.         "
"27","We expect that when a new leader who receives primary support from a different set of societal interests comes to power, existing alliance commitments may be at risk. Yet, even if the new and the old winning coalitions have different alliance preferences, it is possible that no abrogation of existing agreements takes place. The probability that domestic political power shifts result in the abrogation of formal alliance agreements is conditioned by political institutions; leaders of democratic states are less likely to abrogate existing legal commitments than their nondemocratic counterparts. Thus, we posit the following two hypotheses:"
"28","                        "
"29"," H1: A change in the leader's core domestic constituency increases the probability that the state will end an alliance in violation of its terms.                  "
"30"," H2: A change in the core domestic constituency of a leader of a nondemocratic state increases the probability that the state will end an alliance in violation of its terms more than a change in the core domestic constituency of a leader of a democratic state.                  "
"31","Of course, changes in the domestic political environment are not the only factors that influence decisions to terminate alliances in violation of their terms. International factors may play a role as well. In fact, some domestic political changes might be motivated by international changes—an electorate, for instance, might be more willing to elect a dove than a hawk in less threatening international times, making it difficult to determine the direct cause behind a change in foreign policy. Thus, in order to evaluate the influence of domestic political changes on the violation of alliance commitments, we must control for various international factors and aspects of alliances themselves that may be related to decisions to end existing commitments. We are guided in our decision of which control variables to include in our model by a recent study by Leeds and Savun (2007).         "
"32"," Leeds and Savun (2007) argue that decisions to end alliances in violation of their terms are based both on the continuing value of the alliance and on the costs associated with abrogating an international commitment. They find that changes in factors affecting the value of alliances (for instance, changes in power, external threat, domestic political institutions, and new alliance partners) since the time of alliance formation are associated with an increased risk of opportunistic abrogation. At the same time, controlling for these factors, features of the member states (democracy and power asymmetry) and features of the alliances themselves (issue linkage) are associated with a lower likelihood of termination in violation of terms.         "
"33","The Leeds and Savun (2007) model focuses very heavily on international incentives to maintain or terminate existing alliances. The authors include only two variables designed to tap into domestic political considerations—whether the alliance members are democratic and whether they experience changes in their domestic political institutions. Both variables capture the effects of institutional variation. Leeds and Savun do not study, however, the effect of domestic political change within a single institutional context. Our study fills this void.         "
"34","A primary impediment to evaluating the comparative consistency of foreign policy in democratic and autocratic systems is lack of information about change in the nature of supporting coalitions in nondemocracies. We have quite a bit of information about the nature of the coalitions that support different political parties within democracies, but very little systematic information about whether new leaders in autocracies draw their support from similar or different constituencies than their predecessors. A major task of this research project is to identify instances in which leaders with different core domestic constituencies come to power for both democratic and nondemocratic states."
"35","We begin by identifying all leadership changes for states with existing bilateral alliance commitments from 1919 to 2001. Our primary source for this information is the Archigos dataset (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009). We then investigate which of these leadership turnovers are associated with a change in the societal groups supporting the leader's hold on power. Sometimes one leader is replaced by another leader who is supported by and accountable to essentially the same segments of society (e.g., King Abdullah replacing King Hussein in Jordan or George H. W. Bush replacing Ronald Reagan in the United States); there is no reason to expect a change in policy driven by changes in domestic political interests in these cases. At other times leadership turnover results in significant differences in core supporting coalitions (e.g., Fidel Castro replacing Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, or Willy Brandt replacing Kurt Kiesinger in West Germany); these are the cases where the conditions for domestically motivated policy change are strongest. Our theory focuses on the extent to which a new leader represents a different core constituency than his or her predecessor. This is not necessarily correlated with the means by which a leader comes to office. For example, the Archigos dataset (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009) distinguishes whether leaders come to power by regular or irregular means. A regular means of transferring power (for instance, an election) can result in a leader with a new supporting coalition or a new leader who represents similar interests as the former leader. An irregular transfer of power (for instance, a coup) can similarly result in a different leader with the same basic supporting coalition (perhaps the military) or a leader with a new supporting coalition. Thus, our coding rules focus on the nature of the leader's core supporters and not on the means by which a leader comes to power.         "
"36","In a democracy, a leader's supporting coalition consists of those who vote for the leader or the leader's party. We consider those who associate with and vote for a given political party to represent a distinct set of interests that they believe will be best served by the platform of that party. Leaders who belong to the same political party are likely to be beholden to the same societal groups, whereas leaders representing different parties have different primary societal coalitions."
"37","Cases of presidential democracies are straightforward. Here we consider a change in the supporting coalition to occur when a new leader who is affiliated with a different party than his predecessor comes into office. We obtain data on the party affiliations of leaders from Woldendorp, Keman, and Budge (2000), the U.S. Department of State Background Notes, and country‐specific sources.         "
"38","The situation becomes more complicated in presidential systems in which the president is not affiliated with any particular party, as is the case, for example, in Russia since 1991 or Ukraine from 1991 to 2005. In these cases, we make decisions on core domestic coalition changes based on two rules. First, if country‐specific sources suggest that the new president is the predesignated successor of the old president, or if the new president is the former vice president, then we code no change in the basis of societal support (e.g., Yeltsin‐Putin in Russia). If the successor was not predesignated by the former ruler and was not vice president under the former regime, we analyze country‐specific sources to determine whether the two presidents were elected by essentially the same groups of voters or different groups of voters (e.g., Kravchuk‐Kuchma in Ukraine)."
"39","In parliamentary democracies, we code a change in the leader's core domestic coalition if, in a single‐party majority or in a minority government, there is a new ruling party, or if, in a coalition government, the major party of the coalition changes. We define the major party as the party that provides the prime minister, whether or not this is the party with the most votes or seats. Thus, if the prime minister comes from a different party than his or her predecessor, we code a change in the core domestic coalition."
"40","Rotating presidencies/heads of states (e.g., Switzerland, Bosnia‐Herzegovina, San Marino, and Colombia during the National Front) form a special category. While leaders (and their parties) change within short intervals, each leader is dependent on the other parties that participate in the rotations; these other parties are part of the leader's supporting coalition. Thus, in cases of constitutionally mandated rotating presidencies/heads of governments, we do not code the change from one leader to another as a coalition change even if they have different party affiliations."
"41","The larger challenge for this project is to identify changes in societal supporting coalitions in nondemocratic states. We begin by differentiating among different types of autocracies, using the coding scheme suggested by Geddes (1999, 2003): military regimes, single‐party regimes, and personalist regimes. In military regimes, the leader's tenure in office is supported by military officers who also hold significant sway over policymaking. In single‐party regimes, one party controls access to the leadership position as well as policymaking (although other parties may legally exist). In personalist systems, the leader is surrounded by a clique of family, friends, and other allies who support the leader's hold on power and whose preferences may be reflected in policymaking. Geddes's coding covers primarily the post‐1945 era; we rely on her codings where available. In addition, we apply her definitions to accomplish our own categorization of the remaining autocratic states based on country‐specific sources.         "
"42","The identification of changes in core supporting coalitions in military and single‐party autocracies is straightforward. Systems that are classified as military juntas are coded as experiencing no core domestic coalition change during the entire time the junta is in power. This is also true for cases in which different military leaders (or civilian leaders installed by the military) succeed each other—the military remains the core coalition for each of these leaders and this coalition is relatively cohesive. While military officers come from a variety of different backgrounds and may embrace very different and potentially conflicting ideologies, there is scholarly consensus that most professional soldiers have a corporate interest in maintaining and improving the efficacy of the military, and they place this interest above everything else (Geddes 1999, 125–26). This means that in order to stay in power, any leader of a military junta must promote military interests.         "
"43","In single‐party systems, the interests of the leader's supporting coalition (i.e., the party cadres) are often even more cohesive than the military. While some disagreements over policies do exist, the general orientation and policy goals are usually fixed by a strong party ideology. Any leader placed in power by the party cadres needs to work within fixed parameters. For this reason, systems that are classified as single party are coded as experiencing no domestic coalition change from the beginning until the end of that party's dominance. Changes to a new single party or away from single‐party government, on the other hand, may constitute changes in supporting coalitions."
"44","Leadership turnover in personalist systems, however, is often accompanied by a change in the core supporting coalition. If the new leader is the predesignated successor of the old leader, no change in supporting coalition is coded. If the leader is replaced by someone other than his or her predesignated successor, we code a change in the leader's core societal coalition. We code those appointed by the outgoing leader, vice presidents of the outgoing leader, and close relatives (e.g., sons and brothers) of the outgoing leader as predesignated successors."
"45","Aside from military, single‐party, and personalist regimes, there is another distinct category of nondemocratic regimes: monarchies. We identify monarchies based on the official position of the leader in power. If the leader is a king or holds a comparable title, we use Morby (2002) to identify the dynasty from which the leader descends. Monarchies are coded as experiencing a change in the leader's core supporting coalition if the new leader stems from a different dynasty than his predecessor.         "
"46","Finally, there are a number of nondemocratic country‐years that do not fit the personalist, single‐party, military, or monarchy regime type. These are mostly years that Geddes (2003) identifies as interregna during which no clear institutional rules are in effect and no particular regime can be said to be in place. Some of these years are periods during which a provisional, interim, or caretaker government assumes power for a limited time. In this case, the change from a regular to an interim government is not coded as a coalition change. Interim governments are installed to help ensure order and the functioning of the state for a limited time. They are not expected to pursue their own policy goals but rather help to maintain the status quo until the next regular government assumes power. The next regular government, on the other hand, does actively shape policies; therefore, if this government has a different supporting coalition than the previous regular government, we code a change in dominant domestic interests. We treat periods of foreign occupation in a similar way—as interim governments. We do not code a change in the leader's supporting coalition when a foreign occupation begins, but we do code one when the foreign occupation ends, provided that the new government draws support from different segments of society than the government in power before the foreign occupation.         "
"47","For cases that do not appropriately fit the nondemocratic regime categories but are also not periods of interim government (e.g., Comoros 1978–2003), we identify changes in core supporting coalitions based on whether the incoming leader was a predesignated successor of the former leader. If the incoming leader is not a predesignated successor, we code a change in core supporting coalition."
"48","In autocratic systems, therefore, changes in supporting coalitions can occur either within one regime category (for instance, the switch from one single party to a different single party, the switch from one personalist ruler to a different personalist ruler who is not a predesignated successor, or the switch from one monarch to a monarch from a different dynasty), or due to movement from one nondemocratic regime category to another (for instance, personalist to military or military to single party). Within our sample, approximately one‐third of the coalition changes in nondemocracies are of the former type, i.e., leadership changes within the same regime category, and approximately two‐thirds are leadership changes that also involve movement from one nondemocratic regime type to another."
"49","In the next section we describe the research design that we use to evaluate our hypotheses. We also provide descriptive statistics regarding leadership change and changes in supporting coalitions for the states in our sample."
"50","As we discussed above, our dependent variable is a state's decision to end an existing alliance commitment in violation of its terms. Our sample includes all members of bilateral alliances formed between 1919 and 1989 according to the Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) dataset, excluding agreements that require only nonaggression commitments (Leeds and Mattes 2007).1 We do not evaluate alliances formed before 1919 due to lack of information on our primary independent variable, and we do not examine alliances formed after 1989 because virtually none of them have terminated; alliances in effect as of December 31, 2001, are treated as right‐censored. The unit of analysis is the alliance member‐year. Our sample includes 234 alliances, 74 of which end in violation of their terms, and 6,842 alliance member‐year observations.         "
"51","The ATOP dataset includes information both on when alliances end and the means by which they end; this is crucial for coding our dependent variable. Alliances are coded as ending in violation of their terms if “(1) a major provision is violated and the governments do not indicate their intention to continue to recognize the alliance in spite of the violation, or (2) one or more of the allied governments specifically declares that it will no longer recognize or be bound by the alliance agreement despite the fact that the alliance has not reached its scheduled termination date” (Leeds and Savun 2007, 1124). Essentially, these are cases in which one or both partners is legally obligated to maintain the partnership but chooses instead to embark on an explicitly different course. Alliances need not be invoked by war or military crisis to end in violation; any abrogation not permitted by the terms of the agreement qualifies.2"
"52","While the ATOP dataset provides information about which alliances end in violation of their terms, the dataset does not identify which state was primarily responsible for the termination of the agreement. Leeds and Savun (2007) note that it is often difficult to attribute responsibility for premature alliance termination to one side or the other, as each leader has an incentive to blame the former ally for making cooperation unworkable. Yet, because our research question specifically concerns the conditions under which individual states violate commitments, our research design must distinguish the state that ends the agreement. We have thus adopted the following rules for coding which alliance member was responsible for terminating an existing alliance in violation of its terms: (1) If one state egregiously and obviously violates key terms of the alliance, for instance by attacking the ally or failing to come to the ally's assistance when attacked (in violation of alliance provisions), that state is responsible for ending the alliance. Germany, for instance, broke the Nazi‐Soviet nonaggression pact by attacking the Soviet Union in June 1941. (2) Barring a clear violation of the treaty, if one state unilaterally declares the alliance over or breaks diplomatic relations with the ally, that state is responsible for ending the alliance. Examples include the USSR's termination of alliances with Britain and France in 1955 and Somalia's termination of its alliance with the USSR in 1977. (3) If there is no clear violation and no single statement ending the alliance, we make judgments based on who we believe most experts judge to have ended an alliance. Here, an example is the termination of the British‐Thai neutrality/nonaggression pact during World War II. While Thailand did not violate any specific provisions of the treaty, and we can identify no statement as the first instance in which a member declared the abrogation of the treaty, the alliance was understood by both sides to have ended after Thailand attacked French possessions in Southeast Asia and signed an alliance with Japan. We code Thailand as ending the alliance because Thai leaders were well aware that the termination of the British alliance would be a consequence of their behavior.3"
"53","Our primary independent variable is a dummy variable indicating whether there was any change in the core domestic supporting coalition for the leader of the state in the given year. Because we recognize that making foreign policy changes takes some time, we do not include cases in which a new leader is in office for less than 30 days. This rule eliminates cases in which a coup is successful for a few days, but the former government then regains control. In addition, for cases in which a new leader assumes power during the last three months of the year, we code the following year as a year of coalition change as well, since new policies may not yet have had time to go into effect. We examined the dates of alliance termination and leadership change to ensure that we were not attributing alliance termination to a leadership change that occurred after the alliance had ended (but during the same year). Only leadership changes that occur after alliance formation are recorded for the first year an alliance is in effect, and only leadership changes that occur before alliance termination are recorded for the last year an alliance is in effect. To test our hypothesis that the effects of domestic coalition change are contingent upon domestic political institutions, we interact our variable representing changes in core domestic supporting coalitions with a dichotomous indicator of democracy. We code any state that scores a six or higher on the POLITY IV composite democracy scale as democratic (Marshall and Jaggers 2002).4"
"54","Applying our coding rules to the sample in our analysis, we find that the 6,842 state‐years include 1,183 years of leadership change. Of those, 554 bring to power leaders who receive their primary support from different core societal coalitions than their predecessors. While democracies make up a relatively small proportion of our sample (1,901 state‐years, 28%), they experience leadership changes more often and their leadership changes are more frequently accompanied by a change in supporting coalition: 30% of the democratic state‐years (574) experience a change in leadership, and 21% (407) experience a change in the leader's supporting coalition. In the nondemocratic state‐years in our sample, only 12% (609) experience leadership change, and only 3% (147) experience a change in the leader's supporting coalition."
"55","As we stressed above, we consider it crucial in evaluating our hypotheses to include control variables for international and alliance‐related factors that influence the probability that an alliance will end in violation of its terms. We base our choice of control variables on the model developed by Leeds and Savun (2007). Many of these variables need modification, however, since Leeds and Savun (2007) conduct a nondirected dyadic analysis, and our analysis is conducted on directed dyads; we include separate observations for state A's decision to terminate an alliance with state B and state B's decision to terminate an alliance with state A.         "
"56"," Leeds and Savun (2007) find that changes since an alliance was formed in factors that affect the value of the alliance are associated with a greater probability of alliance abrogation. Specifically, they examine four factors—changes in international power, changes in political institutions, changes in levels of external threat, and the formation of new outside alliances. Three of these factors (power, political institutions, and new outside alliances) are positive and statistically significant in their model, indicating support for their hypotheses. We include all four of these factors as variables in our present analysis.         "
"57","First, we include a dummy variable that is coded 1 if either the state in question or its ally has experienced more than a 20% change in its international power since the alliance was formed.5 These calculations were made using the Correlates of War Composite Index of National Capabilities (CINC; Singer 1988). States that have become stronger (or whose partners have become weaker) may find an alliance less valuable for fulfilling security needs, and states that have become weaker may be unwilling to maintain external security commitments that were possible at an earlier date.         "
"58","Second, we include a dummy variable that is coded 1 if either the state in question or its ally has experienced a change in its domestic political institutions since the alliance was formed. Because changes in domestic political rules change the incentives of leaders, we expect that such changes may strain an alliance as policy preferences change. This variable also helps us to isolate differences between changing institutions and changing coalitions. We code any change of at least two points on the POLITY democracy or autocracy scale as a change in domestic political institutions (Marshall and Jaggers 2002).6"
"59","Third, we include a variable designed to measure the change in international threat faced by the allies. This dummy variable is coded 1 if either the state in question has experienced at least a 30% decrease in its level of international threat since the alliance was formed, or if its ally has experienced at least a 30% increase in threat. When a state's threat level decreases, it may see less value in an alliance, and when its ally's threat level increases, the alliance may be seen as increasingly costly. Leeds and Savun (2007) develop a novel procedure for measuring international threat, which is based on considerations of both power and policy difference. States in the allies' politically relevant international environments become more threatening when they become stronger and/or more different in foreign policy orientation, and they become less threatening either by becoming weaker or more similar in foreign policy orientation.         "
"60","Leeds and Savun begin by defining the states that make up a state's threat environment. First, only states in a state's politically relevant international environment (PRIE) are part of the threat environment, since these are the states capable of posing a military threat (Maoz 1996, 136–42). Operationally, these are contiguous states and major powers. Second, states that are allied to the state in question or have similar foreign policy preferences to the state in question are not considered to be military threats; operationally those states that share an S score (Signorino and Ritter 1999) with the state in question above the population median or who share an alliance tie according to the ATOP dataset (Leeds and Mattes 2007) are excluded from the threat environment. A state's threat environment thus includes all contiguous states and major powers with whom the state does not share an alliance or a similar foreign policy portfolio. To determine the state's level of threat, Leeds and Savun sum the COW CINC scores for the states that make up the state's threat environment.         "
"61","Fourth, we include a variable indicating whether the state in question formed a new outside alliance in the given year. Because a state that has succeeded in forming an alliance with a preferable substitute may no longer value an existing alliance, new alliances may put existing alliances at risk. This variable is measured using the ATOP data (Leeds and Mattes 2007).7"
"62"," Leeds and Savun (2007) also find that features of an alliance itself affect the likelihood that the alliance will be terminated in violation of its terms. We include four variables in our analysis that control for features of the alliance. First, we include a variable that indicates whether the alliance includes one major power and one minor power, based on the Correlates of War project distinctions. Morrow (1991) has argued that alliances between states of different status are likely to last longer, and Leeds and Savun (2007) find support for this hypothesis.         "
"63","The other three alliance variables are all drawn from the ATOP dataset (Leeds and Mattes 2007). First, we include a variable that indicates whether the alliance agreement includes provisions for nonmilitary cooperation. Issue linkage should increase the value of the agreement and make it less prone to opportunistic abrogation. Next, we include a variable indicating whether the alliance agreement went through a formal process of ratification; we assume that treaties that have been ratified domestically are less prone to violation. Finally, we include a variable indicating whether the alliance requires peacetime military cooperation and thus involves higher sunk costs. This variable is operationalized with an index initially developed by Leeds and Anac (2005). The Leeds and Anac index considers a variety of requirements involving troop placements, military bases, integrated command, training and technology exchanges/coordination, official contact among military officials, and formal coordinating organizations; the measure is explained in detail in their article. We expect that alliances with more peacetime investment are less likely to be terminated prematurely. Leeds and Savun (2007) find support only for the hypothesis regarding issue linkage. In their analysis, alliances with provisions for nonmilitary cooperation were less likely to be abrogated opportunistically.         "
"64","Our goal is to determine the probability that an existing alliance ends in violation of its terms at a particular time, given particular conditions. To do this, we employ a logit model with controls for time dependence. Carter and Signorino (2007) make the case that a logit model including variables for time, the square of time, and the cube of time is often preferable for interpretive purposes to event‐history models like the Cox or Weibull, and to logits with the more complicated corrections proposed by Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998). We adjust the standard errors to account for the lack of independence among observations associated with the same alliance.8"
"65","Our analysis includes no left‐censored observations since our sample includes only alliances formed since 1919. The majority of our observations, however, are right‐censored. Cases are right‐censored if the alliance is still in effect at the end of our study's time period (2001), but they are also right‐censored if the alliance ends through any means other than violation of its terms. Alliances that end in fulfillment of their terms, in mutual renegotiation, or due to an exogenous loss of independence by one of the members provide us important information for our analysis—we know that as of the date they ended through another means, they had not ended in violation of their terms. We do not know, however, whether they would have ended in violation of their terms if they had continued. Thus, they are treated as censored.9"
"66","We present our results in Table 1. Column 1 of Table 1 reports that the dummy variable representing domestic coalition change is positive and statistically significant, indicating that such a change increases the probability of alliance termination in violation of alliance terms. This provides support for our first hypothesis. In Column 2 of Table 1 we add an interaction term to test the difference in this effect between democratic and nondemocratic states. The coalition change variable remains positive and statistically significant, indicating that the positive relationship between domestic political change and alliance violation holds among nondemocracies (i.e., when democracy = 0). Democratic states, however, are less likely to abrogate alliances opportunistically, at least when they are not experiencing changes in their leader's supporting coalitions; the dummy variable representing democracy is negative and statistically significant. The interaction term representing coalition change in a democratic state is negative and statistically insignificant.10 Interpreting this effect, however, requires joint consideration of the interaction term coefficient and coefficients associated with its constituent parts. We accomplish this by examining the substantive impact of a coalition change upon the probability of alliance termination.         "
"67"," Table 2 demonstrates the changes in the probability of alliance termination in violation of alliance terms associated with a change in a leader's supporting coalition. All of these effects and their confidence intervals were calculated using Clarify; variables other than democracy and change in supporting coalition are held at their mean values (King, Tomz, and Wittenberg 2000; Tomz, Wittenberg, and King 2001). The first row in Table 2 shows the effect of a change in a leader's core supporting coalition on the probability that an alliance is terminated in violation of its terms without distinguishing between democracies and nondemocracies. Overall, the risk of alliance abrogation increases by more than two and a half times with a significant change in the domestic leadership coalition. The following two rows, however, show that this effect seems to be isolated to nondemocracies. In nondemocracies, a change in the core domestic coalition of a leader leads to a substantial, statistically significant increase in the probability of alliance termination. Alliances are nearly four times more likely to be abrogated opportunistically when the domestic supporting coalition of a leader in a nondemocratic state changes. On the other hand, there is no increased risk of opportunistic abrogation of an alliance associated with such a change in a democracy; the effect is statistically insignificant. Our second hypothesis also receives clear support.         "
"68","We have argued that leadership change in itself should not precipitate foreign policy change except in cases in which the new leader depends on a different societal base of support. Since cases in which a new leader who depends on a new domestic base emerges are a subset of all leadership changes, we need to demonstrate that they are a unique sample, and that leadership change alone does not explain our results. Thus, in Column 3 of Table 1 we report an analysis including dummy variables representing any leadership change, with or without a change in supporting coalition. These coefficients are statistically insignificant, as are the changes in the probability of alliance termination by violation associated with changes in these variables. As we expect, only leadership change that is accompanied by a change in the primary source of societal support affects foreign policy.         "
"69","The control variables are generally consistent with the results reported by Leeds and Savun (2007), with a few exceptions. In our analysis of a smaller sample, change in political institutions is statistically insignificant, as is the variable representing an alliance between a major power and a minor power. The significance levels of these variables are not affected by the introduction of our new variables; in our replication of the Leeds and Savun model on the 1919–2001 sample, these variables are insignificant. Otherwise, our control variables conform to the prior findings.         "
"70","While the empirical findings reported in this study are an important advance, they open a number of additional questions. One possibility, for instance, is that democracies may not violate their commitments because instead they pressure their partners to renegotiate undesirable agreements. By doing this, new democratic leaders might be able to avoid maintaining undesirable commitments and also avoid outright abrogation. We have data on the alliances that ended in renegotiation of their terms, and thus, we were able to investigate this question. There are 81 alliances in our sample that end in renegotiation. Our analysis of the probability of alliance renegotiation, using the same independent variables, reveals that democracies are no more likely than nondemocracies to renegotiate their alliances. There is also no statistically significant relationship between the assumption of power by a leader with a new supporting coalition and renegotiation of alliances for either democratic or nondemocratic states. Thus, there is no evidence that renegotiation serves as a substitute for violation."
"71","What we cannot address in this study, however, is whether we are observing the effects of constraints (the inability of democratic leaders to reverse course), or of screening (the care of democratic leaders in making commitments), or both. Are democracies more careful in selecting the agreements that they form, for instance committing themselves only to agreements with strong national support that they are confident they will not have future incentives to break? Do democracies design agreements of shorter duration or with more opportunities for legal withdrawal so they can avoid the need to violate commitments? A full understanding of the comparative influence of democratic and nondemocratic political institutions on foreign policy will need to address these additional questions. For now, however, we can be confident that the international commitments made by democracies are resilient in the face of leadership and partisan turnover."
"72","Democracy is hailed as beneficial for its unique ability to hold leaders accountable to the citizenry. Many philosophers, scholars, policymakers, and pundits have worried about a potential downside to democratic accountability: the inability to make long‐term policy commitments in the face of a fickle electorate. Nowhere are the costs to such a condition as severe as in the realm of foreign policy where effective international cooperation requires that commitments be self‐enforcing. While democratic governments need to be responsive to their citizenry and abandon truly undesirable commitments, these instances must remain relatively rare in order for the state to remain reliable and be able to reap the benefits of international cooperation. Leaders must be able to provide adequate guarantees of their own and their successors' future behavior."
"73","There is theoretical reason to believe that modern democracies have accomplished this goal. Even as public opinion and elected officials change, democratic institutions contain checks and balances that make dramatic and sudden policy change difficult. In addition, democratic leaders face incentives to pursue policies with broad and general appeal. While leadership transitions and partisan changes serve to define a working democracy, institutional constraints and incentives may limit the extent to which policy outputs vary with these domestic changes."
"74","In order to examine the propensity for domestic political changes to affect international commitments, we collected new data on leadership changes within both democracies and nondemocracies during the twentieth century. Specifically, we identified which leadership transitions were characterized by a change in the core societal coalition supporting the leader. We then evaluated whether domestic leadership transitions that result in leaders with different primary bases of societal support are associated with the abrogation of international commitments."
"75","While our argument should apply to a wide range of foreign policy issues, we devoted this study to examining whether domestic political change results in an increased propensity for alliances to end in violation of their terms, controlling for international factors that affect decisions to abrogate alliances. We discovered that the probability of opportunistic abrogation of an existing alliance is nearly four times greater following a change to a leader with a different societal base of support in a nondemocratic state, but that there is no discernible effect of similar domestic transitions in democratic states. In addition, leadership transitions alone do not affect the probability that alliances will end in violation of their terms; domestically motivated foreign policy change is likely only when the new leader is beholden to different core interests."
"76","Commitments to long‐term international agreements are most in doubt for nondemocracies. While leadership transitions, and especially transitions to leaders with different societal bases of support, are relatively uncommon in nondemocratic states, they have clearly perceptible effects when they occur. The regular leadership turnover associated with democracy does not seem to put commitments to international agreements at risk, even if we only examine cases in which the party in power changes in addition to the leader. Our study provides evidence, therefore, that we need not abandon accountability in favor of consistency."
