"1","Party unity determines party‐label coherence. Parties can uphold unity in three ways: negative agenda control, cohesion, and discipline. Negative agenda control—the party leadership's ability to keep unwanted bills off the legislative calendar—is effective, but hard to observe. In the U.S. House, for example, Rohde (1991; cf. Campbell et al. 2001; Cox and McCubbins 2001, 2005) suggests that the majority party seeks to ensure that the House rarely considers issues that would split the party. Party cohesion jibes with the idea of a party as a group of like‐minded individuals joined for a common purpose (e.g., Bowler et al. 1999; Krehbiel 1993; Rasch 1999). Yet even like‐minded individuals disagree from time to time, and some purposes are more common than others. When cohesion fails, unity can be upheld through party discipline, which imposes costs on MPs who fail to toe the party line. Party leaders control an array of disciplinary tools, including but not limited to ballot access (or the right to use the party label; Cox and McCubbins 1994), committee positions (D'Onofrio 1979; Kiewiet and McCubbins 1991), advancement within the party and, by extension, increased influence over party policy positions and access to legislative perks (Bowler et al. 1999).         "
"2","The threats that party leaders use to maintain party unity are closely tied to legislator ambitions. Legislators who can sidestep disciplinary threats should do so, even if that implies moving into a different party. That is, party discipline should be linked to party switching."
"3","As an emerging literature indicates, the incidence of party switching varies across countries—that is, across institutional contexts and party systems. Even where switching is rare, it is not utterly absent and its occurrence varies over time. Against stereotype, the phenomenon is not confined to new democracies or weakly institutionalized party systems, as Table 1 exhibits.         "
"4","Despite the contributions of extant studies of switching and despite the ubiquity of the phenomenon, we lack a general understanding of what motivates switchers. Three basic questions thus remain open, and in turn point to legislator ambition and hence to indirect links between switching and discipline. First, is switching fundamentally different for legislators in unsettled systems—in new democracies (Àgh 1999; Grofman et al. 2000; Mainwaring 1999), in the wake of political reforms or scandals (Kato 1998; Reed and Scheiner 2003; Verzichelli 1999), or in reaction to sea changes in voter sentiment (Aldrich and Bianco 1992; Canon and Sousa 1992; King and Benjamin 1986)? Is the effect of switching on legislators' voting behavior (Ansolabehere et al. 2001; Hatcher and Oppenheimer 2003; McCarty et al. 2001; Nokken 2000; Nokken and Poole 2004) independent of the effect on their careers (Desposato 2003; Grose 2004; Grose and Yoshinaka 2003; Mershon and Heller 2003; Yoshinaka 2005)? Do differences in the context of switching produce differences in its effects (Aldrich and Bianco 1992; Castle and Fett 2000; Desposato 2006; Heller and Mershon 2001; Kreuzer and Pettai 2003a, 2003b; Laver and Benoit 2003; McElroy 2003)? Though these questions are as yet unresolved, it is clear that the multiple aspects of party switching are interdependent. All aspects play on the importance of electoral success and career advancement for individual legislators. All tap, in a word, ambition.         "
"5","The centrality of ambition has not gone unnoticed. McElroy's (2003) analysis is explicitly ambition theoretic, and Desposato's (2006) assessment of the impact of electoral, institutional, ideological, and patronage concerns on legislators' propensity to change parties hinges on legislator ambition. Desposato finds, consistent with Aldrich and Bianco (1992), that switchers aim to enhance their prospects both for reelection and legislative influence. Other studies suggest ambition as the driving force behind switching (Mershon and Shvetsova 2008). Turan (1985), for instance, finds that switchers in Turkey seem to serve longer in the legislature and to “accomplish other goals,” while Sánchez de Dios (1999; see also Àgh 1999; Tomás Mallén 2002) views switching as a means of jockeying for position and political influence. Studies that show that legislators who change parties also change the way they vote (e.g., Ansolabehere et al. 2001; McCarty et al. 2001; Nokken 2000) implicitly consider ambition, since party‐induced changes in voting behavior likely are linked to party discipline, and discipline works because legislators are ambitious.         "
"6","Legislator ambition is central to both legislative party discipline and legislator party switching. Are discipline and switching related more directly? We next argue that strong party discipline should make MPs more likely to switch than they would be if discipline were weak."
"7","Legislators belong to parties because party membership helps them to achieve their goals (Aldrich 1995). It is by now common sense that parties and by extension legislators want some combination of votes, office, and policy (Müller and Strøm 1999; Strøm 1990; and see in particular Strøm 1994). Success at the ballot box not only ensures a political career for the length of the term of office, but also underscores a candidate's value to her party. Advancement within the party, whether assigned according to longevity or another criterion, signals success in a political career. The ability to influence policy derives in turn from a politician's standing in the party and with voters. These goals both fuel legislator ambitions and afford party leaders the tools to discipline the rank and file, by threatening to withhold the benefits of the party label (Cox and McCubbins 1994) or to block MPs' intraparty advancement. For party members who feel the lash of discipline too often or too harshly, the choice of whether to stick with the party or switch to a new one, assuming a suitable one is available, should weigh heavily on the side of switching (cf. Hirschman 1970). Other considerations come into play as well, not least the question of whether and how switching might change policy outcomes. In the end, a legislator's decision to switch is some function of her ideal policy,3 her party's policy position, her party's ability to influence outcomes, and her contribution to that influence. We now examine these issues in more detail in a sketch of a model—a formal characterization of our core intuition about party discipline.         "
"8","The relationship between unity and discipline is on its face straightforward. A member of parliament (MP) should vote with her party as long as the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. She will vote the party line happily as long as she likes her party's position on the question at hand more than the alternative (the status quo or another party's proposal). She will continue to vote with her party even when she likes its position less than the alternative, on any given issue, as long as she can reasonably expect the penalties for straying from the party line to be at least as great as any utility gained by voting against her party. She will vote against her own party only when its choice is far, relative to the alternative, from her observed ideal policy.4"
"9","It is important to distinguish here between alternatives in terms of legislative votes and alternatives in terms of party ideal points. (Table 2 gives notation for this discussion.) We take party ideal points to be essentially fixed. Vote alternatives, by contrast, can vary widely: votes are taken on policy proposals versus the status quo (or reversionary policy) and proposals versus counterproposals; there is no reason to expect any alternative to reflect exactly any party's ideal point. A party's preferred alternative, for which its leaders expect their members to vote, is simply the one that is closest to its ideal point (it is possible, but uninteresting, for all parties to prefer the same alternative). It is thus likely that any MP will from time to time find that her party's choice is farther than the alternative from her most preferred policy.            "
"10","Consider the example in Figure 1, which shows member l (with ideal point L) of Party1 and policy alternative b1. If Party1's ideal point is x1, then Party1's preferred policy is b1. If there is a b2 closer than b1 to L, however, l prefers it to b1. Absent the threat of punishment, l votes for b2 if b2∈ (b1, b*1), where b*1 is a policy alternative that is the utility equivalent of b1 for l.            "
"11","                 Unity, Discipline, and Disobedience in Legislative Voting                         "
"12","In the real world, the threat of punishment is not absent. If party leaders can inflict costs on MPs who fail to toe the party line, then the range of attractive alternatives to the party's choice shrinks concomitant to that cost. MPs who transgress the party line must pay a price, but discipline imposes opportunity costs on those who vote for their party's alternative against their own preferences to avoid the penalty for bucking the party. Referring again to the policy space depicted in Figure 1, l would prefer to vote for any b2 closer than b1 to L (that is, in regions 2, 3, or 4). If l has to pay cost k1 for breaking discipline, then she will vote for b1 over b2 as long as k1 exceeds the benefit she would realize in voting for b2 over b1—formally, if k1≥ | ul (b1) −ul (b2)|, where ul (bi) is l's utility for policy bi, i= 1,2—which is the case only if b2 lies in region 3.            "
"13","Discipline is the credible threat of punishment. What sorts of threats can party leaders make that induce members to subordinate their ideals to those of their party? Discipline works when the party can block or at least hamper the pursuit of one or more of the aims routinely attributed to legislators: policy, office (e.g., a cabinet post) and legislative perks, and reelection (Müller and Strøm 1999; Strøm 1990). The tools of discipline derive from the party's control over necessary steps along the paths of MPs' ambition.            "
"14","The more a party uses discipline to induce its MPs to vote with the party and against their underlying preferences, the less utility accrues to each MP on average. In terms of Figure 1, every time an MP votes contrary to her underlying preferences she pays a cost in benefits foregone equivalent to − | ul (b1) −ul (b2)|, the difference between her utilities over the two alternatives. As these costs mount, it stands to reason that MPs might seek out ways to improve their utility; one way to do so might be to move to a new party. In short, a legislator for whom the lash of discipline bites too deeply might see moving to a different party as attractive.            "
"15","At issue is whether a switcher can more easily vote for alternatives in regions 2 and 4 in Figure 1 without giving up something else. Consider the nature of the alternatives on the table. A legislative vote is a choice between two alternatives that parties can support or oppose; these alternatives are not necessarily or even usually the same as party ideal points. It is thus likely that any MP will from time to time find that her party's choice is farther than the alternative from her most preferred policy. Hence one reason for switching is to be able to vote for any b2 in regions 2 or 4 (or 3) without having to pay disciplinary costs. To make switching worthwhile in terms of voting preference, however, either the probability that b2 will lie in region 1 or region 5 must be low, or disciplinary costs in the new party (k2) must be relatively small. At minimum, l would be better off switching even into a party whose preferred alternative is on average farther than her preswitch party's choice from L, all else constant, as long as disciplinary costs plus any utility loss over party position in the new party sum to less than her old party's disciplinary costs. Formally, l's utility for voting as a member of Partyi is the sum of the utility derived from voting for Partyi's chosen alternative bi when either l prefers bi or does not like bj enough to pay ki to vote for it (i.e., bj is anywhere but region 3 in Figure 1) and the utility of voting for bj otherwise (i.e., bj in region 3), minus the cost ki of punishment for so doing. Taking utility for bi over an entire legislature as utility for the expected value of bi, ul (votei), is               "
"16","Voting in a party is just part of the overall value of that party to an MP. Also important are the party's policy goals, particularly to the extent that parties seek to reach outcomes as close as possible to their ideal points. We thus denote l's preferences over policy outcomes by her utility for her party's ideal point, i.e., ul (xi). Note that ul (xi) and ul (votei) together cover Partyi's value to l with regard to policy. If l weights her utility for the expressive act of voting by wl∈[0, 1], then her policy utility as a member of Partyi is wlul (votei) + (1 −wl)ul (xi).            "
"17","For present purposes, we distill the ambition aspects underpinning party membership to three elements: party size, government status, and prospects for reelection. First, larger parties should be more attractive to potential switchers, in part because larger parties are more likely to be attractive potential coalition partners and to wield policy influence whether in or out of government, and in part because it should be easier to gain reelection in a party that wins many seats than in a party that wins fewer (Heller and Mershon 2005). Government parties also should be attractive to MPs thinking about changing parties, for similar reasons (see Heller and Mershon 2001, forthcoming; Laver and Benoit 2003). Finally, an MP who is concerned about her ability to win reelection in her current party—because her party has lost favor, because she will be moved down or even removed from the ballot, or for some other reason—might benefit from switching to a different party that offered her better electoral prospects (Aldrich and Bianco 1992). We express l's prospects for realizing her ambitions in Partyi as a weighted combination of these three factors: ambitionli=f(partysizei, govstatusi, reelectionli).            "
"18","We fold ambition and policy preferences into a legislator's utility for her party by allowing policy and ambition to take different weights, so that l's expected utility from retaining membership in Partyi is ul (Partyi)  = γl[wlul (votei)  +  (1 −wl)ul (xi)] +  (1 −γl) (ambitionli), where γl∈[0, 1] is the weight that l assigns to policy (versus career) concerns. This implies a “switching inequality”: legislator l in Partyi will move to a new party if there exists some Partyj, j≠i,5 such that               "
"19","Our model of the motivation for switching resembles that of Desposato (2006). We differ primarily in our focus on the possible tension between endorsing the party line and hewing to personal preferences. Legislators who care about policy will not always vote with their parties without some incentive. Discipline supplies that incentive. Even if party members are willing to subordinate their personal preferences for the good of the party (Laver and Shepsle 1999), such self‐sacrifice must have its limits. As long as MPs prefer to vote according to their preferences, all else equal, they can be tempted to change parties by offers of greater freedom from discipline.            "
"20","To elaborate: As long as an MP attaches some weight to her own policy preferences (that is, as long as γl > 0), the application of any discipline in the MP's original Partyi, ki, lowers her overall policy utility wlul (votei) + (1 −wl)ul (xi) as a member of Partyi (refer again to [1] and [2]). The higher the disciplinary cost, the more the switching inequality in (2) tips against Partyi. It follows that the greater the divergence between an MP's own preferences and those of her party, regardless of the disciplinary cost, the more the switching inequality tips against Partyi.            "
"21","Thus, the switching inequality yields two hypotheses, one about switching and discipline in general, the other about the role of preferences (independent of ambition and discipline) in switching decisions. We do not advance any hypotheses about ambition directly, in part because it is implicit in our focus on discipline and in part because others already have convincingly demonstrated its importance (Aldrich and Bianco 1992; Desposato 2006; Heller and Mershon 2005; Laver and Benoit 2003; McElroy 2003).            "
"22","                              "
"23"," Party discipline and party switching should be positively correlated. If, as argued, discipline and loyalty—or party unity—can be traded against each other, strong party discipline should create an incentive for legislators to switch parties.6"
"24"," Legislators whose ideal points are relatively far from those of their parties should be more likely to switch, all else constant. For a legislator whose ideal point is close to her party's, discipline is largely irrelevant. For an MP who often votes against her sincere preferences so as to avoid the lash of discipline, discipline exacts a high cost. Disciplinary pressures motivate such MPs to seek to align their behavior more closely with their ideals.                     "
"25","We seek to shed new light on a hitherto misunderstood aspect of the relationship between parties and their members, not to identify every source of party switching. Any decision to change parties probably depends on some factors omitted from our model of switching and discipline, such as personal relationships with party leaders and colleagues. Even so, our hypotheses suggest that parties (more precisely, party leaders) ought to be careful in defining disciplinable offenses and flexible in applying disciplinary measures; if they are not, they might find their members choosing exit over loyalty or voice (Hirschman 1970).            "
"26","We contend that MPs switch parties at least in part due to the incentives they face as they navigate their priorities vis‐à‐vis the reelection imperative, personal preferences, and party discipline. Our first hypothesis, on the link between party discipline and party switching, is in essence a probabilistic statement about the likelihood of switching within a legislature. It implies that MPs who choose to change parties do so in the hopes of making themselves better off. The most basic test of this notion is to look at whether MPs in more disciplined parties are more likely to switch. Our second hypothesis hones in more closely on personal preferences. If an MP is likely to switch out of her party the farther its ideal point is from her own, all else equal, the more plausible it is that she cares about policy per se and not just as an instrument of ambition.7"
"27","We test our hypotheses using voting data from the Italian parliament for the 1988–spring 2000 period. Italy is an ideal case for several reasons. Electoral laws vary over time, given the 1993 move from pure PR to hybrid laws (e.g., Katz 2001), yet throughout are comparable to those in other advanced democracies.8 The parliamentary system eliminates concerns about presidential versus legislative coalitions or a separate executive's ability to coerce, seduce, or cajole MPs. Still another advantage for our design is that most observers to date attribute the high rate of switching above all to system‐level conditions (but see Heller and Mershon 2001, 2005; Mershon and Shvetsova 2008). Other analyses of switching in Italy are primarily descriptive, invoking explanations grounded in the organizational weakness of Italian parties and the decomposition of the Italian party system in the wake of the 1992 corruption scandals (see, e.g., D'Alimonte and Bartolini 1997; Pappalardo 2000; Verzichelli 1996, 1997, 1999). We move beyond system‐level analysis to probe individual MPs' propensities to stray from their party lines. Yet we also interpret findings on MP behavior in light of the transition from Christian Democratic dominance to bipolar competition (D'Alimonte and Bartolini 2002).         "
"28","Our tests are straightforward, though we lack direct measures of some key variables. Our proxies for party and legislator ideal points draw on established methods. We use novel measures to capture party discipline. We turn first to proxies for preferences."
"29","Our base dataset of voting in the Italian parliament begins in 1988, near the start of the tenth legislature (2 July 1987–2 February 1992), and ends in spring 2000, roughly one year before the mandated end of the thirteenth legislature on 9 March 2001. The over 2.9 million legislator‐vote observations in the base dataset include all final votes on legislation, all votes to convert decree laws, all votes where the relevant government minister and the relevant committee disagree on the advisability of passage (a disagreement observable only on nonfinal votes), and all votes where the outcome goes against the responsible minister's recommendation (e.g., the vote was in favor but the government was opposed).9 Each deputy has six possible casts: yea, nay, “voted,”10 abstain, absent, and “on mission” (absent with cause). We excluded all “voted” casts, as they reveal no information about preferences, and coded “on mission” and “absent” as missing data. We kept certain abstentions, as detailed below.            "
"30","We calculated two‐dimensional Optimal Classification (OC) scores (Poole 2000, 2005) for Italian deputies (and their parties), dropping all secret votes and any members who vacated seats due to, e.g., election to a new office incompatible with parliamentary office. Scores were calculated separately in each legislature for all deputies who voted at least ten times in a single party in votes with a minority proportion of at least one‐half percent of those voting.11 Assuming that MPs should be able to forecast when abstentions will sink bills they oppose, we counted abstentions as “passive nay” votes when the bill did not pass and the number of abstentions exceeded the difference between yeas and nays—that is, [sum(yea) – sum(nay)] < sum(abstain). We calculated party positions on each vote—so as to compute OC scores for parties as well as individual MPs—as follows. When a plurality of a party's MPs who were present at a vote (voting either yea or nay, or abstaining) voted in favor of a proposition, we counted the party as voting in the affirmative. When a plurality of the party's MPs who were present at a vote voted against a proposition, we counted the party as opposing that item. When neither the members voting nay nor those voting yea constituted a plurality of the party's present members, we treated that party on that vote as missing data, since we could not determine whether the party as a whole was for or against the proposition. We then used OC scores to calculate our variables of interest, discussed below.12"
"31","To test the hypothesis that strong party discipline provides legislators with an incentive to switch parties, we want simply to examine the effect of discipline on an MP's likelihood of switching. Deputies are identified as switchers if they belong to different party groups for at least one pair of votes in a given legislature. Discipline is observationally indistinguishable from cohesion when it works (Bowler et al. 1999), but we can measure how closely MPs' OC scores cluster around that of their party and how much deviation there is in that clustering. We calculate MP i's distance from party j (where i is a member of j) as , where OC1i is i's first‐dimension OC score and OC1j is j's first‐dimension OC score. We take the mean of this two‐dimensional distance as one indicator of party unity and compute this distance (meandistance) by party and legislature. The smaller the average distance of party members from the party ideal point, the more likely are party members to chafe at the bridle of party discipline, all else equal.            "
"32","Party members' distance from the party ideal point is an important element of discipline‐motivated unity, but hardly decisive. In parties with strong discipline, mean distance should be low. In a party whose members share similar preferences, however, mean distance also would be low with no discipline at all. Our second discipline index is MPerror, which we treat as a proxy for an MP's standard deviation around her OC score.13 If two parties have the same value on meandistance, the one in which MPs on average exhibit greater MPerror will also be more disciplined, as leaders strive to constrain observed ideal points to approach the party ideal.            "
"33","Two additional scores tap discipline in our multipronged measurement strategy.14 The first, Weldonunity, resembles the well‐known Rice unity score (Carey 2000; Rice 1928), but incorporates abstentions (Weldon 2002) and is calculated as  for each party. The original computation pertains to each vote; in the collapsed dataset used for our estimations (discussed below), Weldonunity is a mean by party and by legislature. We also compute sdWeldonunity, the standard deviation of Weldonunity, by party and legislature. Parties with high discipline should evince both high Weldonunity and high sdWeldonunity: discipline creates cohesive voting but also greater variance—when unity breaks down, it should break down all the way.            "
"34","It is possible that the votes missing from the original dataset (see note 9) could bias our tests. Because the excluded votes are ones for which party positions are clear and deviations from the party line easy to identify, we might not capture the most meaningful instances of indiscipline. Alternatively, our data might be overpopulated with votes where party leaders care little about how MPs vote, so that discipline appears artificially low. In either case, however, our inferences should be reasonably safe. First, the missing observations are drawn from the entire Chamber, so any bias is constant across all MPs. Second, whether overall levels of discipline are high or low is irrelevant for our purposes; we are interested in relative discipline and changes in discipline. As long as the missing observations do not affect relative levels or the direction of changes—and we do not see why they would—they should not affect our conclusions.            "
"35","Also worrisome is the overwhelming prevalence of nonevents. That is, if our unit of analysis is the legislator and we compute the percentage of MPs who have ever switched in a legislative term, as in Table 1 here, switching has been relatively common in the Italian Chamber. From the viewpoint of our original dataset of almost 3 million legislator‐vote observations, however, most deputies stay where they are most of the time. We therefore collapse the dataset down by legislature, switchperiod,15 MP, number of switches for the MP, and party, and we construct one observation (all variables take their mean values for each period) for each new deputy‐switchperiod‐party combination (as well as a new observation if the party enters or leaves government) per legislature.16 This leaves 132,632 observations over the 12 years in the dataset, of which nearly one‐third are party switchers as just defined (usable observations are fewer—see below and the appendix—though the proportion of switchers does not change with the number of usable observations). The collapsed data allow us to focus on the probability that an MP will switch parties, which we believe is not an impulsive decision, rather than on the conditions prevailing at the moment of switching.17 We now use these data to put our hypotheses to the test.            "
"36","We conduct a binary logit estimation of the probability that deputy l in party j will switch to a different party. The dependent variable is willswitchl, a binary variable equal to 1 if deputy l will switch into a different party from the one he or she is in. If l switches more than once, this variable takes a value of zero only after his or her last move.18"
"37","Our key explanatory variables are seven. The four variables tapping aspects of party discipline afford direct tests of our first hypothesis. Since high discipline should pull revealed MP ideal points relatively close to the party ideal, low values on meandistance suggest high levels of discipline, and thus, according to our hypothesis, the coefficient of meandistance should be negative. If two MPs in the same party have the same revealed preferences, the one with greater MPerror will more likely chafe at the party line, and so the coefficient on MPerror should be positive. The first hypothesis also implies positive coefficients for Weldonunity and sdWeldonunity.            "
"38","Three independent variables address an aspect of ambition. The first, MPdistance, is standardized distance from the MP's two‐dimensional OC score to that of her party, measured as distance‐meandistance.19 This variable directly tests our second hypothesis, according to which legislators whose ideal points are relatively far from those of their parties should be more likely to switch, and should thus take a positive coefficient. The second ambition‐related variable, ingovernment, is a dummy equal to 1 if the MP's party is in government and 0 if not. We expect the coefficient for ingovernment to be negative, in line with the notion that membership in a government party has its rewards. The last variable tapping ambition is partysize—the average number of party members per vote, for each switchperiod that the deputy was in the party. We expect the coefficient for this variable to be negative as well, since larger parties should be better able than smaller parties to influence outcomes, win seats, and garner policy (or other) rewards. Finally, we include as a control a dummy for whether the deputy belonged to the motley gruppo misto, where unity (however measured) should be low and switchers should be relatively common. Because the gruppo misto is fundamentally different from other party groups in purpose as well as composition, we hold no expectations about the sign of its coefficient.20"
"39"," Table 3 shows the results of our logit estimation of willswitch for each of the four legislatures in our dataset. The table's rightmost column reports on our fixed‐effects estimation with legislature dummies. At first blush, the first hypothesis, on the positive relationship between discipline and switching, receives substantial though not unequivocal support. For one term and for the pooled estimation, the coefficients of all four proxies for discipline have the expected sign and are significant. For two terms, three proxies perform as held in the first hypothesis. Yet in the 12th Legislature the coefficients for three of four indices of discipline confound expectations.            "
"40","Similarly, a preliminary assessment discloses somewhat patchy evidence on the measures tapping ambition, MPdistance, ingovernment, and partysize. Our key variable for testing the second hypothesis, MPdistance, should have a positive and significant coefficient. This expectation is borne out in three legislatures. For the 13th, the coefficient of MPdistance is negative and insignificant, however, and in the pooled estimation the coefficient has the right sign but is insignificant. The findings on government status and party size—which do not directly address our hypotheses but express the centrality of ambition to our theoretical framework—also are mixed. The coefficient for ingovernment is negative and significant, in line with expectations, only in the 13th Legislature; in the pooled estimation it is negative and almost attains statistical significance at conventional levels. In the 11th and 12th legislatures, by contrast, that coefficient is positive—against expectations. The wrong sign on the coefficient for partysize shows up in the 10th and 11th Legislatures.            "
"41","Apparently patchy evidence notwithstanding, a closer look suggests that the forces driving switching are consistent with central elements of the logic here. To make sense of the data, not least in light of the tremendous changes in Italy in the span covered, we both hone in on variations across legislative terms and interpret the coefficient of one variable in relation to the coefficients of others."
"42","Consider once more the impact of discipline on switching. Except for the 12th Legislature, the closer party members' revealed preferences are on average to the party ideal point, the more likely an MP in that party is to switch: by the light of meandistance, tightly bound MPs tend to jump to free themselves from discipline, as posited. Except for the 11th Legislature, the greater the variability around the individual's revealed preferences, the greater the likelihood that the MP will switch: MPs who require discipline, as identified by MPerror, rebel by changing party. Except for the 13th Legislature, highly unified party voting (as expressed in Weldonunity) pushes MPs to switch; and except for the 12th, high variance in unified party voting (sdWeldonunity) does the same. The different facets of discipline do not always work in tandem, indicators for them are distinct, and results need to be evaluated in context. It makes sense that when—as in the 11th Legislature—switchers flee parties characterized by extremely low mean distance and extreme swings in unified voting, and switchers' own ideals lie very far (as indexed by MPdistance) from those of their original party, switchers also exhibit relatively low, not high, variability in their ideals (low MPerror): faced with a relatively distasteful party line that is drawn in the sand, MPs whose votes cluster closely to their distinct ideals tend to move. On the other hand, when—as in the 13th term—switchers exit parties with low mean distance and high variance in unified voting and yet also parties with low levels of unified voting, the distance between an MP's ideals and those of her party (MPdistance) matters little for switching: with all other facets of strong discipline spurring switching, loose party voting erodes the connection between an MP's divergent preferences and her propensity to switch. Yet almost all aspects of discipline in the 12th Legislature operate against expectations. It is time to proceed term by term.            "
"43","In the 10th Legislature (1987–92) and the 11th (1992–94), unlike later, MPs tended to change party en bloc. The second largest parliamentary group at the opening of the 10th term, the longstanding opposition Italian Communist Party (PCI), in 1991 split into the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and Communist Refounding (RC). This historic rupture dominated switching in the 10th Legislature, although, for example, RC drew what had been the tiny band of Proletarian Democrats (DP) and the misto saw movement (cf. Verzichelli 1996). While not all MPs (more precisely, in our data, not all deputy‐switchperiod‐party combinations) from the opposition switched, all switchers included in our estimation came from the opposition and none from the governing parties. Thus, 8,300 observations on governing MPs (that is, deputy‐switchperiod‐party combinations) are dropped; in this sense, our prediction about the incentives to stick with ruling parties is all too successful.21 Confining attention to the ranks of the opposition, our model accounts well for who switches and who does not. The one item upsetting expectations has to do with party size: MPs migrated to smaller parties, not larger, as the PCI, undeterred by pure PR—and under stress with the collapse of communist regimes—broke in two.            "
"44","The 11th Legislature was engulfed by the vast corruption scandal that broke open in Italy in 1992. Fully one‐quarter of the MPs elected in 1992 were under official investigation for abuse of office by late 1993, and the bulk of the MPs embroiled in the scandal came from Italy's longstanding governing parties (Ricolfi 1993). Reflecting these pressures, the party that had ruled Italy continuously since 1946, also the largest party since 1946, the Christian Democrats (DC), split in early 1994. Overall, in the 11th Legislature, the preponderance of switching originated in governing parties and in particular owed to the dissolution of the large DC (although the opposition Northern League, for instance, also witnessed a few switches). In these circumstances, the governing party leaders who strove to impose unity (recall very low meandistance) at times failed spectacularly (very high sdWeldonunity). In these circumstances, too, MPs whose ideals diverged greatly from those of their parties, and who consistently expressed their ideals in votes (low, not high, MPerror), moved in efforts to save their careers. The unexpected signs on the coefficients for ingovernment and partysize are thus understandable. True, pure PR was abandoned at roughly midterm, which should have pushed MPs toward larger parties; but the two chunks of the former DC apparently hoped that the new hybrid laws would favor them (Katz 2001).22"
"45","After the 1994 elections, the first held under the hybrid laws, MPs began switching as individuals rather than in groups. Despite frequent solo moves in both the 12th (1994–96) and 13th (1996–2001) legislatures, different factors underpin switching in the two terms. Specifically, the 12th stands out for the failure of discipline to generate switching as predicted. In a way, however, this is not surprising, since party leaders and members were learning to play by new rules. Even more, new parties, party leaders, and members entered the Chamber in 1994. The largest party in the 12th Legislature was Forza Italia (FI), founded a mere two months before the 1994 elections by a (former) nonpolitician who after the elections became premier. Other new parties entered the fray, as political entrepreneurs responded to the incentives of new electoral laws, and established parties opened up recruitment channels. In consequence, an extraordinary 70.8% of MPs took their seats for the first time in 1994 (Verzichelli 1996, 141). Discipline per se did not fall apart in this context (e.g., the mean of Weldonunity in the 12th resembles that in other terms, as seen in the appendix); what did fail, again, was the usual logic of party‐level conditions triggering switches. Operating instead as predicted are the individual‐level attributes we isolate: MPs whose votes roamed rather widely around their own ideals and whose preferences stood far from party ideals tended to hop parties. Finally, the fact that MPs exited governing parties reflected above all the reorganization and renaming of the Northern League, an increasingly restive member of the center‐right ruling coalition until it toppled the cabinet in late 1994.            "
"46","The 1996 elections reaffirmed the trend to bipolar competition under the hybrid laws and tilted the balance of power in favor of the center‐left bloc, so that the largest party in the 13th Legislature was the Democratic Left (DS), the former PDS, itself in turn the majority of the former PCI. The first center‐left coalition thus took office in post–World War II Italy. With post‐Communists in the executive throughout the term, the determinants of switching largely comport with our hypotheses. The departures from our argument are all tied to the Mixed Group and deserve disentangling with care. The incorrect sign on the relationship between unified party voting and switching reflects just which groups had relatively low or middling Weldonunity in the 13th term; the Mixed Group belonged to former category, and the Christian Democratic Center (CCD), Italian Renewal (RI), and the Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR) belonged to the latter. Switching emptied out the CCD, RI, and UDR, as rules on group size forced the few remaining loyalists from each into the misto. The Mixed Group nearly quadrupled in size in the 13th term (Heller and Mershon 2005, 551), even taking into account the many switchers who merely paused in the misto en route to join or help found some other group. With loosely unified voting, ideological diversity, and many temporary members characterizing the Mixed Group, it mattered little whether a switcher's ideals diverged from those of her group.23"
"47","The pooled estimation confirms that the evidence on switching largely meets our expectations. All facets of discipline work as we posit to motivate switching. The coefficient on MPdistance is positive as predicted but does not attain statistical significance, given the dominance of the 13th Legislature in available data on MPdistance (see the appendix). At the same time, each of the legislature dummies takes on a positive and significant coefficient: even accounting for the forces that drive switching as we posit, switching in the 11th, 12th, and 13th legislatures retains elements of a distinct dynamic.            "
"48","It is in many ways surprising how well our model can account for party switching in what amount to fundamentally different legislative party systems. Excluding the special case of the gruppo misto, no party group represented at the outset of the 10th Legislature existed in the 12th Legislature. Further, only one party group from the 11th Legislature—the CCD, a product of the DC's split—held seats in the 13th Legislature. Our study thus encompasses a total of 41 party groups over the four terms studied. The capacity of our reasoning to account for switching is remarkable given the number of parties and the shift in party systems captured.24"
"49","Intraparty dissension is normal. It is unrealistic to expect members of the same party to hold the same views on all—or even most—issues. Juxtaposed with the conventional wisdom on discipline, this yields a conundrum: why would members of a party acquiesce to disciplinary lashings? If nothing else, dissenting members can always leave their party (Hirschman 1970); they might not want to, for any number of reasons, but the option always exists. In fact, in Italy deputies appear to both see the possibility of switching and take liberal advantage of it. While some of the switching was involuntary, as pivotal resignations from small party groups forced their dissolution, with remaining members moving into the gruppo misto, most was not. What does party discipline mean in light of MPs' willingness to avail themselves of the exit option?         "
"50","To answer this question, we examined links among legislative voting, party discipline, and party switching in the Italian Chamber of Deputies from 1988 to 2000. We showed a predictable, albeit counterintuitive, link between party discipline and MPs' propensity to switch. On the whole, more disciplined parties saw more switching. MPs whose ideals stood farthest from those of the collective preferences of their parties switched the most."
"51","The upheaval and transformation of Italian politics during the span we study present a stiff challenge to our hypotheses. Our premise is to take switching seriously. We seek to discover whether a general argument can hold even as conditions vary across legislative terms and even under extreme conditions and can still illuminate politics in a given place. Again, it is remarkable how well our reasoning identifies the motivations underpinning party switching in what amount to different party systems operating under different electoral laws. True, the first postreform legislature was to some extent anomalous, but even then switchers recognized the Duvergerian incentive to bandwagon into larger, more viable parties in order to ensure reelection; and, as stressed, the individual‐level attributes we highlight functioned as expected to spur switching. The favorable findings carry weight precisely because Italy is a hard case."
"52","Party membership clearly matters and, in keeping with generally accepted truths about parliamentary versus presidential systems, party unity seems to be much greater in the Italian Chamber than in the U.S. Congress. Discipline is neither constant nor overwhelming, however. Dissension exists, and sometimes MPs find it worthwhile to turn a deaf ear to the blandishments of their parties. When they do, their party leaders can impose costs for breaking discipline. Deputies for whom these costs weigh too heavily can always exit. Moreover, when just a few new MPs can move a party group from the sidelines into the thick of the political game, parties are likely to compete for the attention and allegiance of potential switchers. That means three things. First, switching is not only possible but likely is also attractive. Second, inasmuch as avoidance of discipline motivates switching, strong party discipline should be one of the first casualties of high switching rates. And third, party leaders' strategic decisions to set discipline hold considerable interest and provide fuel for future research."
