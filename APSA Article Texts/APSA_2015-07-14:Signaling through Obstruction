"1","Obstruction is a time‐honored legislative tradition that comes in many forms, including committee gatekeeping, the filibuster, and abstention.3 While prior work has considered the potential signaling role, or “informational value,” of obstruction, much of this work has focused on sending a message about the content of the legislation.4 This focus, while natural, differs in important ways from the arguments and analysis presented here, in which the content of the proposal is known and cannot be affected by efforts to obstruct. First and foremost among these differences is that the policy content of the legislation is at least potentially knowable by multiple legislators and all legislators presumably care at least a little about it.         "
"2","In the theory presented in this article, on the other hand, what is unknown to the voter is an idiosyncratic characteristic of the legislator. In a sense, there is monopoly control over this information: It can be signaled or conveyed only by the legislator through his or her statements of behavior. In addition, I consider a setting in which this characteristic is a valence attribute in the sense that every legislator would prefer to be perceived as being a “high type.”         "
"3","As opposed to “delay,” which is a relatively uncontroversial notion, “obstruction” is a somewhat ambiguous concept. For example, in the presence of asymmetric information, obstruction can be driven solely by rational bargaining motivations (Myerson and Satterthwaite 1983; Admati and Perry 1987; McKelvey and Page 2002; Powell 2006). Standing at the other extreme, I argue in this article that obstruction might be driven by career concerns that can be independent of the policy being obstructed. Of course, “career concerns” is actually a broad category of motivations, so I now briefly discuss a few examples.         "
"4","While I frame this argument in terms of reelection motivations—the legislator can use obstruction to signal his or her type to the legislator's constituents, the insights from the theory apply to any individual or group that can bestow or withhold some individual reward to the legislator. My choice to frame the theoretical argument in terms of the canonical electoral accountability framework in which a voter attempts to control an incumbent politician is purely stylistic—it links the argument with its intellectual antecedents5 and keeps language simpler. That said, it is worthwhile to quickly run through a couple of other “principals” to whom incumbents might be attempting to signal something through engaging in obstruction.            "
"5","It is simple to reinterpret the model by relabeling the “voter,” who chooses whether to reelect or replace the incumbent, with a “donor” who can choose whether to donate to the incumbent's reelection bid or not (e.g., Koger and Victor 2009). And, indeed, both interest groups and firms lobby in ways that are sensitive to, and take advantage of, opportunities for obstruction (e.g., Victor 2007; McKay 2011). Incumbents can potentially use obstruction tactics even in “lost cause” situations to signal their fealty to an industry or interest that might provide financial or logistical support for the incumbent's reelection bid.               "
"6","Also, not every incumbent is in the majority, and the minority party often has a collective incentive to engage in obstruction, but the individual incentives to do so may be weak, creating a collective action problem. Thus, one could relabel the voter in this model as some intra‐legislative principal, such as the incumbent's party leadership (e.g., Posler and Rhodes 1997). In such an interpretation an incumbent's “obstruction” can take many forms, ranging from the obvious (such as filibustering and employing other dilatory tactics) to the more subtle (such as harassing the majority party and engaging in partisan attacks in the media). Engaging in such activities can be interpreted, among other ways, as signaling the legislator's resolve to back the party line and/or fidelity to the party's platform and principles. Doing so yields a more explicit model of the day‐to‐day and election‐to‐election relationship between rank‐and‐file legislators and party leaders in models akin to those examined by Cox and McCubbins (1993, 2005) and Patty (2008).               "
"7","Recently, several scholars have begun “unpacking” U.S. political parties and recognizing that any major political party is actually a remarkably dispersed and heterogeneous amalgam of donors, activists, and officeholders (Masket 2011). From the grandest matters, such as presidential nominations (Cohen, Karol, Noel, and Zaller 2009), to the more everyday matters of coalition management (e.g., Karol 2009), it is simple to replace the “voter” with something more closely tied to elites, interest groups, and other “policy demanders” (Bawn, Cohen, Karol, Masket, Noel, and Zaller 2012; Noel 2013).               "
"8","The fact that the theory presented in this article is highly portable—that it can speak to multiple potential audiences whose beliefs about legislators might create an incentive for inefficient obstruction—obviously broadens the empirical applicability of the model, but it also leads to a theoretical conclusion about representation. In particular, the model implies a well‐known but often unexplored conclusion about the difficulty of ensuring that an agent who has multiple principals can be held accountable to any one of those principals. In the context of an elected representative living in a world with political parties, policy demanders, donors, and—of course—constituents, the legislator's behavior while in office might be “aimed at” any one or more of these potential principals. This reality is arguably at the heart of various honored arguments regarding the best way to achieve “responsible government.” Many scholars have argued that political parties are the heart of such a solution (Ranney 1954; Cox and McCubbins 1993, 2005; Aldrich 1995; Jones and McDermott 2004; Lebo, McGlynn, and Koger 2007) and, while many have noted that this solution itself has many problems (Cutler 1988; Sundquist 1988; Fiorina 1996; Bovitz and Carson 2006) and others have noted that only the barest forms of accountability may be impossible to achieve (Riker 1982; Fearon 1999), the theory presented here adds a layer to the conundrum. Not only might achieving accountability require inefficient behaviors, the reality that legislators may seek rewards from multiple audiences can exaggerate this incentive. In other words, in the real world, incumbents are potentially signaling multiple “dimensions” of their type. The degree to which they support a given position on a given issue, the degree to which they are willing to stand with their party, and of course the lengths they are willing to go to on behalf of their constituents are only three among many possible characteristics that an incumbent might want to signal about himself or herself.               "
"9","While I strive for clarity and parsimony and accordingly describe the behavior in question as “obstruction,” it should be remembered that the key characteristic of obstruction in this framework is only that it is per se inefficient. In other words, the behavior described by this theory might appear nothing like active obstruction all: It could encompass policy entrepreneurship on issues upon which the incumbent's individual efforts are clearly ineffective,6 appearing at ribbon‐cuttings back in the district, showing up on the Sunday news programs or the late night talk shows, or—somewhat ironically—spending time talking about how he or she is not attempting to obstruct, one could directly apply the logic and comparative statics laid out here to any type of “expressive” or more generally non‐instrumental behavior that incumbents may engage in in pursuit of establishing their bona fides with their constituents.         "
"10","Linking the insights from this model with the empirical literature on Congress and legislatures in general, the model provides a general yet parsimonious theoretical basis for the long‐recognized reality that pursuit of reelection can induce incumbents to engage in inefficient activities (Mayhew 1974).7 More specifically, given the conception of these activities as themselves playing no part in the legislative process, the model provides a signaling logic of “home style” activities (Fenno 1978).         "
"11","This “home style” conception of the model suggests one interpretation of what the incumbent is attempting to signal to his or her constituents—that is, what it is that the incumbent's type represents: knowledge of his or her constituents' preferences. In this interpretation, a “high type” incumbent is one who recognizes that the constituents would prefer a different policy than the one that the incumbent is attempting to obstruct and a “low type” is an incumbent who does not realize this. For example, former Senator Jesse Helms was famous for delaying appointments,8 holding up funding,9 and attempting to delay treaties,10 and oftentimes in pursuit of policies unrelated to the matters at hand. From the other side of the aisle, Senator Russell Feingold was also renowned for obstruction: temporarily filibustering reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act in 2006, and two years later, joining with Senator Chris Dodd in an attempt to block the FISA Amendments Act of 2008.               "
"12","A second interpretation of the incumbent's type is as a willingness to fight for the district in future situations in which the obstruction might ultimately be successful. That is, obstruction might signal the strength of the incumbent's preferences on the issue (e.g., Bawn and Koger 2008). At least some incumbents' behaviors during the federal government shutdown in 2013 can be described in these terms: some members of the GOP were attempting to signal the lengths to which they would go to repeal Obamacare. Even if there was no realistic chance that the GOP could defund Obamacare in 2013, and the government shutdown benefited very few voters, it is exactly this costliness that allowed incumbents to credibly signal the strength of their opposition to Obamacare—and thus the price they would be willing to pay to overturn it in the future if the prospects of successfully repealing it improved—by going along with the temporary shutdown.               "
"13","By adopting the rather stark assumption that obstruction is a lost cause in policy terms, the theory is consistent with obstruction that stems action on a policy that is completely unrelated to the “cause” trumpeted by the incumbent. This interpretation is particularly relevant when one considers the use of obstruction to get an issue onto the agenda: history is replete with examples of incumbents fighting for what at the time were clearly lost causes on issues such as abortion, campaign finance reform, civil liberties, civil rights, school prayer, and so on.11 Indeed, such an interpretation is consistent with an incumbent obstructing a policy that he or she (and, indeed, possibly his or her constituents) actually benefit from in pursuit of taking stand on some other issue. That is, the theory can explain behavior such as an incumbent (say) holding up funding for a program that benefits his or her district—the explanation offered here is that because such behavior is (clearly) costly to the incumbent, this costliness provides credibility for the sincerity of the stance he or she adopts during the obstruction.               "
"14","Of course, any form of obstruction might ultimately have instrumental benefits, but this possibility does not overturn the fundamental conclusions of the theory provided here. When obstruction can be instrumentally useful by, for example, yielding a compromise on the issue at hand, then the electoral incentive for obstruction at least partially reduces to the incentive for implementing policy change. Furthermore, if obstruction is reasonably seen as potentially affecting policy outcomes, then it is not surprising that constituents might reward even ultimately unsuccessful obstruction (e.g., Bawn and Koger 2008). Put another way, we already have a ready and portable explanation for obstruction when there is some possibility that it might succeed.         "
"15","Accordingly, it is exactly in situations in which, as described by the quotes from Senators McCain and Murkowski provided above, obstruction is seen as a lost cause from the outset that we are in need of a theory of whether and how reelection motivations might rationalize what is apparently inefficient behavior. Unsuccessful obstruction is potentially inefficient for at least two reasons. First, public obstruction carries opportunity costs: The incumbent (and the legislature as a whole) could be handling other pressing and policy‐relevant business instead of being held up by the obstruction. Second, incumbents who engage in obstruction risk being seen as difficult partners for subsequent legislative activities, potentially damaging their ability to secure benefits for their constituents in later legislative compromises. When one or both of these inefficiencies are potentially at play, then, it is reasonable to suppose that one reason for the obstruction is the incumbent's desire to send a message to his or her constituents. The theory provided in this article formalizes and characterizes this possibility.         "
"16","In contrast with the bargaining strength family of explanations for obstruction, the argument forwarded in this article revolves around the incentives induced by the presence of an observer, or “audience,” who is at least more distant from, if not completely outside of, the policy process. In this way, the argument is related to that put forward by Groseclose and McCarty (2001). A key distinction between Groseclose and McCarty's argument and the logic underpinning the theory presented here is that Groseclose and McCarty focus upon the incentives that coarse (“veto”) signaling to a third, outside party, (e.g., the voter) can present to one player (e.g., the president) and how those incentives then infect the incentives of a second player (e.g., “Congress”) when choosing a policy proposal. This is an interesting and important question, and Groseclose and McCarty's theory offer a succinct explanation for a variety of phenomena, including the observation of proposals that are known a priori to be facing certain veto by the president. Thus, it predicts that obstruction will be knowingly “invited” by a strategic proposer in certain situations.               "
"17","The argument advanced here accordingly considers the flip side of this problem, in a sense. Consider a proposal that is known a priori to be certain to go into effect. That is, I consider the stark (but not unrealistic) case of a fait accompli proposal: obstruction of the proposal will merely delay, but otherwise not alter, the policy in question. In such cases, I show that even when obstruction is costly to the obstructer in policy terms, significant obstruction can occur in equilibrium because of the signaling value of this delay. Furthermore, and somewhat ironically, such obstruction in equilibrium is possible precisely because the act of obstruction is costly to the legislator.               "
"18","The theory is based on a simple stylized setting involving a legislator, L, and a voter V. The legislator is confronted by some exogenous proposal and must choose when to acquiesce to it. The legislator is simply choosing how long to delay what is otherwise a fait accompli. Furthermore, to make the theory's implications as stark as possible, delay is assumed to be costly to both the legislator and the voter: from a purely instrumental standpoint, delay is inefficient. However, while delay is always costly to the legislator, the degree to which it is costly depends on the legislator's type, which is unobserved by the voter. In other words, some legislators pay a larger cost from delay than others.         "
"19","The degree to which a legislator cares about delay is in some sense a measure of his or her toughness, ability to stand his or her ground, or “commitment to the cause.” The voter doesn't like delay in this instance, but does prefers to be represented by a representative who is tough, perhaps because this toughness will be instrumentally useful for the voter in a future bargaining situation. Accordingly, in spite of the fact that delay is inefficient in the current situation, the unobserved differences between the legislators and the voter's desire to be represented by a tough legislator lead to the possibility that delay in the current situation can be deployed as a credible signal of the legislator's type to the voter. In fact, if legislators desire reelection, such signaling will occur in equilibrium."
"20","The legislator's choice is denoted by  where d represents accepting the proposal after a delay of d periods (so that  represents immediate acceptance). The legislator has a type, , that is observed only by the legislator. In general, I denote the cumulative distribution function that characterizes the distribution of t by . For the purposes of tractability and parsimony, I focus on the special baseline case in which the legislator's type is distributed according to the Uniform[0, 1] distribution.12"
"21","Prior to making his or her decision about how long to delay, d, the legislator observes his or her type, t. Then, L chooses how long to delay, d, and this choice is observed by a voter, V, who cares about d and the legislator's type, t. The voter V then infers t from d, and chooses whether to reelect () or replace () the legislator. The voter's payoff is                  "
"22","A perfect Bayesian equilibrium in this model essentially involves consistency between the voter's beliefs and the incumbent's incentives. The voter's vote decision is almost trivial, given his or her beliefs.15 Accordingly, one side of equilibrium in this model is how the length of the incumbent's delay affects the voter's beliefs about the incumbent's type: This effect is endogenous and simultaneously determines which types of the incumbent will find it profitable to obstruct, and for how long. In equilibrium, the voter's beliefs must be correct in the sense that any behavior observed by the voter must be correctly ascribed to the various potential types of the incumbent who pursue that behavior.               "
"23","Because all incumbent types seek reelection, the voter can either reelect or not (i.e., the reward  is binary) and because this is an adverse selection problem, it is generically the case that the voter can not credibly randomize his or her choice of reward (Fearon 1999), the voter will in equilibrium utilize a “cut‐point” strategy, in which the voter retains the legislator if and only if the incumbent delays at least  periods. This is because the voter prefers incumbents who have lower marginal costs of delay. Given the voter is using such a rule, and conditional on the challenger's appeal (ρ), the incumbent's reelection motivations, (β) and—most importantly—the incumbent's privately observed type, t, the incumbent will choose to either delay exactly  periods, or immediately capitulate and not delay at all.16 The following proposition describes the equilibrium of the baseline model in terms of the voter's cut‐point strategy.17                                    "
"24","Proposition 1.In equilibrium, the voter reelects the incumbent if , defined as follows:                        "
"25","                  "
"26","Proof.Contained in the online appendix."
"27","Inspection of Equation 2 verifies that Proposition 1 has three implications. First, because  when , obstruction will occur only when the challenger is sufficiently appealing to the voter. One interpretation of this is that delay occurs only when the challenger has a higher ex ante appeal to the voter than the incumbent does. Put another way, the equilibrium is consistent with electorally strong incumbents not obstructing.               "
"28","Second, and relatedly, the proposition implies that, when delay occurs, its length is increasing in the appeal of the challenger to the voter, ρ. Thus, in line with the first implication discussed above, the amount of obstruction pursued by an incumbent who chooses to delay is increasing in the challenger's ex ante relative electoral strength. When the challenger is very appealing to the voter, and the incumbent decides to obstruct, the incumbent will pursue a lengthy delay.               "
"29","Finally, the third implication of the proposition is that, when obstruction occurs, its length is increasing in the strength of the legislator's reelection motivations, β. This implication is testable (presuming that one can find a proxy for the strength of reelection motivations), and, in addition, has significant welfare implications. In particular, while the (extrinsic and intrinsic) rewards from office can serve to motivate legislators to exert effort on behalf of their constituents, these motivations can also undermine voter welfare. The distinction between these two seemingly contradictory effects is both important and portable: Strengthened selectively awarded reelection motivations are beneficial from the voter's perspective when attempting to mitigate an incumbent's moral hazard problem, but they can be detrimental to the voter's expected welfare when the voter is confronted with an adverse selection problem.18 I now turn to the implications of Proposition 1 for the probability of obstruction occurring at all.               "
"30","The second and third of the implications discussed above are conditioned on obstruction occurring. This follows from the fact that this is an adverse selection problem: the incumbent knows his or her type and when this type is too low (and the challenger's appeal is sufficiently large) his or her cost of the delay required to secure reelection will exceed his or her value of reelection, so that the incumbent will immediately capitulate. The following corollary describes the probability that the incumbent capitulates in equilibrium, which I denote by .                  "
"31","Corollary 1.In equilibrium, the probability that the incumbent capitulates is                        "
"32","                  "
"33","Proof.Contained in the online appendix."
"34","The implications of Corollary 1 complement those of Proposition 1 in the following two ways. First, it highlights a nonmonotonicity in the frequency of delay as a function of the challenger's appeal. When the challenger has low appeal to the voter (), the incumbent will always capitulate () and win the election with certainty. However, when the challenger is sufficiently appealing to the voter, the probability of capitulation drops to zero and then increases linearly as the challenger becomes more appealing. This is pictured in Figure 1.               "
"35","The figure illustrates the two indirect motivations for capitulation: when the challenger's appeal is sufficiently low ), the incumbent will win even if he or she does not obstruct, because the incumbent's ex ante expected type is higher than the challenger's appeal. Accordingly, because the incumbent finds obstruction costly, all incumbents will capitulate. On the other hand, when the challenger's appeal is very high (), most incumbents will find the requisite obstruction, , more costly than the value of winning reelection, β. In these situations, most incumbents will immediately capitulate, but capitulation will lead to electoral defeat, unlike when the challenger has sufficiently low electoral appeal.               "
"36","The second implication of Corollary 1 is that, unlike the length of delay, the probability of capitulation is invariant to the legislator's bonus from retention, β. Thus, if the incumbent becomes more reelection‐motivated (β increases), the length of delay will increase, but its frequency does not change. This is a substantively important conclusion because it implies that, to the degree that one concludes that obstructionism within Congress has increased in frequency, the baseline model indicates that the cause of the increased frequency of obstructionism must be the electoral appeal of challengers, not an exogenous increase in incumbents' desire to secure reelection. This empirical implication of the baseline model is particularly interesting in light of the recent debate about the sources of the recent increase in polarization within Congress.19 In particular, to the degree that polarization is correlated with obstruction, this model implies that untangling whether a factor such as redistricting or campaign finance is playing a role in this should consider the effect that the factor has on the electoral appeal of the candidates that subsequently emerge to challenge Congressional incumbents.               "
"37","I now turn to consider the effects of the challenger's electoral appeal on the voter's expected welfare."
"38","In the equilibrium described by , the expected value of the type of a legislator who is retained after engaging in obstruction is equal to ρ, the appeal of the challenger, whenever  and equal to 1/2 otherwise. With this in hand, the voter's expected equilibrium payoff as a function of ρ is as follows:20                        "
"39","Note that  is a convex function of ρ.21 Thus, the voter's ex ante equilibrium expected payoff is maximized on  either by  or . Comparing these payoffs:            "
"40","This is a relatively unsurprising result upon a moment's reflection, as in both  and , immediate capitulation occurs with probability one, though for different reasons: when , the incumbent need not delay in order to secure reelection, and when , the incumbent can not “delay enough” to secure reelection and hence does not delay. Thus, the only effect of ρ on the comparison between these two corner solutions occurs through the induced selection effect of ρ, which operates in these two cases as “would you prefer to retain the incumbent with certainty, or would you prefer to have a perfect replacement with certainty?” The answer to this question in this stylized environment is obvious: The voter's welfare is maximized by having a perfect challenger with whom to replace the incumbent in the second period.         "
"41","Of course, the “perfect challenger” is an unrealistic threshold. Accordingly, and without adding too much baggage to the model, one might think of a more realistic problem for the voter as follows. Suppose that the voter is confronted with a set of possible challengers that are less than perfect, from which he or she can select the challenger (in the first period) with whom the incumbent will be confronted in the election. Formally, suppose that the voter is constrained with respect to choosing , where  is exogenously determined. The convexity of  with respect to ρ illustrated above indicates that the optimal choice for the voter is either  or .         "
"42","Comparing  with , straightforward algebra confirms that the voter should choose  whenever            "
"43","Inequality 5 leads to the following proposition.            "
"44","Proposition 2.Suppose that the voter can choose a challenger with either value  or value . The voter prefers the more appealing challenger, , if                  "
"45","The conclusions of Proposition 2 highlight the differential impacts of using obstruction as a screening device. Intuitively, if delay is not too costly to the voter—i.e., δ is small—then the voter's cost from obstruction by high quality incumbents is also small. If the importance of having a tough legislator in the future is very important—π is large—then the voter has an two‐pronged incentive to recruit and groom high quality prospective challengers. If the voter perceives the type of his or her future representative to be important, this clearly provides a direct incentive to promote high quality challengers. In addition, though, as π increases, the voter also places a higher value on the screening effect of delay by the first period incumbent. Finally, note that, for lower levels of , the voter will learn less about the type of any incumbent who is retained in equilibrium. This is because the conditional expected value of any incumbent who is retained in equilibrium is equal to . This demonstrates a somewhat subtle, but intuitive, effect of the value of challengers: more appealing challengers induce more informative/precise posterior beliefs about the true type/strength of incumbents who “do what it takes” to win reelection.         "
"46","Before considering a few “empirically motivated” extensions to the baseline model, I pause to consider the normative/welfare implications of the incumbent's cost of obstruction. Focusing for a moment only on the U.S. Senate, this is an important consideration in practical terms because of debates about the impact of various procedural realities such as holds, “silent filibusters,” “blue slips,” and, more generally, the tracking system that emerged in the 1970s that essentially allowed these less costly obstruction techniques (Den Hartog and Monroe 2011; Koger 2012; Black et al. 2014; Smith 2014), as well as debates about various mechanisms to circumvent obstruction, such as the motion to table (King, Orlando, and Rohde 2012; Smith, Ostrander, and Pope 2013) and various “nuclear/constitutional options” (Binder, Madonna, and Smith 2007). Specifically, I generalize the incumbent's payoffs as represented in Equation 1 as follows:            "
"47","It is straightforward that the voter's expected payoff—i.e., social welfare—is maximized by maximizing k: making the signal of type more marginally costly to the incumbent is in the voter's interest because the voter desires only the information/signaling value of the obstruction and dislikes the actual extent of any realized obstruction. In other words, the baseline model establishes a baseline in what is essentially a “race to the bottom” from the voter's perspective. Letting  denote the equilibrium cutoff given challenger's appeal ρ and marginal cost of delay k, and letting  denote the voter's ex ante expected equilibrium payoff, given ρ and k, the following proposition establishes that decreasing k can never make the voter better off.            "
"48","Proposition 3.For any ρ,  is weakly increasing in k. Furthermore, for any ,  is strictly increasing in k.               "
"49","Proposition 3 not only states that the voter always weakly prefers that the incumbent pay a higher marginal cost from delay—it establishes that this preference is strict whenever the probability of delay occurring is positive. That is, whenever obstruction occurs in equilibrium, expected social welfare is strictly increased by increasing the incumbent's marginal cost of obstruction.         "
"50","Putting this in substantive terms, Proposition 3 suggests that it is precisely those situations in which (say) Congressional and party leaders might seek to alter the procedures governing obstructionist efforts—situations in which obstruction is actually occurring with positive frequency—that the social welfare impact of such changes might be strictly negative. This conclusion, when partnered with the realities surrounding such changes in the 1970s in the Senate, might seem strange at first blush. After all, many of the procedural changes made filibusters less obvious to constituents. However, the logic behind these reforms might have missed a key point. While silent filibusters and secret holds arguably allow a member to avoid blame for his or her obstruction—an implication of these reforms that has not gone unnoticed ()—there is nothing about these reforms that prevents a member from claiming credit for such maneuvers. To the degree that a member wishes to be seen as obstructionist, he or she can go public in pursuing such obstruction and—in the current regime—incur a much lower marginal, day‐to‐day cost from sustaining the obstruction effort. When this is possible, the theory predicts that obstruction will increase in length when it occurs.         "
"51","I now move to consider some extensions to the baseline model. Each of these lead to predictions about empirical characteristics of both candidates and voters that might be useful in testing the basic intuition of the model."
"52","In this section, I briefly present three extensions of the model that incorporate, respectively, valence on the part of the legislator, uncertainty about the challenger's appeal, and selective attention on the part of the voter. I focus on these extensions because they are empirically and normatively proximate to the question at hand. With respect to the incumbent's valence, the theory implies that the electoral impact of strong valence for the incumbent will decrease the incentive for the incumbent to obstruct, thereby offering an empirically testable prediction that high valence incumbents will engage in less obstruction. This conclusion has normative implications, too, as it potentially amplifies the benefit a voter will enjoy from having a high valence incumbent and potentially ameliorating some of the well‐known negative welfare impact from having an incumbent who the voter can not credibly replace.22"
"53","Relaxing the assumption that the challenger's appeal is known to the incumbent more clearly indicates how reelection motivations motivate obstruction.23 I show that the voter may in many (but not all) cases benefit from the incumbent being “kept in the dark” about exactly how threatening his or her challenger in the upcoming election will be. This conclusion demonstrates one aspect of the potential strategic effects of electoral institutional features such as the procedural details and timing of candidate selection processes such as primaries and caucuses.         "
"54","Finally, incorporating selective attention by the voter into the model leads to the conclusion that it is possible that the voter's expected welfare can be improved if the voter can commit to not paying attention to the incumbent's behavior. If the voter is not paying attention to the incumbent, the incumbent has no incentive to engage in costly obstruction. I show that in some cases the voter is better off if he or she can commit to not paying attention to the incumbent's behavior. The extension illustrates the potential value from making deliberation private—grandstanding through obstruction is costly to the voter, and its value to the voter in this framework is based solely on the discrimination it provides to the voter when faced with retaining or replacing the incumbent. The voter may want to give up his or her ability to hold the incumbent accountable because incumbents are too strongly motivated by reelection to allow themselves to be discriminated between."
"55","I conceive of valence in this context in a simple fashion: The legislator may possess a priori known characteristics, such as seniority (Roberts 1990; McKelvey and Riezman 1992; Kellermann and Shepsle 2009); expertise/effectiveness (Funk 1997; Volden and Wiseman 2009); ideological proximity/congruence (Burden 2004; Stone and Simas 2010; Adams et al. 2011), or simple old fashioned “public appeal,” which the voter would necessarily forego if he or she replaces the incumbent. Thinking of valence in this idiosyncratic, candidate‐centered fashion, and representing the legislator's valence by an exogenous parameter , one can reexpress the voter's payoff as follows:               "
"56","Following the logic of the baseline model, it is straightforward to derive that the efficient equilibrium in this this extension is characterized by the following cut point:               "
"57","It is simple to extend the model to incorporate the possibility that the incumbent does not know the appeal of his or her challenger. In reality, of course, incumbents are frequently charged with carrying out their duties prior to knowing who will ultimately challenge them in the subsequent election. The simplest case of such an extension treats the ultimate challenger's appeal, ρ, as an exogenous random variable. Suppose that the challenger's appeal, ρ, and the incumbent's type, t, are each drawn independently from the Uniform[0, 1] distribution and the sequence of play is as follows: the incumbent realizes his or her type, t, and then chooses how much to delay, d, without knowing the challenger's appeal, ρ. Following this choice, the challenger's type, ρ, and the incumbent's choice of delay, d, are each observed by the voter, who then chooses whether to retain the incumbent () or not (). The game then concludes. Both players' payoffs are identical to those in the baseline model.            "
"58","The following proposition describes when the expected extent of obstruction is lower in this case than when the challenger's type is known prior to the incumbent choosing how long to obstruct.               "
"59","Proposition 4.Suppose the challenger's type is drawn from a Uniform [0, 1] distribution after the incumbent chooses how much to delay. Then the expected length of delay is lower than when the challenger's type is observed by the incumbent beforehand if                     "
"60","The range of challenger's appeals in which the expected delay is decreased by the incumbent not observing the challenger's appeal spans from approximately 0.61 to 0.89. Remember that the incumbent always capitulates immediately if . Thus, for a wide range of challenger appeals (more than 50% of the pertinent parameter region), the expected length of delay is strictly lower if the incumbent does not know the challenger's appeal to the voter when choosing how much to obstruct. This conclusion provides the basis for an interesting argument in favor of “unknown” challengers. From an institutional perspective (albeit one that neglects strategic candidacy/career concerns by potential challengers), the argument favors late filing deadlines. However, the conclusion is based only upon a short‐run concept—the expected length of delay by the current incumbent of unknown type—rather than overall voter welfare, which properly encompasses the (future‐rewarded) selection effects of the incumbent's choice in addition to the direct immediate costs of obstruction by the incumbent. I now turn to the question of when a forward‐looking voter is best served by keeping the challenger's appeal hidden from the incumbent.            "
"61","As mentioned above, the analysis in Proposition 4 restricts its scope to a comparison of expected delay length by the current incumbent. This is an important, but not exclusive, component of the voter's ex ante welfare. Specifically, the voter may prefer longer expected delay if it is produced by a setting in which the voter is presented with higher expected value challengers. The following proposition describes when the voter would prefer that the challenger's appeal is observed by the incumbent prior to the incumbent choosing how long to obstruct. The proof is contained in the online appendix.                  "
"62","Proposition 5.If the challenger's appeal, ρ, is distributed according to the Uniform [0, 1] distribution, the voter strictly prefers that the challenger's appeal be observed by the incumbent prior to the incumbent choosing how long to delay if                        "
"63","The principal implication of Proposition 5 is the interaction of the incumbent's reelection motivations with the voter's incentive to attempt to “discipline” the incumbent through revelation of the challenger's appeal prior to the incumbent's choice of whether and how long to obstruct. Because obstruction is costly to the voter, it is useful to the voter only to the extent that it screens out low quality incumbents with as little delay as possible. Because the incumbent's reelection motivations are assumed to be independent of the incumbent's type, strong motivations will necessarily induce lower quality incumbents to obstruct for a longer time in pursuit of reelection. This effect simultaneously reduces the value of the screening device and increases the cost of its use. Somewhat counterintuitively, then, it is in the voter's interest to have the incumbent observe exactly how demanding the challenger's electoral appeal will be precisely because, in many cases, this appeal will dissuade low quality incumbents from pursuing the requisite amount of obstruction, thereby reducing the cost imposed on the voter.               "
"64","In line with Proposition 5's focus on the voter's induced preferences about information, I now turn to the question of whether and when the voter would prefer to be “distracted” in the sense of not being able to observe the incumbent's choice of obstruction.               "
"65","Note that we can think of the legislator's expected value of reelection as being composed of two multiplicative components: a probability that the voter “pays attention” to the legislator, p, and the value of reelection, so that the legislator's payoff is as follows:24                        "
"66","The following proposition describes the voter's welfare‐maximizing level of attention, . The voter's optimal level of attention is either complete focus () or complete ignorance (). The voter benefits from not paying attention to the incumbent (and, hence, being unable to hold the incumbent “accountable”) when obstruction is very costly to the voter or the incumbent is very strongly reelection motivated.            "
"67","Proposition 6.The voter's ex ante optimal level of attention is either zero or one (). Furthermore, it is zero () if                  "
"68","The conclusions from Proposition 6 complement those of Proposition 5. Specifically, the effects of the incumbent's reelection motivations, β, the voter's value of the second‐period legislator's type, π, and the voter's cost from delay, δ, point in qualitatively opposite directions.         "
"69","Focusing on the incumbent's reelection motivation, β, and as discussed above following Proposition 5, the voter has an interest in transparency (i.e., he or she prefers that the incumbent know the challenger's appeal with certainty) when β is large, but Proposition 6 indicates that the voter also will prefer a form of opacity (i.e., he or she would prefer to not observe the incumbents' behavior) in this case. These effects are driven by the same underlying calculus: When low types of the incumbent are sufficiently motivated by reelection to incur the requisite cost of delay to obtain reelection, the voter has an interest in dissuading/demotivating the incumbent from engaging in delay. Propositions 5 and 6 indicate the subsitutability of two types of transparency in achieving this. By revealing the challenger's appeal to the incumbent, the voter can convince some low type incumbents from pursuing obstruction; by committing to not observing the incumbent's behavior, the voter reduces the incentive for all types of incumbents to engage in obstruction.         "
"70","With these welfare comparisons in hand, I now turn to a discussion of the broader conclusions to be drawn from the theory presented in this article."
"71","Obstruction is potentially informative precisely and ironically because it is inefficient. The theory presented in this article indicates that a classic argument, due to Spence (1973), can provide some traction on the dynamics of obstruction. In particular, such an argument can provide an explanation for apparently irrational costly obstruction in situations in which the obstruction is entirely foreseen to be ineffective in changing the policy or decision in question. The driving force of this explanation is the presence of an audience that the obstructor(s) are attempting to, in colloquial terms, “impress” with their fortitude.         "
"72","This signaling argument relies not only on the presence of a somewhat attentive audience, but also a positive affiliation/correlation between the type/strength/appeal of the obstructor and the individual cost he or she must bear when engaging in obstruction. Though the broader consideration of this is beyond the scope of this model, this point arguably delimits the types of situations in which obstruction can be informative to the electorate about whether they should reelect the legislator or not. In general, setting aside some expressive motivations by the voter to have a “tough” representative and focusing instead on a more instrumentally‐based model of motivations, the fortitude or strength signaled by a legislator's obstruction should be arguably linked with an ability to secure policy benefits in the future."
"73","Such a link is not tough to imagine if one presumes that the legislator, if reelected, will have the opportunity to obstruct future proposals, too. In this model, I have set aside the effect of such a possibility on the proposals that are ultimately offered—one could easily imagine that a legislator who has signaled that his or her type is high might be able to extract concessions from a time‐sensitive proposer in future negotiations."
"74","At the same time, the model presented in this article suggests a commitment problem with applying a purely policy‐bargaining model of obstruction. To see this, note that securing a policy bargain that favors one's constituents is a moral hazard problem in the sense that the voters can replace the incumbent without forfeiting the policy gains he or she secured. Accordingly, the ex ante promise by a reelection‐seeking legislator to not obstruct a policy bargain if it contains sufficient concessions to the legislator's constituents' interests is no necessarily credible: once the deal is struck, the legislator may nonetheless face an opportunity to send a signal about his or her strength to his or her constituents through (perhaps partially) reneging on the deal and obstructing the agreed‐upon proposal anyway. To the degree that such temptation is recognized by the (unmodeled) proposer, the commitment problem tempers the proposer's incentive to offer policy concessions in pursuit of a speedier resolution reward past (credible) demonstrations of the legislator's strength.         "
"75","This point makes clear the potential importance of transparency in legislative negotiations. In particular, bargaining in private might be preferable from the standpoint of the voter's welfare because it eliminates any potential gain from obstruction as modeled here. This point is complementary to the conclusions reached by Stasavage (2007), who illustrates similarly perverse effects of transparency on information aggregation (and voter welfare) in collective choice settings.25 The connection between this theory and that offered by Stasavage is informative. Stasavage provides a compelling argument for opacity when legislators might be debating “common value” matters precisely because transparency might induce some members to behave in ways that obfuscate their private information about the right choice to make. Such obfuscation inherently reduces the informedness of (and, by construction, social welfare flowing from) the ultimate collective choice. Thus, Stasavage's theory rests upon a subtle and ironic implication through which transparency destroys information. In the theory presented here, however, the efficiency loss is due to the fact that transparency of obstruction efforts leads to obstruction precisely in pursuit of providing/revealing information to the voter about something that is of interest to the voter. In the analysis of the selective attention extension in the section titled “Extensions to the Baseline Model,” it is shown that there are situations in which the voter would be better off if he or she could credibly commit to not observing the legislator, thereby removing any incentive for obstruction (albeit at the loss of some information about the legislator).         "
"76","With this contrast in mind, an interesting direction for future work is to consider the endogenous provision of transparency, conditional upon the matters under discussion. Obviously, legislatures deal with some matters concerning “common values” (e.g., general welfare, health, safety, and national security), many that are more clearly parochial, and even more that lie somewhere in between. Methods by which legislatures and legislators attempt to distinguish between and condition upon legislative business on these ground and the incentives they induce in reelection seeking legislators is an interesting topic. As the theory presented in this article indicates, studying the procedures used to deal with different matters (e.g., the strength of minority rights to advise and/or obstruct) may be substantially incomplete without considering whether the use of these procedures is observable by external audience(s) that legislators may (appropriately or inappropriately) seek to curry favor with."
