"1","The standard definition of political corruption is the abuse of public office for private gain (e.g., Jain 2001; Shleifer and Vishny 1993). This article distinguishes between two types of personal gain, cheating and looting. “Cheating” is the use of illicit means to enhance one's probability of being (re)elected. At first blush, this definition does not seem to fit easily into the traditional definition of corruption as abuse of public office for private gain. However, when one recognizes that (re)election is private gain for an individual politician, cheating fits well within more traditional conceptions of corruption, and it is even more clearly corruption in a broader sense, as cheating corrupts the democratic process by making elections less fair (cf. Warren 2004, 2006).         "
"2","“Looting” is defined as the use of public office illicitly for private material gain. Looting more closely mirrors the traditional definition of corruption, but the type of private gain is more narrow, so as to distinguish it from cheating, which is motivated by political gain. The most headline‐grabbing form of looting is the looting of public coffers—particularly political leaders directing public funds into private pockets or bank accounts, in extreme cases on the order of millions or billions of dollars. This occurs on a much smaller scale as well: there are myriad examples of small‐town mayors taking their (private) business clients to lunch at the taxpayers' expense and other similar abuses."
"3","Looting as defined here also includes the looting of private coffers. Public officials may change their behavior in the performance of their office in exchange for material resources from private actors. This may include officials engaging in extortion in the performance of their expected public office (an immigration official requiring a bribe to allow a legitimate immigrant to enter a country), officials accepting money or services for not doing their public office (a police officer taking a bribe not to write up a speeding ticket), or officials accepting money to change the manner in which they perform their office (a politician accepting money in exchange for changing his or her vote on a bill). Looting in this sense is an exchange of influence over political outcomes for material reward. Looting of both public and private coffers is driven by the potential for private material gain, while cheating is driven by potential electoral reward."
"4","The relationship between cheating and looting may be complex. Conceptually, they are distinct—corrupt behavior driven by two distinct motives (private material gain vs. electoral reward)—but there are many potential relationships between the two. On the one hand, there may be cases in which great opportunities to loot create greater incentives to cheat and opportunities to cheat allow greater opportunities to loot. On the other hand, at the level of the individual politician making a decision at a specific moment in time, the need to cheat to ensure reelection may signal a lesser capacity to loot (particularly looting private coffers). Similarly, secure, experienced politicians who have greater capacity to loot should have little incentive to cheat. This article cannot consider all of the possible relationships between cheating and looting that might potentially exist, as it appears that in Japan cheating and looting have been driven by very distinct factors.1 Instead the focus is on showing how electoral competition influences these two types of corruption differently at the level of the individual politician in Japan.         "
"5","Naturally, many of the factors the existing literature identifies as influencing corruption may affect both cheating and looting similarly. Greater freedom of the press, for example, should reduce both types of corruption by increasing the probability of any bad behavior being discovered and made public (Brunetti and Weder 2003), and stronger rule of law should limit all types of corruption by raising the costs of getting caught (Ades and Di Tella 1997; Damania, Fredriksson, and Mani 2004). However, some factors influence cheating and looting differently. Although competition may restrain corruption of both types by increasing the probability and cost of a potential scandal being discovered,2 cheating, unlike looting, also increases the candidate's vote and thus enhances her probability of being (re‐)elected. The incentives to cheat in order to win the current election may well outweigh the fear of paying a cost at the next election if the cheating were to be discovered. Thus the effects of electoral competition on looting and cheating may be quite different.3"
"6","The goal of cheating is to win the current election, and thus one can theorize about cheating based on variance in the need to use illegal methods to gain that goal.4 Both the level and type of political competition provide variation in incentives to cheat. Candidates who think they need just a few more votes to put them over the top are more likely to risk arrest than those who need either no more votes or many more votes to ensure victory.5 The incentives to cheat in order to win the current election may well outweigh the fear of paying a cost at the next election if the cheating were to be discovered. Thus cheating is a form of electioneering and more marginal candidates have greater incentive to cheat. This leads to our first hypothesis, that candidates who are on the cusp between winning and losing are more likely to cheat than those who are either assured of victory or have no chance of winning.         "
"7","                        "
"8","Candidates on the cusp between winning and losing are more likely to cheat.6"
"9","It is important to realize that this hypothesis is based on a logic that is not simply about vote margin, but primarily about the impact of a marginal vote on the subjective probability of victory. Candidates for office have a subjective estimate of their vote margin, but they must also consider their uncertainty about this estimate. As voter volatility and thus uncertainty increase, all candidates' subjective evaluations of their probability of victory are more likely to include both the possibility of losing and winning and thus their subjective marginality increases. Lower volatility leads to candidates having greater confidence in whether they will win or lose, thus lowering subjective marginality and decreasing the value placed on each marginal vote. In other words, candidates who are less certain of their predicted margin are more likely to seek insurance through greater efforts in campaigning than those who are confident in their predictions."
"10","Furthermore, it is not simply the value of each marginal vote that affects the likelihood of cheating, but the importance of cheating in order to garner that extra vote. Given a choice between two campaign practices equally effective and equally expensive but one illegal, a candidate is likely to choose the risk‐free legal practice. However, when legal campaign practices are ineffective at garnering that crucial marginal vote, candidates will be more tempted to draw on illegal practices. Intraparty competition is less likely to involve competition over issues and government responsibility and more likely to involve pork‐barrel politics and expensive personalistic appeals, increasing the demand for illegal campaign activities (Chang 2005; Katz 1986). This suggests a second hypothesis concerning cheating:         "
"11","                        "
"12","Intraparty competition is more likely to generate cheating than interparty competition."
"13","Interparty competition provides greater means for inexpensive differentiation amongst the candidates. For example, opposition candidates can always suggest that the incumbent government has performed inadequately while those in government can always try to trumpet their achievements. The range of differences candidates may use to compete with copartisans is more limited. Intraparty competition forces candidates to rely on a personal vote, which frequently evolves into an expensive “arms race” in developing personal vote‐gathering organizations (on this in Japan, see Curtis 1971). In Italy, Golden and Chang find that “charges of malfeasance against DC Deputies … tend to be positively affected by intraparty competition and that they are uncorrelated with interparty competition” (2001, 610).         "
"14","Alternatively, one might suggest that candidates may attempt to monitor each other's behavior, and thus more candidates and greater competition should serve as a deterrent to cheating (e.g., Kunicová and Rose‐Ackerman 2005). However, even by this logic, it seems reasonable to expect that monitoring should be differential by the type of competition and that intraparty competition is more likely to generate cheating. Candidates are likely to have less incentive to identify and report malfeasance by copartisans because this may invite reprisals from within the party and/or negatively affect their own probability of election as there may be negative consequences for the party vote share as a whole in the district.         "
"15","Thus marginality and intraparty competition should increase the probability of cheating. Although these hypotheses are listed separately, it is natural that they should interact. Regardless of the nature of competition, a candidate guaranteed victory has little incentive to cheat in order to gain the extra handful of votes because those votes will have no effect on her election. Similarly, a candidate who is marginal but has effective legal means of campaigning is unlikely to risk scandal by cheating."
"16","While cheating has the potential of improving a candidate's electoral fortunes, the incentives for looting are financial. While there may be many factors that influence politicians' desire to enrich themselves, the systematic influences on looting evaluated in this article are not variation in how much politicians desire money, but in the potential opportunities for and costs of looting. While political competition should increase the likelihood of cheating, it should have the opposite consequences for looting. As one of the risks of looting is the potential loss of votes (and office) if discovered, looting should be more likely to occur by those who can most afford to lose votes.7 This suggests the third hypothesis:         "
"17","                        "
"18","Candidates who are more secure are more likely to loot.8"
"19","As with marginality, security should be seen as a function not just of the expected margin of victory, but also uncertainty and volatility."
"20","While in general experienced politicians are more likely to be secure, it is not simply security that may allow senior politicians to be more corrupt. Looting is a crime of opportunity, and frequently requires access, influence, and experience. Generally speaking, only incumbents have the capacity to loot,9 but political influence is not distributed evenly amongst incumbent politicians, and those with greater political influence should have greater opportunity to loot (and may believe they are better able to get away with it). Thus         "
"21","                        "
"22","Candidates with more political influence are more likely to loot."
"23","In the period examined in Japan, conservative politicians had greater political influence, as they represented wealthier (business) interest groups and were in government the entire period. Furthermore, it seems reasonable to suggest that influence grows with seniority, and that influence is substantially greater for cabinet members and major faction leaders."
"24","From 1947 to 1993, Japan used the single nontransferable vote in multimember districts to elect their House of Representatives. Most districts elected three, four, or five members of the Diet, although there was also a single‐member district and a few two‐ and six‐member districts. Each voter voted for a single candidate and the top M candidates were declared victors (where M is the district magnitude—the number of seats in the district). This system forced any party wishing to win a majority of the Diet to run more than one candidate per district. Like the Italian electoral system used from the end of the war until 1994, it forced candidates from the same party to compete against each other, reducing the role of issues and increasing the importance of the personal vote (Carey and Shugart 1995). Campaigning in Japan was extremely expensive and, like Italy, Japan experienced high levels of corruption.         "
"25","Major corruption scandals affected the general elections of 1949, 1952, 1967, 1976, 1983, 1990, and 1993 (Reed 1996). Many implicated the political elite, including sitting, past, and future prime ministers. There was also a constant stream of allegations and arrests involving lesser lights. Much of this corruption clearly fits the looting definition. Kickbacks from construction companies, for example, appear to have been standard practice. Converting tax monies into slush funds using creative accounting techniques appears to have been the norm not only for politicians, local governments, and national bureaucrats but also the police.         "
"26","Since much of the looting had become standard practice, politicians who could weather the electoral storm and win reelection could continue their careers almost as if nothing had happened. The standard way of dealing with a scandal was to resign from the party and official posts but run again in the next election. Scandal‐tainted candidates did lose around 9,000 votes on average, even after running scared and campaigning with special intensity, but 63% were reelected. In the conservative camp, reelection was considered to be the equivalent of a democratic “absolution” (misogi) and the politician was allowed to resume her career. To take the most famous example, Tanaka Kakuei was arrested for taking bribes in the 1949 coal nationalization scandal. The coal industry paid him to change parties and vote against the coal nationalization bill. He resigned his post as Vice Minister of Justice (responsible for enforcing the law). He was convicted but the conviction had been reversed by the time of the next election. He was investigated again in connection with a construction scandal before the 1967 election but managed to avoid pressure to resign from his post as secretary‐general of the party and easily won reelection. Tanaka became Prime Minister in 1972 but another scandal forced him to resign in 1974. He expected his resignation to be temporary but was arrested in the Lockheed scandal in 1976 (MacDougall 1988). He resigned from the party and did not serve in any formal posts thereafter but continued to head the largest faction within the LDP and was, in fact, the king maker who decided who would lead the party and thus become Prime Minister (Johnson 1986). In 1983 he was convicted of bribery and sentenced, but appealed the conviction and continued to play a major role in Japanese politics until suffering a disabling stroke.         "
"27","Tanaka's story is obviously not typical but many similar, if lesser, stories could easily be told. However, although there clearly has been a substantial amount of looting in Japan, much of the political corruption in Japan has centered on improving politicians' fortunes in electoral competition and did not necessarily serve to enrich politicians. There is little evidence of a class of “businessman politicians” such as those found in Italy (della Porta 1996), and much more evidence of politicians engaging in illegal fundraising and attempts at vote buying, which is not entirely surprising given the nature of political competition and the constraints on legal mechanisms for campaigning.         "
"28","Japanese election laws are extremely detailed and restrictive (Curtis 1992). Many violations are thus relatively minor matters of putting up more posters or sending out more postcards than allowed by law. Many cases of “vote buying” involve handing out relatively inexpensive gifts embossed with the candidate's name, but other cases involve more money and are both more sinister and more effective. Outlawing door‐to‐door canvassing proved to be a good way to ensure that candidates would be tempted to break the law because the practice that has been outlawed is one of the most effective. Any organization that regularly visits its members, most notably agricultural cooperatives and religious groups, is able to skirt the law against canvassing by (illegally but undetectably) mentioning a candidate's name during the performance of their normal activities. On the other hand, there also appears to be a limit to how many votes can be bought. In 1976, for example, Shinki Kyuji set a record for money spent buying votes but finished with less than 5% of the vote (Asahi Shinbun, 26 January 1977). Other similar stories of marginal candidates spending excessive amounts of money but losing badly are not hard to find. Cheating may push a candidate over the top, turning a near‐winner into a winner, but more than money is required to win a seat.         "
"29","Strict campaign regulations tend to advantage incumbents over challengers. Incumbents have several years to advertise themselves and their positions while challengers have only a few weeks. Incumbents in Japan are well aware of this and have periodically tightened regulations regarding political finance and shortened the campaign period (McElwain 2008). The story of one “cheater” illustrates the point. In 1963 the president of a construction company, Inamura Sakonshirou, challenged the three conservative incumbents in rural Ishikawa second district, becoming the fifth conservative candidate in this three‐member district. Nine of his campaigners were arrested during the campaign for, among other violations, handing out towels and snacks to over 50 voters. After the election his wife was also arrested for vote buying and door‐to‐door canvassing. A total of 36 persons were investigated in his campaign, which proved successful by a little over 2,000 votes (1.2% of the total votes cast). The local newspaper reported his legal problems but also praised his “boundless energy” for breaking down the walls that protect incumbents from defeat (Kitakuni Shinbun 6–22 November 1963).         "
"30","Politicians in postwar Japan have engaged extensively in both looting and cheating; the extent of corruption has been as great in Japan as in almost any other developed democracy. However, it seems unlikely that the moral fiber of Japanese politicians is dramatically different from that of politicians elsewhere. Rather, political corruption in Japan has been related to the competitive pressures and distribution of temptations that politicians faced."
"31","Reliable data on corruption are difficult to come by, and since we seek to analyze the incentives for looting and cheating at the candidate level, the major cross‐national sources of data on corruption are not appropriate. Academic and newspaper articles provide information on the major corruption scandals in great detail, but data on the myriad minor scandals have yet to be collected. Data on the tens of thousands of potential election law violations which are investigated in Japan are even harder to analyze, as candidates are seldom investigated directly for election law violations. It is political secretaries and campaigners, not the candidates themselves, who are prosecuted, and nothing in the legal records allows a particular incident to be connected to a particular candidate."
"32","Unable to rely on legal records, we have relied on newspapers (a tactic also used by Cox and Kousser 1981), performing a systematic search of the Asahi Shinbun CD‐ROM. Cases of cheating are easy to code. Right after every election the newspapers report on the most notable cases of election law violations, clearly identifying them as such.10 Other corruption scandals are more diverse. There were a few sex scandals, some fraud, and a couple of abuse of power scandals, such as having the military band play to welcome the politician into his district (which are not included in this measure), but most cases fit neatly into the definition of looting. A scandal was coded as cheating if it was clearly related to illegal electoral competition (primarily vote buying). A scandal was coded as looting if it involved the illegal receipt of money which was not directly used for electoral competition. Other scandals were not included in the analyses. This method of collecting data allows consideration of cheating and looting by all candidates for the House of Representative elections for the entire 1947–1993 period. The dataset includes 16,623 observations (candidate elections), with 277 cases of newsworthy cheating (1.7% of candidates) and 186 cases of newsworthy looting (1.1% of all candidates, 1.8% of incumbents). The variation of cheating and looting over time is shown in Figure 1. As noted in the previous section, the incidence of cheating appears most widespread in the decade immediately following the end of the Occupation, with a small rise in the late 1960s as well. This measure thus captures the major trends in total election law violations quite well. Looting, on the other hand, shows little signs of a trend, except for the increase in the late 1980s with the Recruit Scandal.         "
"33","                 Cheating and Looting in Japan, 1947–1993                      "
"34"," Note: The data on cheating and looting are coded by the authors based on a systematic search of the Asahi Shinbun CD‐ROM.                     "
"35","These data on corruption are limited to scandals that are uncovered and merit reporting in newspapers. Limiting the data to those cases that were discovered and were newsworthy enough to make the national newspapers may bias the sample but several control variables in the analyses may help account for this.11 Any remaining biases in the data should be relatively minor, particularly given the novelty of providing individual‐level analyses of both cheating and looting, and this issue is further considered in the discussion of the results.         "
"36","The independent variables in the statistical analyses must capture marginality (H1), type of competition (H2), security (H3), and influence (H4), along with control variables that may help account for any bias in the measures."
"37","One standard measure of marginality and security is vote margin. Since many of the analyses are of cheating during an election campaign, it is inappropriate to consider vote margin after an election as a factor that influences cheating during the campaign. Candidates do not know their actual vote totals and margins during the campaign; they must estimate these and choose whether or not to cheat in part based on the likely impact cheating will have on increasing their probability of victory."
"38","In order to do this, we calculate a measure called viability, which incorporates data from the immediately prior two elections to establish a predicted vote margin for candidates and also incorporates an estimate of their uncertainty about the margin. A candidate's predicted vote is the average of her vote in the prior two elections (or her vote in the prior election if she has only run once).12 To calculate vote margin, the expected vote of a candidate is compared to the votes of other candidates.13 When the candidate is predicted to win a seat (be one of the top M candidates), the vote margin is the difference between the candidate's predicted vote and that of the best loser (first runner‐up), whereas if the candidate is predicted to lose, the vote margin is the difference between the candidate's predicted vote and that of the last winner.14"
"39","In order to capture the variance in uncertainty about the margin of victory, we suggest that if previous vote totals were a good predictor of votes in each district in prior elections (volatility was low), candidates are more certain of their estimated vote margin. To the extent that prior vote totals had been a poor predictor of vote totals in prior elections, candidates should be more uncertain about relying on prior vote totals to suggest their margin of victory, and more uncertain about the likelihood of election. Thus a candidate who expects to win by 1,000 votes in a district in which there has been little electoral volatility in the past has a higher certainty of election than a candidate who expects to win by 1,000 votes in a district that has recently had wild vote swings.15"
"40","Using the data from prior elections to estimate expected vote margin and uncertainty, a subjective probability of election for each candidate is calculated based on the assumption that candidates' estimation of their vote margin is normally distributed around a mean (the predicted vote margin) with a standard deviation that equals the standard deviation of vote prediction error (volatility) in a district over the prior two elections.16 This allows a simple transformation of the expected vote margin and prediction error into a measure of the subjective probability of election (Viability) ranging from 0 to 1.17 If a candidate expects that her vote total will be precisely the same as the bar, she will estimate her probability of election at 50%. As candidates are on the cusp of winning or losing (as the measure approaches 50%) the value of each marginal vote increases, whereas the value of a marginal vote to a candidate certain of winning or losing (with a subjective probability approaching 0 or 1) is close to zero, as it will barely change the probability of being elected. The analyses include both this basic probability (Viability) and its squared term (Viability2), since viability is expected to have a nonmonotonic effect.18"
"41","This method of estimating candidate viability relies on candidates' prior vote totals, requiring the exclusion candidates running for the first time in a district, as well as the first election in the sample (1947). More than 5,000 of the 16,000 candidates in the dataset are running for the first time, creating a substantial number of excluded observations, limiting the ability of the analyses to be generalized to understand corruption by new entrants into the political system. However, in the Japanese case, there is an opportunity to partially correct this problem, because in many cases candidates “inherit” a constituency. In multimember districts, candidates need not try to represent the whole district, or even half of it. Instead they must organize their own constituency by selecting specific geographical areas, organizations, and interests. This is true in similarly sized multimember districts in Ireland as well (Carty 1981). In Japanese, these ad hoc constituencies are called jiban. Where we could confidently identify a retiree's successor, they were coded as belonging to the same jiban. In those cases in which only one candidate for a given party retired and only one new candidate from that party ran in the subsequent election, one can confidently assume that the latter succeeded the former and thus comes from the same jiban. This is the simplest case, analogous to assuming that the new Labour candidate in a district is the successor to the retiring Labour candidate in Britain's single‐member district system. A similarly simple case occurs when a son (or sometimes a daughter) succeeds a retiring father, a common pattern in Japanese politics (Ishibashi and Reed 1992). Finally, newspapers often identify a new candidate as the successor to a retiring candidate. Using jiban, rather than the candidate, as the unit of analysis gives us many more cases to analyze.19 Thus the analyses include more than 12,500 candidates for whom the measure of electoral viability could be calculated.         "
"42","To test Hypothesis 2 (Type of Competition), it is important to distinguish between intraparty and interparty competition, or more precisely in the case of Japan, intracamp and intercamp competition, in order to consider how the type of competition directly affects the probability of cheating. We use a relatively simple measure of the level of intracamp and intercamp competition: the number of competitors of each type divided by the number of seats in the district to normalize for the fact that district magnitude in Japan varies.20 The four camps considered are the conservatives, socialists, communists, and Koumei. Although two of the four camps do at times include multiple parties, given the evolution of the party system from 1947 to 1993, distinguishing intra‐ and intercamp competition was more appropriate than simply distinguishing between intra‐ and interparty competition.21"
"43","In order to capture political influence and assess Hypothesis 4 (Influence), five variables are included. Three dummy variables capture key aspects of political influence in Japan: one dummy variable captures whether the candidate was a conservative (Conservative) as conservatives were in power the entire period, one variable captures whether the politician had been in cabinet (Cabinet Member), and one dummy variable identifies faction leaders within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (Faction Leader). Each of these is affiliated with progressively greater political influence, which is expected to be related positively to the probability of looting. More generally, seniority is an excellent indicator of influence in Japan and especially inside the LDP in the period being analyzed (Sato and Matsuzaki 1986). Thus the analyses include an interaction of the number of times a candidate has been elected (seniority) with the conservative dummy, creating Conservative Seniority and Non‐Conservative Seniority.         "
"44","Several other independent variables capture other relevant factors related to imperfections or biases in the measures. In the analyses of cheating, a dummy variable for incumbency (Incumbent) is included, which some might suggest could bias the extent to which corruption is actually reported, as is a dummy variable for whether the candidate is running for the first time (New Candidate), which might indicate greater than usual uncertainty. The number of times that a candidate from the same jiban has won in the district is included as a measure of the experience and success of the electoral machine in that district (Jiban Wins). District magnitude was also considered, but it was insignificant in all models and thus not included.22"
"45","Certain district characteristics may also make cheating or looting more or less likely. In particular, electoral campaigning in urban and rural Japan has often been seen as different (e.g., Curtis 1971; Ramseyer and Rosenbluth 1993; Scheiner 1999), as urban voters have been increasingly more volatile, and candidates in urban districts have been less secure. This suggests that there may be greater incentive for cheating by candidates in urban districts (given their greater uncertainty), and more looting by rural politicians (given their greater security). Thus a standard measure of population density (Urban‐Rural) based on the Asahi Shimbun ordinal ranking is included in the analyses.         "
"46","Finally, one might reasonably suggest that the electoral strategies of small parties that were not serious contenders for power did not face significant intracamp competition, and were often not even credible in many districts (communists, Koumei), may differ from larger camps that faced greater intracamp competition (conservatives, socialists). To ensure that the results are not driven by the inclusion of minor camp candidates, models showing the major results when limiting the sample to socialist and conservative candidates are also reported."
"47","Given that the dependent variable is a rare event—both scandals and cheating occur in fewer than 2% of the cases—we use rare‐events corrected logit as the estimation technique (King and Zeng 2001).23 The determinants of cheating and of looting are analyzed in turn.         "
"48"," Table 1 shows the first results for considering the impact of candidate viability on the likelihood of cheating. Model 1 tests our preferred measures of marginality (Viability and Viability2) against the actual vote margin and its squared term (cf. Chang 2005). The vote margin measures are insignificant, but the squared term of viability is significant in the expected manner—candidates on the cusp of winning and losing are more likely to cheat.24 When control variables are added in Model 2, the relationship between viability squared and cheating remains significant. Five variables are significant in the expected direction (Incumbent, Conservative, Urban‐Rural, Conservative Seniority and Non‐Conservative Seniority) and two are not (New Candidate, Jiban Wins). The latter two variables are excluded in subsequent models. The results are also robust to limiting the sample to conservative and socialist camps (Model 3). Overall, these results consistently support Hypothesis 1: marginality increases the probability of a candidate cheating in Japan.         "
"49"," Table 2 introduces the variables capturing intraparty and interparty competition and uncovers several complexities. Model 1 shows that as the level of intracamp competition increases, the likelihood of cheating also increases significantly, consistent with Hypothesis 2 (Type of Competition). However, as the level of intercamp competition increases, the likelihood of cheating significantly decreases—suggesting that interparty competition may constrain cheating. Both of these results are robust to the inclusion of the other independent and control variables (Model 2).         "
"50","The extent to which intraparty competition matters should also depend on the marginality of the candidate. Candidates with no chance of winning (or extremely unlikely to lose) should be less likely to cheat regardless of the level of intraparty competition. Thus an interaction between viability and intraparty competition is tested in Model 3, and there is clear support for the significance of the interaction. As the statistical significance and substantive importance of interactions are difficult to interpret from the raw results, Figure 2 reports simulations showing the effect of the subjective likelihood of winning on the probability of cheating when a candidate faces no intraparty competition and when a candidate faces high levels of intraparty competition.25 The effects of viability and intraparty competition are dependent on each other. When intraparty competition is high, a candidate who is on the cusp of winning is more than twice as likely to cheat as when intraparty competition is low or when the candidate is certain of winning or losing.         "
"51","                 The Impact of Viability and Intraparty Competition on the Likelihood of Cheating                      "
"52"," Notes: The figure reports simulations of the impact of the interaction of viability and intraparty competition on probability of cheating based on Table 2 Model 3, with other variables held at their median values. The lower line with a light gray 95% confidence interval represents the probability of cheating as viability varies with no intraparty competition. The upper line with dark gray confidence intervals represents the probability of cheating with high levels of intraparty competition (six other candidates in the same camp).                     "
"53","The final two models of Table 2 show that interparty competition does not in fact have the same interacted dependency on viability (Model 4), suggesting that interparty competition decreases cheating regardless of candidate viability.26 Model 5 shows that the results are robust to limiting the sample to only conservatives and socialists. In fact, the results for the interaction of intraparty competition and candidate viability are strongest in Model 5, which should not be particularly surprising as including communist and Koumei candidates in an analysis of the effects of intraparty competition is likely to add little in the way of variation in intraparty competition and cheating.         "
"54","The results in Tables 1 and 2 are consistent with expectations concerning cheating. Marginal candidates facing higher levels of intraparty competition are the most likely to cheat. Interparty competition, however, lowers the probability of cheating, although this result is not as robust. Experienced candidates, candidates with little chance of winning, candidates who are nearly certain of winning, and candidates facing low levels of intraparty competition are less likely to cheat. However, the analyses of looting find a different result.         "
"55"," Table 3 reports statistical models that analyze how political competition and influence affect looting by incumbent politicians. Model 1, which includes only viability and viability squared, shows that the basic finding for the effect of candidate viability on looting is quite different from its effect on cheating. The squared term is significantly positive, rather than negative, suggesting that extremely secure incumbents are more likely to loot than those just on the cusp of winning or losing. This result is robust to adding in variables that capture the effect of political influence and district characteristics (Model 2). Model 2 includes variables to test Hypothesis 4 (Influence), and the results are quite significant: conservative politicians, particularly senior conservative politicians, cabinet members, and faction leaders, are substantially more likely to loot.         "
"56","The significance of the squared term might also suggest that politicians who are extremely likely to lose are also more likely to loot. This would be consistent with the idea that those who have no chance of reelection (along with those who are most secure) should be more likely to loot. However, one should be careful in extrapolating results based on functional form beyond the bounds of the existing data (King and Zeng 2006). Fewer than 5% of incumbents have a viability of less than 40%, and reasonable confidence intervals for predicted probabilities in this range of incumbent viability are extraordinarily broad. Figure 3 reports simulated results for the impact of viability on looting based on Model 2 for the range of viability for which one can be reasonably confident of the results. As viability approaches one and a candidate becomes almost certain of reelection, the probability of looting according to this model approaches 2.7%, more than double (and significantly different from) the 1.3% probability associated with a candidate with equal chances of winning and losing.

"58"," Notes: The figure reports simulations of the impact of viability on the probability of looting based on Table 3 Model 2, with other variables held at their median values and the 95% confidence interval shown in gray.                     "
"59","Model 3 reports the effects of including the level and type of political competition in the analysis of looting. Increasing the level of both intra‐ and interparty competition decreases the likelihood of a looting scandal at nearly identical rates, suggesting that the level but not the type of competition a politician faces significantly affects the probability of looting. All of the results are robust to limiting the sample to conservative and socialist candidates (Model 4). These results thus confirm that increased competition decreases the probability of looting while increased candidate security, experience, and influence increase it."
"60","Are there more convincing alternative explanations for these results? While it is of course impossible to rule out all omitted variables or sources of bias, the idea that competition has differential effects on cheating and looting seems most reasonable given the results."
"61","One worry in these analyses is in relying on newspaper reporting of corruption in Japan. Naturally, this is an inefficient measure—not all instances of corruption are exposed. If, however, the corruption captured in the data were a random sample of corruption in Japan, the results would still hold. The more serious worry is that the measure is biased. It may be that newspapers are biased toward more newsworthy scandals, and thus are more likely to report corruption by prominent politicians because it is a better story, leading to disproportionate reporting of corruption by powerful, influential politicians. On the other hand, it might be that newspapers in Japan have close ties to incumbent, experienced politicians and thus are less likely to report on their corrupt behavior. However, neither bias toward nor against experienced, connected politicians is a convincing alternative explanation of the results. Newspapers report that one form of corrupt behavior (looting) is more likely to involve experienced politicians, while another form of corruption (cheating) is more likely to involve new politicians. Moreover, both forms of corruption are more frequently observed amongst the most influential (conservative) politicians, suggesting that influential politicians are not shielded by their ties to newspapers. Furthermore, any sort of bias in newspaper reporting could not readily explain the finding of an interaction of the viability of a candidate and the type of competition, which holds even when controlling for seniority and experience. Thus while there may be reporting bias in the dependent variable, it seems unlikely to drive the results on the differences between the determinants of cheating and looting."
"62","Rather than bias in the reporting of the dependent variable, perhaps there is some omitted variable that would better explain the results? Various types of omitted variables could influence the analyses. For example, perhaps voters in certain districts are more permissive of corruption in ways that are not captured in the analyses, or perhaps newspapers were more likely to report corrupt behavior in certain elections, or the periodic attempts to increase the penalties for political corruption have had a substantial effect. While one cannot definitively rule out this sort of bias entirely, the findings are robust to the inclusion of district‐level fixed effects and election year dummies, making us skeptical that omitted district‐level variables or temporal interventions drive the results. It is more difficult to control for unobserved candidate differences, since the dependent variable is too rare to allow for candidate‐level fixed effects, but again it seems unlikely that unobserved candidate‐level factors explain the results for both cheating and looting, particularly the interaction between intraparty competition and marginality associated with cheating.27"
"63","What causes corruption? How can corruption be controlled? This analysis suggests that one should not expect a single answer to either of these questions. Instead, the causal structure that produces corruption varies by the type of corruption under consideration. These empirical analyses show that the causes of looting differ from the causes of cheating in a manner consistent with theoretic expectations about the relationship between political competition and corruption."
"64","Does political competition curb corruption? With respect to looting, these findings support the conclusion that it does, thus agreeing with the great bulk of the literature. The idea that avarice (desire for reelection) may check avarice (desire to loot) appears to be a robust finding, supported by a wide variety of analyses across a wide variety of electoral and national contexts. With respect to cheating, however, our conclusions are more nuanced."
"65","In analyzing cheating, the results suggest that it is important to distinguish not just amongst the types of corruption, but the types of competition. Intraparty competition does not curb cheating but, in fact, increases it. This finding is consistent with prior analyses of corruption in Italy (Chang 2005; Golden and Chang 2001) and consistent with long‐held arguments about the effects of intraparty electoral competition (Katz 1986), although this prior work does not distinguish types of corruption as done here.         "
"66","However, there is some indication of the opposite relationship between interparty competition and cheating. We are less certain this finding will prove as robust and generalizable across varying political contexts. Competition both produces incentives to cheat in order to win the current election and imposes risks of being subsequently caught and paying a price in a somewhat more distant future. The balance of costs and benefits appears to differ in cases of intense interparty competition and intense intraparty competition, but may vary along other dimensions as well. Other factors that future work may wish to investigate could include the time horizons of political actors and varying degrees of enforcement and other factors influencing the probability of being caught.         "
"67","There remains a great deal of work to be done to improve our understanding of the determinants of political corruption in all its various guises. But the distinctions drawn in this article, and the findings linking different types of political competition and different forms of corruption, should help as we seek to improve our understanding of the causes of and potential remedies for political corruption."
