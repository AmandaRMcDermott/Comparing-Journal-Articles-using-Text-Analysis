"1","Arguments regarding the neighborhood effect have frequently been evaluated in discussions of voting patterns at British general elections,2 although the paucity of data has very largely prevented analyses at spatial scales consistent with general understandings of neighborhoods—relatively small locales with their own, internally focused, social networks.         "
"2","Much attention has instead been focused on variations in voting across regions within Great Britain, usually involving divisions of the country into no more than 20 separate regions (as in Johnston, Pattie, and Allsopp, 1988). Most studies have found some interregional variation throughout the period of the modern party system (as in Field 1997). Almost all employ aggregate data from election returns at the constituency scale and have suggested a clear north‐south divide, with the Labour party relatively strong in England's northern regions plus Wales and Inner London, and the Conservatives getting greater support in the southern regions.         "
"3","The extent of such regional variations in British voting behavior was first substantially introduced in Butler and Stokes's classic study, in which they identified as general beliefs"
"4","                        "
"5","… two quite different kinds of homogeneity of electoral behaviour between areas. On the one hand, the class basis of enduring allegiance is everywhere the same; on the other hand, electoral change, being a response to common national issues, is also everywhere the same. (1969, 172)"
"6","Their analyses, however, found that"
"7","                        "
"8","the generally uniform pattern of swings between the parties has always been broken by regional and local variations …[although] by any measure, swing is far more uniform across the regions than is class support for the parties. Any idea that class provides a universal ground for party allegiance is difficult to reconcile with the extraordinarily uneven spread of party support between regions, continuing decade after decade. (1969, 172)"
"9","In other words, similar people—according to their class and other individual characteristics—voted differently in different regions and changed their minds to different extents in different regions."
"10","These arguments were substantially extended by Curtice and Steed (1982), who showed substantial differences in voting patterns (and in changes in those patterns) according to both a north‐south regional divide and an urban‐rural divide, with urban areas more pro‐Labour and rural areas pro‐Conservative. The north‐south divide was particularly marked in the 1980s, a split generally associated with Conservative government economic policies which resulted in massive closures of manufacturing industries in the “north” alongside the growth of service industries in the “south.” Since then, the divide has been less stark, but its outlines remain firmly etched in the country's electoral geography when it is studied at that gross scale (Johnston, Pattie, and Rossiter 2005).         "
"11","Although these aggregate patterns are very clear and have been illustrated in many other analyses of both ecological and survey data which have incorporated regional variables, what is not certain is whether similar people (according to their sociodemographic characteristics) voting differently in different regions reflects different regional political cultures—a situation that clearly applied in the United States “south” for much of the last 150 years. Some of the observed variation in Britain certainly reflects major differences in political culture: in Scotland and Wales the growth of nationalist parties (the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, respectively) since the 1970s has generated regional differences in both attitudes and voting behavior. (The two parties have won on average some 20 and 11% of the votes respectively in those countries at the last four general elections.) Apart from that difference, however, and a small number of much more localized regional variations within England (such as the relative popularity of the current Liberal Democrat party and its predecessors in the two southwestern counties of Cornwall and Devon), the importance of regional variations, other than any reflecting regional population composition, has been contested. Using survey rather than aggregate data, for example, McAllister and Studlar (1992) cast severe doubt over the claims regarding major regional variations, even in the 1980s.3 Scotland and Wales aside, therefore, claims of regional political cultures reflected in different voting patterns within England are open to considerable doubt, as suggested by the rejection (by a majority of 78:22) of a proposed Regional Assembly for the northeast of England in 2005.         "
"12","Below the regional scale, almost all aggregate data analyses have necessarily been conducted by Parliamentary constituency, because general election voting data are not made available for smaller areas. (The average Parliamentary constituency in England contains some 70,000 voters.) At this scale, Miller (1977, 1978) provided strong evidence of spatial polarization in voting consistent with the neighborhood effect. Using the British Election Study (BES) survey data for several general elections and looking only at those who voted either Labour or Conservative, he found that overall 73.4% of the middle class (those in nonmanual occupations) voted Conservative, as against 30% of the working class (those in manual occupations). Thus in a hypothetical constituency where everybody was in manual occupations, the Conservatives would get 30% of the votes, whereas in another which was entirely middle class in its composition they would get 73.4%. When he used constituency data to regress percentage middle class against percentage of the votes going to the Conservatives, however, he found that in a constituency that was entirely working class the Conservatives would get just 16% of the votes whereas in one that was entirely middle class it would get over 100% (Miller 1977, 42). Of course, there are no constituencies with these extreme class compositions—the actual range was from 15 to 55—but the argument regarding spatial polarization held within those boundaries.         "
"13","Miller associated these observed patterns with what he termed contact effects, operating as follows:"
"14","                        "
"15","… social contacts are structured by family, choice of friends, social characteristics and locality. If party appeals to group interest or group attitudes evoke any differential political responses, the patterns of contact between individuals will tend to increase the political consensus within high‐contact groups. (Miller 1977, 48)               "
"16","No direct evidence that such processes operate was provided, however, only circumstantial evidence through identified patterns that were consistent with his hypotheses. Despite some critiques (notably by Dunleavy 1979, 1980), such findings were generally accepted as indicative of neighborhood effects. Other studies similarly showed that support for the main parties at that scale could not be accounted for by constituency sociodemographic composition (e.g., Johnston, Pattie, and Allsopp 1988), and a later study of a sequence of elections replicated such findings but also accepted Miller's proposed mechanism (Andersen and Heath 2002, 126):         "
"17","                        "
"18","If Mr A and Mr B have similar social characteristics but Mr A lives in an area where the middle class forms twice as large a fraction of the local population as in the area where Mr B lives, then Mr A is likely to have more middle‐class contacts than Mr B even if he is unlikely to have twice as many. Thus Mr A's contact group will be biased towards the middle class compared with Mr B's contact group. (Miller 1978, 265)               "
"19","As a consequence Mr A will be much more likely than Mr B to vote Conservative.         "
"20","Further analyses of variations across constituencies in their voting patterns have focused not on their sociodemographic composition but rather on party activity there. Parliamentary constituencies are the key spatial units in U.K. general elections, with the candidate getting most votes in each being elected as its representative. Parties campaign differentially across the constituencies (there were 529 in England at the 1997 general election analyzed here), because of differences in their marginality. Many constituencies are “safe seats” where, because of their sociodemographic composition and recent electoral history, victory for one of the parties is virtually assured. Others are more marginal, however, and could be won by two or even three of the competitors depending on one or both of: (1) shifts in voting intentions; and (2) differential success for the parties in mobilizing their supporters and ensuring that they turn out on election day. Studies have shown that parties increasingly focus their resources on such constituencies (Denver and Hands 1997; Denver, Hands, and MacAllister 2004). Those resources include the amount of money spent on campaigning and canvassing locally, and there is substantial evidence that the more a party (especially a party challenging an incumbent) spends in a constituency—as an indicator of the intensity of its campaign there—the better its relative performance (Johnston and Pattie 2007; Pattie, Johnston, and Fieldhouse 1995).         "
"21","It may be, therefore, that differences in voting patterns across constituencies reflect either the operation of neighborhood effect processes or differences in the intensity of the campaigns conducted by the various parties—or both. These patterns may themselves be aggregation effects, however. As already noted, Parliamentary constituencies in England contain about 70,000 voters on average, and such areas are almost certainly not commensurate in their size with the locales within which the social interaction associated with the neighborhood effect occurs. Thus the “real” processes may operate in smaller areas. Similarly, parties may campaign differentially within constituencies—focusing on smaller areas where they consider their potential gains to be greatest."
"22","Only small amounts of work have been done evaluating either of these claims. With regard to campaigning, case studies clearly indicate considerable geographical specificity and sophistication by parties, with the anticipated effects (Cutts 2006). With regard to smaller‐scale neighborhood effects, the absence of data has until recently precluded any detailed and wide‐ranging studies. However, innovative work in the late 1990s saw the introduction of what are termed “bespoke neighborhoods.” Using the 1997 BES survey, detailed knowledge of the respondents' home addresses which could be matched with the small‐area census geography allowed census data to be collated for the areas around those home addresses. These were used to characterize each survey respondent's immediate locale, down to the characteristics of the nearest 500 people to each respondent's home. Using these data, very convincing evidence was produced of small‐scale voting patterns that are entirely consistent with the neighborhood effect. People from the same social background voted differently according to their local context, producing the greater spatial polarization of voting than of sociodemographic groups which is the hallmark of the neighborhood effect hypothesis (Johnston and Pattie 2004; MacAllister et al. 2001). Later work, using another survey, showed that people who interact with their neighbors are more likely to vote in ways consistent with the effect than are people who are relatively isolated socially within their local areas (Johnston et al. 2005a).         "
"23","Within neighborhoods, one context that has been almost entirely ignored is the home—largely because almost all surveys randomly sample one individual within a household rather than all of its permanent residents. The British Household Panel Study (BHPS) interviews all adult members of its sampled households, however. Analyses using this source have convincingly demonstrated that people who live together not only tend, very strongly, to vote together, but also tend to change their minds together between elections (Johnston et al. 2005b).         "
"24","Different studies have identified spatial variations in voting at British general elections at a number of spatial scales, therefore, ranging from the household to the region. None have been able to evaluate the relative importance of the full range, however, so as to establish which are the statistically and substantively important correlates of (and presumed influences on) voters' choices. In this article, we report on such an evaluation of a full spatial range of effects, using a multilevel modeling approach. (Multilevel modeling was introduced to electoral studies in Jones, Johnston, and Pattie 1992, and used in British electoral analyses, inter alia, by Fisher 2000; for a full recent presentation, see Steenbergen and Jones 2002.)         "
"25","Multilevel modeling was developed to deal with hierarchically structured data sets, such as those used in the studies of school and classroom effects on student educational performance (Goldstein 1995). It differs from standard OLS regression modeling of such structures, which incorporates the various levels as dummy and interaction variables, by considering the variation at all levels of the analysis simultaneously. A multilevel model consists of two parts, fixed and random coefficients. Fixed coefficients provide estimates of the average or general relationship. Here they provide estimates of the relationships between, for example, voting Labour and the age, sex, and class of the respondent as it occurs on average across England. The random coefficients, in contrast, estimate the degree of heterogeneity and are variance terms. They assess the variation between units at a particular level having taken account of what is in the fixed part of the model. Thus, they can assess between‐constituency and between‐region variation having taken account of the age, sex, and class effects for general voting behavior.         "
"26","To evaluate these arguments regarding voting patterns at various spatial scales, we use data for the 1997 general election in England obtained from the BHPS survey that year. (The 1997 election was chosen because the bespoke neighborhood data that are at the core of the analyses here are not available for the later elections held in 2001 and 2005; the 1991 census data can be used for those remaining in the BHPS survey at those dates, but major issues of survey attrition in a survey started in 1991 then come into play. Some neighborhood data sets have been created for use with the 2005 BES—Johnston and Harris 2006—but this survey lacks any information on the household scale.) The BHPS is a longitudinal study initiated in 1991 with an initial sample of some 5,000 households and 10,000 individuals.4 These are reinterviewed annually and asked a series of questions about politics, including—when relevant—whether they voted at the general election held in that year and, if so, for which party. (Recent general elections in the United Kingdom have been held in May or June; the BHPS is in the field in the last quarter of the year.) Unlike most voter studies, which survey only one individual in each sampled household, the BHPS interviews all household members, which enables analyses of the degree of agreement within this the most local of contexts.         "
"27","Our attention here focuses only on those who reported that they voted for one of the three main parties (Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democrat), thereby excluding both abstainers (who, as in all surveys, were underestimated relative to the actual figures) and the small number who reported voting for minor parties. This requires a multinomial model, in which we contrast voting Labour with voting for each of the other two parties. Thus we model the log‐odds of voting Liberal compared to Labour in one “wing” of the model; and the log‐odds of voting Conservative compared to Labour in the other."
"28","Because of the substantial support for the nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales, which generate differences in voting patterns between those countries and England, we restrict our analyses to England alone. A 16‐region scheme is deployed, with the major conurbations (London, West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Tyne and Wear) separated out from the standard statistical regions used by the Office of National Statistics: London is divided into an inner and an outer ring. The voting percentages in Table 1 indicate considerable differences across these regions in party choice: support for both Labour and the Conservatives varied by a factor of over two across the regions, for example, whereas for the Liberal Democrats the variation involved a factor of 3.5.         "
"29","To test whether that regional variation shown in Table 1 was “real” or simply an artifact of geography (because different types of people living in different types of neighborhood and voting in different ways were concentrated in different regions) our multilevel modeling design included potentially four spatial scales—regions, constituencies, neighborhoods, and households. In the multilevel modeling only three of these are treated as random effects as it was not possible to separate neighborhoods and households because the sampling design in practice produced virtually just one household per neighborhood. For regions, we used the 16 shown in Table 1. The constituency scale was introduced because, as outlined above, this provides the important subnational context within which voting decisions are made because of the varying nature of the contest between the parties there and the intensity of the campaigns which they conduct. The 4,132 respondents were distributed across 404 separate constituencies (the total for England then was 529) with a minimum of 1 in some and a maximum of 50.5 The sample included individuals from 2,731 separate households. (The households were not the same as those originally sampled in 1991 because of dissolution and the creation of new households by members of the original sample.)         "
"30","For the neighborhood scale, since we wished to test for contextual effects reflecting the socioeconomic composition of each respondent's local area, we deployed a scheme of bespoke neighborhoods, created for the data set. Such neighborhoods are defined through a simple application of Pythagoras' theorem, using the smallest spatial units for which U.K. 1991 census data were made available—the enumeration districts (EDs), which averaged c.500 in population. The survey data provided the individual's address by post‐code (the average post‐code contains some 40 separate addresses: Harris and Johnston 2003) and by using match‐up tables produced by the Office of National Statistics it is possible to place each address into its enumeration district.6 That district's adjacent EDs are then identified according to the distance between their population‐weighted centroids, and EDs are aggregated into the bespoke neighborhood until the required population threshold is reached. Thus, for example, if the average ED has 500 residents, a bespoke neighborhood containing the nearest 3,000 people to an individual's home would comprise six contiguous EDs centered on that home address. This procedure allows characteristics of each respondent's local milieux to be identified, at very small spatial scales, certainly much smaller (and therefore more local) than the average zip code in the United States or electoral ward in the United Kingdom. A range of thresholds can be set for defining the bespoke neighborhoods, based on criteria of either size (the number of people in the neighborhood) or area: for studies with the BHPS data deployed here, bespoke neighborhoods for each respondent have been created using the districts containing the nearest 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 and 10,000 persons to their home and also those living within 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 meters from their home.         "
"31","Analyses of the 1997 BES data explored the relative importance of bespoke neighborhoods as predictors of voting behavior at different spatial scales, recognizing that there was a substantial autocorrelation problem because the smallest neighborhoods are nested within the larger ones. Some evidence of significant variations at two scales at least was discerned, however. For example, working‐class residents of areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage in bespoke neighborhoods, defined as those comprising the nearest 500 persons to their home, were even more likely to vote Labour if the neighborhoods defined according to the nearest 10,000 persons to their home were also characterized by high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage than if they were not (Johnston and Pattie 2006, 96): similar patterns were identified in analyses of the current data set (Johnston et al. 2004). Nevertheless, in general, most exploration suggested that just one spatial scale was sufficient to incorporate most of the neighborhood effect variation. There is no theoretical evidence to suggest which scale that should be, but since it is generally assumed that locales for social interaction are relatively small, we have selected the 250‐meter district around each home as representative of its immediate neighborhood.         "
"32","Having assembled all of the census enumeration districts in each of these bespoke neighborhoods (there were 2,362, indicating that virtually every household was allocated to a separate small neighborhood), the census data for those districts were obtained. The neighborhood characteristics were then characterized by a principal components factor analysis of 18 separate variables (full details of which can be found in Johnston et al. 2004). Five factors were extracted and labeled as7"
"33","                        "
"34","socioeconomic disadvantage;"
"35","mobile, one‐person households;"
"36","age structure;"
"37","ethnic minorities living at high room densities; and"
"38","rurality."
"39","On the first, neighborhoods were arrayed along a continuum from those with the least socioeconomic disadvantage (as indexed by variables such as unemployment, long‐term illness, absence of a car, and household headed by a lone parent) to those with the most. The second factor differentiated neighborhoods according to their percentages of both recent migrants and one‐person, nonpensioner households; districts with high positive scores had relatively large numbers of small, mobile households. The third arrayed them on a continuum according to their age structure—those with many children were at one pole and those dominated by one‐person pensioner households at the other. The fourth presented a continuum of neighborhoods according to the percentage of their population drawn from the country's main ethnic minority groups (blacks and South Asians). The fifth was a rural‐urban continuum, distinguished by the percentage of the workforce employed in agriculture."
"40","Our model therefore placed individuals within households, neighborhoods, constituencies, and regions. For households and regions we incorporated no other information. For the others, however, variables representing various characteristics were incorporated. With constituencies, for example, since these are the arena within which elections are fought, we included an index of the intensity of the 1997 electoral competition there, on the argument—sustained in many separate studies of campaign effects at U.K. elections—that the greater the intensity of a party's campaign in a constituency the better its performance, but the greater the intensity of its opponents' campaigns, the poorer its performance. As an index of campaign intensity, we use the amount spent by each party during the official campaign period there, as a percentage of the legally specified maximum."
"41","For individuals, we used a range of variables relating to the respondents that are available from the BHPS survey and which other studies have repeatedly shown are statistically and substantively related to party choice in England. These were age, sex, educational attainment (a 9‐point scale), and occupational class (an 11‐point scale based on the widely used classification developed by Heath and Goldthorpe). For households, we again used BHPS survey data for net household income (standardized for household size; Bardasi, Jenkins, and Rigg 2003), housing tenure, and car ownership.         "
"42","The analysis proceeded through seven stages, with further variables being added at each as we wanted to test the model's fit at each specification:"
"43","                        "
"44","Model 0: variation among individuals only;"
"45","Model 1: variation among individuals within households/neighborhoods;"
"46","Model 2: variation among individuals within households/neighborhoods within constituencies;"
"47","Model 3: variation among individuals within households/neighborhoods, within constituencies, within regions;"
"48","Model 4: variation across individuals within households/neighbourhoods, within constituencies, within regions conditioning on the effects of age, sex, net household income, education, occupational class, housing tenure, and car ownership;"
"49","Model 5: variation across individuals within households/neighborhoods, within constituencies, within regions, conditioning on age, sex, net household income, education, occupational class, housing tenure, and car ownership and additionally on neighborhood characteristics; and"
"50","Model 6: variation across individuals within households/neighborhoods, within constituencies, within regions, conditioning on age, sex, net household income, education, occupational class, housing tenure, and car ownership, neighborhood characteristics and additionally party spending in the constituencies."
"51","The first stage (Model 0) models variations among individuals alone—i.e., around the mean. The next three stages introduce the separate random‐effect levels within which individuals are nested; and the final three add characteristics of the individual voters and their households, their local neighborhoods, and political activity in their constituencies. Our primary focus is on the relative importance of the spatial contexts—in particular, are there any regional variations in voting across England once all of the other variables have been accounted for?"
"52","The choice of this sequence was determined by the general orientation of our argument and the division between fixed and random effects. Our basic contention is that there are no substantial regional cultures within England that underpin differences in voting behavior. Any observed spatial variations will reflect processes operating at the household, neighborhood (social interaction), and constituency (party campaigning) scales, and once these have been taken into account there should be no significant regional variations. Hence Models 1–2 look at the random effects linked to household and constituency, before introducing a regional effect in Model 3. Our expectation is that Model 3 will provide no better predictive power than Model 2—i.e., that once we have taken into account the household and constituency within which the respondent lives, there should be no significant regional variation. Models 4–6 then introduce the variable effects, incorporating respectively the characteristics of the individual respondents, the bespoke neighborhoods, and the intensity of the parties' constituency campaigns. As with Models 1–3, we start at the smallest scales and move upwards, asking, for example, whether—given that similar people tend to cluster together—there are significant neighborhood effects once individual respondent characteristics are taken into account. Even if region was significant in Model 3, it should not be so in Models 4–6 according to our argument that regional variations within England, as observed in many other studies, are simply aggregation effects.8 If there were regional political cultures within England, then there would be significant regional effects in Models 3–6: the observed differences across regions (as in Table 1) could not be accounted for the differential concentration of different types of individuals, neighborhoods, and constituency campaigns there.         "
"53","The multilevel model was fitted using the MLwiN software with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) estimation; details of the procedure for a multinomial model are given in Chapter 20 of Browne (2005). This Bayesian estimation procedure was used for two reasons. First, it is known that maximum‐likelihood procedures underestimate the size of the random effects when they are large and when there are relatively few lower level units within a higher level unit. The case of respondents in households is clearly the worst possible, as between‐household effects are likely to be large (or alternatively people within each household are likely to vote the same way) and households tend to contain relatively few people (in this study, the average number of eligible voters per household is two). Second, we needed a measure so that we can compare the relative effectiveness of different models in accounting for the variations in the voting behavior. Such an overall goodness‐of‐fit of the models is the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) coefficient (Spiegelhalter et al. 2002; van der Linde 2005) which is a by‐product of the MCMC procedure. The DIC statistic is a combination of the fit to the data and complexity. The “badness of fit” is determined by the deviance statistic while complexity is a function of the number of degrees of freedom consumed by the model. A model with many parameters will provide a very good fit to the data, but will have few degrees of freedom and be of limited utility. As the DIC statistic accounts for the number of parameters in any model, a larger DIC suggests a worse performance. A small difference in DIC between models indicates that they are empirically equivalent. This balanced approach discourages overfitting. The DIC statistic is a generalization of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), for which general rules of thumb have been developed such that a difference of less than 2 between models suggests essentially no difference between models; while differences greater than 10 suggest substantial support for the model with the smaller value (Burnham and Anderson 2002).         "
"54","The basic principle of the MCMC approach (Jackman 2000) is to simulate values and to use empirical summaries of these simulated values to describe the distribution. There are two stages to the simulation. The first is an initial “burn‐in” which, if the simulation is run long enough, will find its way to equilibrium of the correct distribution. Once this convergence has been achieved, these simulations must be discarded, as they will contain biased estimates possibly far away from the correct distribution. In the second stage, further simulations form a “random tour.” Summarizing these simulations provides a description of the estimate and its distribution. Then length of run determines the quality of estimate, longer runs giving increased precision, once convergence has been achieved. Here we used the MLwiN software to obtain maximum‐likelihood estimates for starting values of the distribution, then 5,000 simulations as discarded “burn‐in,” then 50,000 further simulations to get the distribution of interest. We used default diffuse priors, meaning that we did not favor a priori any particular values of the estimates. The values given in the estimates in Tables 4–6 are based on the mean of the simulated values, and the standard error is the standard deviation of the simulated distribution.         "
"55"," Table 2 gives the DIC values for the various models and the change in this value from model to model. Introduction of variation within households in Model 1 results in a very substantial reduction in the statistic, indicating that a great deal of the variation between respondents can be accounted for by within‐household agreement over which party to vote for. Thenceforward, each subsequent stage involves a further reduction in the value of DIC, which is relatively small compared to that between Model 0 and Model 1 but which is nonetheless substantially greater than 10 with one exception. There is only a very small reduction in the DIC value between Models 2 and 3, indicating that, with within‐household and across‐constituency variation already included in the model, the inclusion of between‐regional variation does not lead to an improvement in the fit. In essence, there are no substantial variations in voting behavior of individuals across the 16 regions that cannot be accounted for by knowledge of the household of which they are a member and the neighborhoods and constituencies where they live.         "
"56"," Table 3 shows the estimated coefficients for each of the three separate random‐effect levels in the six models, along with their standard errors: a coefficient shown in bold is more than twice as large as its standard error. The estimates are variances on the logit scale for the “between unit” variance. Thus, the regional variances assess the degree of heterogeneity between regions, the constituency variance estimates the within‐region between‐constituency variance, and so on. For both wings of the model—that is, Liberal Democrat voters in relation to Labour in the first set of estimates and Conservative voters in relation to Labour in the second—by far the largest and most significant variation is that within households; this is especially so in the comparison of Conservative and Labour voting. In Models 2 and 3, in which only the three random‐effect levels are included, each coefficient is more than twice its standard error, indicating differences in the propensity of individuals to vote either Labour or Liberal Democrat/Conservative by household, by constituency, and by region, although this is barely the case in the latter.         "
"57","It is possible, using the random‐effects variance, to obtain estimates of the specific random effects for each region. These, expressed as multinomial logit estimates for voting either Conservative or Liberal Democrat in each region, rather than Labour, indicate a very similar pattern in each comparison. Three regions stand out as being both more pro‐Liberal Democrat and more pro‐Conservative than the remainder:9 the Rest of the South East (i.e., the “Home Counties” which form Greater London's hinterland), the South West, and East Anglia. Together these cover the whole of southern and southeastern England outwith Greater London and provide strong evidence of a north‐south divide within the country.10 Other regions have small positive logits—notably Outer London and Rest of Yorkshire/Humberside—whereas those with substantial negative logits (Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South and West Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, and Rest of North) identify the northern urban regions where Labour performed much better than either of the other two parties. But the odds ratios derived from those logits indicate that just three regions deviate very substantially from the remainder of the country. Containing 36% of the total number of respondents whose voting is analyzed here (Table 1), they form the southern half of England (outside Greater London) where both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats performed very much better—relatively to Labour—than they did anywhere else.         "
"58","Once variables representing the characteristics of the individuals, the household, and the neighborhoods in which they live plus the intensity of party campaigning within their constituencies are added in Models 4–6, however, some of these random‐effect variations become less than twice their standard error. Introduction of individual‐level characteristics at Model 4 results in insubstantial between‐region variation and a substantial reduction in between‐constituency variation (the estimated coefficient for the Labour:Conservative contrast in Model 4 is only half that in Model 3, for example). The further addition of neighborhood characteristics in Model 5 sees the disappearance of a difference across constituencies in the Labour:Conservative contrast and a further reduction in the size of the coefficient for the Labour:Liberal Democrat comparison. When the intensity of constituency campaigns is added in Model 6, only the household/neighborhood‐level random effects remain sizeable and statistically significant."
"59","The clear implication to be drawn from these findings is that much of the observed variation between regions, and also that between constituencies within regions, in analyses of voting patterns at the 1997 general election in England is a function of aggregation effects. Once variations in individual (Model 4) and neighborhood (Model 5) characteristics are incorporated within the model, significant regional variations disappear and interconstituency variations are much reduced. Different types of people and household are concentrated in different types of neighborhood, which in turn are concentrated in different constituencies and regions. Once those concentrations are included in the modeling, the larger‐scale spatial variations are very largely removed."
"60"," Tables 4–6 show the impact of the extra variables added in Models 4–6. Model 4 incorporates the characteristics of the individual voters with findings that very largely conform to all other studies of voting behavior in England using survey data. The contrasts between Labour and Liberal Democrat voters include very few statistically significant coefficients, indicating that whether or not people supported one of those two parties or the other was not linked to the country's main social cleavages. Older and higher income respondents were more likely to vote Liberal Democrat than Labour, however, and those with no educational qualifications were less likely to do so. The contrasts between Labour and Conservative voters indicate a strong class cleavage. In addition to older and higher income respondents being more likely to support the Conservatives, there were also significant coefficients for many of the variables representing occupational class, housing tenure, and car ownership. Relative to semi‐ and unskilled manual workers, those in most white‐collar occupations (except those providing personal services), the petty bourgeoisie, farmers, and agricultural workers were much more likely to vote Conservative than Labour. The same was true of those who lived in owner‐occupied (including those being bought with mortgages) rather than rented homes, and those who lived in homes with two or more cars available as against those with either none or one.         "
"61","Turning to Model 5 (Table 5) the overall pattern of significant coefficients for the individual characteristics is very similar to that in Table 4: there is strong evidence of a class cleavage in voting Conservative rather than Labour but not in voting Liberal Democrat rather than Labour. Attention here focuses, however, on the coefficients for the five additional variables, relating to the five dimensions of the bespoke neighborhoods within which the respondents lived. Both contrasts contain two very significant coefficients, for the first and the fourth factors. The significant coefficients for the first show that the more socioeconomically disadvantaged the respondents' home neighborhoods (defined here as the area within 250 meters of their homes containing, on average, some 1,200 people, with a standard deviation of just under 500), the smaller the odds of them voting either Liberal Democrat or Conservative rather than Labour. (Neighborhoods with positive factor scores are the more disadvantaged; those with negative scores are the less disadvantaged.) The substantially larger coefficient for the Conservative than the Liberal Democrat contrast indicates much greater spatial polarization of the electorate with regard to the decision whether to vote Conservative or Labour than with that for the Liberal Democrat‐Labour decision.         "
"62","The other significant regression coefficients are for the fourth—ethnicity—factor: high positive loadings on this indicate neighborhoods with relatively large minority ethnic populations, whereas negative loadings indicate areas which are predominantly white. The negative coefficients indicate that the odds of voting either Liberal Democrat or, especially, Conservative relative to Labour decline the larger the neighborhood's ethnic minority population. In part this is undoubtedly because members of England's Black and South Asian ethnic minority groups have traditionally voted Labour. It was not possible to test for this with data on the individual characteristics because of the small number of BHPS respondents who were members of those groups. The clear implication, therefore, is that in areas of relatively large minority ethnic group concentrations, whites are much more likely to vote Labour than are those who live elsewhere."
"63","As noted above, when these neighborhood characteristics are added in Model 5, there is no substantial variation in voting patterns at the regional level and little at the constituency scale. The conclusion to be drawn is that the regional variations identified in many other studies, and in Model 3 here, are artifacts of the geography being studied. Once the characteristics of local neighborhoods are included in the model, along with those of the households and individuals who live there, there were no significant regional variations in voting propensities at the 1997 general election.11 Such regional variations that have been observed in other studies thus probably came about because of aggregation effects. If different types of people and different types of neighborhood are relatively concentrated in different regions, then if their individual and neighborhood characteristics are not incorporated in the models regional variations will occur—as aggregation effects.12 In this case, in 1997 white‐collar older workers who owned their own homes were more likely to live in southern regions. Furthermore, the neighborhood types where Labour was favored—i.e., those with relatively large numbers of socioeconomically disadvantaged and ethnic minority populations—were also concentrated in certain regions. Table 7 gives the mean scores for each region on those two factors and shows very substantial differences. Seven regions have large positive mean scores on the first factor—all of them major conurbations—whereas the highest average negative scores (i.e., the least disadvantaged neighborhoods) are for the three regions (Rest of the South East, South West, and East Anglia) which stood out in the Model 3 analyses. For the ethnicity factor, only three regions have substantial positive mean scores—London and the West Midlands conurbation have the largest ethnic minority concentrations in England. (The only other positive score is for West Yorkshire, where there are substantial South Asian communities in some districts.)         "
"64","Model 6 incorporates three further variables, at the constituency scale, providing measures of the intensity of the parties' local campaigns there. Increasingly in the U.K. parties have focused their campaigning in the weeks before the election on marginal constituencies where the entire contest may be won or lost. (See Denver and Hands 2004; Denver et al. 2003; Johnston and Pattie 2007: the expenditure data used here refer to the official campaign period after the election has been called, during which there is a legal maximum that any candidate can spend.) The more that they spend in a constituency, the better the parties tend to perform there, relative to their opponents. The coefficients in Table 6 indicate that this was the case in 1997 in England, even when individual and neighborhood characteristics were held constant within the framework of the three spatial random‐effect levels. In the contest between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the more that Labour spent in the constituency the smaller the odds that an individual would vote Liberal Democrat, whereas the odds were greater, the more that the Liberal Democrats spent. The coefficient for Liberal Democrat spending was larger than that for Labour spending, indicating that the former party's campaigns were more effective than Labour's; the Liberal Democrats got a better return on their spending than did Labour. The latter's local campaigns were also less effective than the Conservatives', although they did have a significant impact on whether an individual voted Labour rather than Conservative.         "
"65","Region is a frequently deployed variable in U.K. electoral analyses of both ecological (usually constituency‐scale) and individual data. The discovery of significant between‐region variations in voting patterns in such analyses has suggested to many analysts that there is an important regional component to voter decision making there—presumably indicative of regional cultural variations which are reflected in party choice. That regional variation is often presented as a north‐south divide, within which is nested an urban‐rural divide."
"66","Regions are large areas, however, and their scale is incommensurate with the processes often deployed to account for such spatial variations in voting—such as the neighborhood effect and party mobilization campaigns. Furthermore, within England there is very little evidence of separate regional political cultures. It may be, therefore, that observed regional variations are no more than aggregation effects, emerging as statistically significant in regression equations because different types of voters, living in different types of households and neighborhoods and subjected to party campaigns of differing intensity, are concentrated in different regions."
"67","That conclusion is consistent with the results of the analyses of spatial variations in voting at the 1997 general election in England presented here, in which smaller scale variations are incorporated. If region and constituency are the only spatial contexts included in the analytical model, then a north‐south divide emerges: people living in southern England (outside London) were much less likely to vote Labour rather than either Conservative or Liberal Democrat than were their counterparts in the northern two‐thirds of the country. But once individual, household, neighborhood, and constituency characteristics are introduced to the models, the significant regional variations disappear. There is a geography to voting at that election, but it operates at much smaller spatial scales. Regional patterns only emerge in spatially underspecified models."
"68","It is not, of course, sensible to generalize very far from these findings regarding the importance of region as an explanatory variable for voting behavior on the basis of a single case. It is, however, reasonable to suggest that the approach to studying regional variations presented here provides a much more nuanced view of geography than has been undertaken in some studies of the spatial patterning of votes in a variety of contexts. Our argument that observed regional variations may be no more than aggregated effects in underspecified models which omit smaller‐scale spatial variations is widely applicable, however, and if adopted should allow more robust evaluations of hypotheses regarding regional effects. Those identified within such contexts could then be taken as clear evidence of processes that operate at the regional level."
