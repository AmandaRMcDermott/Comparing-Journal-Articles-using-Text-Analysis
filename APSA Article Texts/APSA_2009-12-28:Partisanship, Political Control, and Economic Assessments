"1","In the nearly 50 years since The American Voter (Campbell et al. 1960) was published, numerous studies have confirmed the correlation between reported partisan affiliations and vote choice, assessments of the current economy, and opinions about important political issues (this work includes Bartels 2000, 2002, 2006; Conover, Feldman, and Knight 1986, 1987; Prior 2007). Those studies examining the correlation between partisanship and economic perceptions have employed either cross‐sectional or panel designs.         "
"2","Cross‐section designs (a classic case is Converse 1964), in which contemporaneous partisanship is used to predict economic perceptions, cannot distinguish among the many alternative mechanisms that might produce this pattern. A prime concern is reverse causality. If partisanship is in part a function of perceived economic performance of the party in government (e.g., Fiorina 1981; Wattenberg 1998), then the correlation between partisanship and economic assessments may reflect the effect of economic perceptions on partisan identity rather than the effect of partisan affiliations on those perceptions.         "
"3","A second concern with cross‐section designs is that survey respondents may perceive a common economy, but differ in how they evaluate it. This pattern could create apparent partisan differences in perceptions if Democrats and Republicans simply diverge in how they define good economic performance. More perniciously, it could arise if partisans considered different aspects of economic performance (e.g., growth rather than inflation, unemployment rather than wages) when evaluating the economy."
"4","To address these concerns, scholars have turned to panel data, in which partisanship is measured at some point in time prior to the measurement of opinions, and lagged partisanship is then substituted for contemporaneous partisanship in statistical analysis of the effect of partisanship on opinions.2 Work using this approach has found that partisanship explains reported voting decisions (Bartels 2000) as well as the relationship between partisan control of the presidency, personal partisanship, and evaluations of the economy (e.g., Conover, Feldman, and Knight 1986, 1987; Erikson 2004; Wlezien, Franklin, and Twiggs 1997). Nonetheless, existing panel studies leave some questions unanswered.         "
"5","First, there is a question of how to interpret the observed correlations. Democrats and Republicans may indeed differ in their beliefs about whether a Democratic president will improve the economy, but they may also diverge in their beliefs about the health of the economy for reasons having to do with biased information acquisition and processing or personal experiences. A panel setting, in which the same individual is interviewed twice, minimizes concerns about static between‐individual differences causing differences in perceptions. But because prior studies employ panels in which interviews are widely spaced (e.g., on the order of several months or years), they cannot distinguish the effects of changes in political control from other over‐time changes."
"6","It may be the case, for example, that partisan differences in evaluation of the economy emerge over time because Democrats and Republicans engage in biased information acquisition and processing (e.g., Rahn 1993; Redlawsk 2004). In this scenario, partisans seek out news affirming their prior beliefs and/or discount information contrary to their prior beliefs. This scenario would still produce partisan differences in evaluations of the economy, but it is by a different mechanism than the claim that partisans immediately differ in their interpretation of a common reality. (For example, Democrats and Republicans may have evaluated President Bush's defense of the War in Iraq differently because they sought out or reacted differently to media coverage of the event, or because they immediately interpreted it differently. The former pattern is due to biased information acquisition and processing, whereas the latter arises because of direct partisan filtering.)         "
"7","Partisan differences in evaluations of the economy may also occur because Democrats and Republicans experience selective exposure to different economic realities. When surveys are widely spaced, the national economy may change in a constant fashion, but the personal and local experiences of partisans may nonetheless diverge. If economic changes affect individuals (or their communities) who have different partisanship in systematically different ways, then Democrats and Republicans who consider their personal circumstances (or the experience of their community) when answering survey questions may be accurately reporting different economic experiences. (For example, Democratic and Republican differences about economic performance during the Reagan presidency [Bartels 2006] might reflect structural changes in the economy that diminished the economic standing of many industrial workers who traditionally identified as Democrats, despite the overall improvement in the macroeconomy.) Thus, a fundamental challenge is to identify events that might be interpreted in politically tinged ways but which are, on face, the same factual events to all witnessing them.         "
"8","A more general concern, unrelated to the panel or cross‐sectional nature of the research design, is that the pattern of survey response in which respondents report being more optimistic when the president is of their party may reflect partisan “cheering” rather than real economic perceptions. A similar concern arises for questions that directly ask the respondent which party is better for the economy or whether some economic indicator has improved or deteriorated during a president's administration. It is perhaps not surprising that presidential partisanship affects partisans’ reported evaluations of economic conditions, because offering assessments of those conditions in a political survey may be perceived as implicitly offering evaluations of an incumbent president's performance (Sears and Lau 1983). It remains unclear whether survey respondents’ reports about real planned economic behavior (e.g., proposed consumption decisions) or other nonpolitical opinions (e.g., their happiness) would be similarly affected since they force respondents to consider real trade‐offs (e.g., spending more money involves having less in the future) or do not as automatically suggest a partisan referent (e.g., happiness and politics are not clearly linked).         "
"9","In response to these concerns, we propose an alternative research design outlined in the next section. This approach employs a panel design in which the same individuals are interviewed shortly before and after the outcome of a discrete political event becomes known. This approach allows us to leverage the advantages of a panel design while also distinguishing immediate partisan divergence in opinions from a similar pattern arising due to heterogeneous information processing or personal experiences. This approach is described in greater detail in the following section."
"10","This section describes the basis for our statistical analysis and formalizes the concerns outlined in the previous section about cross‐sectional and panel designs. The 2006 CCES is a panel study containing two interviews for each person. The pair of interviews bracketed the November 2006 election, with one conducted in late October and the other in November.3 For each person in our sample we measured a host of individual demographic variables and partisanship during the first interview, and expected consumption, economic forecasts, and expectations for household income during both interviews.         "
"11","Individuals may differ with respect to their partisanship (P) and other characteristics, some of which are measured in the survey (X) and others which are not (Z). There is also variation over time, because between the interviews certain features of the general environment change, including the state of the economy and which party's politicians hold political office."
"12","Our statistical model describing how a response variable (consumption plans, economic forecasts and assessments, personal happiness, etc.) is determined by attributes (P, X, Z) and environmental influences is             "
"13","Given that Z is unobserved, when estimating equation (1) all terms which employ the variable Z must be omitted and therefore assigned to the model error. Equation (1) can be used to illustrate some of the potential barriers to inferring the effect of partisanship, and more specifically the interaction between partisanship and political control (B7), from cross‐section regressions. For example, suppose that instead of collecting panel data, the researcher gathered two cross sections (one pre‐ and one postelection) from different subjects. Assuming the model is otherwise correctly specified, estimates of B7 based on equation (1) face two important hurdles.         "
"14","First, cross‐sectional regressions are vulnerable to bias due to Z, unmeasured or omitted variables. This will provide a biased estimate of the effect of the interaction of partisanship and political control (B7) if the omitted Z is correlated with P and the effects of Z on Y are not zero (B5 and B10–11 equal zero). Partisanship is predicted by many individual characteristics. It is therefore plausible that unmeasured individual attributes that affect Y, which include personality, intelligence, life experiences, attitudes of friends, and measurement error in X (including aspects of X omitted from the survey measures, such as type of work or type of school attended), are also related to P. The specific arguments will vary by case, but this is a core difficulty in cross‐sectional analysis and is one reason why this approach is frequently classified as unconvincing evidence in other disciplines (see, e.g., the Cochrane reviews in medicine)."
"15","A second difficulty is that it is impossible to separate the effects of postelection and Demcontrol. There is perfect colinearity between a collection of time indicators and an indicator variable like Demcontrol, which takes on the same value for the entire sample at each point in time. As a consequence, we cannot separately estimate the pairs B1 and B2, B6 and B7, B8 and B9, and B10 and B11. Conceptually the problem is that in addition to political control changing (or not), many other things are also changing (e.g., personal economic experience and consumption of political information) at the same time, and these changes may have average as well as differential (on P, X, and Z) effects on Y. It is therefore impossible to attribute the effects of altered behavior or attitudes to the political change rather than the variation in all the other things that are affecting the survey respondents.         "
"16","Turning to the panel context, in which the same individual is interviewed twice, equation (1) can be used to write the change in Y from before the election to after it (and again assuming that P, X, and Z are fixed):            "
"17","A key advantage of (2) over (1) is that the effects of fixed characteristics of the individuals are “differenced away.” In particular, Z, the vector for omitted measures, no longer appears. Without loss of generality, let Δpostelection equal 1 for the entire sample. Equation (2) can be rewritten as            "
"18","From this exposition we conclude that moving to a panel dataset does not guarantee identification of the effects we seek to estimate. Fortunately, there are some unique features of the CCES that make it more plausible than is typically the case to interpret the estimates of B7 derived from equation (2)′ as the causal effects of a shift in political control. Specifically, the key feature of our data is that the interviews were conducted just before and just after a historic political shock. (Prior to 2006, majority control of both houses of Congress had changed simultaneously only five times since WWII, most recently in 1994 and 1955.) The short time period between interviews and the intervening important political change imply that it is plausible to assume the effects of nonpolitical background effects (B1, B6, B8, and B10) are zero, which we label assumption 1.4 Using assumption 1 to set Δpostelection effects to 0 and setting ΔDemcontrol = 1, equation (2)′ can be rewritten as            "
"19","The simplification (2)″ rests on the argument implicit in assumption 1. An example of a similar argument is that a researcher polling the day before and the day after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 might confidently attribute partisan patterns in attitude changes from the day before the attacks to the day after them to those attacks, rather than to a collection of other things that happened on 9/11 that also affect partisans differentially (see, e.g., Kaplan and Mukand 2007). Assumption 1 is less plausible, all else equal, as the time between interviews is longer. This interval is often referred to as the “event window” and is similar in spirit to the caliper size in a regression discontinuity design study. The narrower the event window, all else equal, the more persuasive is the attribution of a causal effect to the event (here ΔDemcontrol) rather than other things occurring between interviews (here Δpostelection).         "
"20","In the context of our particular study, we can also test this assumption by examining whether other factors that might shape the views of partisans also changed during the period between surveys. We do so in two ways. First, we reviewed changes in leading economic indicators in the weeks prior to and after the election and found no evidence of significant changes in unemployment, inflation, GDP, retail sales, the S&P 500, or the price of crude oil.5 This stability reassures us both that average changes in the real economy were small, and that (importantly for our analysis) changes in factors likely to differentially affect Democrats and Republicans were apparently minimal. Second, we examined media coverage of the economy. In particular, we coded coverage in the New York Times (a Democratic‐leaning paper) and the Wall Street Journal (a Republican‐leaning paper).6 Both papers are relatively neutral on the economy prior to the election. The Wall Street Journal is similarly neutral after the election, but the New York Times becomes more negative. Thus, at least initially, it appears that Democratic and Republican outlets were portraying a common economy, and the New York Times’ movement to a more negative portrayal of the economy would tend to bias against finding that Democrats (the paper's likely readers) became more optimistic.         "
"21","Notice that while assumption 1 aids identification of the effect of P *ΔDemcontrol (B7), it does not resolve all estimation problems. Specifically, a term involving the unmeasured Z remains. This causes standard omitted variable bias if the change in political control may cause change in Y differentially for those with different Z, and if Z is correlated with P, the estimate of B7 will be biased. This problem can be minimized by including as many X variables as are available, though in the end it requires an assumption either about B11 (B11 = 0) or that Z (the factors that remain after controlling for X) is uncorrelated with P.         "
"22","Having identified the ambiguity in interpreting an association between partisanship and economic assessments in cross‐sectional designs or in research employing widely spaced panels, we briefly summarize the expected relationship between partisanship and survey outcomes in a research design employing closely spaced panel interviews. These patterns are presented in Table 1.         "
"23","If partisanship directly shapes the perceived economic consequences of political events, the alignment of an individual's partisanship and the partisanship of the party advantaged by the event should result in more positive economic perceptions and real changes in nonpolitical behaviors. This predicted pattern is summarized in column (0) of Table 1, where the “+” signs denote an expected positive association for both types of outcome measures.         "
"24","By contrast, if partisanship is simply affected by (endogenous to) contemporary conditions, employing preevent partisanship and examining changes in outcomes should remove any correlation between partisanship and either economic perceptions or nonpolitical behaviors. This is shown in column (1). Similarly, if partisans are simply employing divergent evaluative criteria (column 2), then focusing on the change in perceptions and behaviors will remove this baseline difference and therefore eliminate the correlation between partisanship and either type of outcome measure."
"25","Columns (3) and (4) display a similar nonrelationship between partisanship and changes in outcomes if selective perception or selective exposure is the sole explanation for the effects of partisanship on opinions. (To be clear, our research design cannot prove that selective perception and selective exposure are not causes of preevent differences in partisan beliefs about the economic competence of the parties. Rather, if we find the correlation predicted in column 0, it can only demonstrate that selective perception and selective exposure are not necessary to produce partisan divergence in assessments of political events.) By employing a narrow event window, we eliminate much of the concern that partisans are experiencing differential information flows or real differences in their personal economic experiences. As with any preexisting difference accounted for in the first interview, these baseline differences will be “differenced out” of the outcome measure."
"26","Finally, as is shown in column (5), if the relationship between partisanship and survey responses observed in previous research arises because of partisan cheering on abstract questions about the health of the national economy, we would still expect a positive correlation between individual partisanship and changes in economic perceptions. However, by including a variety of more concrete measures of nonpolitical behaviors, including specific economic consumption decisions and measures of psychological states, we seek to distinguish this domain‐specific political response to political events from a more pervasive and wide‐reaching effect of partisanship on perceptions of events. Those alternative measures appear unrelated to politics and therefore unlikely to impel the respondents to tailor their response to their general partisan disposition. If “cheering” alone is at work, we would not expect a correlation between partisanship and changes in those behavioral measures."
"27","The data for our analysis are from the fall 2006 CCES. The CCES is a pre‐ and postelection panel survey conducted by Polimetrix. Respondents were selected from a pool of Internet users to match the characteristics of a nationally representative random‐digit dialing sample. We focus on a 2,000‐respondent subsample of the CCES in which respondents were asked a series of questions we crafted for both the pre‐ and postelection surveys. Preelection surveys were completed in the period between October 10 and Election Day and postelection surveys were completed between November 8 and November 27, 2006.7 CCES respondents were asked a standard array of political and demographic questions (age, gender, race, ethnicity, union affiliation, education, income, and partisanship) in the preelection survey and, in both the pre‐ and postelection surveys, a series of questions we designed to measure economic perceptions and behaviors. Summary statistics for all variables appear in Table 2, and exact question wording and coding rules appear in Appendix A.         "
"28","Our measures of economic perceptions asked respondents to provide their Household Income Forecast (over the next two years) and their National Economy Forecast (over the next year). Additionally, we asked respondents to provide us with their Planned Holiday Spending and Planned Vacation Spending (next summer) in dollars and to rate their Happiness. We note that in all cases we repeated these questions on the pre‐ and postelection survey, so that for each respondent who completed both surveys we have both his or her preelection and postelection response for each measure.         "
"29","Our analysis proceeds by examining changes in answers to these behavioral and perceptual measures as a function of a respondent's preelection partisan identification and intervening national and state political events. This is the statistical specification in equation (2)″ above. For the 2006 CCES, the relevant national political event is the (largely unexpected) Democratic takeover of the U.S. Congress.8"
"30","We begin by examining changes in responses to the economic perception measures before and after the 2006 election as a function of partisanship. In this analysis, therefore, we focus on the effect of a single national event. Where responses are categorical in nature, our dependent variable is the ordered scale for the postelection response, and we control for prior responses by including indicator variables for each categorical response in the preelection survey. So, for example, where our dependent variable is Postelection Household Income Forecast (2 = Increase a lot, 1 = Increase a little, 0 = About the same, −1 = Decrease a little, −2 = Decrease a lot), our estimated statistical model includes separate indicators for each of these responses (excluding one) in the preelection survey.9"
"31"," Table 3A contains ordered probit estimates of the effect of partisan affiliations on changes in economic perceptions. (Throughout, we code partisan identification using a 5‐point scale, in which 2 = Strong Democrat, 1 = Weak or Lean Democrat, 0 = Independent, −1 = Weak or Lean Republican, and −2 = Strong Republican.)10 To convey the magnitude of the effects, in Table 3B we present the marginal effect of changing party identification on the dependent variables analyzed in the Table 3A models. In Table 3A column (1) we estimate a baseline model for Postelection Household Income Forecast including only the respondent's partisan identification and find that Democrats and Republicans react differently to the outcome of the fall 2006 election (p < .01 in a one‐tailed test; throughout we employ one‐tailed tests for our directional hypotheses about the effects of partisanship). In the column (2) specification, we add a standard array of demographic variables, most importantly income, to the base specification. The magnitude of the effect of party affiliation declines, but the estimated coefficient remains statistically significant at p < .01.         "
"32","Column (1) of Table 3B contains estimates of marginal effects based on the specification with individual‐level demographic measures. In particular, we report first for an “average” nonpartisan respondent (e.g., an independent whose partisanship score is 0) the predicted probability the respondent would report his or her household income would increase “a little” or “a lot,” which in this case is 64.6%.11 Additionally, we report the effect for this same respondent of shifting partisan affiliation from Strong Republican (partisanship score =−2) to Strong Democrat (partisanship score = 2). In this case, this shift in partisanship is predicted to increase the probability of offering either optimistic response by 8 percentage points (or by about 12.4% relative to the baseline prediction), and the 95% confidence interval of this prediction is 2.1 to 13.6%. Overall, then, these results suggest that Democrats (Republicans) reacted to learning that Democrats would control the U.S. Congress by increasing (decreasing) their optimism about their household's future earnings.12"
"33","In columns (3) and (4) of Table 3A we estimate models where the dependent variable is Postelection National Economy Forecast. We find that Democrats become more optimistic about the national economy after the fall 2006 election, while Republicans become more pessimistic (even after accounting for preelection forecasts). In both columns, the coefficient on partisan identification is positive and statistically significant at p < .01. Marginal effects appear in column (2) of Table 3B. For an average nonpartisan respondent (whose preelection national economy forecast was “Stay about the same”), the simulated probability that respondent reports that the national economy will “Get better” or “Get much better” is 26.09%. For the same average respondent, a shift in partisanship from strong Republican to strong Democrat is predicted to increase the probability of offering either response by 29.05 percentage points (95% confidence interval 22.47 to 35.17%), which represents a proportional increase of more than 100% over the baseline probability.         "
"34","The pattern apparent in Table 3A suggests that even with a narrowly spaced panel design, we find evidence that partisans differ in their reactions to political events. Moreover, these effects extend to both expectations about the national economy in general (sociotropic evaluations) and personal (or pocketbook) expectations for a respondent's own household. As we note above, however, such a pattern is also consistent with partisans simply answering abstract questions about the national economy and their personal household in a partisan‐tinged fashion. Table 4A therefore presents results for a series of behavioral measures. To measure changes in planned holiday and vacation spending behavior, we construct a measure of the logged ratio of pre‐ to postelection spending plans (Log[Postelection Response/Preelection Response]).13 In column (1) we estimate a baseline model for Log Change in Holiday Spending including only the respondent's partisan identification. Per these results, respondents who are not affiliated with either party (e.g., Independents, whose partisanship score is 0) have an average decline in their anticipated holiday spending of 4.4 percentage points between the pre‐ and postelection surveys, or about $34 given that the average preelection report of anticipated spending is about $774. Among Strong Democrats (Party ID = 2), spending is instead predicted to increase by about 2.4 percentage points ($19), while among Strong Republicans (Party ID =−2), it is predicted to decline by about 11.2 percentage points ($87). The coefficient on Party ID is statistically significant at p < .10. Adding a standard array of demographic variables reduces the magnitude of the effect (by about 4%), but improves its precision.         "
"35","To provide a clear sense of how partisanship predicts changes in behavior from before to after the 2006 election, we turn to Table 4B, which presents marginal effects calculated in a manner identical to those shown in Table 3B. Column (1) of Table 3B contains estimates of marginal effects based on the specification with individual‐level demographic measures. The baseline prediction for a nonpartisan respondent is −2.45%, while shifting partisan affiliation from Strong Republican to Strong Democrat is predicted to increase postelection spending by 12.84%. (The 95% confidence interval of this prediction is −4.30 to 29.55%.)         "
"36","Columns (3) and (4) of Table 4A report estimates from models where the dependent variable is Log Change in Vacation Spending. Here, the results provide even stronger evidence of partisan variation in the response to the fall 2006 election outcome. In both model specifications, the effect of partisan identity is nearly identical and is statistically significant at p < .05 (one‐tailed test) or better. Per the column (4) specification, a strong Democrat's vacation spending is predicted to increase by about 20% (or $286 above the average preelection plan of $1,432), while a strong Republican's is expected to decline by about 11%, or $162. Column (2) of Table 4B shows that a shift in partisanship from strong Republican to Strong Democrat is predicted to increase postelection vacation spending by 30.51% (95% confidence interval 4.08 to 57.22). These are large and substantively important effects.         "
"37","Finally, we turn our attention to a measure of a respondent's self‐reported happiness. In both columns (5) and (6) of Table 4A we find strong evidence that Democrats reacted to the fall 2006 election outcome by becoming happier, while Republicans became less happy. The coefficient on party identification is statistically significant at p < .01 in both specifications. As is shown in column (3) of Table 4B, for an average nonpartisan respondent (whose preelection happiness response was “Somewhat happy”), the simulated probability that respondent reports being “Somewhat” or “Very happy” in the postelection survey is 82.40%. For the same respondent, a shift in partisanship from strong Republican to strong Democrat increases that probability by 5.37 percentage points (95% confidence interval 0.83 to 9.62%), or by about 6.5% relative to the baseline prediction.         "
"38","Overall, we find substantial evidence that economic perceptions and behaviors respond to the conjunction of election outcomes and partisan affiliations. Immediately after the 2006 election Democrats believed their household and the nation's economy would improve and reported that they would increase their holiday and vacation spending and were happier. Republicans behaved in a mirror fashion. We next consider the robustness of these results to alternative methods of analysis and different data sources."
"39","Our first series of robustness checks are reported in Table 5. We focus our analysis on the survey measure of changes in national economic forecasts, although analysis employing the other measures shown in Tables 3 and 4 produces highly similar results. For comparison, column (0) of Table 5 is the baseline specification from Table 3A column (4). The first robustness test, in column (1), examines the sensitivity of our results to the exclusion of independents (partisan affiliation = 0 on our 5‐point scale). This test ensures that the effects we observe originate in differences between partisans, rather than between partisans and independents. Doing so, we find our results virtually unchanged. The coefficient on party affiliation increases in magnitude by about 3.5% and remains statistically significant at p < .01.            "
"40","In column (2) we allow the effect of partisanship to vary in a nonlinear fashion by including indicators for each separate category of partisan affiliation included in our 5‐point partisan identification scale (the excluded category is independents). For each category, the size and direction of the coefficient estimate is as expected and is statistically significant at p < .05. After the 2006 election, and after accounting for preelection responses, strong Republicans are the most negative about the national economy's future and strong Democrats are the most optimistic.14 In column (3) we pool strong and weak/leaning partisans together, creating a 3‐point scale (1 = Democrat, 0 = Independent, −1 = Republican). Again, the estimated effect of this collapsed partisan affiliation scale is positive and statistically significant at p < .01. (Not surprisingly, it is also smaller.) Column (4) shows that our results are similarly robust to employing a 7‐point scale (3 = Strong Democrat, 2 = Weak Dem., 1 = Independent who leans Dem., 0 = Independent, −1 = Lean Rep., −2 = Weak Rep., 3 = Strong Rep.).            "
"41","The matching estimates shown in column (5) demonstrate that the estimated effect of partisanship is not driven by the linear functional form for the included covariates (e.g., age, income, education). We begin by recoding our dependent variable as a linear scale (2 = Much better, 1 = Better, 0 = Stay about the same, −1 = Worse, −2 = Much worse) and dichotomizing the treatment, party affiliation (1 = Strong or weak/lean Democrat, 0 = Strong or weak/lean Republican, independents are discarded). Next, we employ exact matching to pair Democrats and Republicans on the basis of the covariates other than age (preelection response, gender, race, ethnicity, union membership, income, and education), and then select individual pairs of Democrats and Republicans to minimize differences in age.15 Exact matching, which discards cases in either the control (Republicans) or treatment (Democrats) condition for which observations with identical responses are not available in the other condition, permits us to achieve perfect balance on covariates other than age, and good balance on age (the bootstrapped p‐value from a Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test of equality of distributions is 0.776, indicating that the treatment and control groups cannot be distinguished). The estimate shown in column (5) is .518, which is statistically significant at p < .01.16"
"42","The specification in column (6) addresses a different concern about how to interpret the effect of individual partisanship on perceptions of economic conditions. Suppose, hypothetically, that Democrats were more positive about the nation's economic fortunes not because they believed the nation's economy would improve, but because they instead believed after the election that more government benefits would now flow to areas with Democratic constituencies. If Democrats tended to live with other Democrats, the estimates reported here would confound the effect of individual partisanship with community partisanship. To test for this possibility, we re‐estimate the column (0) specification after including a measure of average local partisanship (the Democratic share of the two‐party presidential vote in the county in 2000). Including this measure slightly increases the effect of individual partisanship on economic perceptions, strongly suggesting that the observed pattern is not due to changing expectations about how government policies will be targeted to different areas on the basis of their partisanship."
"43","Finally, the column (7) specification allows us to consider whether our results reflect the influence of real differences in state economic conditions. To do so, we reestimate the column (0) specification after restricting our sample to the 16 states in our sample for which we have at least 30 respondents and including an indicator (fixed effect) for each of those states. Even after accounting for differences in state economies (and any other static differences across states), the coefficient on partisanship is similar in magnitude and statistically significant at p < .01.17"
"44","Cumulatively, these robustness checks suggest that the pattern of partisan response shown in Tables 3 and 4 is not driven by particular functional form assumptions or the behavior of independents. Rather, across a variety of measurement and model specifications, Democrats reacted to the 2006 election by becoming more optimistic in their economic forecasts for the national economy, while Republicans became more pessimistic. We next consider whether partisans in 2006 responded in a similar manner to the outcome of state gubernatorial elections when forming judgments about state economic performance.            "
"45","Up to now, we have confined our analysis to the effect of partisanship following national elections. State election outcomes are often similarly uncertain, however, but most surveys do not provide sufficient samples within individual states in which the outcome of the gubernatorial race is difficult for voters to predict ahead of time. In this regard, the 2006 CCES is an important exception because we were able to target half of our respondents so as to oversample states with a governor's race that was rated as likely to be close by the Cook Political Report. Our analysis strategy here therefore seeks to exploit the uncertainty about state gubernatorial elections to test whether survey respondents reacted with a similar pattern of partisan response to these state elections."
"46","Complete details of our analysis strategy and model estimates appear in Appendix B. We find a similar pattern of partisan response to the outcome of gubernatorial elections for state economic expectations to that reported above for national economic expectations. Democrats (Republicans) became more optimistic (pessimistic) about their state's economy when a Democrat won the election. These effects are slightly magnified among Democrats in elections whose outcomes were ex ante classified as uncertain. Further suggesting the validity of this approach, we find no evidence that respondents condition their evaluations of the national economy on state election outcomes.            "
"47","These results suggest that partisanship has a powerful and immediate effect on interpretation of political events, and these interpretations extend beyond control of national political institutions to state‐level election outcomes."
"48","It is well known that partisans rate the current economy and its prospects more favorably when their party holds the presidency. There are several plausible reasons why this association may occur. We use a panel survey with response waves just before and just after the November 2006 election to measure the changes in economic expectations and behavioral intentions which occur in the aftermath of a major, and widely unanticipated, shift in political power. Using this novel research design, we are able to observe whether the association between partisanship and economic assessments still holds when some of the leading mechanisms thought to bring about this association do not operate."
"49","The fundamental idea motivating our research design is that while little of substance changed in the actual economy or its depiction in the media between the panel waves (separated by approximately one month), there was a huge political upheaval. The very short period between the panel waves makes it highly implausible that the divergent change in partisan economic assessments was due to (1) a sudden change in real economic experiences that happens to be correlated with partisanship, (2) sudden changes in the information streams about the economy that happen to be correlated with partisanship, or (3) partisan bias in the incorporation of a burst of new information about the economy itself. Rather, it appears that partisans believe that their party is better able to bring about substantial improvement in both general national economic performance and their own household's economic situation. Partisans of the party that increased its political power expect a better economy for the nation and their own households, while partisans of the losing party are more pessimistic. The effects of partisanship therefore cross the dividing line between pocketbook and sociotropic expectations."
"50","Further, partisanship is associated not just with general statements about national economic performance, but also with reports of specific consumption intentions, which bolsters our confidence that respondents are expressing their confidence in the economy and not merely responding in an abstract fashion that expresses their general affinity for a party. Partisans believe that their party is of better quality, and when their party wins an election become more optimistic about the economy and alter their consumption decisions and personal happiness in response to that expected improvement."
"51"," Tables 3B and 4B show that the magnitude of partisan differences are large even in the absence of any contemporaneous selective perception or selective exposure. For instance, we find that, following the Democratic takeover of Congress and holding constant preelection evaluations of the economy, strong Democrats are nearly 30 percentage points more likely than strong Republicans to say that the national economy will be better or much better over the coming year. Shifts of similar magnitude are also found for the intended consumption measures.         "
"52","The evidence we present suggests that partisans have different beliefs about the general economic competence of the parties. How might these differences come about? One obvious possibility is that individuals form their partisan association in response to economic performance and over time this brings about a correlation between partisanship and views about economic competence. However, and in contrast to measures such as presidential approval ratings, partisanship is quite stable. This stability of partisanship through adulthood (e.g., Alwin and Krosnick 1991) suggests that performance variation is not being incorporated into partisanship. Somewhat surprisingly, empirical analysis of trends in partisanship suggests that partisanship is at most weakly responsive to macroeconomic events (e.g., Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002). Further, the strong association of partisanship with groups identified on the basis of factors such as personality (Gerber et al. 2009; Mondak and Halperin 2008), religion, race, ethnicity, and geography, suggests that tastes, values, and distributional politics, rather than economic competence itself, play a major role in the formation of partisan identity. Understanding how factors unrelated to assessments of economic performance shape partisanship, which in turn affects economic evaluations, is a fruitful area for future research.         "
"53","An alternative explanation for partisan belief difference is that partisanship leads to a general attribution of desirable traits to those who share one's partisanship (Conover and Feldman 1982). A similar phenomenon emerges in psychology research, in which individuals are prone to falsely attribute unobserved positive qualities to individuals whom share characteristics with them while falsely attributing unobserved negative qualities to individuals whom they do not feel warmly toward. While there is no doubt that some citizens have sophisticated and deeply held views about economic policy (although it is unclear what implications changing congressional control might have for immediate economic performance), for many Americans, there is no rational basis to suppose that one party is better than the other at managing the economy. If such positive or negative traits are attributed to the parties nonetheless, it could generate the patterns of economic assessments and behaviors observed here.         "
"54","In light of these findings, we suggest two areas for future research. The first is to investigate whether or not the behavioral effects we find here manifest outside of the survey context. Such an analysis could proceed by examining either aggregate differences in behaviors for different groupings of partisans (e.g., Gerber and Huber 2009) or collecting information on the nonpolitical behaviors of individual partisans. The second is to try to instantiate the claim that partisanship shapes subsequent perceptions by manipulating partisanship itself (e.g., Gerber, Huber, and Washington 2009). If induced changes in partisanship affect subsequent beliefs, this would validate directly the claim that partisan affiliations shape subsequent perceptions.         "
"55","We obtained 318 respondent interviews in states where, on November, 6, 2006, the Cook Political Report coded the race as “Toss‐up.”18 This list, with the party of the incumbent governor prior to the election listed in parentheses, is Alaska (R), Iowa (D), Idaho (R), Maryland (R), Michigan (D), Minnesota (R), Nevada (R), Oregon (D), Rhode Island (R), and Wisconsin (D). (We note that in this set of states, only in Maryland did the governor's party change after the election, when Republican incumbent Robert Ehrlich was defeated by Democrat Martin O’Malley. Additionally, Democrats gained control of previously Republican governorships in Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio, but these outcomes were accurately forecast ahead of time.)               "
"56","The statistical estimation approach we employ in this test deserves careful attention. In particular, when providing assessments of their state's economic future, respondents may reasonably consider not just the effect of political control of their state's executive branch, but also control of national political institutions. For this reason, in the analysis that follows we allow there to be a uniform effect of partisanship across states (to account for national events, e.g., the Democratic takeover of Congress), as well as additional effects for partisanship both in states with governor's races and in states with governor's races that were rated ex ante as uncertain. To do so, we model postelection evaluations as a function of preelection responses, a standard vector of demographic covariates, state of residence,19 partisanship, whether a Democrat or Republican won the governor's election, whether the state's governor's election was ex ante uncertain (a rating of “Toss‐up” by the Cook report), and the interactions between the last three items. This approach yields the following specification:                  "
"57","In states without a governor's election, the effect of a one‐unit shift in partisanship is therefore simply B1. By contrast, in states where the Democrat won in a race that was ex ante not expected to be competitive, the effect of that shift in partisanship is B1 + B2. (Where a Republican did so, the effect is B1 − B2.) Finally, in a state where a Democrat won in a race that was ex ante uncertain, the effect of a one‐unit shift in partisanship is B1 + B2 + B3 + B4 (and B1 − B2 + B3 − B4 if a Republican did so)."
"58","Estimates employing this model specification for the Postelection State Economy Forecast measure appear in column (1) of Table B1. The positive and statistically significant “baseline” effect of partisanship (including in states without governor's elections) suggests that the outcome of the national election did affect how respondents believed their state's economy would perform in the future, with Democrats being more optimistic and Republicans more pessimistic.               "
"59","In states with a governor's election whose outcome was ex ante certain (in retrospect), we observe an incremental effect of partisanship that is also statistically significant. In particular, the cumulative effect of a shift in partisanship from strong Republican to strong Democrat on state economic forecasts is larger in states with governor's elections than in states without. Formally, we test the hypothesis that a four‐unit shift in Party ID, from strong Republican to strong Democrat, has a bigger effect in states with a governor's election than in states without. This test is 4 * B1 + 4 * B2 − 4 * B1 = 0, or 4 * B2 = 0. (This is when a Democrat wins. When a Republican wins, the appropriate test is −4 * B2 = 0.) The coefficient estimate for 4 * B2 is .870 with a Z‐statistic of 8.40, which is statistically significant at p < .01. This implies that Democrats become more optimistic (pessimistic) about their state's economic fortunes when a Democrat (Republican) won the governorship, while Republicans behaved in the opposite fashion."
"60","Finally, these estimates also show that the effect of partisanship combined with the outcome of state elections is further magnified in states with governor's elections that were ex ante uncertain. Again, the appropriate test is whether a shift from being a strong Republican to a strong Democrat has a smaller or larger effect on economic forecasts in states with difficult to predict election outcomes relative to certain ones. When a Democrat wins, this test is 4 * B1 + 4 * B2 + 4 * B3 + 4 * B4 − (4 * B1 + 4 * B2) = 0, or 4 * B3 + 4 * B4 = 0. The coefficient estimate for this test is .639, with a Z‐statistic of 2.27, which is statistically significant at p < .05.20"
"61","Finally, the results shown in column (2), where the dependent variable is Postelection National Economy Forecast, suggest that state elections have little effect on respondents’ evaluations of the national economy. We find, consistent with the results shown in Table 3, that Democrats are more optimistic about the national economy after the 2006 election and Republicans are more pessimistic. The outcome of state elections interacted with respondent partisanship has no additional influence on this measure, however. In particular, we cannot reject the null hypotheses that 4 * B2 = 0 (the effect of a shift in partisanship in certain state elections) or that 4 * B2 + 4 * B3 + 4 * B4 = 0 (the effect of a shift in partisanship in uncertain state elections). Rather, state election outcomes and respondent partisanship appear to jointly influence only perceptions of state, and not national, economic conditions.21"
