"1","The Enlightenment offers students of the history of political philosophy at least two visions of “the science of the legislator.”2 By far the more well known is that set forth by Smith and David Hume, the philosophers chiefly responsible for articulating and subsequently defending the project of commercial modernity. As has been shown, Hume and Smith aspired to teach potential legislators in their audiences how to devise political and economic institutions capable of accommodating man's selfish passions and in turn meliorating or transforming them into agents of social stability and growth (see esp. Cohen 1989, 51, 54, 59, 62; Haakonssen 1981; McNamara 1998; Winch 1996, 117). Given this objective, it may at first seem strange, if not perverse, to regard Rousseau as a contributor to this project. Rousseau's advice to nation‐building legislators, as presented in his writings on Poland and Corsica and Geneva, seems to counter Smith in advocating resistance to commerce and liberal individualism and a recovery of a commitment to the common good based on classical republican ideals. Yet it is Rousseau, in his early draft of the Social Contract (the Geneva Manuscript), who advances the second vision of “the science of the legislator” (GM I.iv, 168; II.i–vi, 179–94), elsewhere called “the true legislator's science” (L, 66).3 Our first task is to see how these two visions compare.         "
"2","Adam Smith is today famous as the champion of the “system of natural liberty”—that is, as the champion of a self‐regulating economic system which would seem to have little need, or even room for, the interventions of political actors. The associated fame of Smith's advocacy of such devices as the “invisible hand” and the theory of spontaneous or unplanned order further seem to suggest that Smith's political philosophy defends or engenders a minimization of the importance of political agency and consequently leads to a “deflection” of politics towards economics (see Cropsey 2001; Minowitz 1993). But if true, why then does Smith insist on articulating a science for the legislator? Thus Winch's helpful question: if indeed Smith means to teach that politics does better when directed by nature rather than the “active statesman as purposive moulder of events and outcomes,” then “what positive part is there for any legislator to play?” (Winch 1996, 94).         "
"3","Smith's answer rests on his distinction between two different types of statesmen, one of whom he agrees should be excluded from political action, but the other of whom he deems vital to the proper functioning of the system.4 He presents this contrast in one of his central discussions of the legislator. Here Smith distinguishes one directed by “the science of a legislator, whose deliberations ought to be governed by general principles which are always the same,” from “that insidious and crafty animal, vulgarly called a statesman or politician, whose councils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of affairs” (WN IV.ii.39). The distinguishing feature of legislative science, on this account, is its commitment to those “general principles” which prevent a politics so guided from degenerating into vulgar Machiavellianism. Elsewhere Smith repeats the claim. Even in noting the potential for general principles to be abused, he hints that “some general, and even systematical, idea of the perfection of policy and law, may no doubt be necessary for directing the views of the statesman” (TMS VI.ii.2.18).         "
"4","But what precisely did Smith have in mind in suggesting that political deliberation ought to be governed by attention to “general principles”? Charles Griswold notes that Smith's insistence that the “general principles” which ought to guide the science of the legislator “unquestionably echo” his discussion of those “general principles of law and government” described in the closing pages of TMS, in which he anticipates a book‐to‐come on natural jurisprudence (Griswold 1999, 36n59). There he distinguishes systems of positive law designed for particular states in particular historical periods from “the natural rules of justice independent of all positive institution.” The latter were the intended focus of his project on “what might properly be called natural jurisprudence, or a theory of the general principles which ought to run through and be the foundation of the laws of all nations”—a field of study he rigorously distinguishes from the study of “the particular institutions of any one nation” (cf. LJA I.i; LJB 1–3). This in turn led Smith to promise “an account of the general principles of law and government, and of the different revolutions they have undergone in the different ages and periods of society” (TMS VII.iv.36–37).5 And while this project was not in fact executed, Smith's essential claim is clear: that appreciation of the principles of natural justice is the “backbone” of the science of a legislator (Haakonssen 1981, 151).         "
"5","By grounding the science of the legislator in the universal norms of justice, Smith intended to provide a mechanism capable of elevating statesmanship above the politics of interest characteristic of his insidious and crafty “politician.” Yet Smith was also acutely aware that a statesmanship grounded in the abstract principles of natural justice is itself susceptible to abuses of another kind. His own failure to execute a treatise on the idea of natural justice itself suggests the difficulty of establishing its principles. But lacking a clear definition of such principles, ambitious politicians might well substitute their own more convenient abstractions. This is precisely the problem that Smith diagnoses in his famous portrait of the “man of system.” The man of system is first and foremost a man driven by his ideals: “apt to be very wise in his own conceit” he is “often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it” (TMS VI.ii.2.17). Indeed his fascination with his utopian vision inspires his political zealotry, for when this “spirit of system” mixes with a certain kind of “public spirit,” this “often inflames it even to the madness of fanaticism,” which in turn “intoxicates” all who fall under the sway of “the imaginary beauty of this ideal system” (TMS VI.ii.2.15). Caught up in this dazzling beauty, such visionaries seek in practice “to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great interests, or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it.” This leads to Smith's well‐known condemnation of the systemic political reformer who “seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess‐board,” indifferent to or unaware of the fact that “in the great chess‐board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might chuse to impress upon it” (TMS VI.ii.2.17). But good government requires that the statesman's hand not deviate from the path traced by the invisible hand. Smith repeatedly insists on this lesson in arguing for his system of natural liberty, claiming that people should always be given free rein to pursue their interests, as they always know these interests better than any superior might (e.g., WN IV.v.b.16; IV.v.b.43; IV.ix.51)."
"6","Legislative science is thus intended as an antidote to the enthusiasm of systematic reformers. Yet this itself prompts an obvious question: insofar as the “system of natural liberty” is itself a “system” in its own right, how can Smith guarantee that the legislator claiming to act in the name of this “system” will not himself be overcome by the “spirit of system”? The problem is made even more acute by his recognition that the legislator's tremendous abilities render him capable of effecting “the greatest revolutions … in the situations and opinions of mankind” (TMS VI.iii.28). Smith describes his remedy for this potential fanaticism in describing the importance of appreciating political circumstances. He nods at this even in venting his frustration with the man of system: not only does he exhibit “the highest degree of arrogance” and a predilection to “fancy himself the only wise and worthy man in the commonwealth,” but he moreover thinks “his fellow‐citizens should accommodate themselves to him and not he to them” (TMS VI.ii.2.18). Yet it is precisely an accommodation of interests and prejudices that Smith calls for in building actual nations if they are to be free of the fanaticism to which political idealism is prone."
"7","Smith's claim then is that the legislator must temper his commitment to idealism with an appreciation of the specific contexts in which he serves. Only by so doing will he accommodate his project to the people, rather than force the people to accommodate his project. But this claim sets the bar high for the legislator, as it compels him to cultivate a political wisdom or understanding different from that wisdom or understanding which might enable him to comprehend the principles of natural justice. Haakonssen nicely captures the distinction between these two forms of comprehension in distinguishing “system knowledge” from “contextual knowledge,” the knowledge of the connecting principles of a system from the knowledge that enables one to understand actual given political conditions (Haakonssen 1981, 79–82, 89; see also McNamara 1998, 87–91; Winch 1983, 510–11). This suggests that the science of the legislator requires a “superior prudence,” an appreciation of both the potential and limits of actual peoples for whom one hopes to make a normative legislative intervention (TMS VI.i.15).6 Such prudence is principally valuable as it enables legislators to shape their ideals to circumstances and thereby better guarantee that a political community will in fact receive the intended benefits of the legislation.         "
"8","Smith goes on to explain that an appreciation of such circumstances will lead not only to a tempering of idealism, but also to an appreciation of the limits of politics, and hence legislation, owing to the imperfectability of political phenomena (Griswold 1999, 301–10; Winch 1996, 123). Smith's favorite historical example of a legislator, Solon, is consistently praised for his capacity to legislate within the horizons of imperfection and his ability to craft a second‐best approach for such situations; hence his endorsement of a modern policy with the observation that “with all its imperfections, however, we may perhaps say of it what was said of the laws of Solon, that, though not the best in itself, it is the best which the interests, prejudices, and temper of the times would admit of” (WN IV.v.b.53).7 The Solonic example is itself the example Smith recommends to remedy the idealism of men of system (Winch 1996, 96–97, 104–5). Thus the best legislator         "
"9","                        "
"10","will respect the established powers and privileges even of individuals, and still more those of the great orders and societies, into which the state is divided. Though he should consider some of them as in some measure abusive, he will content himself with moderating, what he often cannot annihilate without great violence. When he cannot conquer the rooted prejudices of the people by reason and persuasion, he will not attempt to subdue them by force; but will religiously observe what, by Cicero, is justly called the divine maxim of Plato, never to use violence to his country no more than to his parents. He will accommodate, as well as he can, his public arrangements to the confirmed habits and prejudices of the people; and will remedy as well as he can, the inconveniencies which may flow from the want of those regulations which the people are averse to submit to. When he cannot establish the right, he will not disdain to ameliorate the wrong; but like Solon, when he cannot establish the best system of laws, he will endeavour to establish the best that the people can bear. (TMS VI.ii.2.16)"
"11","Here Smith teaches that political humility is a prerequisite for the science of a legislator. In contrast to the arrogance and superiority of the man of system, Smith here praises the humility of statesmen who work with rather than against the prejudices and preconditions of a nation. Such statesmen, Smith further insists, know the limits of their wisdom; fully conscious that they lack the omniscience of the divine, they instead represent the more limited “perfection of human political wisdom” (Griswold 1999, 308). Unlike Caesar and Alexander, such legislators never fall under the spell of the delusive and “excessive self‐admiration” that might suggest the direct inspiration of divinity (TMS VI.iii.28). A properly scientific legislator thus strikes a balance between the ideals of natural justice and the reality of actual conditions and thereby achieves a salutary moderation in steering a course between the hubris of scientific management and the fanaticism of the idealists.8 Smith's emphasis on respecting settled habits and prejudices indeed represents a recovery of the ancient conception of the distinction between the best and the most fitting or best possible regime (see Aristotle 1984, 1269a30, 1337a10; Griswold 1999, 305).         "
"12","Before turning to Rousseau, a final aspect of Smith's approach to the science of the legislator demands notice. Smith's reputation for a commitment to limited political interventions in the civil or economic spheres would seem to commit him to a restricted view of the proper sphere of the legislator within a well‐ordered state; there indeed would seem to be little room for a legislator if in fact “little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice; all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things” (Smith in Stewart 1982, 322). But elsewhere—and particularly in a little‐noted passage in The Theory of Moral Sentiments—Smith takes a much stronger stance on the necessity of moral legislation:         "
"13","                        "
"14","The civil magistrate is entrusted with the power not only of preserving the public peace by restraining injustice, but of promoting the prosperity of the commonwealth, by establishing good discipline, and by discouraging every sort of vice and impropriety; he may prescribe rules, therefore, which not only prohibit mutual injuries among fellow‐citizens, but command mutual good offices to a certain degree … Of all the duties of a law‐giver, however, this, perhaps, is that which it requires the greatest delicacy and reserve to execute with propriety and judgment. To neglect it altogether exposes the commonwealth to many gross disorders and shocking enormities, and to push it too far is destructive of all liberty, security, and justice. (TMS II.ii.1.8)"
"15","Smith does not provide precise rules for the conduct of such judgment, but from his comments above it is evident that he believes good legislation requires a middle ground be established between libertarianism and totalitarianism. But even as Smith was silent on this front, the attempt to define this middle ground was to become the particular intention of Rousseau."
"16","The study of Smith was once dominated by the famed Adam Smith Problem: the question of how to reconcile Smith's analysis of sympathy in moral life with his analysis of self‐interest in economic life.9 But Rousseau seems to suffer from his own Problem.10 Aside from the Problem initially posed by Cassirer—the question of whether Rousseau is better seen as a classical eudaemonist or Kantian deontologist—a more political Problem concerns whether he is better understood as a friend of constitutional democracy or as a friend of totalitarianism.11 Resolution of this question is unlikely to be reached soon and is not attempted here, but attention to his conception of the science of the legislator and how it compares to Smith's helps illuminate certain moderate aspects of his thought, and especially his willingness to accommodate the characteristic prejudices of modernity.         "
"17","To begin by suggesting that there might be anything moderate or accommodating in Rousseau's science may at first seem odd. The most famous account of the legislator in Rousseau's corpus—the account offered in Book II, chapter vii of the Social Contract—certainly seems to read as a direct challenge to, if not rejection of, several fundamental tenets of the Smithean science. First Rousseau openly questions whether the divine and the political should be separated, arguing that legislation benefits considerably from the popular impression of the legislator's intimate association with the divine. Further, where Smith cautions against the attempt to “impress” on men principles foreign to their nature, Rousseau seems to endorse precisely this in claiming that the nation‐building legislator's first and most important task is to “transform” the people:         "
"18","                        "
"19","Anyone who dares to institute a people must feel capable of, so to speak, changing human nature; of transforming each individual who by himself is a perfect and solitary whole into part of a larger whole from which that individual would as it were receive his life and his being; of weakening man's constitution in order to strengthen it; of substituting a partial and moral existence for the independent and physical existence we have all received from nature. In a word, he must take from man his own forces in order to give him forces which are foreign to him and of which he cannot make use without the help of others. The more these natural forces are dead and destroyed, the greater and more lasting are the acquired ones, and the more solid and lasting also is the institution. (SC II.vii.3; GM II.ii, 179–80; cf. PE, 12–13)"
"20","It is difficult to imagine a position more repugnant to Smith's. Not only does Rousseau's legislator annihilate the prejudices that Smith's is concerned to respect, but he also seeks the alteration of human nature itself. Rousseau elaborates on his intentions in this regard in Emile. Such denaturing is necessary, he explains, because of the violence already done to human nature by the civilizing institutions that Smith defends. It is the corruptions of civilized man, or the bourgeois, which make it necessary “to denature man, to take his absolute existence from him in order to give him a relative one and transport the I into the common unity” (E, 40). Yet modern legislators are not alone in seeking to “transform” human nature; the greatest ancient legislators, Rousseau suggests, had similar ambitions. Thus we are told that when Lycurgus legislated for Spartans he “transformed them into beings more than merely human,” that Moses “made bold to transform this herd of servile emigrants into a political society, a free people,” and that Numa gave Rome strength by “transforming the robbers into citizens…by mildly restrictive institutions that bound each of them to the rest and all of them to the soil” (GP, 6–7). Such legislators cannot help but seem immoderate when compared to Smith's.         "
"21","But Rousseau's call for “transformation” hardly exhausts his conception of the legislator, for alongside this grandiose vision lies another more moderate vision. In the published version of Social Contract, this moderate vision takes the form of an attempt to mitigate what the work's subtitle calls the “principles of political right” with the “maxims of politics” (SC III.xviii.3). As Arthur Melzer and Roger Masters have demonstrated, the Social Contract at its heart seeks to establish a balance between these two principles—a balance between, on the one hand, a commitment to the abstract principles of “universal justice” (SC II.vi.2), and on the other, the practical maxims of politics necessary to bring a project to fruition (see especially Kelly 1987, 322; Masters 1968, 290–93, 301–13; Masters 1972, 412–18; Melzer 1990, 114–19). Rousseau's study of the aims of legislation in the chapter prior to his description of the legislator in SC II.vii makes clear that such a balance is necessary, as a commitment to universal justice in the absence of positive law cannot guarantee the establishment of actual justice; hence Rousseau's reminder that while “all justice comes from God, he alone is its source,” it remains true that to be realized, justice requires a set of positive institutions; hence “conventions and laws are therefore necessary to combine rights with duties and to bring justice back to its object” (SC II.vi.2). Such a conception will remind us of Smith's commitment to balancing natural justice and positive law at the end of TMS. But more crucially, the commitment to establishing a balance between the best and the best possible also serves to mitigate the seeming extremism of Rousseau's most rhetorically charged comments on the legislator and his transformative duties. In this way Rousseau's conception of the legislator leads back to Smith's, for the attempt to establish a balance between “universal justice” and the “maxims of politics” parallels Smith's commitment to describing a balance between the universal principles of “natural justice” and “contextual knowledge.”         "
"22","This parallel is extended when we turn to Rousseau's explicit comments on the science of the legislator. Rousseau's first and most complete account comes in the first draft of the Social Contract, or the Geneva Manuscript. As Masters details, Rousseau comprehensively revised this section of the work, with SC II.vii virtually all that remains of the sustained investigation of the science of the legislator that occupied most of Book II of GM; the “science of the legislator” is never mentioned in the final published version (Masters 1968, 293 and 1972, 413, 417). Yet Rousseau does explicitly mention the “true legislator's science” in the Letter to d'Alembert. Here he explains that the mere task of crafting and writing legislation is not a difficult one: “On the whole, the institution of laws is not such a marvelous thing that any man of sense and equity could not easily find those which, well observed, would be the most beneficial for society.” The challenge of legislating lies not simply in writing good laws, but in writing laws well suited to a people: “the force of the laws has its measure, and the force of the vices that they repress has one too. It is only after one has compared these two quantities and found that the former surpasses the latter that the execution of the laws can be depended upon. The knowledge of these relations constitutes the true legislator's science” (L, 66). The central claim here is that legislation cannot be judged good in the abstract, but only by the degree of its fittingness for the people and problems for which it is established.         "
"23","By insisting that wise legislators should strive to fit their laws to the nature of the people and the needs of the state, Rousseau takes an important step back from the utopian insistence on “transforming” and “denaturing” that he elsewhere seems to advocate. This continues when he offers us a historical example of a practitioner of the “true legislator's science.” In the Letter to d'Alembert, his example is Solon. Solon did more than simply author a legal code, Rousseau explains: “The problem is to adapt this code to the people for which it is made and to the things about which it decrees to such an extent that its execution follows from the very conjunction of these relations; it is to impose on the people, after the fashion of Solon, less the best laws in themselves than the best of which it admits in the given situation” (L, 66). In echoing (or anticipating) the endorsement of Solon by Smith, Rousseau makes plain that legislative science is a science of the second‐best.12 Indeed throughout the Letter one finds less idealism than a realist insistence on the need to accommodate proposals to circumstances: “let us not seek for the chimaera of perfection but for the best possible according to the nature of man and the constitution of society” (L, 110).         "
"24","In GM Rousseau would further explore this aspect of the Solonic or second‐best approach to legislation. His constant lesson throughout GM is that “these general objects of all good institutions should be modified in each country according to the relationships that arise as much from the local situation as from the character of the inhabitants; and it is on the basis of these relationships that each people must be assigned a particular system of legislation that is the best, not perhaps in itself, but for the State for which it is intended” (GM II.vi, 193; SC II.xi.4; cf. E, 34–35). In developing this claim, Rousseau makes clear that legislators must tailor specific policies to the exigencies of particular customs and circumstances. In GM this contrast takes the form of a distinction between “right” on the one hand and “those matters of expediency which are indispensable to every good institution” on the other (GM II.iii, 183). The published version drops the explicit distinction between right and expedience, but repeats the fundamental claim that this distinction introduces, namely, that “just as a skillful architect, before putting up a building, observes and tests the ground to see whether it can bear the weight, so the wise founder does not start by drafting laws at random, but first examines whether the people for whom he intends them is suited to bear them” (GM II.iii, 183; cf. SC II.viii.1). The lesson in each case is that legislators must begin their efforts to improve men by taking them as they are (Masters 1972, 429). This leads Rousseau to insist that one should strive always to work within the context of the material one has been given: “he should not try to change the institution of a people that is already subject to laws, let alone try to restore an institution that has been abolished or to revive worn out mechanisms” (GM II.iii, 188). Further, it is the task of a wise legislator to take not just people but also conditions as they are, and hence the call for the lawgiver to attend to “the location, the climate, the soil, the morals, the neighbors, and all the particular relations of the people that it was his task to institute” (PE, 12). Seen thusly, the science of the legislator tempers the idealism that a sole emphasis on transforming or denaturing might otherwise encourage.13"
"25","One final aspect of Rousseau's science of the legislator requires review before turning to the practical political writings. It has been argued above that common to both Rousseau's and Smith's science is an insistence on the import of tailoring legislation to the ills of the times. But this suggestion was to have a particularly important effect, and take on a unique cast, in the practical political writings that we are about to examine. To see how, we turn to Rousseau's final argument for the import of accommodating context. Such accommodation is necessary, he insists, because the particular ills of a given society themselves contain the key to their reconciliation. This is suggested explicitly in GM:"
"26","                        "
"27","But although there is no natural and general society among men, although men become unhappy and wicked in becoming sociable, although the laws of justice and equality mean nothing to those who live both in the freedom of the state of nature and subject to the needs of the social state, far from thinking that there is neither virtue nor happiness for us and that heaven has abandoned us without resources to the depravation of the species, let us attempt to draw from the ill itself the remedy that should cure it. Let us use new associations to correct, if possible, the defect of the general association. Let our violent speaker himself judge its success. Let us show him in perfected art the reparation of the ills that the beginnings of art caused to nature. (GM I.ii, 162)"
"28","Herein lies what Starobinski has called “the fundamental insight” of Rousseau's political philosophy: the idea that the most effective political remedies are homeopathic, or internal to the disease being treated (Starobinski 1993, 118–31, quote at 127; Forman‐Barzilai 2003, 462–63). But what precise form should this homeopathic remedy take? And put more directly: what are the “ills that the beginnings of art caused to nature?” Rousseau's most direct treatment of this question comes in the Discourse on Inequality. In describing the transition between the pure state of nature and the corruptions of the civil state, Rousseau identifies a middle position characterized by precisely the incipient ills that separate art from nature. This he describes as the “period in the development of human faculties, occupying a just mean between the indolence of the primitive state and the petulant activity of our amour propre”—the state in which the “idea of consideration” had been awakened in its nascent form, and “public esteem acquired a price” (SD II.16–18). In what follows I argue that it is Rousseau's identification of the civilizing potential of incipient love of consideration properly directed that characterizes his moderate advice to Corsica and Poland. The remedy for their ills, Rousseau argues, lies not in the violent uprooting of the passions and prejudices that constitute the evidence of their corruption, but rather the redirection of such passions and prejudices towards more useful ends. For if indeed it is true that today “everybody wants to be admired,” it is then necessary “to excite the desire and to facilitate the means of attracting by virtue the same admiration that one today attracts only by wealth” (OC III, 502–3; cf. GP, 17).         "
"29","The previous section of the article sought to demonstrate that beneath Rousseau's extreme depiction of the legislator in his theoretical writings lies a more moderate claim: that so far from denaturing or transforming citizens, wise legislators instead meet them where they stand. This same tension is to be found in Rousseau's practical writings on Corsica and Poland.14 In each of these works, Rousseau's extreme republican rhetoric is striking. But when examined closely, so far from revealing Rousseau as an advocate of political denaturing or the recovery of supposed ancient disinterestedness, these writings instead suggest a more prudential approach to legislation. In each essay, Rousseau crafts solutions to the problems of existing regimes by appealing to and encouraging passions and prejudices endemic to these regimes. As such, they stand as examples of Rousseau's efforts to practice the fundamental task of legislative science: namely, “to draw from the ill itself the remedy that should cure it.” Yet it is not only this general formulation that binds Rousseau's approach to Smith's. The principal ill that Rousseau diagnoses in each of the nations he examines is precisely a form of the incipient selfishness characteristic of modernity diagnosed in the Second Discourse (see especially SD II.27, 52, 57). Further, in each of these writings, the remedy proposed is not simply eradication of amour‐propre, but its redirection to the promotion of the common good (Dent 1988, 225; cf. Masters 1968, 380–82). Smith's and Rousseau's sciences of a legislator thus share a common aim: namely, demonstrating how vanity can be steered to become an agent of social stability and the promotion of common well‐being. The difference in their sciences lies in the forms of selfishness to which their respective legislators train their attention; Smith's legislator seems to have in mind the prudent regulation of economic self‐interest (see, e.g., Muller 1993; Rosenberg 1960), whereas Rousseau seems more interested in the proper regulation of the love of honor and glory. But both are keenly sensitive to the empire of opinion that dominates modernity, and both recognize that the central task of modern legislators is to cultivate and thereby redirect the vices modernity encourages. This strategy is suggested in the discussion of censors in the Social Contract:         "
"30","                        "
"31","It is useless to draw a distinction between a nation's morals and the objects of its esteem; for all this follows from the same principle and necessarily converges. Among all peoples of the world, not nature but opinion determines the choice of their pleasures. Reform men's opinions and their morals will be purified of themselves. One always loves what is fine or what one finds to be so, but it is in this judgment that one is mistaken; hence it is this judgment that has to be regulated. Whoever judges morals judges honor, and whoever judges honor takes opinion as his law. (SC IV.vii.3; cf. Masters 1968, 385)               "
"32","Rousseau applies precisely this strategy in his own advice to actual states. It is perhaps most evident in his advice to Geneva in the Letter to d'Alembert. The seeming story of the Letter is that Geneva, in its uncorrupted purity, should ban the theater and thereby preserve its republican simplicity. But the true story, always present just beneath the surface, is that corruption has already made significant headway in Geneva, and that its efforts might be better spent attempting to meliorate that which it is already too late to cure. Thus directly after introducing us to the “true legislator's science,” Rousseau asks,         "
"33","                        "
"34","By what means can the government get a hold on morals? I answer that it is by public opinion. If our habits in retirement are born of our own sentiments, in society they are born of others' opinions. When we do not live in ourselves but in others, it is their judgments which guide everything. Nothing appears good or desirable to individuals which the public has not judged to be such, and the only happiness which most men know is to be esteemed happy. (L, 67)"
"35","So far from a hopeful call of the idealist for transformation, Rousseau's most forthright advice for the ennobling of his fatherland demands a concession to precisely the worst of all corruptions, the empire of amour‐propre. Put differently: the best state he knows is incapable of receiving the best absolutely, and Rousseau must rest content with focusing on the transformation of a nation whose tastes are already corrupted. Such advice is in fact consistent across Rousseau's works. He knows that he “may be told that anyone who has to govern men should not look for a perfection beyond their nature of which they are not capable,” yet he remains optimistic that “it is not impossible to teach them to love one object rather than another, and to love what is genuinely fine rather than what is malformed,” and “thus to transform into a sublime virtue the dangerous disposition that gives rise to all of our vices” (PE, 36). This advice would form the foundation of his practical legislative advice to Corsica and Poland.15"
"36","Rousseau's Plan for a Constitution of Corsica presents itself on its face as a rejection of accommodation and an endorsement of the politics of transformation. Its introduction reads as an explicit rejection of accommodation to exigencies. Noting that the separation of the government from the people is the source of Corsica's difficulties, Rousseau explains that in such a case, wise men, “observing relations of suitability, form the government for the nation. Nevertheless, there is something much better to do, that is to form the nation for the government” (CC, 123). And he is clear on how Corsica should best pursue this course. Throughout his piece Rousseau is unstinting in his admonitions for the Corsicans not to encourage commerce. So far from advocating an accommodation of Corsica within wider European trade networks, he instead calls the Corsicans to take all possible means to ensure their economic self‐sufficiency. Not only must they discourage dependence on money, but they must also discourage the growth of large urban centers and encourage agriculture that will promote the self‐sufficiency of both the nation and its citizens, and in so doing eradicate the indolence, selfishness, and “stupid pride of bourgeois” (CC, 131).         "
"37","In recommending this course of moral simplicity and economic self‐sufficiency, Rousseau of course seems far from Smith's own practical recommendations for Britain.16 Yet as the essay develops, Rousseau moderates the extremism of his opening republican sallies, qualifying his initial statements with the disclaimers that his hope was “not to destroy private property absolutely, because that is impossible, but to restrict it within the narrowest limits” (CC, 148), and his hope that even if money cannot practically be done away with altogether, “at least it can be reduced to so small a thing that it will be difficult for abuses to arise” (CC, 147). As he continues he also suggests that he has not forgotten his earlier lessons on tailoring proposals to specific conditions, reminding us that there are qualities “in the nature and the soil of each country” that render a particular type or form of government particularly well suited to it (CC, 127), and that wise legislators must begin by taking the principle of “national character” into account (CC, 133). In so doing Rousseau reminds us that he remains aware that he is not legislating for a new people, but one with cultural traditions and institutions and habits.         "
"38","Furthermore, Rousseau also explicitly recognizes that Corsica is the product of a series of specific historical circumstances. In the Social Contract, he praised Corsica as the only country in Europe still capable of receiving legislation, owing to “the valor and steadfastness with which this brave people was able to recover and defend its freedom” (SC II.x.6). Back then Corsica seemed the perfect model of a state “fit for legislation” on account of its self‐sufficiency, independence, moderate wealth, and civic affection (SC II.x.5). But what does Rousseau find when he reexamines Corsica from the point of view of a potential legislator? Now he explains that the fundamental fact that shaped the Corsicans was their occupation by the Genoese who succeeded in “crushing” Corsica and reducing it to abject poverty and dependence. This leads him to observe that even though Corsica has retained some of its original virtues, in its servitude it contracted tremendous vices that cannot be removed without recourse to extreme measures (CC, 137).         "
"39","How then does Rousseau respond to such incipient corruption? His actual remedy is in fact far more accommodating than his opening rhetoric might have led one to expect. In particular he strives to accommodate his policies to the main passion that has already been encouraged in the Corsicans, presumably the consequence of their occupation at the hands of the commercial Genoese; interestingly, it is precisely the same passion on which his famous diagnosis of corruption in the SD rests:"
"40","                        "
"41","Thus in order to awaken a nation's activity it is necessary to give it great desires, great hopes, great positive motives for acting. When well examined, the great motive powers that make men act are reduced to two, sensual pleasure and vanity, still if you remove from the first everything that belongs to the second, in the final analysis, you will find that everything is reduced almost to vanity alone. (CC, 153)"
"42","This is a remarkable claim in light of what has come before. For not only does Rousseau here concede that his legislative project for Corsica is conceived within the horizon of the second best rather than the best absolutely, but he also suggests that the key to its success lies in the prudent directing of the chief passion of modernity. He goes on to explain that the vanity of which he here speaks “is only one of the two branches of amour‐propre,” the modern moral failing on which SD focused. But rather than uproot amour‐propre, he here suggests that the legislator's task lies in redirecting it from vanity, its base form, to pride, its less base form (CC, 153–54).17 What is striking then is the fact that even though Rousseau is clearly an advocate of ennobling the moral conditions of the modern Corsicans, the ascent that he envisions is the limited or moderate ascent from one form of amour‐propre to another.         "
"43","Rousseau's advice to Poland follows a trajectory similar to his advice to Corsica. By far the most striking feature of GP is its fervor for a recovery of republican simplicity. Yet read closely it appears that rather than simply advocating the rejection of corruption, Rousseau means to encourage the Poles to discover a solution to their vices that emerges from their incipient corruption. Rousseau's advice in this respect constitutes a practical application of the vanity‐directing project described in CC. Yet again this may seem an odd place to start. GP frequently seems as adamant as CC in calling for an institution of ideals and rejection of contextual accommodation, particularly with regard to modernity. This stridency is particularly evident in the choice Rousseau compels the Poles to make between agriculture and commerce. “If what you wish is merely to make a great splash,” he counsels, “cultivate the sciences, the arts, commerce, industry.”“But if perchance you wish to be a free nation, a peaceful nation, a wise nation,” you must both recover older customs and tastes, and “cause money to become an object of contempt and, if possible, useless besides.”18 Yet either way, one must choose: “Since the two plans of action I speak of are for the most part mutually exclusive, you must, above all, not try to combine them” (GP, 67–68). Thus not only does a moderate accommodation seem unlikely, Rousseau also here states his preference for ancient virtue over modern virtue—a predilection in keeping with his call to the Poles to “seize the opportunity afforded by the events of the present moment, and raise souls to the pitch of the souls of the ancients” (GP, 12). And one must not be gentle in so doing. Sumptuary laws are not enough to ennoble men's souls and “stamp out luxury”: “You must reach deep into men's hearts and uproot it by implanting there healthier and nobler tastes” (GP, 18).         "
"44","Here again the plan seems clear: not moderation but dire measures are necessary if corruption is to be defeated and expelled. Yet elsewhere Rousseau reminds us that he has not forgotten the prudence of the legislator's science. In the opening of the book he reminds us of the importance of sensitivity to context. “One must know thoroughly the nation for which one is building,” lest the final product, “however excellent it may be in itself, will prove imperfect when it is acted upon” (GP, 1). Rousseau presents his own proposal as tailored to the Poles, and thus an exception to the pan‐European legislative systems common in his day; rather than imitate others, he seeks to craft legislation suited to Poland itself (GP, 11, 80, 82, 86). But what then does he find when he turns to the nation in question? The truth is that it fits his model of the ideal state for legislation no better than had Corsica. Poland is hardly the sort of small nation in which the bonds of civic affection guarantee national self‐identification and unity, but rather a large state, wracked by internal faction and dissension, and bordered by large, powerful neighbors (GP, 10, 31; cf. GM II.iii, 183–84; SC II.x.5). In addition, it seems that Poland may be no more free of the corruptions endemic to modernity than the rest of Europe. Thus just before examining the three great legislators of antiquity, Rousseau describes the difference between the ancients and the moderns:"
"45","                        "
"46","What prevents us from being the kind of men they were? The prejudices, the base philosophy, and the passions of narrow self‐interest which, along with indifference to the welfare of others, have been inculcated in all our hearts by ill‐devised institutions, in which we find no trace of the hand of genius. (GP, 5)"
"47","This of course admits of several different readings. On the one hand, it might be seen as a call for modern legislators to emulate those ancients who sought to transform corrupted peoples. On the other hand, Rousseau explicitly means to remind us of our distance from the ostensible disinterestedness of ancient republicanism in insisting that “we” today are shaped by “prejudices” as well as by the “passions of narrow self‐interest”—indeed it is to this fact that his advocacy of Polish nationalism has been traced (Hassner 1997, 209). But such a formulation brings Rousseau much closer to Smith; both emphasize the largely overlooked fact that the proper task of legislators is principally to attend to these existing prejudices and passions (cf. Danford 1980, 694–95). Such advice is indeed fully in keeping with Rousseau's earlier admonition that “once customs are established and prejudices have taken root, it is a dangerous and foolhardy undertaking to want to touch them” (GM II.iii, 184).         "
"48","As we read on, it at least becomes clear that Rousseau is concerned to appeal to the modern passions, if not precisely the “passions of narrow self‐interest.” Interestingly he uses the example of the ancients to introduce this decidedly modern approach. Thus he explains the principal aim of Greek legislators seeking to fashion peoples was to “set them on fire with the spirit of emulation,” which “tied them tightly to the fatherland” (GP, 8). Rousseau's conception of classical republican virtue, that is, is itself founded on the proper channeling of amour‐propre via emulation, rather than the recovery of disinterestedness. But what is striking here is less Rousseau's endorsement of ancient methods than his sense that such methods might be particularly suited to modern Poland. For in suggesting that emulation and “the love of glory” will prove the best means of shaping the hearts and minds of the Poles, Rousseau advocates a prudent means of appealing to the concern for the self that is fundamental not merely to the ancient love of honor but also to the modern love of recognition (cf. WN V.i.f.4; cf. TMS I.iii.2)."
"49","In seeking to encourage emulation, Rousseau's goal is to direct the native love of honor in the hearts of the individual Poles to work for the common good. In this sense, it is lesson analogous to the lesson taught in Corsica. There Rousseau's goal was not to abolish amour‐propre, but to effect an ascent from vanity to pride, or its more base to its less base form. The same movement is suggested in the examination of selfishness that Rousseau makes in Poland:         "
"50","                        "
"51","One can make men act only by appealing to their self‐interest. That I know. Of all interests, however, that in pecuniary gain is the most evil, the most vile, the readiest to be corrupted, though also—in the eyes of one who has knowledge of the human heart (I reiterate this with confidence and shall always insist upon it)—the least important and compelling. In the heart of every man there is a natural reservoir of several strong passions…Learn how to foment these passions, learn how to open up a direct path to their satisfaction that can be travelled without money, and money will soon lose its price. (GP, 70)"
"52","The effect of this passage is twofold. First, Rousseau clearly distances his position from that of the idealism that would seek to overcome selfishness; his legislative proposals rest on steering self‐interest well rather than attempting to transcend it. Secondly, Rousseau makes clear how he intends to steer selfishness, namely by attempting to direct it to the love of glory and away from the love of wealth. Only in this way, Rousseau insists, can the characteristic vice of modernity, the love of opinion, be employed to recover what modernity has lost. Thus the remedy most likely to succeed:"
"53","                        "
"54","It consists in seeing to it that every citizen shall feel the eyes of his fellow‐countrymen upon him every moment of the day; that no man shall move upward and win success except by public approbation; that every post and employment shall be filled in accordance with the nation's wishes; and that everyone—from the least of the nobles, or even the least of the peasants, up to the king himself, if that were possible—shall be so completely dependent upon public esteem as to be unable to do anything, acquire anything, or achieve anything without it. The resulting emulation among all the citizens would produce a ferment that, in its turn, would awaken that patriotic fervor which raises men—as nothing else can raise them—above themselves. (GP, 87)"
"55","The key to elevating the moral character of the Poles is to meet them where they stand. So far from insisting that the love of opinion engendered by amour‐propre should be abolished, Rousseau employs it as the source of its transcendence. Already corrupted by an extreme solicitude for esteem, the Poles' best hope lies in total submission to opinion. The division of the bourgeois between his private happiness and his solicitude for public esteem which always transports him outside of himself is to be rectified by rendering the solicitude for esteem the only source of his happiness: “let him be conscious always that every detail of his conduct is being observed and evaluated by his fellow‐citizens, that no step he takes will go unnoticed, that no action he performs will be disregarded, and that the good and the evil he does are being posted upon a scrupulously accurate balance‐sheet that will affect every subsequent moment of his life” (GP, 88). The struggle for public recognition must thus become the only concern of the good citizen (GP, 15, 22, 64, 102). Rousseau hopes that such competition for the honors and esteem of the public will ultimately lead each to “channel all their efforts into forwarding the glory and prosperity of the state” (GP, 52). In such a manner, his legislative science comes full circle back to Smith's, for what is true of Smith's market holds true for Rousseau's Poland: not the disinterested love of virtue, but the competition of each with all, in which every individual is driven by a desire for the external good of esteem, becomes a mechanism for promoting the universal well‐being of the whole."
"56","Above I have argued that both Rousseau's and Smith's visions of the science of the legislator seek to promote moderation insofar as each emphasizes the need to mitigate a commitment to the universal principles of justice with a sensitivity to the exigencies of a given political context. Yet this emphasis on expedience, or moderation, itself raises a heretofore unaddressed question: how is Rousseau's concealed moderation to be squared with the explicit political immoderation of SC II.vii?19 It is this question that the article's remainder will address. Yet doing so requires addressing a second question. For while it has been argued above that both Smith and Rousseau are dedicated to tempering the ideal with the real, it is by no means clear that they have similar conceptions of what it is that requires tempering. That is, it is not clear that Smith's vision of the “general principles” or “rules of natural justice” is commensurate with Rousseau's vision of the principles of “universal justice” or the “principles of political right.” Thus we might ask: given their shared commitment to the moderation necessary for the instantiation of their respective political ideals, how do Rousseau and Smith understand those principles themselves?         "
"57","We begin with Smith. The foundations of Smith's system of natural liberty are to be found in his commitment to the existence of “rules of natural justice.” The question has rightly been raised by several of Smith's commentators as to whether in fact the sort of skeptical epistemology that Smith articulates allows him to claim that the principles of natural justice are in fact humanly knowable; on this view, it is held that the “standpoint external to the human spectacle” necessary for the investigation of the first principles of natural justice is “unavailable” (Griswold 1999, 256–58 and 2006, 182–86; Fleischacker 2004, 166–69). This question of whether Smith's skepticism can be reconciled with his faith in the existence of natural order is important and demands separate treatment. But what is most important for us here is less the potential epistemological problems posed by Smith's conception of natural order than the positive political work that this conception does in Smith's system of natural liberty. Indeed, in one sense, the fact that the universal principles of natural justice cannot be comprehensively known is of the greatest political import for Smith. Smith's primary defense of individual liberty in the Wealth of Nations is founded not in an appeal to natural rights but rather in the evidence that he adduces for what Griswold calls “the epistemic limits of statesmanship” (Griswold 1999, 302–4). One of Smith's principal normative intentions in presenting the science of the legislator in the manner that he does is clearly to induce humility—and hence a greater restraint—via the reminder that the imperfection of our ability to understand natural order ought to restrain our interventions.         "
"58","Yet such an approach to legislation can only work if indeed the system of natural liberty can be assumed to operate with minimal external involvement. Much of Smith's positive political program rests on the claim that natural order is more efficient than the constructs of men, a view that itself seems to be founded on Smith's faith in the existence of a providential or teleological natural order (see esp. Alvey 2004; Hill 2001; Waterman 2002; cf. Haakonssen 1981, 77). Put differently, Smith's argument against the manipulation of human interests by ambitious legislators is founded on the claim that human interests are naturally self‐regulating and can promote the common interest of the whole, independent of extensive human intervention. It is, however, precisely this claim that Rousseau is most concerned to challenge. Despite his several explicit invocations of natural order, Rousseau consistently denies that it can be known or might serve as a guide for political order. Given this skepticism, the fundamental legislative task is not imitation of natural order but creation of an artificial order to replace a natural order that is largely unknowable, and to the degree that it is knowable, appears to be inimical to justice.         "
"59","Rousseau's consistent claim on this front—indeed the claim that necessitates the extensive political proposals of the Social Contract—is the claim that unregulated nature tends towards injustice. Thus Rousseau's striking rejoinder to Smith's natural justice is that nature, left unto itself, tends to promote injustice: “Far from there being an alliance between private interest and the general good, they are mutually exclusive in the natural order of things” (GM I.ii, 160). Consequently, Rousseau claims, nature cannot serve as a guide for politics (GM I.ii, 158–60; cf. PE, 6; Melzer 1983, 639, 645), insofar as politics must artificially create the justice that is absent from nature. Hence Rousseau's departure from Smith: where Smith's “libertarianism” finds its anchor in his conviction that the natural order is capable of self‐regulating private interest for the sake of general interest, Rousseau argues that it is precisely nature's insufficiency in this regard that requires replacing natural disorder with artificial order. And hence Rousseau's version of Hume's sensible knave problem. Left unto nature, he insists, man necessarily follows his selfish instincts, and it is this that necessitates creation of a comprehensive conventional order with the sole purpose of redirecting individuals from the pursuit of their “apparent interest” towards an appreciation of their interest “properly understood” (GM I.ii, 163)—that is to say, politics must be dedicated to “substituting justice for instinct” (GM I.ii–iii, 163–65; SC I.viii.1).20 It is then Rousseau's pessimism over the existence of natural justice that leads him to propose the creation through convention of “the rules of rational natural right” in order to supplant what goes under the name of “natural right properly so called,” and is “based only on a true but very vague sentiment that is often stifled by love of ourselves” (GM II.iv, 191). In this light, Rousseau's positivism is founded on the rejection of the principles of natural justice that Smith is concerned to establish. “Law comes before justice and not justice before law” precisely because the injustice of natural interest demands it: “The true principles of the just and unjust must, therefore, be sought in the fundamental and universal law of the greatest good of all, and not in the private relations between one man and another; and there is no particular rule of justice that cannot be easily deduced from that first law” (GM II.iv, 190–91; cf. GM I.vii, 178; PE 19; Melzer 1983, 640–42). This in turn becomes the task of the legislator. Realizing the absence of natural justice, the legislator is charged with the responsibility of replacing natural law with positive law (GM I.iii; SC I.i.2).21"
"60","How then do Smith's and Rousseau's conceptions of the science of the legislator compare? Their fundamental agreement, I have argued, lies in their shared insistence that legislators must temper their efforts at instituting general principles with a prudential and moderate sensitivity to the conditions and contexts in which they work. In particular they require an appreciation of the “passions” and “prejudices” native to the people for whom they legislate, as well as an appreciation of the degree to which these native passions and prejudices have been transformed by exposure to passions and prejudices of alternative provenance. Their difference then lies not in their positions on the need to accommodate the conditions of modernity—on which they agree—but rather their differing conceptions of the ideals that such accommodations are intended to instantiate. Rousseau's science of the legislator, dedicated to creating the principles of political right, in this respect sharply clashes with Smith's. Where Smith seeks to preserve natural justice, Rousseau seeks to create justice to remedy the challenges that an unregulated nature would otherwise pose. Where the goal of Smith's moderation is then to restrain the claims of political life and thereby allow for the persistence of nature in society, Rousseau's legislative moderation is dedicated to the comparatively immoderate goal of transcending the injustice and chaos that are, on his view, endemic to nature."
"61","Contemporary nation builders stand to gain from attention to Smith's and Rousseau's agreements and disagreements. It would be dangerous to suggest that any thinker in the history of political philosophy can provide ready answers to our problems; attempting to extract contemporary lessons from historical texts would be particularly egregious in the present instance, in which the texts in question teach the import of appreciating nuances and particularities in discrete situations and of resisting urges to legislate via imposition of ideal templates. At the same time, the Enlightenment's conception of the science of the legislator is worthy of our attention for at least two reasons. First, for all their internal disagreements, current debates over nation building concur in recognizing that America is likely to be engaged in nation building for some time, and that we have thus far failed to establish an adequate framework for dealing with its challenges (Dobbins 2003, xiii–xxix; Fukuyama 2006, 8–12). Contemporary lack of clarity thus provides one argument in favor of returning to the Enlightenment. Yet more importantly, the Enlightenment's conception of the science of the legislator also enables us to understand better both the necessary disposition required of nation builders, as well as how nation builders might most effectively cultivate a no less necessary receptivity to the dispositions of the peoples who comprise the nation to be built.         "
"62","With regard to the former, Smith and Rousseau describe a disposition likely to be both more sustainable and more successful than those often seen today. Recent American nation‐building efforts have prominently featured two dispositions: the enthusiasm and idealism of initial reformers and the pessimism and despair of retrospective assessors. It would be easy to counsel “moderation” in the face of such extremes—yet this would miss the subtlety of the particular sort of moderation Smith and Rousseau recommend. In the first place, their moderation emphasizes the limits of political intervention and calls for an embrace of second‐best solutions. But to leave matters at that would be to recommend a deflationary realism rather than genuine moderation. What distinguishes their vision of the science of a legislator is that it joins to this tempering of idealism a steady attachment to guiding universal principles. Smith and Rousseau realize that the hard‐nosed dismissal of universal principles is likely to degenerate into Machiavellianism, just as the too‐eager embrace of such principles is likely to lead to hubristic enthusiasm. The genius of their moderation lies in its effort to establish a balance between ideals and context, and thereby enable a legislator to navigate a course between the Scylla of unmitigated practicality and the Charybdis of immoderate idealism."
"63","Smith and Rousseau also provide insight into the practical methods as well as the spirit of contemporary nation building. While on some level true, it would be facile to suggest that both emphasize the importance of gathering the “intelligence” that is so often said to be lacking in our recent nation‐building projects. Their claim is more specific. In calling for legislators to come to an appreciation of the passions and “prejudices” of the peoples for whom they legislate, their aim is to encourage an appreciation of the current state of the psychology of such peoples and the ways in which this psychology has been shaped by their political experience. In particular, Smith and Rousseau counsel that the legislator's first and most important task is to grasp the nature of the particular loves of a particular people, and craft legislation that appeals to such loves, however corrupted by recent experiences. The lesson is particularly apt for democratic nation‐builders seeking to build democratic nations. America's recent nation‐building projects have largely been in nations emerging from undemocratic and sometimes totalitarian conditions. Attention to the science of the legislator proposed by Smith and Rousseau would suggest that while freedom and democratic self‐rule remain noble and proper goals for these efforts, a direct appeal to such a people's love of freedom is unto itself unlikely to succeed; also needed is engagement with the actual present loves and needs of such a people, and not merely those loves and needs one might wish them to have (see also Williams 2007, 30–31). Smith and Rousseau, that is, can remind “our present‐day lawgivers, thinking exclusively in terms of coercion and punishment,” how much they err in forgetting that the essential problem consists in the question of “how to reach men's hearts” (GP, 4).         "
