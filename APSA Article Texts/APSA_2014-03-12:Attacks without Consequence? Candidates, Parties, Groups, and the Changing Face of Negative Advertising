"1","Selection bias makes it difficult to estimate the causal effect of the sponsor of an ad on candidate evaluations. As a result, most studies of the differential effects of negative advertising by sponsorship have relied on experimental designs (see Arceneaux 2010 for an extensive discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of experimental methods for the study of campaign effects). Table 1 presents a summary of this experimental literature.         "
"2","A number of studies find that candidates who air an attack ad are subject to a “backlash effect” in which their own evaluations suffer as well as those of their opponents (e.g., Allen and Burrell 2002; Brooks and Murov 2012; Garramone 1985; Garramone and Smith 1984; Lau et al. 1999; Lau, Sigelman, and Rovner 2007; Shen and Wu 2002).4 Whether a similar backlash effect is present when another entity sponsors the attack ad has also been explored. Several studies find that candidates can escape at least some of the backlash of a negative attack if it is sponsored by a group (Brooks and Murov 2012; Garramone 1985; Groenendyk and Valentino 2002; Shen and Wu 2002; Weber, Dunaway, and Johnson 2012).            "
"3","Other research suggests that party‐sponsored attacks produce more backlash than those sponsored by candidates (Jasperson and Fan 2002; Meirick 2005). And yet another study finds no relationship between sponsorship and the effectiveness of a negative ad (Pfau et al. 2002).            "
"4","Most of the published research that tests the conditioning effects of campaign ad sponsorship focuses on the difference between group‐sponsored ads and candidate‐sponsored ads. But as Brooks and Murov note, most of this research has involved “well‐known groups with clear partisan affiliations” (2012, 1). For example, the group in Garramone's (1985) study was the National Conservative Political Action Committee, and Groenendyk and Valentino (2002) compare the persuasiveness of an issue ad sponsored by the Sierra Club to one sponsored by Al Gore.5 However, since the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC campaign finance reform advocates and the media have largely focused on the so‐called “unknown” groups, particularly the Super PACs6 that have sprung up as conduits for unlimited corporate and union spending and the 501(c) nonprofit organizations that are able to shield their donors from disclosure.            "
"5","Campaign scholars have only recently begun to examine the effectiveness of ads sponsored by unfamiliar groups. Two recent studies—Weber, Dunaway, and Johnson (2012) and Brooks and Murov (2012)—manipulated a negative ad's sponsorship information to include an unknown group. Using different designs, samples, and stimuli, both studies find that candidates incur greater benefits from negative ads sponsored by unknown groups. Nevertheless, they offer different explanations for what produces this advantage. On one hand, negative ads sponsored by unknown groups may be more effective because they are perceived as more credible sources of information. On the other hand, the effectiveness of a group‐sponsored ad may have little to do with the relative credibility of the sponsor, but merely reflect how well voters are able to link the attack back to the candidate.            "
"6","Weber, Dunaway, and Johnson (2012) test the first possibility by randomly assigning participants to watch an ad that attacked a fictitious congressional candidate's record on crime sponsored by either a fictitious candidate, a known group (the National Rifle Association [NRA]), or a fictitious, unknown group (Citizens for a Safer America). Although the ad sponsored by the known group was more persuasive (lowered evaluations of the attacked candidate) than the same ad sponsored by a candidate, persuasion was limited to those already favorable to the NRA. The unknown group ad, however, was persuasive regardless of subjects’ feelings about the NRA, a finding they attribute to differences in source credibility.7 Brooks and Murov (2012) test both possibilities by examining persuasiveness (i.e., how much the ad affects evaluations of the targeted candidate) as well as backlash (i.e., how much the ad affects evaluations of the attacking candidate). They find that while candidates are penalized for sponsoring an attack ad, the same ad sponsored by an unknown group produced significantly less backlash. Unlike Weber and colleagues, however, they find no evidence that sponsorship affected the persuasiveness of the attack ad, which accused a fictitious state assemblyman of absenteeism, tax evasion, and other campaign violations. Although these varied results may in part reflect differences in how persuasion was operationalized in the two studies, additional experimental replication is needed to examine the mechanism by which group‐sponsored attack ads help candidates.            "
"7","Moreover, we know little about whether unknown groups provide a distinct advantage when it comes to keeping candidates’ hands clean. Only a handful of studies have examined differences between party‐ and candidate‐sponsored ads, and even fewer have tested for differences across all three possible sponsorship types (Pfau et al. 2001, 2002). In one non‐experimental study, Jasperson and Fan (2002) use public opinion and ad buy data over the course of a Senate campaign to examine the relationship between the sponsorship of a negative attack ad and candidate favorability. Their results suggest that the party‐sponsored ads had the unintended consequence of reducing the favorability of the candidate they were trying to help. However, party‐sponsored ads in this non‐experimental study may have been more negative than the candidate‐sponsored ones, thereby making it impossible to isolate the causal effect of sponsorship. In an experimental study, Meirick (2005) finds that evaluations of the attacking candidate were more positive after seeing attack ads sponsored by a candidate compared to those sponsored by a political party, suggesting that voters may see candidates as more trustworthy or “plain‐spoken” than a political party. Yet, as noted in Table 1, this study was limited in that it varied both ad content and sponsorship across treatment conditions. In another experimental study that kept ad content constant, Meirick and Nisbett (2011) find little difference in candidate evaluations between candidate‐ and party‐sponsored ads; nor do they find that candidates were seen as tougher or more honest when they sponsored the attack ad. But while it appears that candidates do not benefit as much from party‐sponsored negative ads as they do from those sponsored by groups, scholars have yet to explicitly test this in a single study using the same ad for all three conditions.8"
"8","As prior work shows, negative ads typically influence evaluations of both the target candidate and the attacking candidate.9 Following this prior work (see, e.g., Brooks and Murov 2012), we analyze whether ad sponsorship affects perceptions of the attacking candidate (“backlash”), perceptions of the target candidate (“persuasion”), and the overall effectiveness of the ad (“net effectiveness,” typically operationalized as the difference between persuasion and backlash). We focus our hypotheses on backlash and persuasion given that net effectiveness is simply the combination of the two. We also focus on the case in which the attack ad is clearly partisan/ideological, as this is a common attack. We note, and show in Study 3, that more vague (i.e., not overtly partisan/ideological) but still issue‐driven attacks will likely result in different effects because the ad attributions provide information (e.g., a party cue in the case of a party‐sponsored ad) that the content of the ad does not.            "
"9","Consistent with prior work, we hypothesize that negative ads sponsored by campaign surrogates will result in less backlash compared to the same negative ad sponsored by the candidate. It is much less clear how the effects of the two campaign surrogates—groups and political parties—should compare to one another. On the one hand, both could allow the candidate to escape (some) backlash. On the other hand, party cues may more readily help voters link the attack ad back to the candidate. Thus, we do not offer a definitive hypothesis for the comparison between group and party ads, and we conduct more conservative two‐tailed hypothesis tests for all comparisons of ad sponsorship conditions."
"10","There are at least two explanations for why negative ads sponsored by campaign surrogates may result in less backlash. One possibility is that a candidate‐sponsored attack ad elicits a negative response from voters because the candidate's responsibility for the ad is clear. Although BCRA requires that candidates, parties, and groups attach disclaimer statements to their ads that identify who paid for the message, candidates must provide their own oral disclaimer (either appearing on‐air making the statement or using a voice‐over accompanied by a clearly identifiable picture that fills at least 80% of the screen). Proponents of this provision of the law reasoned that candidates would be deterred from sponsoring negative ads out of fear that voters would hold them accountable for unfair or misleading attacks. This leads to the expectation that candidate‐sponsored attacks will be less effective because they are the only ads that are unambiguously linked back to the candidate (Brooks and Murov 2012). An alternative, or perhaps complementary, explanation is that campaign surrogates remove the link between the candidate and the attack. That is, without the attribution to the candidate, voters do not connect the candidate to the party or group that sponsors the attack. In this scenario, it is not the candidate disclaimer that moves opinion, but the other disclaimers. We attempt to distinguish between these two explanations below.            "
"11","In terms of persuasion, prior work suggests source credibility as the most likely explanation for sponsorship differences (see, e.g., Weber, Dunaway, and Johnson 2012). Classic theories of communication argue that messages sponsored by credible sources—those who possess expertise and can be trusted to give an objective opinion—are generally more persuasive than those sponsored by less credible ones (Hass 1981; Hovland, Janis, and Kelley 1953; Hovland and Weiss 1951; see Pornpitakpan 2004 for a review). In the case of campaign advertising, candidates may be seen as particularly less trustworthy than parties or groups, especially groups that—due to their innocuous‐sounding names—appear to be less motivated by individual self‐interest (Brooks and Murov 2012; Groenendyk and Valentino 2002; Pfau et al. 2007; Weber, Dunaway, and Johnson 2012). As a result, voters may be more likely to be moved by messages sponsored by groups—particularly groups with names that sound like they are citizen groups with strong grassroots support. This leads to the expectation that negative ads sponsored by groups will be more effective because group‐sponsored ads are viewed as more credible and, therefore, more persuasive than those sponsored by candidates.            "
"12","We further argue that the extent of sponsorship differences should depend on the partisan affiliation of the voter. Because copartisans of the attacking side have little reason to blame the candidate for an attack ad (they likely agree with the attack), we should see the effects of sponsorship concentrated among those who identify with the targeted candidate. Thus, in terms of backlash, we expect partisans of the targeted candidate to punish the attacking candidate, but to be less likely to hold the attacking candidate accountable for an ad sponsored by a party or group. It is not clear that differences by sponsorship in terms of persuasion will vary based on respondent partisanship. Indeed, one prior study found little difference in terms of persuasion by respondent partisanship, but a greater difference in backlash between ads sponsored by groups and those sponsored by candidates among those who shared a party affiliation with the targeted candidate (Brooks and Murov 2012). Finally, it is also not clear whether sponsorship will affect candidate evaluations among political independents given previous research suggesting that negative ads affect their opinions the least (Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995; Iyengar, Jackman, and Hahn 2008; see also Brooks and Murov 2012). Therefore, we focus our analysis on partisans but present results for Independents in the supporting information (SI).            "
"13","In our studies, we test for differences across candidate‐, party‐, and group‐sponsored ads, while holding the content of the ad constant. All three of our experimental studies were administered on Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) interface. MTurk is an online platform for recruiting and paying subjects to perform tasks. The MTurk population is a convenience sample that appears more representative than student samples, but it is not completely representative of the U.S. population (Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012; see Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling 2011 for a discussion of using MTurk to recruit participants for experiments). In the SI, we provide complete details of our experimental protocols and question wording.         "
"14","Our first study used an ad that originally aired during the 2010 Missouri senate race between Democratic candidate Robin Carnahan and Republican candidate Roy Blunt.10 The attack ad, as was typical of Republican attack ads in 2010 (Fowler and Ridout 2010), linked Carnahan to “failed” Democratic policies. We paid a professional video editor to create three ads: Group Ad (N = 205), Candidate Ad (N = 179), and Party Ad (N = 160). The original ad was sponsored by the group American Crossroads, which is a 527 organization founded by Republican operatives Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie, and it has received some media attention. Despite this attention, we believe American Crossroads still falls into the “unknown” group camp that has been the subject of prior studies (Brooks and Murov 2012; Pfau et al. 2007; Weber, Dunaway, and Johnson 2012) for two reasons. First, it uses an innocuous or “stealth” name (Pfau et al. 2007).11 Second, in a pilot study (N = 268) administered on MTurk a few months (March 2011) prior to Study 1, only 14% of participants reported having heard of American Crossroads, suggesting the group was largely unknown at the time of our study.12 Thus, American Crossroads is the sponsor of our Group Ad, with their “stand by your ad” statement being the same as it was when originally aired (but with a different voice used, as we made the voices consistent for the Group Ad and Party Ad; we used Roy Blunt's voice for his “stand by your ad” statement). The ad sponsorship screen consisted of American Crossroads’ website displayed underneath the text “SAY NO TO ROBIN CARNAHAN” (displayed next to a picture of Carnahan), along with a full “stand by your ad” disclaimer (see Table 2) that took up the bottom third of the screen, while the voiceover stated that “American Crossroads is responsible for the content of this advertisement.” See the SI for the complete voice‐over text. Our other two treatment conditions, Candidate Ad and Party Ad, replaced all the relevant sponsorship information, as shown in Table 2. Each disclaimer used in this study and the others reported in this article follow legal guidelines set forth in BCRA, with one exception: the candidate‐sponsored ad we used in this study failed to include Roy Blunt's picture on the screen with his voice‐over. We corrected this error in our subsequent studies. We note that even with the presumably weaker candidate disclaimer in Study 1, we still observe differences between the candidate‐sponsored ad and other ads.            "
"15","After watching the ad, participants were asked to evaluate both candidates separately. Specifically, we asked, “What is your overall impression of [Robin Carnahan/Roy Blunt]?” where we randomized which candidate was asked about first. We use these two questions, which were asked on a 4‐point scale with additional “not sure” and “never heard of” options, to create our three outcome measures.13 First, to measure backlash, we create a variable, Impression of Blunt, that ranges from “very unfavorable” (–2) to “very favorable” (2), with 0 representing respondents who said they either were “not sure” how they felt about Blunt or had “never heard of him.” Second, to measure persuasion, we create a variable, Impression of Carnahan, that also ranges from “very unfavorable” (–2) to “very favorable” (2), with 0 representing respondents who said they either were “not sure” how they felt about Carnahan or had “never heard of her.” Third, to measure the net effectiveness of the ad, we create a variable, Net Effectiveness, that combines responses to the two questions so that it ranges from –4 (“very favorable toward Carnahan”/“very unfavorable toward Blunt”) to +4 (“very favorable toward Blunt”/“very unfavorable toward Carnahan”). We standardize these three variables (M = 0, SD = 1) within our final sample to allow for more direct comparability of coefficients and to ease interpretation.14"
"16","Figure 1 presents results from this experiment for the full sample. The figure displays the three standardized (M = 0, SD = 1) outcome measures by indicators for our treatment groups—Candidate Ad (“Cand.” in the figure), Party Ad (“Rep.”), and Group Ad (“AC”). For all of the figures presented below, the dots represent the mean of the treatment condition, and the whiskers denote 95% confidence intervals around that mean. In the SI, we present, for the full sample and by respondent partisan identification, a table of means and standard errors (Table S2), along with a separate table (Table S3) reporting p‐values from t‐tests of the equality of the various treatment condition coefficients (each pairwise combination) for each study.15 These tables also report the number of observations in each condition, for the full sample and by respondent partisan identification.

"19","Beginning with the results for backlash, we find that the Group Ad did result in less backlash compared to the Candidate Ad. Evaluations of Blunt go from –.204 in the Candidate Ad condition to .131 in the Group Ad condition. This difference represents a shift of about one‐third of a standard deviation and is statistically significant (p = .001). Consistent with prior work, a candidate‐sponsored attack results in a larger backlash effect than if a group sponsors the attack instead. A novel aspect of our experiment was the use of a party‐sponsored ad, which we included to see whether it also allows candidates to escape backlash and whether its effects are different from those of group‐sponsored ads. We find that, like the Group Ad, the Party Ad also resulted in less backlash than the Candidate Ad, but only about two‐tenths of a standard deviation less (p = .09; p > .10 using Tukey‐Kramer test). The difference between the Party Ad and Group Ad of .143 is not statistically significant (p = .149). In other words, based on the full sample, which is skewed Democratic (see Table S1a), it appears that candidates are well served to have both their party and groups attack on their behalf, but the size of the effects suggests groups provide a somewhat greater advantage.            "
"20","In terms of persuasion, we find that the three conditions are about equally persuasive. None of the three conditions are statistically distinguishable from one another (the smallest p‐value is for the difference between the Group Ad and Party Ad, p = .427). This finding is consistent with Brooks and Murov's (2012) conclusion that candidate and group ads do not differ in terms of persuasion, but not Weber, Dunaway, and Johnson's (2012) finding that a group ad is more persuasive than the candidate ad.16 Last, in terms of the net effectiveness of the ad, we find the Group Ad has the most positive effect for Blunt (M = 0.058), but that it is not statistically distinguishable from the Party Ad (p = .841) or the Candidate Ad (p = .152).            "
"21","Recall that we hypothesized that the backlash the attacking candidate receives would depend on the partisanship of the subject. In particular, we argued that the effect of sponsorship would be primarily confined to partisans of the targeted candidate. In this instance, the results of the full sample should be driven by Democratic respondents. In Figure 2, we present the results for backlash for self‐identified Democrats and Republicans.17 For Republicans—partisans of the attacking candidate—the three conditions are not statistically distinguishable from one another (the smallest p‐value is for the difference between the Group Ad and Party Ad, p = .297). For Democrats—partisans of the targeted candidate—both the Group Ad and Party Ad are statistically distinguishable from the Candidate Ad (p = .001 and .005, respectively) and represent shifts in backlash of more than one‐half of a standard deviation. Thus, it appears that the extent to which a candidate can escape backlash does vary by sponsor and that, as expected, this effect is largely confined to partisans of the targeted candidate. Estimating a two‐way ANOVA in which the treatment condition, respondent partisanship (Democratic or Republican), and the interaction between the two are the explanatory factors (see Table S3e), we find a statistically significant interactive effect (F = 3.73, p = .025).            "

"24","The results by partisan identification for persuasion and net effectiveness are displayed in the SI (Figure S1). There we find that among Republicans, the Party Ad is more persuasive compared to the other two conditions (p = .009 for difference from Candidate Ad and p = .032 for difference from Group Ad), but that there is no difference among Democrats across the three conditions. This suggests partisans of the attacking candidate (in this case, Republicans) may use party sponsorship as a signal that affects their attitude toward the targeted (Democratic) candidate, but that partisans of the targeted candidate (Democrats) do not find party sponsorship any less persuasive (two‐way ANOVA results for interactive effect of Party × Treatment: F = 2.22, p = .110). We find no significant differences across the three conditions for either party in terms of the net effectiveness of this attack ad (two‐way ANOVA results for interactive effect of Party × Treatment: F = 0.19, p = .828).            "
"25","To ascertain whether the results from Study 1 were dependent on the particulars of the ad used (and because the candidate disclaimer did not follow legal guidelines), we replicated Study 1 with an ad that attacked a Republican candidate (and followed all legal guidelines). Study 2 followed Study 1 in terms of its design and protocol, with one exception: we also included a No Sponsor condition that allows us to test whether the disclaimer statements move opinion from a group that watches the ad without a disclaimer statement.18 The ad we chose originally aired during the 2012 Iowa 3rd District congressional election between Republican candidate Tom Latham and Democratic candidate Leonard Boswell. The attack ad focused on Latham's “hypocrisy” regarding the TARP bank rescue plan—Latham voted against it, but the ad suggests Latham's family business (a bank) received funds from it.19 See the SI for the complete voice‐over text.            "
"26","We supervised a student video editor to create four ad sponsorship treatment conditions: No Sponsor (N = 144), Group Ad: Citizens for Strength and Security (N = 176), Candidate Ad (N = 148), and Party Ad: Democratic (N = 151).20 The original ad was sponsored by Leonard Boswell, and we kept his voice for his “stand by your ad” provision. Otherwise, to make the ads consistent, we had a former newscaster redo the voice‐over for the original ad so that the voice was consistent for all treatment conditions from beginning to end. See Table 2 for the “stand by your ad” content of the various treatment conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions and, after watching the ad, were asked to evaluate both candidates, separately: “What is your overall impression of [Tom Latham/Leonard Boswell]?” The coding of these two questions to create our three outcome measures of interest, which are again standardized (M = 0, SD = 1), is the same as for Study 1.            "
"27","Given the results of Study 1, we focus our attention on the results for backlash, partitioned by partisan identification, as displayed in Figure 3.21 We again observe a fairly clear pattern in which sponsorship influences the backlash the candidate receives among partisans of the targeted candidate, but not among partisans of the attacking candidate (two‐way ANOVA results for interactive effect of Party ×            "
"28","The Effect of Ad Sponsorship on Candidate Backlash"
"29","Note: Means, by treatment condition and respondent party identification, with 95% confidence intervals. Each outcome is standardized: M = 0, SD = 1. Source: 2013 MTurk Study.                        "
"30","Treatment: F = 2.79, p = .040).22 Specifically, Democratic respondents do not vary across sponsorship condition (the smallest p‐value for all pairwise comparisons across all three treatment conditions, excluding the No Sponsor condition for now, is for the difference between the Party Ad and Group Ad, p = .407). Republican respondents, however, do exhibit variation in backlash across the treatment conditions. The difference between Candidate Ad and Party Ad of about one‐quarter of a standard deviation is in the expected direction—less backlash in the Party Ad condition—but is not statistically significant (p = .377).23 There is significantly less backlash for the Group Ad compared to both the Candidate Ad (a difference of nearly three‐quarters of a standard deviation, p = .018) and the Party Ad (a difference of nearly one‐half of a standard deviation, p = .073; although this difference is p > .10 using the Tukey‐Kramer test). These results corroborate the main finding from Study 1: differences in backlash by sponsorship are largely concentrated among partisans of the targeted candidate.            "
"31","In addition, comparing the Candidate Ad and No Sponsor conditions in Study 2 permits us to test whether the candidate disclaimer produces this backlash by depressing evaluations of the attacking candidate. Figure 3 suggests this is not the case. Neither Republicans nor Democrats who watched the Candidate Ad view Boswell statistically significantly differently than those in the No Sponsor condition (p = .517 and .563 for difference among Republican and Democrats, respectively; in the full sample, displayed in Figure S3 in the SI, this difference is also not statistically significant, p = .373).24 In fact, the point estimates are in the opposite direction of what we would expect if the candidate disclaimer caused people to respond more harshly to the attacking candidate.            "
"32","In Studies 1 and 2, we used negative ads that were fairly partisan/ideological in their content. For example, the ad attacking Carnahan explicitly linked her to President Obama, and more than 70% of subjects who watched the Latham ad without a sponsor correctly identified his partisan affiliation (see Table S5 in the SI). It stands to reason that most people who watched these ads did not need to know who paid for it to know whose side they were on. What if this is not clear from the content of the ad? Do we observe a similar pattern of results?"
"33","For Study 3, we chose an ad that originally aired during the 2012 Iowa 2nd District congressional election between Republican candidate John Archer and Democratic incumbent Dave Loebsack. The ad, which was originally sponsored by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), attacked Loebsack on energy policy and the economy.25 Participants in our pilot study did no better than a coin flip in terms of identifying Loebsack as a Democrat based on the ad alone without sponsorship information (see Table S5 in the SI), suggesting that the ad was relatively neutral in terms of its partisan content. This permitted us to realistically manipulate not only the sponsor by candidate, party, and group, but also within party and group.            "
"34","We supervised a student video editor to create six ad sponsorship treatment conditions: No Sponsor (N = 293), Candidate (N = 242), Democratic Party (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee [DCCC]; N = 219), Republican Party (NRCC; N = 235), Liberal Group (Citizens for Strength and Security; N = 260), and Conservative Group (Crossroads GPS; N = 235).26 To make the ads consistent, we had a former newscaster redo the voice‐over for the original ad so that the voice was consistent for all treatment conditions from beginning to end. See Table 2 for the “stand by your ad” content of the ad sponsorship treatment conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the six conditions and, after watching the ad, were asked to evaluate both candidates, separately: “What is your overall impression of [Dave Loebsack/John Archer]?” The coding of these two questions to create our three outcome measures of interest, which are again standardized (M = 0, SD = 1), is the same as for Studies 1 and 2.            "
"35","Three results from this experiment stand out. First, as we show in the SI, the Candidate Ad is not statistically distinguishable from the No Sponsor condition for any outcome for either party (or in the full sample; all p‐values > .10). In fact, consistent with the results of Study 2, the direction of the difference between the two conditions is that evaluations of the attacking candidate are more positive when he sponsors the ad than when there is no sponsor. This provides corroborating evidence that the candidate disclaimer itself is not responsible for the backlash the candidate receives.            "
"36","Second, we find that participants were particularly sensitive to the disclaimer statements identifying the sponsor to be a party. Figure 4 presents the results for each of our three outcome measures by the two party and two group treatment conditions for Republicans and Democrats separately. Focusing on the results for the net effectiveness of the ad (the third column of Figure 4), Republicans (Democrats) had a much lower opinion of Loebsack—the candidate who is attacked—when the Republican (Democratic) Party sponsored the ad, and a much higher opinion of him when the Democratic (Republican) Party sponsored it. (Among both Republicans and Democrats, Democratic Party is significantly different from Republican Party [p = .034 and p < .001, respectively; however, for Republicans, this difference is p > .10 using the Tukey‐Kramer test.]) Faced with a vague attack (at least in terms of partisanship/ideology), participants used the identity of the (party) sponsor in their judgment of the candidates. Furthermore, this difference in effectiveness is largely driven by differences in persuasiveness, and to a lesser extent by backlash. (The difference between Democratic Party and Republican Party is statistically significant among Democrats for both persuasion [p < .001] and backlash [p < .001], but only for persuasion among Republicans [p < .006.])27 Thus, party sponsorship does appear to convey useful information to voters. That this information polarizes partisans provides further evidence of the power of partisan priming (see, e.g., Iyengar, Jackman, and Hahn 2008).            "
"37","The Effect of Party and Group Sponsorship"
"38","Note: Means, by treatment condition and respondent party identification, with 95% confidence intervals. Each outcome is standardized: M = 0, SD = 1. Source: 2013 MTurk Study.                        "
"39","Third, the results of Study 3 also demonstrate the advantages groups can have as a result of their unfamiliarity. The two group conditions are not statistically distinguishable from each other among Democrats, Republicans, or the full sample for any outcome. Thus, although our participants were responsive to whether we identified the sponsor as either the Republican or Democratic Party, they made no such distinction between conservative and liberal groups. Despite the media attention that groups have received—particularly since Citizens United—it appears that many voters remain unaware of the ideological or policy motivations behind them.28"
"40","Requiring campaign messages to clearly identify their sponsors was supposed to promote accountability and reduce mudslinging. As Senator Lindsay Graham argued during debates about extending the disclaimer requirement of BCRA to the Internet, “the effort to put some measure of accountability into the system has and will continue to take some of the venom out of politics.”29 Clearly, such wishes have not materialized as campaigns have become more—not less—negative since the passage of BCRA (Fowler and Ridout 2012).         "
"41","But while negative ads are an essential part of a campaign's toolkit, their effectiveness remains in question. Similar to other recent work that suggests the effects of negative campaigns may be conditional on a variety of factors (e.g., Blackwell 2013; Fridkin and Kenney 2004, 2011; Krupnikov 2011), we examined whether the effect of a negative ad depends on who sponsors it. Specifically, our three experimental studies involved participants watching actual negative ads that differed only in their sponsorship (i.e., opposing candidate, opposing party, or a relatively unfamiliar group). In Studies 2 and 3, we also randomly assigned some participants to view an ad with the identifying disclaimer statement removed. And while Studies 1 and 2 used attack ads that should have made it relatively easy for participants to identify the partisanship of the targeted candidate, Study 3 used a more vague attack (at least in terms of its partisan leanings). This experimental design resulted in four findings that have implications for the negative campaigning literature, campaign strategy, and current debates about campaign finance regulations.30"
"42","First, consistent with theoretical expectations, we find that candidate‐sponsored negative ads result in more backlash against the attacking candidate compared to group‐sponsored ads (Studies 1 and 2) and, to a lesser extent, party‐sponsored ads (Study 1). Further, we find that these differences are largely concentrated among partisans of the targeted candidate. The fact that group and party ads nearly uniformly attacked a candidate in the 2010 and 2012 elections (Fowler and Ridout 2010, 2012) is perhaps not surprising given that they appear to allow the candidates they support to remain “above the fray.”         "
"43","Second, we find some suggestive evidence that a candidate's campaign may benefit the most from having groups do the attacking, even in comparison to the party. We say “suggestive” because although there is a rather large difference (nearly one‐half of a standard deviation on our measure) in backlash between the group‐ and party‐sponsored ads among partisans of the targeted candidate in Study 2, we do not appear to have enough power in our smaller sample of Republicans to detect statistical significance. Given the increased flow of money to and spending by groups in recent elections (Fowler 2012; Fowler and Ridout 2010), more work is needed to see whether recent campaign finance rulings that give groups more freedom to spend their money on elections (e.g., Citizens United) will have substantial campaign effects.         "
"44","Third, the results of Study 3, which used a nonpartisan ad, suggest that the above findings may be confined to partisan/ideological attacks or perhaps also character attacks (see Brooks and Murov 2012).31 Two notable differences in Study 3 stand out. First, participants used the party attribution to fill in the “missing” partisan content in the vague attack, resulting in differences in persuasion. Second, because of their lack of familiarity (see fn. 28), the groups used in Study 3 did not help participants judge the content of the ad, as we found no difference between the group conditions among Democrats and Republicans. While the Supreme Court continues to uphold disclaimer (and disclosure) regulations on the grounds that they serve the public interest by ensuring citizens are fully informed about who is speaking, the results of Study 3 suggest that disclaimers work as intended only when they convey useful information.         "
"45","Fourth, the lack of a difference in backlash between the no sponsor and candidate sponsor conditions in Studies 2 and 3 suggests that BCRA's “stand by your ad” requirement does little to change evaluations of candidates who sponsor negative attack ads.32 As further support, we note that in a pilot study (described in detail in the SI), we asked subjects who they thought the sponsor of each of six ads was after watching the ads stripped of their sponsorship information. The modal response in all six cases and the majority in five was the opposing candidate, suggesting that most people assume that a candidate sponsors attack ads (see Table S6). If this is the case, then we would expect ads sponsored by candidates to have effects similar to those presented without any sponsor, which is indeed what we find.         "
"46","If the candidate disclaimer does not produce the differences in backlash, then what does? The other explanation we offered is that without an attribution to the candidate, voters do not connect the candidate to the party or group that sponsors the attack. We do not have any direct evidence that this is what is occurring, but it is the case that the proportion of “not sure” responses is higher in the group and party sponsor conditions compared to the candidate sponsor condition in Studies 1 and 2 (where we observe these differences in backlash across sponsorship conditions).33 Figure 5 displays the distribution of “not sure” responses for the attacking candidates from both studies (Blunt in Study 1 and Boswell in Study 2) across the treatment conditions for the full samples. (Table S5a in the SI provides the full distribution of responses.) About 35% of subjects responded “not sure” in the Candidate Ad conditions, whereas anywhere from 47% to 60% responded “not sure” in the other conditions. The inability (or unwillingness) to offer an evaluation of the attacking candidate may explain why we observe differences in backlash across the conditions. As further evidence, note in Study 2 that although a higher percentage of respondents in the No Sponsor condition responded “not sure” (53%), participants in this treatment group evaluated the candidates no differently than those shown the candidate‐sponsored attack. Our explanation for this is that people assume the candidate sponsored the ad without that sponsorship information (see Table S6 in the SI). Thus, it appears that it is not that the candidate disclaimer creates or adds accountability, but that the other disclaimers weaken the link between the candidate and the attack. This suggests that candidates do not have to go out of their way to distance themselves from negative ads sponsored by campaign surrogates: many voters simply do not connect the candidate to attacks attributed to others.         "
"47","Campaign strategists are certainly aware of the advantages groups provide. As one campaign consultant noted, “The super PACs are not accountable to anybody so they can say what they want to say and it's not going to blow back on the campaign” (as quoted in Isikoff 2012). The results of our studies provide empirical support for this received wisdom. It is not surprising, then, that the presence of groups on the electoral landscape has increased substantially since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned long‐standing restrictions on political expenditures by corporations and unions. Spending by groups in the 2010 midterm elections—the first set of federal elections after the Court's landmark decision in Citizens United v. FEC—was 50% higher than spending on House and Senate races just two years prior (Fowler and Ridout 2010). And the surge in group‐sponsored ads in 2012 was even more dramatic (Fowler and Ridout 2012; Franz 2012). Nearly one out of every three presidential ads in the general election was sponsored by a group, with conservative groups accounting for over half of pro‐Romney ads (Franz 2012). Groups also spent more in congressional races in 2012 than in the “issue advocacy” elections of 2000 (Franz 2012). Understanding the differential effects such spending may have is an important endeavor that the present study takes a first step toward.         "
"48","Scholars and policy makers have suggested numerous ways to reform the campaign finance system with respect to independent groups. Most of these proposals focus on ways in which voters can be made more aware of the motivating (ideological) interests behind the message (e.g., Levitt 2010).         "
"49","For example, in recent years, Congress considered the DISCLOSE Act, which would have required the top five funders of groups to be listed in ads they pay for.34 One area for further research is to see whether the apparent added benefit of airing a group‐sponsored negative ad can be offset with such additional information. Recent work, for example, suggests that group‐sponsored ads are somewhat less effective when information about donors is disclosed after the ad (Dowling and Wichowsky 2013). Whether information imbedded in an ad itself, as the DISCLOSE Act proposed, would do the same remains an open question.         "
"50","At the same time, the results of our experiments suggest that greater disclosure of ideological interests may not completely offset the group advantage. Even negative ads sponsored by political parties permit the attacking candidate to escape some backlash (Study 1). In addition, party‐sponsored ads provide information that results in partisans polarizing in response to a vague attack ad (Study 3), which could also happen with group‐sponsored ads if similar ideological cues were given about groups at the end of the ad (or if the groups were simply more familiar to the public). Thus, changing how independent groups are regulated may simply result in the effects of their attack ads being more similar to those of party‐sponsored ads, not candidate‐sponsored ones. In order for all negative ads to be created equal, a more direct association between the candidate and the sponsor (be it a group or party) likely needs to be made more apparent to voters."
