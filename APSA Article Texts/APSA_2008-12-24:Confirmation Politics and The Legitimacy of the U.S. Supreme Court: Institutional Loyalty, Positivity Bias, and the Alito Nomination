"1","For the Supreme Court, 2005 was a year of great speculation and anticipation—about retirements and resignations, Chief Justice Rehnquist's health, potential battles over nominees, and long lists of aspiring candidates. Public interest picked up markedly when, in August of 2004, Rehnquist announced that he had cancer and was undergoing treatment. As if to dramatize the possibilities of massive change, the frail Chief Justice administered the oath to President Bush in mid‐January of 2005 and quickly left the stands, thereby fueling comment on how long he would remain on the Court. To the surprise of most, Rehnquist was not the first departure. Justice O'Connor announced her retirement in June. In July, President Bush sent up Judge John Roberts to the Senate as her replacement. Roberts's nomination proceeded smoothly through the summer and seemed to be well poised for the Judiciary Committee's hearings in September. Then, in September, Rehnquist died; and after an interval, the president switched Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. A month later, to the shock of most observers, Bush named his chief of staff, Harriet Miers, to replace O'Connor. This nomination was doomed from the outset and was withdrawn after three weeks, largely on the basis of conflict among the Republicans. Judge Alito, who had been on the short list for the previous openings, received the nomination from the president on October 31, 2005."
"2","Despite a last‐minute effort by Senate liberals to mount a filibuster against Judge Alito, and great exertions by liberal interest groups, the Senate confirmed him at the end of January on a vote of 58–42. In the end, Judge Alito seemed to be successful in gaining the fairly robust support of the American people, including most Democrats. Those who managed the campaign, including in particular Alito's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, executed a nearly perfect, textbook example of how to get a president's nominee confirmed (on presidential public relations efforts, see Maltese 1995). A significant part of this victory had to do with effectiveness in portraying Alito as conservative, but as a mainstream conservative, certainly not an extremist. As important was their success at focusing the debate, not on ideology, but instead on Alito's professional accomplishments and judicial qualifications.         "
"3","Yet, another large part of the confirmation story has to do with preexisting attitudes toward the Supreme Court. As it has been developed, the theory of institutional loyalty and positivity bias suggests that standing commitments to an institution generate a bias in expectations and perceptions of confirmation struggles that predisposes people to emphasize certain criteria and ultimately to accept judicial nominees. Because the theory of positivity bias is so central to our analysis, we consider it in some detail."
"4"," What is positivity bias? As Gibson, Caldeira, and Spence (2003a, 2003b) explain it, positivity bias is a frame through which contemporary political conflicts are judged. In their theory, the process goes something like the following. People become attentive to courts in the context of policy controversies (e.g., Bush v. Gore) or events like confirmation hearings. In such circumstances, judicial symbols proliferate—in part because elites and interest groups realize the power of such symbols and attempt to manipulate them—so it is impossible for attentive citizens to avoid exposure to them.         "
"5","Legitimizing symbols likely activate loyalty toward the institution, where it exists, as well as reinforce the understanding that courts are different from other political institutions. Consequently, although policy concerns may provide the initial impetus for attention to a court (see Gimpel and Ringel 1995, 146), a second dimension, judiciousness, is often stimulated and, for some, becomes the dominant frame for judging the confirmation.         "
"6"," Is positivity bias associated with any substantive views of the judicial process? We believe that positivity bias is closely connected to the view that courts are different from other political institutions and that judicial decision making is largely a nonpolitical process. This conception is quite similar to what Scheb and Lyons refer to as the “myth of legality,” by which they mean “the belief that judicial decisions are based on autonomous legal principles” and “that cases are decided by application of legal rules formulated and applied through a politically and philosophically neutral process of legal reasoning” (Scheb and Lyons 2000, 929). We hypothesize that those characterized by strong loyalty to courts tend to subscribe more completely to the myth of legality and therefore are more likely to view courts as relatively distinct, nonpolitical institutions.         "
"7"," How does positivity bias arise? Our understanding of the origins of positivity bias begins by positing that citizens do not naturally differentiate between the judiciary and the other branches of government. That courts are special and different must be learned.3 Thus, those most ignorant about politics in general, and with little exposure to judicial politics in particular, are likely to see courts and other political institutions as quite similar: Courts are not seen as special and unique.         "
"8","Exposure to legitimizing judicial symbols reinforces the process of distinguishing courts from other political institutions. The message of these powerful symbols is that “courts are different,” and owing to these differences, courts are worthy of more respect, deference, and obedience—in short, legitimacy. Because courts use “nonpolitical,” principled processes of decision making (and since the American people do not necessarily approve of the decision‐making procedures commonplace in political institutions—see Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse 1995), and since judicial institutions associate themselves with symbols of impartiality and insulation from ordinary political pressures, those more exposed to courts come to accept the “myth of legality.” This process of social learning explains why citizens who are more knowledgeable about courts tend to adopt less realistic views of how these institutions operate and make decisions (e.g., Scheb and Lyons 2000).4"
"9"," How does positivity bias influence perceptions of decisions and events? A positivity bias is little more than a frame through which events are perceived and evaluated. “Issue framing effects refer to situations where, by emphasizing a subset of potentially relevant considerations, a speaker leads individuals to focus on these considerations when constructing their opinions” (Druckman 2004, 672). Framing is a process by which the salience or accessibility of different criteria or dimensions by which an event or a case might be judged varies according to established characteristics of the individual. Stimuli activate a frame, and the frame influences how the world is perceived and judged. Elites often compete in proffering frames to the mass public (e.g., Sniderman and Theriault 2004), which typically results in competing frames being available in the marketplace. Framing effects are not inevitable (Druckman 2004), preexisting attitudes do not always exist, and it is seldom easy to predict which frames will dominate, but the battle for public opinion is often, if not typically, a battle of one frame against another.         "
"10","Confirmation controversies provide a classic example of competing frames. On one side, the frame of legality is advanced, typically by proponents of the nominee.5 Their argument is that the nominee ought to be judged primarily (if not exclusively) on legalistic criteria like judiciousness. On occasion, the opponents will take issue with the nominee's judiciousness; but more likely is an attempt to substitute a frame defined by political considerations such as ideology, partisanship, and policy. Which frame comes to dominate depends in part on the nominee and the elements of the specific context, but also in part on whether citizens have preexisting commitments (loyalty) to the institution that the proponents can activate. In the case of the U.S. Supreme Court, the outcome of a confirmation controversy depends in significant part on the degree to which citizens subscribe to the myth of legality, which is of course a central element of positivity bias.6"
"11","This theory of framing is also entirely compatible with theories of motivated reasoning (e.g., Taber and Lodge 2006). One element of that body of work has to do with confirmation bias: “the prediction that people, especially those who feel the strongest and know the most, will seek out confirmatory evidence and avoid what they suspect might be disconfirming evidence” (Taber and Lodge 2006, 759). This confirmation bias means that contrary evidence—such as evidence that a Supreme Court nominee has strong partisan and ideological preferences and objectives—battles against preexisting attitudes based on the myth of legality and the presumed criteria of the judiciousness of nominees.         "
"12","During confirmation fights, citizens are offered the opportunity to get a view of how the Supreme Court actually operates. Since many actors are focusing on the ideology of the nominee, considerable potential exists for the myth of legality—according to which judges make decisions not on the basis of their ideologies but rather strictly according to the syllogisms of stare decisis—to be placed under strain during confirmation hearings. Debates are certainly confused by discussions of “judicial activism,” but few close observers of the process doubt the importance of ideologies. Thus, the central legitimizing symbols upon which the Courts relies—its impartiality and its strict adherence to the law—are potentially compromised during politicized confirmation processes.7"
"13","Positivity frames may be able to override attempts to politicize confirmation processes.8 The job of the successful nominee and his or her proponents is to activate the legal rather than political frame through which ordinary citizens perceive and judge the confirmation process. We hypothesize that to the extent legal expectations are satisfied, the influence of ideology, policy, and partisanship is minimized, which is typically the preferred strategy of policy‐minded presidents.         "
"14","Thus, the central hypothesis emerging from the theory of positivity frames is that preexisting institutional loyalty plays a crucial role in how people perceive and judge confirmation processes. Of course, facts and contexts are important; how people perceive the details of confirmation fights is crucial to the formation of their preferences. But we hypothesize that institutional loyalty interacts with events surrounding the confirmation, leading citizens with a sense of loyalty toward the Court to rely primarily upon criteria of judiciousness in judging the nominee. In contrast, those without a sense of institutional loyalty are likely to judge the confirmation process largely in terms of ordinary political criteria."
"15","In sum, our view of citizen preference formation in the confirmation process is as follows:"
"16","                              "
"17","Those holding strong institutional commitments to the U.S. Supreme Court tend toward accepting the myth of legality, rejecting the view that courts are ordinary political institutions."
"18","Both institutional loyalty and belief in the myth of legality generate a particular set of expectations about the desirable qualities of a Supreme Court nominee and how the confirmation process ought to unfold. The central element of these expectations is that judges and courts are different from ordinary politics. We refer to this package of expectations as “judiciousness.”"
"19","Intelligent confirmation strategies exploit predispositions to perceive nominees as judicious and not political. With prominent exceptions, the opposition tends not to directly challenge the judiciousness of the candidate, focusing instead on trying to exploit the political dimension. But predispositions to see nominees in nonpolitical frames are strong and difficult to overcome."
"20","Our most important general hypothesis is thus that institutional loyalty tends to shield candidates from ideological scrutiny (and therefore we posit a conditional/interactive relationship)."
"21","This research is based primarily on a nationally representative sample interviewed face‐to‐face from mid‐May until mid‐July 2005. A total of 1,001 interviews was completed, with a response rate of 40.03% (AAPOR Response Rate #3). No respondent substitution was allowed; up to six callbacks were executed. The average length of interview was 83.8 minutes (with a standard deviation of 23.9 minutes). The data were subjected to some minor “poststratification,” with the proviso that the weighted numbers of cases correspond to the actual number of completed interviews. Interviews were offered in both English and Spanish (the Spanish version was prepared through conventional translation/back‐translation procedures). Samples such as this have a margin of error of roughly ± 3.08%."
"22","During the course of the Alito confirmation process, we sought to reinterview the respondents from the 2005 survey.9 The fieldwork began on January 19, 2006, and was completed on February 13, 2006. A total of 335 individuals from the 2005 survey was reinterviewed.10"
"23","Since t2 interviews were completed with only one‐third of the original respondents, questions about the representativeness of the subsample naturally arise. We have considered this issue in some detail, in a statistical investigation available from the authors. The analysis supports two general conclusions. First, the t2 subsample is reasonably representative on its face, and second, with minor poststratification, the 2006 subsample closely mirrors the 2005 population from which it was drawn (reflecting, of course, one of the most useful assets of panel designs). We therefore believe population inferences can confidently be drawn from these panel data.         "
"24","What were the preferences of the American people on Judge Alito: Should he have been confirmed? We asked the respondents their views on this question and the evidence is unequivocal: A substantial majority of Americans (62%) supported Alito's confirmation. Only 26% felt that the nominee should not be confirmed. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, only 12% of the respondents had no opinion about Judge Alito. In a follow‐up question asking how important it is to the respondents that their senator vote their preferred way on the nomination, nearly one‐third (32%) thought the senator's vote very important and another 45% rated it somewhat important, while only 4% judged how their senator voted on the nomination as not important at all. In general, the Alito nomination was salient and significant to the American people,11 and a substantial majority favored the ascension of Alito to the high bench.         "
"25","For the purposes of this analysis, the dependent variable under scrutiny is preferences on whether Judge Alito should be confirmed to the Supreme Court. The specific measure we analyze in this article is an index that combines the responses to the question about whether Judge Alito ought to be confirmed with the replies to a query about the importance of the issue to the respondent. This measure is a continuous variable, which we rescaled to range from zero to one. The mean of the index is .61, and it is correlated with the five‐point Alito preference measure at .99, and with a preference trichotomy (favor, don't know, oppose) at .94. Thus, this measure captures the intensity of support or opposition to Alito's nomination and therefore can serve as a useful dependent variable for the analysis that follows.12"
"26","Our analysis focuses on two major classes of explanations of preferences on the confirmation process. The first we term the Policy Agreement Model, the second a Model of Judiciousness."
"27","The simplest way to think about how confirmation preferences are formed is to focus on policy and ideological agreement. We hypothesize that those who perceive the nominee's policy and ideological positions as congruent with their own will support the nominee's confirmation. The greater the policy distance between the respondent and the perceived location of the nominee, the less likely will the respondent be to support the confirmation."
"28","We measured congruence along two dimensions. The first is broad ideological agreement. Using a scale ranging from (0) extremely liberal to (10) extremely conservative, we asked the respondents to locate themselves, President Bush, and Judge Alito in ideological space. The results indicate that the opponents of Judge Alito failed in their efforts to paint the nominee as an extreme conservative. With the center on this 11‐point scale at 5.5, the average American places herself or himself very near the middle of the continuum (5.8); Bush is only somewhat to the right (6.3); and Alito is only very slightly to the right of Bush (6.5).13 On average, the American people viewed Judge Alito as 0.7 points more conservative than themselves, based on an 11‐point scale. It is perhaps odd that Bush is not seen as a quite conservative president, but, most important for this analysis, Alito is clearly not perceived as an extreme conservative. Only 9.8% of the respondents placed Alito at the most extreme point (10) on the liberalism–conservatism continuum. Were we to treat scores of 8 through 10 as indicative of being quite conservative, only 35.2% of our respondents rated Alito as quite conservative. The data seem to indicate that the Americans see Alito as conservative, but not as excessively or unacceptably so.14"
"29","Another way to parse these data is to compare the respondent's own position to his or her perception of Bush and Alito. The data in Table 1 show whether Bush and Alito are seen as more liberal than the respondent, more conservative, or about the same. The latter category is defined as being within plus or minus two points from the respondent's own position on the 11‐point scale. Thus, if the respondent places herself at 6, then scores from 4 through 8 are categorized as “about the same.”            "
"30","The compelling finding in Table 1 is of course the 60.9% of the respondents who see Alito as being relatively close to their own ideological position. That figure strikes us as emblematic of the opposition's abject failure at portraying Alito as excessively and illegitimately conservative. By an almost two‐to‐one margin, the respondents who do not share Alito's ideology see him as more conservative, but this is within the context of six out of ten Americans perceiving themselves to hold roughly the same ideological position as the judge.15"
"31","So the evidence from this survey is that Bush was perceived to have nominated someone of roughly his own ideological position to the Court. This seems to fit with the oft‐heard argument that “Bush won the election, therefore he gets to pick the judges,” so long as they are not too extreme. Clearly, Alito was not perceived by most as an extremist. It is therefore not very surprising that a majority of Americans supported Alito's confirmation and that the Senate vote turned out the way it did."
"32","Our survey also posed several questions about policy preferences, beginning by asking the respondent to rate six policy areas on their importance to her or him.16 The issues are (1) abortion, (2) affirmative action, (3) issues related to homosexuality, (4) the amount of money courts can award in personal injury lawsuits, (5) whether to allow religious displays on government property, and (6) whether the government has the right to record the telephone calls and monitor the e‐mail of private U.S. citizens in order to prevent people from planning terrorist or criminal acts. Next, we asked the respondent to identify the most important issue of this group.            "
"33","The most important court‐related issue to these respondents is the government's right to circumvent the privacy of citizens in order to deal with terrorism and crime, with 63.8% of the respondents assigning the issue the highest importance rating (“very important”), and more than one‐third rating this as their most important issue. The perennial conflict over abortion follows, with over one‐half of the respondents rating it as very important, and one‐fourth judging abortion to be the most important issue before the Supreme Court. Perhaps most interesting is the relatively low salience of issues of homosexuality, affirmative action, and even so‐called tort reform, none of which attracts a very large constituency. Indeed, twice as many respondents ascribe the greatest importance to the issue of whether to allow religious displays on government property as compared to affirmative action. Homosexuality is even less significant to these respondents."
"34","The respondents were also asked to indicate their positions on the judicial issue they deem to be most important. Considerable variability exists in the percentages of respondents adopting the modal position on each issue. For instance, a very large percentage (84.6%) of those rating the public display of religious symbols as most important wants to allow such displays. Similarly, most (73.1%) of those rating the civil liberties issue as most important would limit the government's right to monitor citizens' telephone calls and e‐mail. But, those who mention abortion as the most important issue are closely divided between those who would restrict abortion rights versus those who would expand them (with the remainder not wishing to change current policy). These figures are of course not for the population as a whole, but are rather the preferences of those who rated the specific issue as the most important on the list."
"35","We also measured the respondents' perceptions of Judge Alito's position on the issue they consider to be most important. For instance, among those viewing the religious display issue as most important, 43.2% view Judge Alito as inclined to favor allowing such displays, which is of course the preferred position of nearly all of those who assign priority to this controversy. Generally, the modal perception on five of the six issues is conservative, with the somewhat puzzling exception that 50.3% of those rating issues of homosexuality as most important asserting that an “Alito Court” would expand gay rights (in contrast to 42.1% who believe gay rights would be reduced). Interestingly, very large percentages of Americans believe they know Judge Alito's position on the issue of greatest importance to them (even if not necessarily on all issues). The largest exception to this assertion is on the issue of religious displays, but even here, of those rating this issue as most important, nearly three‐fourths believe they can identify Judge Alito's position. At the other extreme, only 6.9% of those rating abortion as most important are uncertain about the judge's stance on that judicial policy.            "
"36","We were able to score virtually all respondents in the degree of perceived agreement with the Alito Court on the policy matter to which the respondent assigned highest priority. We differentiate in this analysis between ordinary disagreement and strong disagreement by distinguishing between those who take an entirely contrary position to Alito (e.g., expand versus restrict civil liberties) and those who differ only in that either the respondent or Alito favors “no change” in current policy, while the other favors a change in substantive position. The distribution of the variable is as follows:"
"37","                "
"38","Thus, specific policy agreement with Alito is less widespread than general ideological congruence, with only four in ten Americans expecting an Alito Court to make the policy preferred by the respondent on her or his most important issue. However, only slightly more than one‐third take a substantive policy view opposite of that which they perceive Alito to hold. Once again, a remarkably high percentage of the American people believe they know the judge's position on the issue of greatest importance to them.17"
"39","Judiciousness is an alternative to ideology as a criterion for preference formation and is based on the qualities the respondent views as important for being a good judge. We began consideration of the respondents' expectations with the following text: “Now I would like you to focus on thinking about the characteristics of a good Supreme Court judge, that is, what a good judge ought to be like. First, how important would you say it is for a good Supreme Court judge to [INSERT ITEM]?” The characteristics about which we queried the respondents are reported in the bottom portion of Table 2. The data clearly reveal that Americans expect their Supreme Court justices to maintain the appearance of fairness and impartiality (75.5%, as well as, no doubt, to actually act in a fair and impartial way), to be especially concerned about protecting people without power from those with power (71.7%), and to uphold long‐standing constitutional values (67.4%). Given the ballyhoo from elites about precedent and “super‐precedents,” perhaps the most surprising finding in these data is the relatively small weight the Americans give to respecting existing Supreme Court decisions (only 37.3% rate it as very important). Across the set of items, the average number of characteristics judged to be extremely important is 3.7 (with a median of 4). Virtually all respondents found something on our list to rate as very important.            "
"40","These expectations are interesting in and of themselves, and we will have more to say about them at a later point in our research. For the purposes of this analysis, however, the primary function of these variables is to allow an expectancy‐based method of analyzing judiciousness. Consequently, we asked the respondents to evaluate Judge Alito on each of these criteria, and we used their replies to calculate an index of satisfaction/disappointment for each of the characteristics about which we asked. The index is scored only for those respondents rating the attribute as very important. On this measure, disappointment is most widespread on whether Alito will be independent of the president and the government and whether he will be concerned to protect the powerless (10.5% scored as very disappointed), and is least widespread on whether the justice will uphold constitutional values (4.9% very disappointed, 42.0% very satisfied)—among those rating the attribute as very important. Table 2 reports the mean satisfaction/disappointment scores (with high scores indicating greater satisfaction). The column labeled “N” is the number of respondents on which the mean is based, which is the number of people rating the characteristics as “very important” in the role expectations questions.            "
"41","The data reveal that, in general, the Americans are reasonably satisfied with Judge Alito, since all the means are greater than .5 (which is the score for uncertainty about Alito). In every instance, Judge Alito is judged to be at least somewhat likely to behave as the respondent expects him to behave. With scores like these, it is little wonder that a majority of Americans favored Judge Alito's confirmation."
"42"," Table 2 also reports the bivariate correlation between the disappointment/satisfaction measure and opinions on whether Alito ought to be confirmed. Several interesting findings emerge from these coefficients. First, some variability exists across the attributes, ranging from a correlation of .53 for satisfaction that Alito will strictly follow the law, to a significantly smaller coefficient of .27 for respecting existing decisions. In general, the more an expectation is satisfied, the more likely the respondent is to support the confirmation of Judge Alito.            "
"43","A very strong bivariate relationship exists between the average disappointment/satisfaction score and support for confirming Judge Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court: r= .56 (N = 321, p < .000). Those whose expectations of Alito are satisfied—in a “running tally” of a sort—are vastly more likely to support his confirmation. This is quite strong evidence in support of the expectancy model.            "
"44","To this point in the analysis, we have developed three important independent variables and their associated hypotheses:"
"45","                              "
"46","Support for Alito's confirmation is expected to be inversely related to the degree to which general ideological disagreement with Alito is perceived."
"47","Support for Alito's confirmation is expected to be inversely related to the degree to which the citizen perceives policy disagreement with Judge Alito on the issue of greatest importance to the citizen."
"48","Support for Alito's confirmation is expected to be positively related to the degree to which Judge Alito is perceived to satisfy the respondent's expectations of judiciousness."
"49","We turn next to our analysis of confirmation preferences."
"50","We begin the analysis with a simple set of equations positing that confirmation preferences are no more than a function of ideological and partisan disagreement. Table 3 reports three nested regression models. Model I hypothesizes that confirmation preferences are a function of the general ideological distance (measured as a continuous variable) between the respondent and Judge Alito. Model II adds policy disagreements to the equation. Because we do not necessarily hypothesize linear effects of policy disagreements, we nominalized the variable and include in the equation three dummy variables: policy disagreement, strong policy disagreement, and uncertainty over whether disagreement exists with Judge Alito's policies. The excluded category for this set of dummy variables is agreement with Alito. Finally, in Model III we add the respondent's party identification (measured using the conventional 7‐point scale) to the equation, hypothesizing that Democrats are less likely to prefer Alito than Republicans.         "
"51","Several telling conclusions emerge from the three models analyzed in Table 3. First, ideological disagreement has a moderately strong impact on confirmation preferences: where the ideological distance between the respondent and Alito is greater, the respondent is more likely to oppose confirmation. Second, however, virtually no independent impact can be found from specific policy disagreement. We note that a significant bivariate correlation between strong policy disagreement and opinions exists (r=−.16), indicating that greater policy disagreement is associated with less support for confirmation, but the effect of this variable is entirely subsumed in the multivariate equation by the measure of ideological distance. Opposition to Judge Alito's confirmation therefore had less to do with any specific policy disagreements with the judge and more to do with broader ideological conflict (although of course the former is a component of the latter).18"
"52","The contribution of Model III is to demonstrate that partisanship influences confirmation opinions over and above simple ideological disagreement. As expected, the independent effects of both ideological distance and partisanship on confirmation preferences are smaller than their bivariate effects; nonetheless, both variables exert a moderately strong impact on views of whether Alito should be confirmed. In this instance, partisanship and ideology are separate bases on which one might oppose or support the elevation of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court."
"53","Thus, at this point in the analysis, it appears that opinions on the Alito confirmation are fairly simple: Democrats and those perceiving strong ideological differences with the judge (mainly but not exclusively liberals) tend to oppose him. The equation has reasonable predictive power (explaining 21% of the variance in confirmation preferences). But is this simple model of ideology and partisanship all there is to the confirmation controversy?"
"54","To what degree does failure to satisfy the role expectations of the respondent influence confirmation preferences? As we have noted, the answer provided by these data is that preferences are strongly influenced by expectations: r= .56. Those who perceived Judge Alito as satisfying their expectations are considerably more likely to favor his confirmation. Moreover, this relationship eclipses the ideology/partisanship equation in its ability to predict opinions.            "
"55","Ideology and partisanship alone (excluding policy disagreement) can explain about 21% of the variance in confirmation preferences. When the measure of expectation satisfaction is added to that equation, another 18% of the variance is explained (for a total of 39%). Table 4 reports the full regression results.19"
"56","The addition of role expectations to the equation significantly reduces the impact of ideological distance and partisanship on preferences, although the relationships remain highly statistically and substantively significant. But the primary importance of Table 4 is that it demonstrates an extraordinarily strong and independent impact of the satisfaction of role expectations on confirmation preferences. Those whose expectations of Alito are satisfied more strongly are much more supportive of his confirmation than those holding unrequited expectations. Thus, the conclusion to draw from this table is that confirmation preferences are a function of three major considerations: (1) whether Judge Alito is seen as having the characteristics of a good judge, as defined and perceived by the citizen; (2) the perceived ideological distance between Alito and the citizen; and (3) the citizen's partisanship. Perhaps the most important finding is that confirmation preferences clearly are shaped by much more than just ideology and partisanship.20"
"57","Finally, we have considered whether the relationships depicted in Table 4 are affected when a variety of demographic characteristics and other attitudes are added to the equation. Specifically, we control for (1) whether the respondent is an African American; (2) gender; (3) level of education; (4) income; (5) age; (6) knowledge of the Supreme Court; and (7) confidence in President Bush. In this expanded equation, the coefficients for the three substantive variables reported in Table 4 are virtually identical. The only control variable with a significant effect on the preference for whether Alito should be confirmed is gender; none of the other variables comes close to having a statistically or substantively significant independent impact. Ceteris paribus, men are more likely to support Alito. Because gender is uncorrelated with the independent variables of primary substantive interest in this analysis, the reduced equation, which has the virtue of simplicity, adequately and accurately represents these relationships. (The expanded analysis is available from the authors on request.)            "
"58","The theory of positivity bias suggests that those with certain predispositions are likely to view confirmation disputes in particular ways. More specifically, those expressing strong attachment to the Supreme Court are likely to hold a distinct set of expectations of judges and are also predisposed to accept arguments by the nominee and her or his advocates about the importance of judiciousness, especially in contrast to policy preferences, ideology, and partisanship."
"59","Testing this hypothesis requires that we develop a measure of loyalty to the U.S. Supreme Court. Our thinking about operationalizing institutional loyalty follows a considerable body of research on theorizing about and measuring mass perceptions of high courts (see Caldeira and Gibson 1992, 1995; Gibson and Caldeira 1995, 1998, 2003; Gibson, Caldeira, and Baird 1998; Gibson 2007). That research conceptualizes loyalty as opposition to making fundamental structural and functional changes in the institution (see Boynton and Loewenberg 1973) and is grounded in the history of attacks by politicians against courts in the United States (see Caldeira 1987) and elsewhere (e.g., manipulation of their jurisdiction). As Caldeira and Gibson describe it, those who have little or no loyalty toward the Supreme Court are willing “to accept, make, or countenance major changes in the fundamental attributes of how the high bench functions or fits into the U.S. constitutional system” (1992, 638; see also Loewenberg 1971). Loyalty is also characterized by a generalized trust that the institution will perform acceptably in the future. To the extent people support fundamental structural changes in an institution, are willing to punish the institution for its policy outputs, and generally distrust it, they are extending little legitimacy to that institution. Conceptually, loyalty thus ranges from complete unwillingness to support the continued existence of the institution to staunch institutional fealty.            "
"60","Following this body of research, we have measured institutional loyalty with a four‐item index.21 We have computed two such indices, one the average response to the four statements and another simply the number of supportive responses. Moreover, we calculate these loyalty indices from two sources: the 2005 survey (i.e., loyalty measured prior to the Alito nomination), and loyalty measured contemporaneously with the Alito questions (i.e., in the 2006 survey). The former of course have stronger claims to causality, but the relationships are attenuated by any change that might have occurred between the two interviews.22 The latter indicators should be stronger predictors since they are measured at the same point in time, but owing to that factor, confidence in the causal inference is clouded.            "
"61","To reiterate, the hypothesis we test is that those with preexisting loyalty to the Supreme Court will judge the confirmation process differently. More specifically, we expect those with high levels of loyalty to weigh judiciousness much more heavily than they weight partisanship and ideology, and more highly than those with low loyalty toward the Court. Table 5 reports the relevant data. In testing the conditional hypothesis, we cast our lot with improving internal validity: increasing the confidence in the causal inference (even though this works against the confirmation of the hypothesis). Therefore, institutional loyalty is measured in 2005, and all other variables associated with the confirmation are measured in 2006. The temporal sequencing of the data adds increased confidence to any causal inferences which we might make about the effect of preexisting attitudes on expectations, perceptions, and judgments of the confirmation process.            "
"62","The coefficients in this table provide strong support for the hypothesized conditional effect of preexisting loyalty toward the Supreme Court. Those who score high on the loyalty index tend to weigh satisfaction of their role expectations (judiciousness) much more heavily in forming a confirmation preference than those who score low on institutional loyalty (b = 3.46 versus b = 1.97). The difference of regression coefficients is highly statistically and substantively significant. Institutional loyalty makes little difference in how much weight is accorded ideological distance and partisanship (the coefficients between citizens with high and low loyalty do not differ). Thus, the consequence of institutional support is that loyalty points the citizen toward judging the process on the basis of judiciousness, and the satisfaction of one's expectations of judges has a very large effect on confirmation preferences, even if loyalty does not totally eliminate considerations of ideology and partisanship."
"63","                "
"64"," Table 5 provides a useful means of illustrating these important differences. However, a more efficient method of testing the interactive hypothesis is available. We estimated a single equation that included as predictors (1) ideological distance, (2) partisanship, (3) satisfaction of role expectations, (4) institutional loyalty, and (5) the interaction of loyalty and role expectations.23 We tested the hypothesis using two separate indicators of loyalty: the mean response to the four items and a count of the number of supportive replies to the four propositions. The results of this formal test of interaction strongly support our hypothesis, and it matters little which of the indicators of loyalty is used.24 Since the count variable employs the most intuitively accessible metric (the number of items on which support is expressed, varying from zero to four), we use that variable to illustrate the results of the hypothesis test.            "
"65","The regression coefficient for the interaction term is .88 (see note in Table 5 for the full equation). Thus, the slopes of the satisfaction of role expectations variable, according to level of institutional loyalty (number of items endorsed), are as follows:            "
"66","These figures clearly document that the impact of the satisfaction of role expectations on confirmation preferences increases rather dramatically over the range of degrees of institutional loyalty.25 The most loyal citizens place an exceptional degree of emphasis on the judiciousness of the nominee when considering whether to support the nomination to the high bench.26"
"67","The analysis presented in this article has produced some reasonably strong support for the theory of positivity bias in public reactions to Supreme Court decisions and events. Most specifically, we have shown that those who express loyalty toward the U.S. Supreme Court form their judgments about nominees to the Court on the basis of specific criteria: the satisfaction by the nominee of expectations of judiciousness. Among the loyal, failure to satisfy role expectations is strongly associated with opposition to confirming Judge Alito, just as satisfying such expectations is strongly connected to approval of his confirmation. These citizens do not eschew entirely issues of ideology, policy, and partisanship—and in that sense they differ little from those who express low loyalty toward the Court—but the dominant factor in their decision making focuses on whether the nominee has the characteristics of a good judge. We argue that this is evidence of a preexisting attitude (loyalty) establishing a frame of reference for evaluating judicial nominees. This frame provides the criteria for judging the candidates. We place a usually high degree of confidence in these findings since they make use of panel data in which loyalty to the Supreme Court is measured well before the variables associated with perceptions and judgments of the confirmation process, a particularly tough test of the hypothesis."
"68","These findings give succor to those who have long labored toward understanding the causes and consequences of institutional legitimacy. Our evidence indicates that legitimacy matters. Whether citizens accord legitimacy to institutions like the Supreme Court has highly significant consequences for a variety of aspects of judicial politics."
"69","Moreover, this analysis also provides considerable support for the theory of framing. We have demonstrated that preexisting attitudes shape evaluations of contemporary events. These attitudes activate criteria against which perceptions of facts are evaluated. Without the frame, matters of judiciousness are less relevant to citizens in their assessments of Supreme Court nominees. This seems to us to be a classic example of the power of frames, although we certainly recognize that more work on the process involved here is in order. Nonetheless, the empirical results are encouraging."
"70","Our findings have important consequences for the confirmation process itself. We begin with a basic empirical fact: The Supreme Court has a very large supply of institutional legitimacy. Due to that legitimacy, a large proportion of the American people are predisposed to judge confirmation controversies in terms of criteria of judiciousness, apart from normal partisan or ideological politics. The presumption is that judiciousness is the most relevant criterion. Of course, candidates can be defeated on issues of judiciousness, of which perhaps Harriet Miers's nomination is a classic example. It turned out that it was not too difficult to challenge Miers's judicial credentials. Indeed, in her case, many did not reach consideration of the dimension of ideology and partisanship, so suspect were her judicial qualifications. Once the presumption that judiciousness was disestablished as the principal relevant criterion, issues of ideology and partisanship could be effectively raised. Of course, the withdrawal of Miers's nomination by President Bush perhaps had more to do with politics within the Republican Party than with ordinary citizens, but we nonetheless perceive some of the same processes at work here. If a president is shrewd enough to nominate someone who is minimally qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, then the debate can often be centered on issues of judiciousness, as it was for Alito and Roberts.         "
"71","The job of the opposition to a nominee is to try to substitute an alternative frame through which the debate can be conducted. That frame of course focuses on ideology, issues, and partisanship. We have seen, however, just how difficult it is for substitute frames to be effective. We attribute this to the wellspring of legitimacy enjoyed by the Supreme Court, and the consequence of this legitimacy, which is the belief that judges are different from ordinary politicians, that therefore nominees ought to be evaluated on the basis of legal, not political, criteria. As long as the Supreme Court maintains its reservoir of goodwill—and if presidents are cagey enough to nominate candidates for whom an easy prima facie case for judiciousness can be made—it seems unlikely that political forces can be effectively mobilized to deny presidents their choices."
"72","We reiterate our view that institutional legitimacy is an enormously important source of political capital. The conventional hypothesis is that legitimacy is significant because it contributes to acquiescence to decisions of which people do not approve (e.g., Gibson, Caldeira, and Spence 2005). We have devoted considerable effort toward investigating that hypothesis throughout the world. To the extent that we are correct in our analysis of the theory of positivity bias, we suggest here that legitimacy has an even more significant role in the political process: Citizens who extend legitimacy to the Supreme Court are characterized by a set of attitudes that frame a variety of expectations and choices. These frames provide a standing decision that is difficult to rebut in contemporary American politics. This consequence of institutional legitimacy is perhaps the most significant.         "
