"1","The short work, entitled “A Discourse of Laws,” first appeared as part of a collection, Horae Subsecivae: Observations and Discourses, published anonymously in 1620. In the 1990s, computer analysis revealed three of the twelve original pieces as the work of Hobbes, who would have been in his early thirties at the time.12 The discourses are important because they provide access to Hobbes's thought prior to his adoption of scientific method, but far from demonstrating any lingering humanistic bent or affinity for Machiavellian tropes, they show general consistency with the works of Hobbes's middle and late periods.         "
"2","Each discourse explores identifiable Hobbesian themes in seemingly uncharacteristic ways. In particular, “A Discourse of Laws” takes up the standard theme of the true ground of obedience, but deals with it by emphasizing the character of the laws rather than the requirement that there be a single author of law in every commonwealth:"
"3","                        "
"4","So the true end of all Laws is to ordain, and settle an order, and government amongst us, the Jurisdiction whereof we are rather bound to obey, than dispute; Laws being, as it were, the Princes we ought to serve, the Captains we are to follow, the very rules, by which all the actions of our life be squared and disposed. (Hobbes 1995, 105)               "
"5","This emphasis is not inconsistent with the more straightforward absolutism of the political treatises. Indeed, even within the limited framework of the three discourses, the connection between law and unitary authority is never hard to find. For example, in “A Discourse upon the Beginning of Tacitus,” Hobbes tells his readers that a chief cause of Augustus's success in seizing the Roman state was that prior to his ascent, the laws were “like Spiders' webs, only to hold the smaller Flies,” and the provincials were happy to support the rule of a prince who strengthened the authority of the law (Hobbes 1995, 49).         "
"6","Although the order of composition of the three discourses is unknown, it is difficult to credit the suggestion (Saxonhouse 1995, 148) that this treatment of Augustus already reflects a change in the young author's thought on law. Rather, the two contrasting discussions strongly suggest the weakness of personal rule, a weakness reflected in a third discourse (“A Discourse of Rome”), which uses a survey of the physical features of the city to elicit reflection on the political failings of its ancient and modern inhabitants. The discourse on law emphasizes the disciplinary utility of positive law, but treats natural law (i.e., “Marriage, generation, education, and the like”) both as an indispensable foundation (Hobbes 1995, 110) and as a living connective tissue (109). A similar approach is evident in later political treatises, which highlight “artificial” consent, but retain the natural element insofar as everyone is born a helpless infant (Hobbes 1991, 117 [De Cive, Chapter I]), imbued with a desire for comfort, a hope to attain it, and a fear to lose it.         "
"7","Where laws rule, the young Hobbes suggests, the skillful prince is unnecessary. Where no laws rule, “such confusion would follow in government, that the differences of Right and wrong, Just and unlawful, could never be distinguished.” Conversation and commerce would be overthrown, “all right would be perverted by power, and all honesty swayed by greatness” (Hobbes 1995, 105–106). “A Discourse of Laws” displays few of the terms and little of the method of Hobbes's political treatises, but there are strong intimations of a miserable natural condition. Without positive law, there is only “convulsion” and “dissolution,” and “neither Religion, nor life, nor society, can be maintained” (109–11). To support this proposition the young Hobbes cites Plato and Heraclitus, neither of whom, it must be said, would accept the political treatises's conception of reason. Be that as it may, if one assumes that law and nature, or reason and nature, are destined to function as wholly contradictory concepts in Hobbes's mature thought, then his early use of phrases such as “convulsion” and “dissolution” in proximity to vaguely Thomistic language uniting law with nature can only be taken as a sign of youthful incoherence. Thus Saxonhouse concludes that the young Hobbes “has not yet resolved the relationship among law and reason and nature as he will in his later writings” (1995, 150).         "
"8","Unquestionably, the discourses lack a fully developed theoretical apparatus, but what initially appears an incoherent version of arguments finally clarified in Hobbes's middle period turns out to be perfectly capable of standing on its own and even casting doubt on subsequent “clarifications.” In particular, Hobbes may not hold reason, law, and nature to be as contradictory as some scholars have argued. Bobbio, for instance, cites passages from De Cive and Leviathan in support of his view that Hobbes's law of nature “has no function other than to provide a justification for the birth of the state, and therefore of positive laws … it is as if the law of nature had appeared only to disappear a moment later” (1993, 122). Similarly, Kraynak argues that Hobbes simply asserts self‐preservation as man's natural end, thereby collapsing right and necessity, only to transform the latter into a moral duty by metaphysical slight of hand (1990, 202).         "
"9","The early and late works suggest the need to correct these views. The appearance that the law of nature is initially unenforceable and is entirely replaced by positive law after the establishment of the commonwealth has spawned a number of commentaries (Gauthier 1969; Hampton 1986; Kavka 1983) which aim to repair Hobbes's failed solution to a purely theoretical puzzle (i.e., how a rational egoist can escape the state of nature), but these reconstructions are plausible only because Hobbes chose to obscure the role of history in the political treatises, and that move, although doubtless connected to a personal “epistemological crisis,” must be seen also in the context of a dispute over the nature of authority with the self‐appointed guardians of religion, custom, and law. In this light, Hobbes's political theory appears, not primarily as an exercise in logic, but as an effort to reconstruct intellectual foundations for what Hobbes took to be dangerously unstable, yet real historical improvements in politics, religion, and morality. On careful analysis, the law of nature is enforceable in the state of nature, at least between parents and children (Hobbes 1991, 116–17 [De Cive, Chapter I]), which explains why Hobbes acknowledges in Leviathan that “the savage people in many places of America,” who remain in the state of nature, nonetheless manifest “government of small families, the concord whereof dependeth on naturall lust” (Hobbes 1968, 187 [Lev., Chapter 13]).         "
"10","That small families exist in the natural condition, and that large families, if not already joined to a commonwealth, are of themselves like little monarchies (257 [Lev., Chapter 20]), amounts to an implicit admission that the cognitive transformation Hobbes seeks does not occur in a vacuum, but depends on a prior historical evolution: small families expand through generation, marriage, and conquest to become kingdoms, kingdoms introduce positive law, which in turn permits the civilizing development of public rule. Christianity complicates this generic historical scheme by inserting the notion of a loving Creator who is identified with an eternal law, accessible to the believer's conscience, and distinct from every existing system of man‐made law. In a Christian world, the generically beneficial distinction between public and private rule turns hazardous. Every merely human legal system is threatened on the one hand by religiously inspired claims of conscience, and on the other by the disparagement of public rule as nothing more than a cover for some fortunate private person's successful seizure of power. In his lifelong effort to dispose of this dual threat, Hobbes does not deny the existence of a natural or divine pattern of political organization, only its misappropriation by philosophers, lawyers, and priests. Of course, Hobbes's pattern—consisting of little more than the Pauline admonition (Romans 13) that the powers that be are ordained of God—is radically simplified and tied to a pessimistic view of human capacities (Hobbes 1999, 21 [L&N, § 12]; Overhoff 2000, 137). But the pattern exists, and it is important not to mistake its simplicity and pessimism for a fatalistic acceptance of arbitrary government. In this respect, the discourses can be especially helpful.         "
"11","The young Hobbes uses several lines from Tacitus, describing the establishment of peace after Rome's civil war, to introduce a theme that later proves central to his political treatises (Hobbes 1995, 45–49; 1968, 188 [Lev., Chapter 13]). Augustus wins over the army with money, the people with food, and the decimated nobility with preferments. From this description, it appears that the formula for civil order does not vary between Hobbes's early and middle periods, but always involves three elements: a universal (albeit individually specifiable) desire for comfort, a hope to attain it, and a fear to lose it. In the mostly private government of Augustan Rome, fear and hope are directly tied to the prince, who strives to balance them. If fear outweighs hope, as in Rome's bloody civil war, subjects are paralyzed and the commonwealth is unable to defend itself (Hobbes 1995, 37). If hope outweighs fear, as when Augustus ages and several potential successors compete for popular favor, subjects are actively disobedient and cast their lot with the party they think most likely to gain power (62).         "
"12","In contrast to the private rule of a politic prince, the public rule Hobbes describes in “A Discourse of Laws” promises lasting stability on the basis of a different orientation of fear and hope. Fear is now internalized or self‐referential, and hope is tied to the success of the system as a whole. Under these conditions, subjects will fear the possibility of “convulsion” which would result if each were to act on the natural “violent heat of desires, and passions, and fancies” (Hobbes 1995, 110). Unlike the external fear of detection and punishment by Augustus, which is always somewhat unpredictable and decays as the ruler declines, fear that is individualized and internalized is self‐regenerating and inherently balanced. It regenerates because it is tied to the passions, the source of all individual impulses, and it is inherently balanced by a rational hope that each will see the “necessary” connection between obedience to the law and fulfillment of a natural, rational desire to “live peaceably and regularly one with another” (111). The fear of general convulsion therefore ensures unforced obedience and durable civil peace.         "
"13","In this setting, the threats and bribes of an Augustus can be held in abeyance as largely subordinate to “the fountains of natural Justice and equity” which flow continuously through the sovereign's public person (108). To speak less allusively, by internalizing fear, the young Hobbes puts the individual in a position to answer personal anxieties as fast as they emerge. Each person's fear that his unregulated pursuit of self‐interest, when projected to all others, will destroy the commonwealth is perpetually balanced by the hope of each that everyone's personal commitment to obedience and industry will lead to public peace and private comfort."
"14","Of course, even in the context of “voluntary” subjection, the sovereign must occasionally resort to violence, but the emphasis here is on regularity rather than, say, the brutal and unanticipated spectacle of a dissected Remirro De Orco, approvingly reported in Machiavelli's The Prince. For the young Hobbes, “punishment of offenders should appear to proceed from a necessity forced, rather than a will voluntary, that by the example of punishing some, others might be made the better” (106). While it may not matter to those on the receiving end whether the sovereign's justice appears to proceed from necessity or choice, to the vast majority of peaceable, law‐abiding subjects, conceiving punishment in terms of necessity transforms the prevailing motivation for obedience. External fear of the sovereign's sword will now be limited to a few points of direct contact between sovereign and subject, while in the larger realm of civil life, obedience will derive from an internal fear of the destructive effects of one's own selfish impulses.         "
"15","Where internalized fear prevails, the sovereign's public rule will signify strength rather than weakness, and the problem of disparity between a violent origin and a later evolution towards self‐restraint will dissipate. In such circumstances, a wily Augustus would do more harm than good. The requisite ruler is a conduit of natural law. To his subjects, he is “reputed to be as the fountain of Justice,” and his primary function—due enforcement of the laws—“keeps the fountain free from corruption, infection, or danger” (109). Laws, therefore, work not only to control the people, but also as a prophylactic for preserving this sort of sovereign's “person and reputation.” In contrast, where a sovereign rules without law, “his person is more subject to the attempts of Traitors, his life to the tongues of malice and detraction, and his reputation to perpetual infamy” (109)."
"16","This early distinction between private and public rulers is carried forward into the political treatises, although Hobbes obscures and dehistoricizes it so as to promote obedience to existing power. If he were to show the long‐term futility of a particular ruler's Machiavellian machinations, as he did in the discourse on Tacitus, he might inadvertently encourage rebellion. To avoid that possibility, as much as to adopt a new scientific method, Hobbes resorts to abstraction. Thus he shows the advantage, in terms of duration and stability, of a government resting on mutual covenant, even as he refrains from denigrating the alternative foundation in conquest. This is the larger significance of his comment, in Leviathan, that the skill of making and maintaining commonwealths consists in rules, “not (as Tennis‐play) on Practise onely” (Hobbes 1968, 261 [Lev., Chapter 20]). He does not deny that commonwealths have long been made and maintained on the basis of practice rather than rules, but he strongly suggests that to follow such precedents is to lay one's foundation in sand.         "
"17","Individuals who covenant with one another create the unity represented by the instituted sovereign. In such circumstances, subjects understand themselves, and are understood to be embedded in a web of commitments sanctioned by sovereignty. In contrast, the unity produced by acquisition is the sum of multiple unilateral relationships with a particular sovereign. Hobbes is at pains to show that the rights and consequences of sovereignty are the same in both instances (Hobbes 1968, 252 [Lev., Chapter 20]). Both rest on consent, which cannot be revoked, regardless of the quality of rule. But if the quality of rule is irrelevant to formal considerations of right and duty, it is highly pertinent to the maintenance of commonwealths, which depends ultimately on the stability of popular opinion (728 [Lev., A Review and Conclusion]).         "
"18","Consent based on every individual's external fear of one strongman, or one conquering nation, is simply less durable than consent based on everyone's internal fear of the destructive potential of unchecked self‐assertion. Strongmen weaken and die. Conquering nations tire of the demands of imperial rule. But individuals never cease hoping to satisfy desire and thus never cease fearing the potential frustration of desire in the “reemergence” of an “original” chaos. This abstract treatment of the problem of reconciling right and law, or “is” and “ought,” may seem to have no connection to historical experience or traditional natural law approaches to the problem. But the early discourses help to show that the appearance is misleading. Fear is the passion to be reckoned on, but it need not be the blunt, external, and ultimately ephemeral terror conventionally identified with the author of Leviathan.         "
"19","In the discourse on Tacitus, Hobbes observes the Roman state splintering as “every man that followed Augustus in his strength, now in the declining of his age turn their eyes upon the next change” (Hobbes 1995, 55). By contrast, in a regime of laws, “the reverence and duty we owe to the Laws is nothing else but obedience to reason, which is the begetter, corrector, and preserver, of the very Laws themselves” (115). The rule of law is thus superior to the rule of an arbitrary despot, no matter how effective, because it rests on an individualized, artificially cultivated cognitive balance between a natural desire to live in peace, a realized hope for its attainment, and a learned fear that unchecked self‐interest will result in its loss. In the context of a comparison between despotism and the rule of law, the quoted statement linking reason and law is not a momentary lapse into a soon‐to‐be‐abandoned Thomism, but an articulation of a severely chastened naturalism, and a foreshadowing of formal distinctions between conquest and mutual covenant. In early and middle periods alike, Hobbes would base lasting political stability and the effective realization of natural law not on reason per se, but on the rational manipulation of natural desires, cultivated fears, and realized hopes.         "
"20","In place of Leviathan's sometimes ponderous logical arguments, the discourses offer charming accounts of ancient political intrigue, the sights and sounds of Rome, and the stability and prosperity of a regime of law. Each of these accounts is connected to the mature political theory, but the connections are easily missed if the reader devotes too much attention to the difference in presentation. Thus, when Hobbes criticizes adulation of Roman tyrannicides (Hobbes 1995, 33) with the saying, “Prosperum et felix scelus virtus vocatur” (prosperous and fortunate vice is called virtue), he is not arguing, in a Machiavellian vein, that vice and virtue originate with the creation of the state (Saxonhouse 1995, 132). That interpretation rests on an implausible assumption about the “plotline” of the discourse, the latter half of which describes how Augustus ultimately fails in his efforts to ensure a peaceful succession precisely because of his extraordinary Machiavellian gifts.         "
"21","Far from praising the maxim, the young Hobbes rejects any implication that great political stakes transform a private crime into a public act of heroism. The argument will reappear in Leviathan, where Hobbes describes certain “false Principles” of right and wrong which encourage crime (Hobbes 1968, 339 [Lev., Chapter 27]). In the middle period, only promising can make right, whether the promise is “freely” given or “extorted” by force. But even in the early discourses, the source of right is the strengthening of the laws, not the usurpation of sovereign office. “Nothing is more proverbial,” Hobbes says in the discourse on Tacitus, “than that the Laws are like Spiders' webs, only to hold the smaller Flies” (Hobbes 1995, 49). Taken out of its context, which is an explanation of Augustus's popularity as one who restored the majesty of the law, the comparison with spiders' webs may seem an affirmation of pure conventionalism, or Machiavellian technique. But it is repeated almost verbatim in Leviathan—with identical references to the Roman strongmen, Marius, Sulla, and Caesar—as an argument against Machiavellian opportunism. To say that success, rather than law, makes the difference between vice and virtue is simply to guarantee “the perpetuall disturbance of the Peace of the Common‐wealth” (Hobbes 1968, 340 [Lev., Chapter 27]).         "
"22","In reference to middle and late works, Baumgold correctly observes that “Hobbes's “art of government” is the antipode of Machiavellian statecraft” (1988, 106), but the early works suggest she exaggerates Hobbes's reliance on the sovereign's self‐interest and misses the most significant ramifications. In theory, a conqueror might govern by settled law, while an instituted sovereign might rule by fiat, but in practice, the opinions of the subjects as to the origin and continuing justification of sovereignty must be taken into account. With a view to the latter, the conqueror has nothing to gain from lawful rule because his subjects focus on his personal power rather than his legitimacy. The situation is different for the descendant of the conqueror, but as legitimacy becomes more salient, its connection with the original, “involuntary” basis of the commonwealth becomes more tenuous. If the conqueror's descendant asserts sovereignty against resistance, he is resented for returning to despotic, private rule. If he accepts legal limitations, he is scorned for his weakness (Hobbes 1968, 721 [Lev., A Review and Conclusion]). This is just the sort of catch‐22 Charles I encountered in the 1630s and 40s, and Hobbes's solution is neither a cleverer prince, nor a more brutal state, but a whole people—elites as well as commoners—instructed in the difference between the small inconveniences of civil life and the great risks of war.         "
"23","Hobbes shows Augustus skillfully making the most of the opportunities provided by Rome's civil war (Hobbes 1995, 45), but no sooner does he acquire the state, than he begins to provide for the succession, a task for which Machiavellian technique proves highly unsatisfactory. Too clever to allow the succession to depend on the lives of his own sons, Augustus also advances the sons of his wife, but that prudent measure produces destabilizing intrigue. When the aging personal ruler can no longer maintain direct control over his agents, “he must be forced to rely on the relations of divers, and so be subject to distraction, or else wholly trust unto some one, and become liable to abuse” (61). Meanwhile, every prominent subject, “hoping to make his private benefit out of the public remissness,” begins to oppress the commoners, whose complaints are kept from the aged prince and thus accumulate to a degree likely to induce rebellion.         "
"24","The high cost of Augustus's dissimulative technique is exacted when he prepares “to quit the Stage.” In despotic circumstances, the hopes of subjects are “much built upon the life of their Prince.” At his death, they must begin again and can conceive of the immediate future in only three modes: liberty, civil war, or a new prince. “For Liberty,” Hobbes makes clear, “they had no hope at all” (61). Augustus wiped out the best and accustomed all others to “the Arts of service, whereof obsequiousness is the chief” And as between civil war and a new prince, there is little to choose, given the character of Augustan technique and the presence of more than one claimant. The problem, Hobbes suggests in conclusion, lies not with absolute power per se, but with its conception. Where it rests on personality rather than law, those who compete for authority are less concerned to ensure the stability of its foundation than to prevent its falling into the hands of another. Thus, Augustus's successors struggle not “to outrun each other in the course,” but simply “to trip up one another's heels” (67), and doing so, they quickly bring the state to ruin."
"25","The contrast between “A Discourse of Laws” and “A Discourse Upon the Beginning of Tacitus” shows that the young Hobbes is not indifferent to the question whether law or arbitrary power holds sway. Human beings must be limited “within certain rules” (105–106), or power alone will dictate outcomes, in which case, there can be neither unity nor peace. The equal administration of justice is the basis of civil concord. Without justice, liberty tempts some to follow violent and unlawful courses to the attainment of their desires. Such men “would not measure their courses, by the rule of Aequum and Justum, but by the square of their own benefit, and affections: and so not being circumscribed within reasonable bounds, their reason becomes invisible” (106)."
"26","The appearance of contradiction between the foregoing argument and various statements in the political treatises is largely attributable to a change of historical context and audience. In the actual civil war of the late 1640s, when Hobbes rejects Aristotle's “Errour,” that “in a well ordered Common‐wealth, not Men should govern, but the Laws” (Hobbes 1968, 699 [Lev., Chapter 46]), his purpose is only to discourage disobedience, not to justify arbitrariness. In the same work, Hobbes asserts an obligation on the part of the sovereign to procure the safety of the people, by which he means not merely preservation, “but also all other Contentments of life, which every man by lawful Industry, without danger, or hurt to the Commonwealth, shall acquire to himselfe” (376 [Lev., Chapter 30]). Moreover, the sovereign is not to fulfill this duty by special treatment—the threats and bribes of a politic prince—“but by a generall Providence … in the making, and executing of good Lawes, to which individuall persons may apply their own cases” (376 [Lev., Chapter 30]).         "
"27","More than two decades separate the publication of the discourses and the earliest of the three main political treatises. In 1620, England was not yet torn by civil war and there would have been less call for a direct condemnation of seditious ideas. Instead, at a time of growing uncertainty, Hobbes speaks to that segment of literate society which is especially interested in Tacitus, Rome, and the works of Machiavelli.13 For such an audience—not yet fully factionalized—the chief obstacle to advancing the civil power is not disobedient pride, but political idolatry, or imagining the source of peace and stability to be the man in power rather than the power (or office) itself. There is no inconsistency between these positions, and no need to imagine a radical change of course in Hobbes's intellectual development.         "
"28","Political idolatry is a concept suggested by Hobbes's description of ancient and modern efforts to separate civil and divine duties, thus permitting the civil to make use of the divine, as in ancient Rome, or the divine to make use of the civil, as in Papal Rome. In Leviathan, idolatry is defined formally as praying to human beings for something “which God onely can doe for us” (Hobbes 1968, 670 [Lev., Chapter 45]). Hobbes's reluctance to express the concept of political idolatry directly may have much to do with its use by opponents of the King such as Milton, who labels support of the crown “a civil kinde of Idolatry” (Milton 1932, 68). From a Hobbesian standpoint, the problem with political idolatry would be that it camouflages the gap between natural self‐preservation and artificial obligation, rather than bridging it overtly with positive law. Such illusory approaches are inevitably unstable and destructive.         "
"29","In “A Discourse of Rome,” the young Hobbes suggests that the process by which the Roman Church elicits obedience from the credulous resembles the pagan practice of supporting morality by erecting massive public buildings and monuments to great men (Hobbes 1995, 83–84). In both cases, appearance is all‐important, but whereas the pagan practice at least conduces to civil order, the Church's practice encourages false worship and superstition, which, in turn, permits the Church to undermine civil authority for its own gain. The result of Church policy, as was the case with Augustan policy in the discourse on Tacitus, is a mistaken obedience: superstitious rather than pious, fearful of the man in power rather than the condition dictating the necessity of power, the customers of “these popish traders” are “carried away with every wind” (87–88). Moreover, scandal breeds skepticism: “When the People be taught moderation and sobriety, and see excess and liberty in their teachers, none is so blind but must see their deceit” (98). Modern, Christianized idolatry is therefore even less capable of constructing durable order than the ancient, pagan version practiced by Augustus.         "
"30","Having refuted ancient and modern mythologizing reconciliations of natural inclination and artificial obligation, the young Hobbes suggests a different way to avoid “a general dissolution” by adopting an unusual dual simile. Laws are like “the walls of government, and nations,” but also like “the only sinews of contracting a people together” (Hobbes 1995, 109). Laws are not merely useful artifacts, like fortifications, but natural constituents, like the connective tissues of a living body. Thus, the destruction of laws in a civil body “is the same with the convulsion of the sinews in a natural [body]; decay and dissolution, being the immediate, and unavoidable successors” (109). This peculiar blending of animate and inanimate images is not accidental. Years later, it reappears in the introduction of Leviathan, where Hobbes famously likens the human body to a machine (Hobbes 1968, 81 [Lev., The Introduction]), but that passage has become so familiar that its full significance is easily missed.         "
"31","A machine and a body politic, laws as fortifications and laws as sinews, are all products of human artifice, but they are not to be analyzed in the same way. To make a functioning machine it is sufficient merely to place components in the proper orientation. Similarly, human beings can be forced to live in proximity, and their quiet terror may for a time resemble the outcome of authorization and obedience. Social advancement and durable peace, however, require the deliberate arrangement of constantly shifting passions. At a minimum, the individual's fear of death must be balanced by a hope of obtaining the things necessary to commodious living (Hobbes 1968, 188 [Lev., Chapter 13]). Yet, if the death to be feared is one's own, the hope to avoid it will inevitably gravitate towards the other who dispenses it, rather than towards the self, in whose continuing obedience the artificial life of the whole is truly sustained. This externalized balance of hope and fear is law as “fortification,” without which “no people can subsist.” In other words, direct fear of the sovereign creates a people distinct from other peoples. Besides this minimal function, however, law can also be “the only sinews of contracting people together,” by which Hobbes implies that internalizing the threat of lawless “convulsion”—that is, the risk of communal rather than personal death—creates “a happy concord” and “union in our civil conversation” (Hobbes 1995, 107).         "
"32","While “all men have thought it more dangerous, to live in an Anarchy than under a Tyrant's government” (109), neither condition is to be preferred to the actual rule of law. In order to distinguish properly between the three conditions it is necessary to understand that nature is not as generous as many of Hobbes's predecessors supposed. By nature, men are “possessed with a violent heat of desires, and passions, and fancies.” Positive law serves to restrain them from “those actions, and thoughts, that would precipitate to all manner of hazards and ill” (110–11). On the other hand, the young Hobbes speaks of “certain fountains of natural justice and equity” (112), from which the infinite variety of municipal law derives. This natural contribution, as it emerges within civil society, is quickly reduced to three considerations: the common good, the persons to whom the laws will apply, and the existing procedures of the state (113)."
"33","Much later, in his dialogue on the common law, an older Hobbes elicits a slightly different formulation of the same idea. The lawyer warns that judges should not depart too much from the letter of the statutes. In reply, the philosopher states that they may without danger recede from the letter, so long as they adhere to “the meaning and sense of the Law, which may be … easily found out by the Preamble, the time when it was made, and the Incommodities for which it was made” (Hobbes 1971, 56–57 [Dial., Of the Law of Reason]). In other words, the rational substance of positive law—its connection to the “fountains of natural justice and equity”—is not the independent wisdom of priests, philosophers, or lawyers, but simply the functional specificity of a general command informed by the sovereign's desire to preserve the commonwealth in a condition of peaceful order. Early and late in his career, Hobbes would maintain that human beings receive much more benefit from positive law than from nature, yet his goal is never a clever and arbitrary Augustus, but the far more stable alternative of a regime which grounds political order in an overtly artificial legal response to a natural human desire for peace and security.         "
"34","It is certainly true that Hobbes rejects the medieval conception of reason and natural law as the means by which human communities participate in a cosmic order (Bobbio 1993, 153). Yet it would be inaccurate to characterize Hobbes's view of nature as one that gives us only conflict. Even before the political treatises' sorely neglected depiction of small families in the state of nature, the discourses suggest that the relation of reason, law, and nature is neither entirely contradictory, nor entirely complementary. Both positions, in Hobbes's view, lead to serious errors, the former illustrated by the destructive opportunism of Augustus and the latter by the self‐conceited fanaticism of the Church of Rome.         "
"35","Hobbes prefers a natural base—as, for example, “the commixture of several sexes” (Hobbes 1995, 110), which evinces a universal and deep‐seated desire for comfort—combined with an artificial superstructure; that is, a durable balance of hope and fear made possible only by fully grasping and openly addressing human limitations. If he was unwilling, in the works of the middle period, to repeat his early characterization of laws as “rulers of men,” it is not because he temporarily abandoned hope in the possibility of a government which operates according to law, or because he thought the instituted sovereign's public conscience an ineffective restraint on absolute power. More likely, in the period between 1620 and the late 1640s, he witnessed the damage done by a priesthood of lawyers disparaging sovereignty under the banner of the common law.         "
"36","Hobbes's judgment as to the superiority of government by settled law is not adequately explained as a consequence of its greater capacity to generate power. To say that Hobbes would see no distinction between governments, so long as each claims an identity of interest between subjects and sovereign, is to miss more than half the argument. The first two Stuart monarchs had already made such claims to little, or to harmful, effect (Sommerville 1999, 126). The important question is whether that identity implies a relationship in which subjects are merely instruments of the sovereign's private person—susceptible to his own desires and fears—or one in which they underwrite the sovereign's public person, and thereby guarantee, to the extent humanly possible, the peace and security of their own private persons. Hobbes recognizes that most actual commonwealths originated in unjustifiable conquest (Hobbes 1968, 721 [Lev., A Review and Conclusion]). Yet the rationale of institution, that people submit “by their own wills,” not to him whom they fear but to “some other whom they confide in for protection” (Hobbes 1991, 171 [De Cive, Chapter V]), is the most likely to foster the enduring habits of obedience which make possible lenient governance by settled laws.         "
"37","In light of the early works, Hobbes's critique of prior approaches to natural law looks less like an attempt to destroy or to supercede, than to salvage the concept. In this respect, the instituted commonwealth is not a creation ex nihilo, as it may appear when the political treatises are taken in isolation. Rather, institution is one of two possible formal solutions for what Hobbes takes to be the central, unavoidable problem of political life, namely, how to ensure stability, peace, and prosperity by reconciling right and law, or natural inclination with artificial obligation."
"38","The first solution, acquisition, is grounded but unstable. It is the “natural” mode of establishing sovereignty in that it appears to arise without choice and is grounded in the sense that it is always available. It does not need to be created. With reference to families, every rational adult knows that he was once a helpless infant, and obedience is owed to parental preservers. Or again, with reference to conquerors, obedience is owed out of gratitude for the life spared. In an effort to show that the rights and duties of sovereignty are the same in all cases, Hobbes translates this first, “natural” solution into the language of “artificial” consent, but he insists that small families exist in the state of nature, and he strongly implies that they grow—through procreation, intermarriage, or conquest—into those “great families” that are to be understood as full‐fledged commonwealths (Hobbes 1968, 257 [Lev., Chapter 20]). The instability of this solution lies in its relation to time. In due course, memory fades and the advantage of physical power shifts. At that point, the ungrateful and impious subject, flush with power, may be tempted to break his promise of obedience to the one, now greatly weakened, who originally spared or preserved him.         "
"39","The second solution, institution, is stable but groundless. It is stable because it is driven directly by the continuous motivation of the passions, which no longer require costuming or training. It is groundless because, on Hobbes's assumptions, it cannot come to be in the state of nature. Although he clearly prefers the second solution, Hobbes consciously insinuates a paradox by making its realization depend on the possibility of a mutual promise, which cannot occur in the absence of a sovereign enforcer, who does not exist until the promise is made. The only way around the difficulty is to recognize that, notwithstanding his antihistorical rhetoric, Hobbes allows for the possibility that life within social units organized on principles of force and fraud—small families, tribes, and commonwealths founded by conquerors—provides the ground, or the partly domesticated human beings that the commonwealth by institution so obviously lacks. The difficulty for Hobbes is that this ground, which appears only after a long habituation to the benefits of civil life, is dangerously undermined by the very logic (i.e., the external balance of fear and hope) that made it possible. When seventeenth‐century Englishmen dispute the authority of the King to tax them at will, they may speak of law, but, in Hobbes's view, they are challenging their sovereign to renew the conquest (Hobbes 1990, 37 [B, Dialogue I]).         "
"40","Thus the separate descriptions of institution and acquisition in the middle period are not recipes to fashion new commonwealths out of human raw materials, but related arguments for consolidating the transformation towards public rule of existing commonwealths, all of which strive for stability by concealing the gap between their natural and artificial aspects under layers of secular and religious myth. In dispelling these myths, or seeking to illuminate “the Night of our naturall Ignorance” (Hobbes 1968, 628 [Lev., Chapter 44]), Hobbes is neither opening the door to destructive ideologies (Kraynak 1990, 191–203) nor bequeathing “a philosophy of individualism that has no room for individuality” (Letwin 1972, 20). On the contrary, he is laying the groundwork for the cultivation of conscientious sovereigns and civil subjects, without which it would be impossible to defeat destructive ideologies or to defend defenseless individuals.         "
"41","At the end of Leviathan, Hobbes praises his late friend Sidney Godolphin as a man whose life proved that it was possible to combine seemingly contradictory traits such as a readiness to forgive personal affronts and an eagerness to risk death in defense of the state. The key to Godolphin's reconciliation, Hobbes suggests, is a profound respect for the fragile and often ambiguous distinction between public and private life. The man who stands his ground in defense of the state is the very same man who overlooks a personal insult, yet the circumstances are different: law and obligation govern the former, while self‐interest and charity compete for control of the latter.14"
"42","In this respect, modern ideological tyrants will appear as self‐destructive inversions of Hobbes's conscientious sovereign. Instead of following the path of law‐bound public rule to political stability, they compound the destructive power of self‐conceit and hypocrisy, by, for instance, linking historical determinism, nationalism, or racism with reliance on liberal institutions to achieve illiberal ends. Yet their personal gains are inevitably temporary, for without laws, humility, and patience, the distinction between public and private life is perforated, all but the most minimal social bonds disintegrate, and rulers can construct only “a crasie building, such as hardly lasting out their own time, must assuredly fall upon the heads of their posterity” (Hobbes 1968, 363 [Lev., Chapter 29]).         "
"43","Given Hobbes's broader philosophical and scientific preoccupations during the middle period of his career, it is easy to overlook his continuing concern with the concrete realities of political life. This concern emerges most clearly in early and late works, but it is evident also in the political treatises, which can be read as efforts to provide a formal analysis—and therewith the tools for consolidation and maintenance—of a common historical phenomenon. Commonwealths frequently begin in conquest but evolve, fitfully and with occasional backward slides, towards lawful rule. Unless that lawful rule is understood anew as having been established “voluntarily,” it is unlikely to secure durable peace and prosperity."
"44","Absent such cognitive transformation, if a sovereign should attempt, as Charles I did, to ground his authority on divine right, hereditary legitimacy, and paternal love, he finds to his dismay that “the devil of rebellion doth commonly turn himself into an angel of reformation” (Gauden 1966, 160). On the other hand, had Charles mastered the ability of a politic prince to “dissemble his passions, and purposes,” he might have saved his neck and passed his kingdom directly to his legitimate heir. But even Oliver Cromwell, Charles's illegitimate and highly skilled successor, could not transmit his formidable talents to his son. Moreover, in Hobbes's view, to emphasize political talent is to diminish reliance on impersonal institutions and thus to invite expedient and ultimately violent measures (Hobbes 1990, 57–58 [B, Dialogue I).15"
"45","For Hobbes, the closest thing to a guarantee of stability and peaceful progress in political life is a population comprised of individuals who have internalized the threat of systemwide destruction through simultaneous self‐assertion. As a consequence of such internalization, subjection will appear self‐willed, applications of sovereignty will appear to proceed from “a necessity forced rather than a will voluntary” (Hobbes 1995, 105), and an unchallenged sovereign will be deprived of any colorable claim to disobey the dictates of reason by which, without any intervening human authority, he is fully obligated. In this respect, it is indeed irrelevant how sovereignty was originally established, but not how it is presently conceived and applied. The more it is conceived along the lines of institution, the more likely it is to be applied by conscientious sovereigns according to the rule of law.         "
