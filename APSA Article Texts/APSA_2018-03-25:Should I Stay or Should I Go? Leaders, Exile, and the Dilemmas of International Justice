"1","Something new is happening in the world of international criminal justice. In recent years, a variety of ad hoc international tribunals, foreign courts using universal jurisdiction laws, and the permanent International Criminal Court (ICC) have all aggressively targeted heads of state. The results have been dramatic. A slew of abusive leaders once considered untouchable—such as Augusto Pinochet, Slobodan Milosevic, Charles Taylor, Khieu Samphan, Laurent Gbagbo, and Hissene Habre—have been apprehended and transferred to international or foreign courts. What are the consequences of this global justice cascade?"
"2","Existing work is largely a debate between optimists and pessimists. Optimists argue that international criminal law deters atrocities.1 Since the international legal regime is designed to increase the likelihood of punishment for the architects of mass atrocities, many scholars assert that it can stay the hand of would‐be oppressors (e.g., Akhavan 2001; Jo and Simmons 2016; Kim and Sikkink 2010; Olsen, Payne, and Reiter 2010; Sikkink 2011). This viewpoint is influential in the policy realm, where many hold an almost dogmatic belief that prosecutions will deter atrocities. As former ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno‐Ocampo put it, “My mission is to end impunity for these crimes in order to contribute to the prevention of future crimes.”2"
"3","Pessimists, by contrast, focus on a negative effect of legal accountability. If making peace means that belligerents will be vulnerable to criminal prosecution, they may decide to keep fighting when they would otherwise lay down their arms. The pursuit of international justice therefore may create incentives to prolong conflicts, which could ultimately increase civilian victimization (e.g., Goldsmith and Krasner 2003; Prorok 2017; Snyder and Vinjamuri 2003). While this viewpoint is less popular than the optimist perspective, it occasionally receives attention in the public sphere. During Libya's civil war in 2011, for instance, Philippe Sands suggested that the ICC's arrest warrant for Muammar Gaddafi gave him a reason to “dig in his heels” and continue fighting.3"
"4","This article takes the literature on international justice in a new direction by examining a different outcome: exile. My argument starts with the simple observation that exile can be a useful political solution. Specifically, exile provides a mechanism for leaders, especially those facing domestic unrest, to give up power in a relatively costless manner. Leaders who might refuse to step down because they fear domestic punishment can instead retire to a safe haven abroad. Consequently, there has been a long tradition of embattled leaders taking this “golden parachute” exit strategy. However, the global justice cascade—which I define as the recent trend toward holding leaders accountable for mass atrocities irrespective of national borders—complicates the exile option. I argue that the justice cascade should have a differential effect on leaders based on their culpability (whether they previously presided over atrocity crimes). Nonculpable leaders can still safely go into exile because they do not need to fear arrest, but culpable leaders now have incentives to entrench in power because the threat of international justice undermines the possibility of a safe exile. Thus, the argument helps explain why past brutal leaders such as Idi Amin, Ferdinand Marcos, and Jean‐Claude Duvalier were content to retire abroad, whereas today's oppressive rulers like Muammar Gaddafi, Laurent Gbagbo, and Bashar Assad choose to cling to power."
"5","As an empirical strategy, I exploit stark over‐time variation in the threat international justice poses to leaders. Specifically, I argue that two key events in 1998 marked a tipping point for the global accountability regime, making the threat of post‐tenure international punishment far more credible than it was previously. First, the signing of the Rome Statute, the treaty creating the ICC, helped institutionalize the previously ad hoc legal regime. Second, the arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet in the United Kingdom—the first time a leader was arrested in a foreign state for international crimes—provided a powerful demonstration effect that shattered the expectation of impunity leaders once enjoyed. The landmark events of 1998 therefore constitute the watershed moment in a shift from an era of impunity to an era of accountability. After witnessing these developments, other leaders had good reason to update their beliefs on the likelihood of facing international justice."
"6","Using a large data set of heads of state and a newly constructed measure of culpability, I find compelling evidence in support of the argument. Whereas culpable leaders are no more or less likely to flee abroad than nonculpable leaders in the pre‐1998 impunity era, culpable leaders are about six times less likely to go into exile in the post‐1998 accountability era. Moreover, a change point analysis reveals that there is a clear break in the rate of exile for culpable leaders starting around 1998."
"7","These findings cast doubt on the merits of the debate between global accountability optimists and pessimists. Most existing studies hypothesize exclusively “good” effects (i.e., deterring atrocities) or “bad” effects (i.e., prolonging conflicts), but my theory implies prior work misses the bigger picture: The justice cascade is likely helpful in some ways and harmful in others. If my argument about exile is correct, then the positive and perverse effects of international justice should be intimately linked. Since the justice cascade makes the availability of a safe post‐tenure exile conditional on a leader's behavior while in power, it ought to generate two effects that pull in opposite directions. On the one hand, by undermining the viability of a secure exile for culpable leaders, the justice cascade should incentivize such leaders to keep fighting during civil wars when they would otherwise retire abroad. On the other hand, precisely because leaders now know that committing human rights abuses will decrease their future exit options, the justice cascade should create a deterrent effect. In other words, we should see the positive and the perverse effects together.4 Therefore, my argument suggests a justice dilemma: Deterring atrocities and prolonging conflicts may be two sides of the same coin.         "
"8","Beyond their own import, my findings raise broader implications for two areas of research. The first addresses how international law shapes behavior. While there is an insightful literature on the various ways treaty ratification can affect human rights,5 a different approach is warranted when it comes to global justice. Given the extremely broad jurisdiction of international and foreign courts, a leader could find himself facing trial even if he never signed on to the relevant treaties.6 Thus, this article contributes to the larger international law literature by shifting our focus from treaty ratification to hard‐nosed action by the international community.7"
"9","The second broader implication concerns the study of leaders in international politics. One strand of research on leaders examines how their personal characteristics shape a variety of outcomes, such as international conflict (Horowitz, Stam, and Ellis 2015), foreign policy decision making (Saunders 2011), democratization (Gift and Krcmaric 2017), and nuclear proliferation (Fuhrmann and Horowitz 2015). My article adds to this literature by showing that leaders behave in predictable ways based on a personal attribute—culpability for atrocity crimes—that has thus far been ignored.8 Another strand of work on leaders explores how the anticipation of domestic punishment affects international politics primarily by giving leaders incentives to “gamble for resurrection” during wars (e.g., Chiozza and Goemans 2004; Croco 2011; Downs and Rocke 1994; Goemans 2000). This article advances the literature by investigating the opposite dynamic: How do expectations of international punishment for leaders influence domestic politics?         "
"10","Scholars have long assumed that leaders choose policies to maximize the probability of staying in office, but recent work in international relations shifts the focus to the consequences of losing office.9 If we add the uncontroversial assumption that leaders prefer a cushy post‐tenure fate over punishments like death or imprisonment, leaders might not always pursue strategies that maximize their tenure in office. Instead, leaders' behavior may reflect a desire to avoid post‐tenure punishment. A focus on the consequences of losing power helps explain the effects of the justice cascade.         "
"11","Consider a standard bargaining model in which a leader and an opposition are engaged in conflict.10 Bargaining models show that credible commitment problems are often a barrier to reaching a negotiated solution. Indeed, negotiated settlements create a commitment problem regardless of whether they keep the old regime in power or bring a new one into office. Settlements that keep the old regime in power typically require the rebel group to demobilize and disarm its members in return for some policy concession. Yet once the rebel group demobilizes, it no longer possesses the military capabilities to force the state to abide by the terms of the recently struck bargain (Walter 1997). On the other side—and especially pertinent to my argument—negotiated settlements that bring the opposition into office create a different commitment problem. Once power is transferred to the former opposition, it has the ability to renege on the agreement it made with the ex‐ruler (e.g., Przeworski 1991).11 In this case, the opposition cannot credibly commit to restraint against the leader, which limits the ability of the two sides to reach a negotiated transition.12"
"12","Exile is a valuable political tool because it can help overcome the commitment problems inherent to transitions of power. As the preceding discussion implies, a leader has little incentive to step down when he expects the opposition to settle old scores. A leader will want an “exit guarantee” (e.g., Dix 1982; Sutter 1995) that protects him from punishment even after he is out of power. Yet, it is hard for the opposition to create a credible exit guarantee because it can cheat on any promise it gives the leader once he steps down. When a leader can go into exile in a third‐party state, however, he no longer needs to fear punishment since he is outside the grasp of the former opposition. In fact, physically leaving the state he once ruled is arguably the best exit guarantee an unpopular leader can have against retribution from his old adversaries. Therefore, as the likelihood of their ouster increases, leaders become more likely to view exile as the best option available. Though they give up power, leaders manage to avoid punishment and can live out their years abroad.         "
"13","Historically, leaders—including many notorious for committing atrocities—took the exile option when facing major threats against their regimes. For example, when Ugandan rebels and their Tanzanian allies marched on Kampala in 1979 with the goal of ousting Idi Amin, the Ugandan dictator opted not to make a last stand. Instead, Amin quickly fled into exile and lived out his days in Saudi Arabia. Other examples of violent leaders seeking the safety of exile abound. When Haiti's Jean‐Claude Duvalier faced a popular uprising in 1986, he went into exile on the French Riviera. That same year, as the People Power Revolution gained momentum in the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos arranged for safe passage to Hawaii. Thus, exile traditionally was an attractive exit option for embattled leaders, even horrifically brutal ones, when their regimes ended."
"14","The rise of an international legal regime designed to arrest leaders anywhere influences whether leaders view exile as a viable retirement option. Of course, legal doctrines devoted to ending impunity mean little if advocates of justice cannot get leaders into court. The central challenge for international justice is enforcement: International courts can issue indictments, but they have no police force to track down oppressive leaders. Instead, they must rely on states to apprehend and transfer indicted criminals. As Cassese (2011, 273) notes, “International courts have been bestowed with the scepter and the gavel, not however with the attendant sword. It follows that they can only operate as long as sovereign states are prepared to lend them a helping hand.” Even when states are willing to lend a helping hand, there is a crucial distinction between apprehending current and former leaders.         "
"15","I make no assumption that foreign countries will dislodge oppressive leaders from power and bring them to justice.13 Indeed, enforcing an indictment against a sitting head of state is an extraordinarily difficult task. Though international actors can issue threats, enact sanctions, and publicly shame leaders for their human rights violations, such efforts are unlikely to succeed because current leaders have the willingness and the ability to resist international pressure. A sitting head of state is highly resolved to resist foreign pressure since his own survival is at risk and is highly capable since the nation's armed forces are at his disposal. Consequently, even infamous human rights violators can remain safe behind their own borders as long as they remain in power.         "
"16","As an example, consider the struggle to bring current Sudanese leader Omar Bashir to justice. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Bashir in 2009 for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur. International actors have tried to put pressure on Bashir. The United States and its allies enacted economic sanctions, the United Nations (UN) sent a peacekeeping force, and nongovernmental organizations raised awareness with campaigns such as “Save Darfur.” Despite these efforts, Bashir remains free since he unsurprisingly has not surrendered himself to The Hague.14 Absent the emergence of a domestic challenger who unseats Bashir, the prospects for justice are bleak.         "
"17","By contrast, after a leader flees into exile, the strategic environment is fundamentally different. In this case, international actors only need to exert enough pressure on the host state to convince it that it is better off giving up the ex‐leader. Though the former leader's freedom is at risk, the stakes are considerably lower for the host. Of course, it may have a preference for protecting a longtime ally or a like‐minded ideologue, but an ex‐leader typically provides few benefits to his host. The host state will therefore have a low cost tolerance for international pressure. Hence, host states have little reason to continue protecting former leaders if international actors can generate even minimal costs of protection."
"18","To illustrate this point, consider the saga of Liberia's Charles Taylor. Taylor's forces committed widespread atrocities during the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, but Taylor agreed to give up power in 2003 in return for a supposedly safe exile in Nigeria. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo even explicitly announced that he would not turn Taylor over to an international court. Nigeria, however, soon faced a torrent of pressure from international actors interested in bringing Taylor to justice (Tejan‐Cole 2009). Human rights groups raised awareness of Taylor's culpability, and powerful Western states demanded that Nigeria hand him over to the UN‐sponsored Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL). Not surprisingly, the Nigerian government eventually decided sheltering Taylor was not worth the cost. They caved to international pressure in 2006 and extradited Taylor to the SCSL.         "
"19","More generally, the supply of states willing and able to protect ousted rulers has decreased. “Golden parachutes” were once the norm, but many states have decided it is no longer acceptable for them to shelter leaders with unsavory pasts. Hence, with Syria mired in conflict in 2012, one European Union official acknowledged that getting Bashar Assad out of Syria could be useful but also stated that there was “no way we'd have him in our countries.”15 Of course, not all states share a strong commitment to accountability. Yet, as the Taylor case illustrates, powerful “steward states” (Hafner‐Burton 2013) that value protecting human rights and pursuing justice abroad can make it difficult even for states that care little about international justice to host violent leaders.         "
"20","Though leaders are unlikely to face international prosecution until after falling from power, the anticipation of post‐tenure international punishment influences their decision calculus while still in office. Specifically, the threat of international justice complicates the decision making of culpable leaders, the subset of leaders responsible for mass atrocities. By increasing the likelihood that giving up power and fleeing abroad will eventually land culpable leaders in a jail cell, the push for global accountability reduces the attractiveness of the exile option for such leaders. Even if a friendly government offers sanctuary, an embattled ruler has good reason to doubt that his potential protector will shelter him over the long haul if it will soon face a barrage of threats or take a major reputational hit. If a leader thinks a host state will not be able to withstand international pressure on his behalf, an offer of protection abroad loses its credibility. This puts leaders in a difficult position. A domestic retirement is fraught with danger because leaders risk severe punishment—imprisonment or death—at the hands of their newly empowered adversaries. An international retirement is perilous because leaders risk arrest and prosecution at an international tribunal.16 Thus, removing the exit guarantee that exile affords gives culpable leaders an incentive to cling to power because they have no other way out.17"
"21","Importantly, the quest for international justice undermines the possibility of a safe exile for culpable leaders only. Nonculpable leaders—those who do not employ mass violence against civilians—still have a reliable exile option if they are overthrown. Despite not committing atrocities, nonculpable leaders might need to seek the safety of exile when people mobilize against the regime due to cronyism, the dismantling of term limits, or rapidly declining popularity. Even though nonculpable leaders may not have perfectly clean hands, exile remains a viable option for the “merely” corrupt or unpopular because the threat of international arrest is low. Indeed, international tribunals like the ICC only have jurisdiction over grave atrocities: war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Consequently, nonculpable leaders often calculate that retirement abroad is preferable to remaining at home and facing the wrath of their own people."
"22","For instance, opposition protests against the corruption and general economic ineptness of Kyrgyzstan's Kurmanbek Bakiyev gained momentum in 2010. Bakiyev, though a staunch autocrat, refrained from using overwhelming force against the opposition. As a result, he was confident that he could safely flee to Belarus when protestors stormed government buildings. Burkina Faso's Blaise Compaore provides another example. In 2014, Compaore announced plans to modify the constitution to allow himself yet another term, which triggered a massive backlash. Compaore, who held power for 27 years via shrewd co‐option rather than brute force, fled to the safety of the Ivory Coast once protestors set fire to parliament and marched on the presidential palace. As these examples show, globalized justice makes the attractiveness of the exile option—and, consequently, whether a leader has incentives to step down or cling to power—conditional on a leader's culpability."
"23","The theory's predictions ultimately hinge on leaders' evaluations of their exit options. Put differently, do leaders have reason to anticipate punishment after fleeing abroad if and when their regimes end?"
"24","My empirical strategy rests on exploiting over‐time variation in the threat of international prosecution. In the past, punishment expectations were low. During the Cold War, ideological competition between the superpowers and the high geopolitical stakes meant that realpolitik strategies consistently trumped concerns about international justice. Moreover, there was a lingering reluctance to discard head of state immunity, the legal principle that a leader cannot be arrested in another state or tried by its courts. By allowing a nation's leader to travel abroad without fear of arrest or detention, head of state immunity has long been viewed as crucial to diplomacy. Of course, unpopular leaders could never count on immunity when facing the ire of their own people,18 but respect for head of state immunity ensured that leaders were inviolable at the international level. All leaders therefore used to have little, if anything, to fear from international justice.         "
"25","Recently, however, a slew of oppressive leaders have been arrested and transferred to international or foreign courts as part of the “justice cascade” (Sikkink 2011) or “revolution in accountability” (Sriram 2005). This rapid change in the likelihood of punishment provides a unique opportunity to estimate the effects of international justice. Though they do not pursue this empirically, Kim and Sikkink (2010, 944) even speculate that “the international realm may provide some kind of natural experiment … because a major change in the key variable, the likelihood of sanction, has occurred in a relatively short period of time.”         "
"26","Building on this insight, I argue that the push for international justice reached a tipping point in the late 1990s. Specifically, two important events in 1998—the signing of the ICC's Rome Statute and the arrest of Chile's Augusto Pinochet—gave leaders compelling reasons to start worrying about international arrest. Others agree on the relevance of these dramatic developments. For instance, when discussing the joint effect of Pinochet's arrest and the Rome Statute, Simbeye (2004, 1) notes that “two very significant events occurred in 1998 … that marked a turning point for international criminal law.” Hence, I view the events of 1998 as a watershed moment for international justice that caused other leaders to update their beliefs on the likelihood of post‐tenure international punishment.         "
"27","Start with the Rome Statute, the treaty creating the ICC. As one scholar accurately puts it, “the pinnacle of post‐Cold War thinking on international criminal justice came in 1998, as diplomats gathered in Rome to negotiate the Rome Statute of the ICC and created the first‐ever permanent institution of international criminal justice” (Kersten 2016, 2). The ICC represented a clear break with the past. While other international tribunals existed previously, they were limited to specific episodes of violence in specific countries.19 By contrast, the Rome Statute helped institutionalize the ad hoc global accountability regime by creating the first international court with jurisdiction over mass atrocities that was both permanent and global.20"
"28","The signing of the Rome Statute gave leaders good reason to update their expectations of post‐tenure punishment. The permanent nature of the ICC, its potentially global reach, and its explicit rejection of head of state immunity21 all reduce the barriers to prosecuting leaders for international crimes since there is no longer a need to wade through the tedious diplomacy of building ad hoc tribunals from scratch for each case of atrocities.22 Instead, all leaders must worry about the ICC because “a leader whose country has not signed onto the Rome Statute, and who is committing crimes entirely within his own borders, could still find himself in the court's crosshairs” (Bosco 2014, 55). The Court therefore should cast a long shadow over leader decision making. Furthermore, the signing of the Rome Statute possessed signaling value. Just as domestic law serves as a signal of the broader community's values (e.g., Kahan 1997), the Rome Statute served as an indicator of the global community's preferences. By creating a permanent court designed to punish international crimes wherever they occur, the Rome Statute signaled to leaders worldwide the international community's desire to pursue justice globally.         "
"29","As important as the ICC's creation was, there nonetheless was ambiguity about whether heads of state really would face international punishment. When the Rome Conference ended, there still had not been a single leader arrested on foreign soil. For international justice—whether it was the ICC, other international tribunals, or foreign courts—to pose an unambiguous threat, it was necessary for states to start apprehending oppressive leaders. But would states fill the enforcement gap in international criminal law? The second key event in 1998, the arrest of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, provided a striking answer only a couple of months after the Rome Conference's completion."
"30","Pinochet's arrest in the United Kingdom under the principle of universal jurisdiction provided a dramatic change to the status quo: It marked the first time a current or former head of state was arrested in a foreign country for international crimes.23 As such, Pinochet's arrest created a powerful demonstration effect that altered the expectation of impunity leaders previously enjoyed. The bombshell decision to apprehend Pinochet became “the moment when the technical lawyers' concern with ‘universal jurisdiction’ made headlines” (Falk 2004, 97) and “sounded the death knell for head‐of‐state immunity for international crimes” (Tunks 2002, 659). As Lagos and Munoz (1999, 36) put it, the Pinochet arrest meant that “current and would‐be tyrants now know the rules have changed.”         "
"31","Of course, this approach assumes leaders form expectations on the likelihood of punishment based on what happens to their fellow heads of state. There is ample evidence that leaders closely follow the fates of their peers. After the Pinochet arrest, former British leader Margaret Thatcher proclaimed, “Pandora's box … has been opened,” and “all former heads of government are potentially at risk” (Bronner 2014, 37). In response, leaders around the world “began factoring the [Pinochet] precedent into their travel plans” (Roht‐Arriaza 2005, 66). For instance, Guatemala's Efrain Rios Montt suddenly stopped traveling internationally after the Pinochet arrest (Sikkink 2011, 175). Other evidence is more subtle: Leaders who once sought medical treatment abroad began viewing hospitals at home as sufficient (Roht‐Arriaza 2005, 66). Overall, the Pinochet arrest served as “a wake up call to tyrants everywhere” (Brody and Ratner 2000, ix) about the possibility of international punishment.         "
"32","Moreover, the evidence is not limited to the Pinochet case—leaders continually update their punishment expectations in accordance with the broader justice cascade. When Charles Taylor was arrested during his exile and sent to the SCSL, Muammar Gaddafi lamented, “This means that every head of state could meet a similar fate. It sets a serious precedent.”24 Similarly, Robert Mugabe told aides after Taylor's arrest that he would never go into exile and “would only leave Zimbabwe in a coffin.”25 Thus, there is plenty of evidence that leaders closely monitor the fates of their peers and update their punishment expectations accordingly.         "
"33","Lastly, it is worth highlighting that the events of 1998 are notable not only in their own right, but also because they rapidly ushered in a new era of holding leaders accountable. For instance, Pinochet's arrest made it easier to target other leaders in other legal venues. According to one SCSL judge, “Nobody thought a head of state could be arrested in another country and brought to book … as happened with Pinochet” (Totaro 2011, 36). Almost immediately after Pinochet's arrest, foreign courts were flooded with universal jurisdiction cases aiming to bring other brutal leaders to trial in a so‐called “Pinochet effect” (Roht‐Arriaza 2005). Few of these foreign prosecutions progressed, but international courts have been quite successful in their attempts to bring culpable leaders to justice. While there were no arrests of heads of state for international crimes before 1998, several leaders who were once considered untouchable have since been apprehended and transferred to international criminal tribunals (see Table 1).26 The implication for other leaders was clear: If these once powerful tyrants could face international justice, everyone was vulnerable.         "
"34","To summarize, the events of 1998 were a tipping point for international justice that marked the start of a shift from an era of impunity to an era of accountability. Whereas leaders previously had good reason to view international punishment for atrocity crimes as far‐fetched, it is now a realistic threat. Of course, this does not imply that every perpetrator will be held accountable. It does mean, however, that culpable leaders must now factor the possibility of facing international justice into their decision making. The preceding logic suggests the following hypothesis: Culpable and nonculpable leaders should be equally likely to go into exile in the pre‐1998 impunity era, but culpable leaders should be less likely to flee abroad in the post‐1998 accountability era."
"35","The data set is composed of heads of state between 1960 and 2010. Specifically, the unit of analysis is the leader‐year. There is an observation for each leader who held power for at least part of 1 year, which means there can be multiple leader‐years for a country in a given year (i.e., years with leadership transitions). I identify leaders using the Archigos data set (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009), which codes the “effective ruler” of each country. I updated the Archigos data to include the 2004–10 period to ensure a post‐1998 sample large enough for statistical analysis.27"
"36","The dependent variable is a binary indicator for whether each leader goes into exile in a given year. I use the Archigos coding of each leader's “post‐exit” fate to identify cases of exile. For observations after 2004, I coded the exile variable using news reports and secondary sources according to the criteria established in Archigos.28"
"37","The independent variable of interest is leader culpability. At the conceptual level, culpability simply refers to whether leaders have previously presided over mass atrocities.29 To create the leader culpability variable, I measure state‐sponsored atrocities using Ulfelder and Valentino's mass killing data set. They define mass killing as “any event in which the actions of state agents result in the intentional death of at least 1,000 noncombatants from a discrete group in a period of sustained violence” (Ulfelder and Valentino 2008, 2). Therefore, in my data set, Culpable Leader is a dummy variable that equals 1 starting in the leader‐year in which the mass killing episode begins and every year thereafter during the leader's tenure.30 To give an example of how I coded leader culpability, Ahmed Sekou Toure of Guinea ruled from 1958 to 1984 and oversaw a campaign of mass killing that lasted from 1960 to 1980. He is coded as culpable starting in 1960 and lasting until his tenure ended in 1984.            "
"38","For additional covariates, there are no established conventions due to the dearth of research examining exile as a dependent variable.31 However, I control for other factors that might influence a leader's decision to flee abroad. I capture the threat the opposition presents to the leader with two variables. I proxy Conflict Intensity with battle deaths (Gleditsch et al. 2002), a measure of people killed in direct combat situations (importantly, one‐sided state violence against civilians is excluded from this measure). Since an opposition movement can also threaten a leader's hold on power outside the context of civil war, such as when the People Power Revolution in the Philippines drove Ferdinand Marcos into exile, I include a Revolutionary Activity variable that captures attempts to change the ruling regime through irregular means (Banks and Wilson 2013). To proxy the extent to which each leader has consolidated power, I control for Leader Tenure, the number of years each leader has spent in office (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009). I also include a dummy variable for Democracy (Geddes, Wright, and Frantz 2014) since democracies generally provide leaders with better post‐tenure options. Additionally, international factors may influence the availability of the exile option for each leader. Since powerful Western states play a dominant role in enforcing international criminal law, it is possible that leaders more closely aligned with the West are less likely to face international justice. Hence, the variable Western Affinity controls for each leader's position toward the U.S.‐led international order using data on voting patterns in the UN (Bailey, Strezhnev, and Voeten 2017). Coding details and summary statistics for these covariates are listed in the supporting information.            "
"39","Using the data described above, I estimate logit models of exile with standard errors clustered on the leader. Given my argument that culpability for mass atrocities limits the viability of exile in the accountability era only, there are two reasonable strategies for structuring the models. The first is to split the data at 1998 into two samples representing the impunity and accountability eras, respectively, and then estimate the effect of leader culpability in each time period. The advantage of the split sample approach is flexibility: It allows the other covariates to vary across the two periods.32 The second option is to estimate a model for the entire 1960–2010 period that interacts the leader culpability variable with a post‐1998 dummy variable. This approach gives up flexibility, but it offers a higher degree of statistical efficiency. Both modeling strategies produce similar results.            "
"40","The results are reported in Table 2. I start with the split sample models. If my argument is correct, Culpable Leader should be insignificant in the pre‐1998 period but significant and negative in the post‐1998 period. Model 1 probes the relationship between leader culpability and exile in the pre‐1998 period. I find that the estimated parameter for Culpable Leader is well outside any reasonable threshold of statistical significance. Thus, the effect of leader culpability on exile is statistically indistinguishable from zero in the impunity era. Model 2 examines the effect of leader culpability in the post‐1998 period. As predicted, Culpable Leader is significant and negative. In other words, culpability for mass atrocities prevents leaders from going into exile in the accountability era only.            "
"41","Model 3 reports the results with the interaction term, which is significant. The marginal effect of leader culpability during the impunity era is estimated by the lower‐order term Culpable Leader. The linear combination of βCulpable Leader + βCulpable Leader × Post‐1998 estimates the marginal effect of leader culpability during the accountability era. The results show that the lower‐order term is insignificant, whereas the linear combination is significant and negative. Hence, the interaction model yields the same conclusion as the split sample models: It is only during the post‐1998 period that culpable leaders are less likely to go into exile.            "
"42","Since logistic regression models are difficult to interpret directly, I calculate substantive effects. I use the results from Model 3 to generate the predicted probability of culpable and nonculpable leaders fleeing into exile in a given year during the impunity and accountability eras, respectively, while all other variables are held constant.33 The probabilities and their confidence intervals, shown in Figure 1, are striking. Before 1998, culpable and nonculpable leaders go into exile at nearly identical rates. After 1998, however, there is a substantively large difference, with culpable leaders being about six times less likely to go into exile.34"
"43","I subject my results to several robustness checks (see the supporting information). These additional tests explore whether my findings hold after addressing issues such as rare events bias, the end of the Cold War, and the possibility of unmodeled heterogeneity. I also probe the robustness of the findings using an alternative leader culpability definition, sample of cases, and empirical modeling strategy. In all cases, the results are robust."
"44","Lastly, I conduct a change point analysis. In the previous results, I specified a temporal break at 1998 based on my theoretical expectations, but it is possible that the results simply pick up a secular trend over time rather than a break in the data‐generating process. The change point analysis is useful because it allows for endogenous estimation of the break date and makes no assumption about when the change “should” occur or even whether a change occurred at all. As Box‐Steffensmeier et al. (2014, 206) point out, “For some problems it may be better to let the data speak for itself and to identify which point or points are statistically most likely to represent a break in the underlying process.” If 1998 really was a watershed year for the global accountability regime that altered leaders' punishment expectations, we should see a noticeable break in the rate of exile for culpable leaders around that time. To check, I use the method developed by Zivot and Andrews (1992), which is applied to a single panel of times‐series data. Therefore, I collapse my data into a panel measuring the proportion of culpable leaders worldwide going into exile for every year from 1960 to 2010. The change point analysis suggests that the best‐fitting model contains exactly one break occurring at 1998.35 This result reaffirms my empirical strategy and lends considerable support to the argument.

"45","There historically has been a long tradition of leaders finding safe haven abroad once they were no longer welcome at home. However, due to the recent justice cascade, the world is now a smaller place for tyrants. In a world of globalized justice, fleeing into exile no longer guarantees that a violent ruler can escape the long arm of the law. As a result, many recent culpable leaders have been unwilling to give up power and retire abroad. In fact, the statistical results presented in this article unveiled a dramatic change in patterns of exile. In the past, culpable and nonculpable leaders went into exile at virtually identical rates, but today culpable leaders are about six times less likely to take the exile option."
"46","What should we make of this finding? From a normative perspective, most would agree that fewer culpable leaders escaping to comfortable, if not luxurious, retirements is a welcome change. As one human rights activist lamented, the norm for a long time was: “If you kill one person, you go to jail; if you kill twenty, you go to an institution for the insane; if you kill twenty thousand, you get political asylum.”36 Today, however, the possibility of justice is always on the table. Indeed, ensuring that former oppressors cannot disappear to a quiet exile is a key part of the quest to end impunity. For those who believe political calculations should be subordinate to law (e.g., Shklar 1964), the international legal regime represents one of the international community's signature achievements.37"
"47","From a positive perspective, things are more complicated. As described earlier, much of the existing literature on the consequences of international justice theorizes causal effects in one direction only. Optimists argue that international justice is helpful because it deters atrocities, whereas pessimists assert international justice is harmful because it prolongs civil wars. My findings on patterns of exile suggest prior scholarship is missing the big picture: Deterring atrocities and prolonging conflicts likely are two sides of the same coin. If leaders know they have a safe exile option waiting if and when their regimes end regardless of how they behave while in office, we should see neither effect. An international legal regime that is not strong enough to deter atrocities is also not strong enough to incentivize leaders to keep fighting in some desperate attempt to evade justice. But if leaders believe committing atrocities now will limit their ability to retire to a safe haven in the future, we should see both effects together. A global accountability regime robust enough to convince culpable leaders to spurn the exile option and instead risk it all on the battlefield is also strong enough to deter at least some other leaders from committing atrocities in the first place. Therefore, scholars should consider moving beyond the existing debate of optimism versus pessimism and toward a more nuanced analysis of the trade‐offs international justice creates.         "
"48","This article helps open several avenues for future research. To start, future work could test the implications of my argument for patterns of mass atrocities and conflict duration using an empirical strategy similar to the one employed here. Another intriguing extension would investigate whether the theory helps explain the behavior of rebel leaders.38 Anecdotal evidence suggests it might. For instance, the Juba peace talks between the Ugandan government and the Lord's Resistance Army failed partly because Joseph Kony feared ending the conflict would result in an international prosecution. Exploring this logic further would be a valuable contribution.         "
"49","For policy makers, the implications are stark. In recent years, Western democracies have simultaneously pursued two goals—convincing violent leaders to step down from power and holding those same leaders accountable—that are at odds with one another. Consider the policy toward Muammar Gaddafi during the 2011 Libyan conflict. During the uprising against Gaddafi, Western leaders Barack Obama, David Cameron, and Nicolas Sarkozy published a New York Times op‐ed that concluded, “Gaddafi must go and go for good.”39 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton similarly implied the United States supported Gaddafi going into exile by saying, “If the violence could be ended by his leaving … that might be a good step.”40 At the same time, however, these Western states also made it clear they hoped to bring Gaddafi to justice. Working through the UN Security Council, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom referred the Libyan conflict to the ICC. Moreover, Clinton qualified her statement on exile by adding, “But of course, we believe accountability has to be obtained for what [Gaddafi] has done.”41 Even the short op‐ed from Obama, Cameron, and Sarkozy contained mixed messages: After calling on Gaddafi to leave Libya, the three leaders then praised the ICC's investigation of Gaddafi. Given all this, Gaddafi ultimately rejected the exile option and fought to the bitter end. Looking ahead, policy makers face difficult choices on whether to prioritize coaxing oppressive leaders out of power or pursuing international justice.         "
