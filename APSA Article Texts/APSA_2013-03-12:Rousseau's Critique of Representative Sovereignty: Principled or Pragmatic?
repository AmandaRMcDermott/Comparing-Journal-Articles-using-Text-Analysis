"1","Commentators have recently emphasized the extent to which Thomas Hobbes's political thought should be understood in opposition to a republican or neo‐Roman tradition (Pettit 2008, 132–40; Skinner 2008), with his contemporaries reading parts of Leviathan as a polemic against the classical republican idea of the civitas libera found in Machiavelli and Livy (Parkin 2007, 178). Traditionally, for republicans, a free state was one governed by laws to which the people consent, paradigmatically understood in contradistinction to a state governed by the arbitrary will of an absolute monarch or tyrant. Concomitantly, a free man consents to the laws under which he lives, in contrast to a slave who exemplifies living in dependence on the will of other men. In seventeenth‐century England, those who drew upon these arguments aimed to assert the rights of Parliament as the representatives of the people against advocates of absolute monarchy. Although they claimed that for a state to be free its laws must be enacted with the consent of all the citizens, they also argued that the people should be represented in an elected assembly to legislate on its behalf (Skinner 1998, 30–32).         "
"2","Hobbes's account of sovereignty is well understood in opposition to these arguments, for he maintained that an absolute sovereign, such as a monarch, could both represent the people and was generated by the consent of every individual. Hobbes's account of the generation of sovereignty involved every individual transferring certain rights to the sovereign through a covenant. For Hobbes, obligations only arise amongst men when someone renounces or transfers one's right to another. At this point one is obliged or bound not to hinder those to whom the right was granted because it would be contradictory and absurd to undo that which was voluntarily maintained from the beginning (Hobbes [1651] 1996, 92–93). In other words, when men covenant they willfully transfer their right and are thus under an obligation to perform in accordance with that will. Such a transfer of right is necessary for the generation of sovereignty. The obligation that subjects are under in a commonwealth, then, depends on them each having voluntarily subjected their will to that of the sovereign.         "
"3","By subjecting all their wills to the sovereign, a multitude of disparate individuals becomes a collective unity and exists as a person. The sovereign bears the person of the commonwealth; indeed, in Leviathan, the people only exist as a unified body by authorizing the sovereign as their representative, for without the sovereign there is only a multitude; hence it is nonsensical to talk of the people holding rights against the sovereign (Hobbes [1651] 1996, 114).8 There is little evidence indicating that Rousseau read Leviathan, but even in Samuel Sorbière's French translation of De Cive—the most probable source of Rousseau's direct knowledge of Hobbes—the will of the sovereign represents (représente) the will of all the subjects (Hobbes [1649] 1982, 145).9"
"4","To be sure, Hobbes's account of the generation of sovereignty faces a problem common to social contract theories more generally, that of how it can be maintained that members of an existing commonwealth have actually covenanted or contracted. In Leviathan, Hobbes attempted to resolve this problem by setting forth “the mutuall Relation between Protection and Obedience” (Hobbes [1651] 1996, 491). By receiving protection, subjects willingly consent to the sovereign's power. In Hobbes's terminology, this is “a signe by Inference,” that is, a sign of the will that may be inferred from an individual's actions or forbearances (Hobbes [1651] 1996, 94, 484–86). Even if Rousseau was unaware of the famous articulation of the relationship between protection and obedience unique to Leviathan, Hobbes similarly argued in De Cive that the consent of the citizens is implied “when they accept the benefit of a person's power and laws for protection and preservation of themselves against others” (Hobbes [1642] 1998, 159).         "
"5","According to Hobbes, then, the sovereign both represents the will of the people and is legitimated by every individual's consent, even if such consent is only implicit. Where republicans argued that a body such as Parliament was necessary to represent the will of the people, Hobbes claimed that any form of sovereignty (be it democratic, aristocratic, or monarchical) would necessarily represent the people and that subjects in any commonwealth consent to the laws by which they are governed by accepting the protection secured by the existence of the sovereign. This, in short, is the Hobbesian challenge to republican theorists who maintain that the representation and consent of the people are inconsistent with absolute rule by a superior. Rousseau averred that Hobbes's “principles are destructive of every republican Government” (LM 235/811), and it is certainly plausible that his own account of sovereignty was developed directly with Hobbes's principles in mind. However, there is a more immediate context in which the Hobbesian challenge proved particularly pertinent, which was shaped by the political controversies that engulfed Geneva during the 1750s, to which Rousseau responded in the writings that he signed citoyen de Genève. As Helena Rosenblatt (1997) has comprehensively documented, the Genevan patriciate—to which Rousseau was firmly opposed—supported their authority by invoking the natural jurisprudence of Samuel Pufendorf and his Genevan follower Jean‐Jacques Burlamaqui. It is important to note here that the natural law and Genevan contexts were complementary, as otherwise the former may be viewed as supplying only an incomplete account of the intellectual milieu in which Rousseau developed his own ideas on representation.10"
"6","Although much of his thought was set out against Hobbes, Pufendorf was also greatly indebted to his predecessor, to the extent that he has famously (and somewhat controversially) been described as a “disciple of Hobbes” (Palladini 1990; but cf. Saastamoinen 1995). This is at least evident in his theory of the generation of sovereignty, in which Pufendorf's nominal opposition to Hobbes belied important affinities between the two thinkers. According to Pufendorf, a sovereign is instigated by two pacts and a decree. The first pact joins a people together or else they would remain in their natural liberty. The decree is a vote that determines the form of government. Finally, a second pact is needed to constitute the person or persons upon whom sovereignty is to be conferred, “by which the Rulers, on one hand engage themselves to take care of the common Peace and Security, and the Subjects on the other hand to yield them faithful Obedience” (Pufendorf [1672] 1729, 639–41). Contrary to Hobbes, Pufendorf maintained that the dissolution of sovereignty would not amount to the dissolution of society since the people would still be joined together by the first pact; thus, it makes sense to talk of both the people and the sovereign having rights and duties. Nonetheless, by submitting their wills to one man, the people bind themselves not to resist so that the sovereign can compel anyone to abide by his commands (Pufendorf [1672] 1729, 654). On this point Pufendorf's theory resembled Hobbes's, for it involved the people transferring their will to that of a superior in order for sovereignty to be generated.         "
"7","Pufendorf's natural law treatises were translated into French by Jean Barbeyrac, who appended discourses to his editions in which he celebrated Pufendorf for having provided the most developed account of modern natural law, by following Hugo Grotius and refuting Hobbes; indeed, Barbeyrac sought to elide the similarities between Hobbes and Pufendorf altogether (Barbeyrac [1706] 1729, 81–85). Mediated by Barbeyrac, Pufendorf's influence on eighteenth‐century political thought in France and Geneva was extensive, perhaps rivaled only by that of Montesquieu. Nowhere is this more evident than in the work of Jean‐Jacques Burlamaqui, and it is the treatises of the Genevan jurist that prove particularly important when considering Rousseau's views on representation.11"
"8","If there is some debate regarding the extent to which Pufendorf should be considered as a disciple of Hobbes, there is little doubt that Burlamaqui was a disciple of Pufendorf, often reproducing many of his predecessor's arguments (as translated by Barbeyrac) verbatim. Nonetheless, Burlamaqui presented Pufendorf 's ideas in such a way as to emphasize specific arguments that supported the position of the Genevan patriciate. For example, while adopting Pufendorf 's account of sovereignty being generated by two pacts and a decree, Burlamaqui more explicitly stressed that even though sovereignty resides originally in the people, it can be transferred to a superior or equally—a point of no small importance—to a body of superiors, so that the people are no longer master of it (Burlamaqui [1763] 2006, 302–15). Consequently, once sovereignty has been transferred, the people have no right to depose the sovereign or to change the form of government (Burlamaqui [1763] 2006, 369–70). For Burlamaqui, as for Pufendorf and Hobbes, sovereignty originated from the will of every individual, but need not reside in the people as a collective body; instead it could be represented by a superior, or body of superiors, such as the Genevan patriciate.         "
"9","Well aware of the opportunity to support their position with reference to highly acclaimed natural law theorists, the Genevan patriciate drew on the arguments of Pufendorf and Burlamaqui in order to contend that the people of Geneva (the citizen body) was no longer sovereign.12 Indeed, social contract theory at the time, especially in Geneva, was usually invoked against the claims of the people by arguing that the people were already represented by the government, upon whom it had conferred sovereignty. In particular, the Genevan patriciate emphasized Pufendorf's second pact and collapsed the two‐contract model into a single contract of submission (Rosenblatt 1997, 243). To recall, it was this second pact that rendered Pufendorf's theory akin to Hobbes's, for in each case the people transfers its will and sovereignty to that of a superior, who is taken to represent it thereafter. This Hobbesian line of argument proved particularly attractive to the Genevan patriciate and was employed, albeit in the version reformulated by Pufendorf and Burlamaqui, to confute the claims of the Genevan citizens. In response, Rousseau, citoyen de Genève, sought to refute this line of argument and meet the Hobbesian challenge by maintaining that a legitimate state required that sovereignty always remain with the people, an argument that was premised on the inalienability of the will.         "
"10","To understand Rousseau's argument regarding the inalienability of the will, it is first necessary to appreciate the importance he accorded to free will in constituting man's moral nature. In the Discourse on Inequality, Rousseau drew a distinction between man's physical side and his metaphysical and moral side, with the latter comprising perfectibility and free will (SD 25–26/141–42). Free will is an inalienable gift of nature; hence any social institutions derived from man alienating his will would be illegitimate. In his discussion of illegitimate contracts toward the end of the Discourse, Rousseau thus stressed the inalienability of “the essential Gifts of Nature, such as life and freedom,” maintaining that free will is “the most noble of man's faculties… a gift they receive from Nature by being men.” This argument was set out in direct opposition to Pufendorf, who “says that just as one transfers his goods to another by conventions and Contracts, one can also divest himself of his freedom in favor of someone else” (SD 58–59/183–84).         "
"11","Rousseau's most forceful attack on illegitimate justifications of the social order, however, was reserved for the opening chapters of the Social Contract. Where Pufendorf had been denounced in the Discourse on Inequality, Grotius was deemed to be the prime culprit in the later work, although no doubt Rousseau also had a wider target in mind—most probably including Pufendorf and Burlamaqui—when he set out his own ideas in opposition to “Grotius and others” (SC I.IV). Rousseau attacked Grotius and Hobbes together, claiming that their positions amounted to a legitimization of slavery. His refutation of slavery was largely based on the claim that “force produces no right,” which followed from his argument against the right of the strongest. Rousseau deemed this supposed right vacuous since “Force is a physical power. I do not see what morality can result from its effects. Yielding to force is an act of necessity, not of will” (SC I.III–IV). This argument, in turn, rested on the distinction between the physical and moral that was first established in the Discourse on Inequality, and Rousseau proceeded to echo his earlier criticisms of illegitimate contracts in a similar vein:            "
"12","To renounce one's freedom is to renounce one's status as a man, the rights of humanity and even its duties. There is no possible compensation for anyone who renounces everything. Such a renunciation is incompatible with the nature of man, and taking away all his freedom of will is taking away all morality from his actions. (SC I.IV)"
"13","According to Rousseau, any contract whereby man alienates his freedom would be illegitimate, precisely because it is free will that constitutes man's moral nature. A legitimate contract, by contrast, would be one in which each individual “uniting with all, nevertheless obeys only himself and remains as free as before” (SC I.VI, my emphasis). The only contract with which Rousseau was concerned was that of civil association (comparable to Pufendorf's first pact), that is, “the act by which a people becomes a people” (SC I.V). Where thinkers such as Pufendorf and Burlamaqui had further argued that there is a second pact that confers sovereignty upon a superior or a government, Rousseau denied, first, that the government can ever legitimately have sovereign power and, second, that government is even instigated by a contract (SC III.I, III.XVI).         "
"14","For Rousseau, the only contract was that by which individuals unite together to form a sovereign body, a collective and moral person, under the guidance of the general will. It is important to point out that this compact only involves individuals generalizing and not alienating their will, as otherwise Rousseau's theory would have been open to the same objections that he leveled against illegitimate contracts. According to Rousseau, the general will “considers only the common interest” of the citizens. In other words, the general will only takes into account the shared interest common to all individuals. Where there is no common interest, there can be neither society nor general will. By definition, then, “the general will is always right and always tends toward the public utility,” since it tends toward precisely the interest that all citizens have in common (SC II.III). The reason why the general will is not an alienated form of man's will is that every individual does actually will the general will qua citizen, even if he has a conflicting private or particular will qua man. The general will is thus a generalized form of man's will, by which Rousseau meant that it is that aspect of his will (or interest) which is shared in common with every other citizen in the body politic. Consequently, no individual is less free as a result of entering into the compact because the general will is his own will and, for Rousseau, this was the only condition under which men could ever remain free in the social order, as “they do not obey anyone, but solely their own will” (SC II.IV). Crucially, therefore, the social pact does not involve individuals alienating their will or transferring their will to another."
"15","For Rousseau, individual citizens would “remain as free as before” so long as they obeyed only their own will qua general will, for to do so would be to obey a law that one has prescribed for oneself, and this was his definition of moral freedom (SC I.VIII). Rousseau's account of the liberty of the individual citizen will be evaluated in more detail in the following section. At present, the foregoing remarks suffice to indicate why he thought that the contract that instigates the people as a collective body does not involve the alienation of man's will. It is at this stage that Rousseau sought to invert the accounts of sovereignty proposed by Hobbes, Pufendorf, and Burlamaqui by further arguing that the sovereignty that resides in the people (established by the contract) can never be alienated or transferred to another. It is well to stress here that Rousseau's argument about the inalienability of sovereignty was concerned only with the liberty of the people understood as a collective body with a collective will and not with the liberty of the individual citizens who form the sovereign body."
"16","Rousseau claimed “that sovereignty, being only the exercise of the general will, can never be alienated.” The sovereign can only be represented by itself because although power can be transferred, the same is not true of will (SC II.I, III.XV). Power, to recall, is constitutive only of man's physical side, whereas will is constitutive of man's moral side. Just as an individual cannot legitimately alienate his will to another individual (such as in the case of slavery), so too the people as a collective body cannot legitimately alienate its collective will to anyone else. Cohen (2010, 148–49) has attempted to defend representative sovereignty against Rousseau's criticisms by arguing that under a system of representatives individuals can hardly be said to live like slaves who have alienated their will to a master. Yet this rejoinder misses Rousseau's point, for the relationship is an analogous one. It is the people as a collective body—not the citizens as individuals—that is enslaved by alienating its legislative right to another body. Modern peoples, Rousseau thus chided, “you have no slaves, but you are slaves. You pay for their freedom with your own” (SC III.XV).         "
"17","According to Rousseau, there was no difference between alienating and transferring the will, for in either case it is “absurd for the will to tie itself down for the future” (SC II.I; but cf. Simpson 2006, 78–81). Any act whereby the people transferred its will to representatives would involve the alienation of the freedom to determine its future will; this would be to consent to obeying and being dependent upon the will of another individual or body thereafter, but dependence on the will of another was the very antithesis of freedom for Rousseau. The social pact would thus only be legitimate so long as it is constantly and freely willed by the people (see also Affeldt 1999, 306–7). For the people to remain free, it must always retain its will in the present, as to transfer its will to another for the future would be to alienate that will.         "
"18","Rousseau's argument here is well understood by way of comparison with Hobbes's account of sovereignty. For Hobbes, to recall, to will and then not to be bound thereafter would be contradictory and unjust, and the generation of sovereignty required that each man transfer his will to a superior who would represent the will of the people. This argument was not unique to Hobbes, as the accounts of sovereignty proposed by all of Rousseau's predecessors in the natural law tradition relied upon the people willingly committing itself for the future by instigating a superior as the sovereign power whose will then speaks for the body politic. It was this act—whereby sovereignty was conferred from the people to a superior—that Rousseau deemed illegitimate, for it constituted the alienation of the people's sovereignty and therewith their freedom. For Rousseau, then, it was imperative to reject the Hobbesian assumption that will can be legitimately transferred to another, since this was the very assumption upon which his adversaries’ accounts of sovereignty were premised."
"19","On Rousseau's account, sovereignty pertained only to the forming or ratifying of general laws; the right of sovereignty was the legislative right alone. Yet the people still had to represent itself as the legislative body in order to ratify general laws as the expression of the general will. Rousseau's argument against representative sovereignty was simply that this legislative right can never legitimately be delegated to either a single individual or a body of individuals. For the same reason that sovereignty could not be transferred to an absolute monarch, it could not be transferred to a body of representatives such as the Genevan patriciate or the English Parliament. Either way, to do so would be to alienate the general will of the people, precisely that which renders the social compact—by which the people is constituted—legitimate. For Rousseau, there was no middle ground; either the people retains its will, in which case the sovereign body is a direct democracy, or the people transfers its will to representatives, in which case all is lost."
"20","The argument that the will is not capable of alienation may at first appear peculiar; hence the analysis thus far has been largely explanatory, aiming only to elucidate the logic behind the argument and to situate it in its historical context. However, it should now be apparent that Rousseau did employ a principled argument against representative sovereignty based on the inalienability of the will in constituting both man's moral nature and a legitimate social order. What is more, insisting upon the inalienability of the will was of paramount importance in the Social Contract, for it is this argument that allowed Rousseau to respond to the Hobbesian challenge and reveal why the accounts of sovereignty proposed by his predecessors were illegitimate. The idea that this argument can be dismissed as irrelevant is therefore mistaken, yet this is far from proving that it is an entirely satisfactory argument against representative sovereignty. Rousseau's argument regarding the inalienability of the will was principally concerned with the freedom and sovereignty of the people taken as a collective body with a collective will. More needs to be said to show how, if at all, this could be compatible with the liberty of individual citizens, for which it is well to evaluate one of the most arresting challenges that such an interpretation faces: the problem of majority voting in the legislative body.         "
"21","One reason why Fralin dismissed Rousseau's argument regarding the inalienability of the will concerned majority voting in the sovereign body. Following John Plamenatz, Fralin claimed that if Rousseau's argument that will is inalienable meant that “no one can will for another person in the sense of making up that person's mind,” then “no citizen would have an obligation to obey the will of the majority if that will were contrary to his own, since this would mean that others were willing for him” (1978, 84; Plamenatz 1963, 964). Despite having famously asserted that freedom is “obedience to the law one has prescribed for oneself” (SC I.VIII), Rousseau appears to have later contradicted this by arguing that freedom is actually obedience to a law ratified by the majority of the citizens, even when one is in the minority. Yet this appearance is liable to deceive by conflating two questions that are best kept separate. The first concerns what the general will is and why one is obligated to obey it, and the second concerns the best means for realizing the general will in any given state. Rousseau's discussion of majority voting is best understood as an attempt to answer only the latter of these two questions.         "
"22","Contrary to Fralin's inference, Rousseau in fact endorsed the idea that “no citizen would have an obligation to obey the will of the majority if that will were contrary to his own.” Fralin's objection misses the mark, since Rousseau nowhere argued that citizens are under an obligation to obey the will of the majority. What Rousseau actually argued is that so long as all of the citizens have unanimously agreed to the rule of majority voting, then “the vote of the majority always obligates all the others.” Rousseau recognized that this might lead to the objection that a citizen may be “forced to conform to wills that are not his own,” and responded that this objection is ill‐conceived and mistaken, for the citizen “consents to all the laws, even those passed in spite of him, and even to those that punish him when he dares to violate one of them” (SC IV.II). Yet for those such as Fralin, this response only seems to make matters worse; hence it is well to examine in more detail what Rousseau meant by this."
"23","According to Rousseau, citizens are only ever under an obligation to obey the general will because the general will is actually their own will. Rousseau did not argue that citizens are under an obligation to obey the will of the majority (which would be akin to the will of all), but only the vote of the majority as to what the general will entails. The citizens who vote are only being asked whether a given proposal or law “does or does not conform to the general will that is theirs.” Rousseau continued to argue that when the opinion contrary to mine prevails, it “proves nothing except that I was mistaken.” When in the minority, then, it is not that a will contrary to one's own has prevailed, but only that an opinion contrary to one's own has prevailed, regarding what the general will entails. What is more, all of this presupposes that the “characteristics of the general will are still in the majority. When they cease to be, there is no longer any freedom regardless of what side one takes” (SC IV.II).13"
"24","The citizen only ever obeys the general will, which is his own will. However, to work out the content of the general will with respect to any given proposal, Rousseau recommended majority voting. If (and only if) majority voting can be relied upon to express the general will, then the liberty of the citizen in the minority would not be violated, for an individual citizen may be mistaken as to what the general will entails regarding any given proposal. The obligation is legitimate because Rousseau's account of majority voting does not alter his answer to the question of what the general will is and why one is under an obligation to obey it; rather, it only supplies an answer to the question of how the general will may best be realized in practice. Citizens are not dependent on the will of the majority, even if, in practice, they rely upon the vote of the majority expressing the general will."
"25","This response may not seem entirely satisfactory, however, and, given that citizens can be mistaken regarding what they take the general will to be, it may reasonably be objected that there is “a sense in which the general will's being the will of each individual does not depend upon the individual's recognition of it as such” (Neuhouser 1993, 370). Yet, for Rousseau, it was imperative that even the citizen who is in the minority comes to recognize the general will (expressed through majority voting) as his own will. For the general will to be in accordance with each citizen's individual freedom, both its objective content (the common interest) and the subjective recognition of the general will as one's own will are crucial. It is in the consciousness of being free “that the spirituality of [man's] soul is shown” (SD 26/142), and, in the social order, such freedom involves recognizing the general will as one's own. Elsewhere Rousseau similarly affirmed that citizens are only free when obeying laws that “have the internal assent of their will” (P 175/961).         "
"26","If this interpretation is accurate, it indicates why majority voting does not violate the liberty of individual citizens and does not contradict Rousseau's claim that each citizen only obeys his or her own will qua general will, so long as majority voting can be relied upon to express the general will. Majority voting, then, does not introduce dependence on the will of the majority, but only reliance upon the opinion of the majority expressing the general will. However, further problems remain for understanding the relationship between the liberty of each individual citizen and the liberty of the people taken as a collective body.         "
"27","If the liberty of individual citizens only requires that they come to recognize the laws as expressions of their own will qua general will, then this could be the case even if the people as a collective body does not remain sovereign. Indeed, the earlier quote that citizens are only free when obeying laws that “have the internal assent of their will” is from the Considerations on the Government of Poland, in which Rousseau permitted (albeit begrudgingly) deputies in the legislative body. Rousseau's analysis of Poland seems to imply that, even if only in rare circumstances, individual liberty could be preserved in states where there are representatives in the sovereign body as long as the general will prevails. Moreover, this would be a necessary consequence of defining moral or individual liberty in terms of the content of the law that one obeys (i.e. the general will or common interest) as opposed to the procedure by which the law is formed. However, Rousseau's claim that moral freedom is “obedience to the law one has prescribed for oneself” does appear to contain a procedural requirement, namely, that citizens do actually prescribe the law for themselves. Given this, it is worth further examining the sense in which citizens do prescribe the law for themselves and the extent to which this is unique to a directly democratic form of sovereignty.         "
"28","For Rousseau, majority voting presupposes unanimity on at least one previous occasion, since majority rule is itself an established convention (SC I.V). When in the minority, citizens could be deemed free because they will that majority voting should determine the content of the general will. In addition, they are free to revoke this will and leave the body politic at any time—even if to do so would be to render themselves foreigners to the body politic (SC III.XVIII)—and only under such conditions could citizens ever be free while partaking in the duties required of democratic sovereignty. In this sense, when Rousseau claimed that the citizens consent to the laws, or prescribe laws for themselves, what is important is less that they (explicitly) consent to the laws in question and more that they consent to the method by which the laws are generated. However, if this is the case, then the consent in question is not unique to democratic sovereignty."
"29","If what is important is that all citizens consent to the method by which laws are formed in order to express the general will, then this would equally be the case if all citizens unanimously agreed to confer the legislative right upon a superior or body of representatives. Indeed, this was precisely Pufendorf 's argument, as he claimed that the constitution of the social order requires “that each Member of the Society submit his Will to the Will of one Person, or of one Council; so that whatever this Person or this Council shall resolve, in Matters which necessarily concern the common Safety, shall be deem'd the Will of all in general, and of each in particular.” Moreover, for Pufendorf, this submission of will was revocable; thus, individuals could retract their will once transferred (Pufendorf [1672] 1729, 638). This would not be dependence on the will of a superior any more than democratic sovereignty is dependence on the will of the majority; instead it would be reliance on the superior expressing the general will (or, as for Pufendorf, the will of all in general), much as democratic sovereignty involves reliance on the majority vote expressing the general will.         "
"30","There may be practical reasons why a democratic body is more or less likely to express the general will than an aristocratic body or a monarch. On Rousseau's principles, however, the liberty of the individual citizen would not be violated so long as the general will prevailed. The relationship between the liberty of the people taken as a collective body and the liberty of the individual citizens (or free men) of which the collective body consists is unclear, which is problematical for those who adhere to the classical republican adage that to be a free man presupposes living in a free state. The explicit consent of every individual citizen to any given law could only arise from a unanimous vote in favor of that law, which in practice would rarely ever be forthcoming. As Rousseau's discussion of majority voting revealed, he did not hold that obedience to a law prescribed for oneself actually involved voting in favor of that law (otherwise the citizen in the minority would not be free) but only the recognition of the law as an expression of one's own will. To be sure, the continuous consent of all the citizens could be inferred from them not revoking their will and exiting the body politic. Yet this would be to fall back on something like the Hobbesian argument that the consent of citizens is inferred from the continuous acceptance of the benefits they receive from the laws, which is quite compatible with undemocratic forms of sovereignty. If this is the case, it is far from evident why individual citizens need to have any share of the legislative right in order to preserve their individual liberty."
"31","If the interpretation advanced thus far is accurate, it follows that the liberty and sovereignty of the people taken as a collective body, which Rousseau deemed so important, have little bearing on the liberty of citizens taken as individuals. However, there is another reason why the sovereignty of the people as a collective body must be preserved by any legitimate social contract. For Rousseau, representative sovereignty also violated the equality of the citizens that is established by the social contract. The contract disregards any natural inequalities between men and instead establishes “a moral and legitimate equality,” so that men “all become equal through convention and by right” (SC I.IX). This is a political or civic account of equality, whereby individuals become equals by virtue of being citizens of the body politic.14"
"32","Rousseau claimed that, in entering the social contract, although each citizen “gives himself to all, he gives himself to no one… since there is no associate over whom one does not acquire the same right one grants him over oneself ” (SC I.VI). The equality established by the contract thus entails that all citizens enjoy the same rights and obligations (SC II.IV). Importantly, for Rousseau, this does not only mean that all citizens should be equally subject to the law, but, concomitantly, that they should all have an equal right in making the law. The legislative body, to recall, is the moral branch of the state; hence moral equality requires that all citizens have an equal legislative right. The representation of the people by itself could only preserve this “moral and legitimate equality” so long as all of the citizens assemble for the legislative body to pass laws and all of their votes count equally. A system of representatives within the sovereign body, by contrast, would violate this equality as the representatives would have a greater share of the legislative right than other citizens (see also Simpson 2006, 81). Representative sovereignty, then, introduces inequality of legislative right between the represented and the representatives.         "
"33","This argument cannot be understated. The moral equality of right established by the social contract demands equal legislative rights amongst the citizens, precisely because the legislative body is the moral branch of the state. Rousseau's analysis of equality has proved attractive to some contemporary political philosophers, with John Rawls explicitly citing it as inspiration for his own conception of justice as fairness. Yet Rawls fails to recognize that, for Rousseau at least, this equality of right is violated as soon as representatives are introduced into the legislative body and that the moral equality of the citizens therefore precludes representative sovereignty (Rawls 2007, 231–35, 244–48; see also Cohen 2010, 148–52).         "
"34","Although Rousseau was principally concerned with a political conception of equality amongst the citizens, he thought that this could only be secured if material inequality, or inequality of wealth, was kept within certain limits. In the Social Contract, Rousseau specified that no citizen should be rich enough to be capable of buying another, and no citizen poor enough to be forced to sell himself (SC II.XI). Yet elsewhere he further argued that money itself must be held in contempt, to the extent that everyone “must live and no one get rich. This is the fundamental principle of the nation's prosperity” (C 142/924; see also SC III.XV; P 209–11/1003–05). Rousseau thought that the existence of inequality would endanger the citizens' liberty, as inequality leads to individuals becoming dependent on the will of others. He thus insisted on the importance of “equality because freedom cannot last without it” (SC II.XI). The idea that equality amongst citizens is necessary for liberty to flourish has a strong ancestry, especially in the republican tradition (for example, see Machiavelli [1531] 1970, 243–48; Pettit 1997, 126). Many thinkers thus subscribe to the idea that equality requires that all citizens are equally dependent and subject to the law, as opposed to being dependent on the will of men. Yet, for Rousseau, the moral equality established by the social contract was even more demanding, for it not only required equality under the law (as the expression of the general will) but also equality of legislative right in ratifying the laws. Only then could the general will truly be “general in its object as well as in its essence… it should come from all to apply to all” (SC II.IV). As far as individual citizens are concerned, then, it is more their moral equality than their moral freedom that, on Rousseau's analysis, is violated by representative sovereignty.         "
"35","The purpose of this article has been to argue that Rousseau did have a principled argument against representative sovereignty and to elucidate the nature and bearing of that argument. The principle upon which the argument rested was that the will is inalienable and therefore cannot be transferred to or represented by another individual or body of representatives. For those who turn to Rousseau in order to improve their understanding of normative problems in contemporary political philosophy, the argument shows in what ways the existence of representative sovereignty may contravene two further principles associated with the legitimacy of modern democratic states: the sovereignty of the people and the moral equality of the citizens."
"36","Rousseau's critique of representative sovereignty was a response to Hobbesian accounts of how the sovereign represents the will of the people. For Rousseau, the only way to show why the people could not be represented by an absolute monarch (as Hobbes's account allowed) was by arguing that sovereignty could not be transferred in any form whatsoever and must remain with the people as a collective body. The sovereignty of the people could only be retained so long as its legislative right was not transferred to another body or individual, for this would amount to the alienation of the people's sovereignty. For Rousseau, then, direct democracy was the only way in which the Hobbesian challenge could be answered."
"37","There may of course be other, non‐Rousseauian, reasons why it might be thought that a Hobbesian sovereign can never represent the will of the people, yet it remains incumbent upon the supporter of representative sovereignty to show why, if a Hobbesian account of representation is illegitimate, any form of representation where sovereignty does not remain directly with the people can be legitimate. Rousseau's somewhat disquieting answer was that it cannot, for the people either transfers its will to representatives or it does not. His account of what the liberty of the people involves is therefore one that challenges the prospects of realizing such (democratic) liberty in any modern states where representative sovereignty prevails."
"38","Rousseau's argument, then, not only indicates that our ideas of democracy and representation should be decoupled, as has been maintained by other theorists of representation more recently (see especially Manin 1997; Rehfeld 2006). Rather, on Rousseau's analysis, these two ideas are antithetical and mutually exclusive, for any state that permits representatives in the legislative body necessarily violates the liberty of the people and the moral equality of the citizens. To be sure, representative democracy might be justified on other non‐Rousseauian (principled or pragmatic) grounds, which do not appeal to either the liberty of the people or the equality of the citizens.15 Yet assumedly most defenders of representative democracy would want to deny the conclusion that representation is actually incompatible with moral equality and the liberty of the people—notions commonly held to be at the cornerstone of modern democracies—and it is precisely the force with which Rousseau argued for this conclusion that renders his analysis so challenging and pertinent.         "
"39","Even if modern states would fail to meet Rousseau's criteria for preserving the liberty of the people taken as a collective body, they may not necessarily violate the liberty of individual subjects or citizens. If liberty is understood as obedience to one's own will qua general will, then citizens could be free while obeying any laws that are in accordance with the general will, or common interest, irrespective of whether or not those laws were passed by the people freely assembled. Indeed, Rousseau's account of majority voting, if it is to remain coherent, entailed that a citizen could still be said to consent to laws that were passed in spite of his vote to the contrary. The citizen remains free not because he voted for the law in question but because the majority vote expresses the general will, which is his own will. Majority voting is only legitimate, on Rousseau's account, insofar as it can be relied upon to express the general will, for this is not dependence on the will of the majority but only dependence on the general will, as expressed by the opinion of the majority. However, to the extent that Rousseau's argument leads to this conclusion, it severs the connection between the liberty of individuals and the sovereignty and liberty of the people as a collective body. To sever this connection, it is well to note, was one of the central purposes of Hobbes's discussion of the liberty of subjects (Hobbes [1651] 1996, 149).16 Moreover, once severed, questions regarding the form that the sovereign or legislative body should take are, in principle at least, quite distinct from questions concerning the liberty of individuals.         "
"40","Hobbes's challenge, to recall, was to show that any form of sovereignty, be it a democratic assembly or an absolute monarch, represents the will of the people and, as such, every individual consents to the laws of the state. Indeed, Hobbes's theory of representation sought to break the link between consent and democratic participation completely, for all individuals willingly consent to the sovereign's authority, irrespective of the form that sovereignty takes. Rousseau thought that the only way that this challenge could be met was if sovereignty remained with the people as a collective body and could not be transferred at all. Viewing Hobbes and Rousseau in juxtaposition to one another thus serves to present two polarities on questions of representation and sovereignty. Both poles are ones that many modern theorists would most likely want to avoid, yet attention to Rousseau's response to the Hobbesian challenge reveals many of the difficulties with navigating a principled position on representation between Hobbesian absolutism and direct democratic sovereignty. This is not to suggest that such a middle ground cannot be coherently defended, but, if it can, it will be based on contravening rather than updating Rousseau's principles of political right, a point of some consequence for those contemporary political philosophers who draw on Rousseau in support of their own positions. According to Rousseau, such a middle ground could never remedy the problems with which politics is faced, for there is “no tolerable medium between the most austere democracy and the most perfect Hobbism” (M 240)."
