"1","In recent years, the Maasai have begun recombining private parcels of land into common property institutions; these institutions are similar to those used before colonialism, albeit with a more limited geographic scale (Mwangi 2007, 2007b). Of those we interviewed for this study, all who had recombined their land did so with other herders who also resided within their group ranch. These new common property groups are not legally recognized by the state as a formal property merger;4 rather, they are informal agreements between households that are recognized and enforced by the broader Maasai community. However, pasture recombination appears, for all intents and purposes, to be binding: Herders are not removing their land from common property after they commit to recombination, and we know of no instance where this has been attempted.5 In terms of the internal rules of governance for these common property groups, social norms require internal consultation with all the herders in the common property arrangement before making land management decisions. These groups often maintain a schedule for grazing, but there is usually no limit to the number of livestock that each herder can pasture on the common property.         "
"2","The Maasai have recognized that there is potential for significant net efficiency gains from land recombination into common property. First, with common property, economies of scale from recombined land and labor may be possible.6 Second, larger geographic distribution of rangeland can be an adaptation strategy to reduce drought risk vulnerability.7 Third, those who recombine their land into common property comply with pro‐social norms of the community.8 But despite the potential for aggregate net gains from common property, it remains uncertain whether and how the gains from common property are distributed among those who enter these arrangements. We next investigate the two theoretical approaches that explain pasture recombination.         "
"3","Cooperation theory emphasizes that groups adopt new institutions if they increase net gains relative to the existing institutions (Eggertsson 1990; Williamson 1975). North (1990, 41–43), for example, argues that private property rights increase the net gains to society because they reduce the costs of enforcing and monitoring economic transactions.9 But cooperation theory is inherently functionalist (Knight 1992): It assumes that individuals shape institutions based upon their desirability to the group, selecting those institutions that lower aggregate transaction costs (Elster 1982). Scholars have offered three potential explanations for why individuals would act in the group interest. First, Elster (2007, 284) argues that the tendency for humans to altruistically punish each other (Fehr and Gächter 2002) may justify the functionalist argument. If some group members are willing to altruistically punish those who seek distributional advantages from the institution, then opportunistic behavior might be avoided and transaction‐cost‐minimizing institutions established. Second, most work in the traditional transaction‐cost literature emphasizes the role of competition among institutions; if institutions are inefficient, then more efficient institutions emerge to outcompete them (Posner 1980). However, this explanation ignores the fact that many social institutions exist in a context where there is little interinstitutional competition (Knight 1992, 211).         "
"4","A third potential explanation involves the role of uncertainty. Actors choose institutions in the face of uncertainty about how these institutions will affect them in the future. In the presence of such uncertainty, actors may try to shape institutions to meet some desired ideal of the future distribution of outcomes across the group as a whole (Landes and Posner 1975). This is akin to a decision made under a Rawlsian veil of ignorance (Frohlich and Oppenheimer 1992); it implies that future uncertainty induces actors to create transaction‐cost‐minimizing social institutions—institutions that benefit the group as a whole—in the present. The setting in our application is conducive to this argument, as the primary motivation for land recombination is to pool the risks induced by frequent drought. If powerful herders shape institutions to systematically advantage themselves, then such rules may be used against them in the future if they become weak due to some exogenous shock. Given the extreme uncertainty of the future climate—especially because of climate change—powerful herders may shape transaction‐cost‐minimizing institutions because they remain uncertain about their own future ability to benefit from an institution that systematically favors powerful herders in the present.         "
"5","According to the cooperation theory, herders will only adopt common property institutions if they increase aggregate group benefits. To assess the explanatory power of this theory, we evaluate the aggregate net benefits from common property compared to private property. We use two criteria to assess the relative net benefits from common and private property. First, models of common‐pool resources traditionally derive benefits by directly comparing the behavior of herders under common and private property (Hardin 1968; Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker 1994). The structure of common‐pool resource dilemmas implies an individual incentive to graze beyond the socially optimal level (Hardin 1968). We thus first assess institutional efficiency by comparing the grazing intensity in the two property regimes. Common property is more efficient to the extent that it decreases grazing intensity relative to private property. Second, studies of common‐pool resources often evaluate institutional outcomes in terms of the biophysical conditions of the resource (Coleman 2009; Ostrom and Nagendra 2006). In this example, we measure differences in biophysical conditions in terms of households’ perception of vegetative conditions. Common property is more efficient to the extent that these vegetative conditions are better in common property than private property.10 These criteria are expressed in the following hypothesis:            "
"6","Conflict theory argues that institutional emergence and change have more conflict than cooperation theory suggests. Powerful members of society can manipulate social institutions to reinforce the ex ante distribution of power (Firmin‐Sellers 1995). If the bargaining process is lengthy or costly, as is the case in this application, powerful households will have a relative advantage in the bargaining process.11 But powerful landholders can only take advantage of their bargaining power if it is disproportionate to those with whom they recombine. Thus, large landholders will target smaller landholders in order to leverage their resources in the bargaining process and form institutions that reinforce their relative ex ante power. These strategic considerations result in asymmetric common property groups that are dominated by a few large landholders.            "
"7","Weak landholders have incentives to rationally acquiesce and recombine their land into these new common property groups. Both common and private property could be viable social institutions for land management in this context. Of course, weak landholders will prefer, in absolute terms, the type of institution that benefits them the most. However, it may not be in the self‐interest of a weak landholder to continue with a bargaining strategy (private property) that is suboptimal given the changing behavior of others. Additionally, because all behavior is conditional on the strategies that others in society employ, weak landholders will play best response strategies given the current behavior of others. If powerful landholders have committed to the new strategy of land recombination, it may be rational for weak landholders to acquiesce to the new social institutions, even if they are worse off relative to their condition under private property. As Knight (1992, 127) states, “Social actors respect these institutional rules not because they have agreed to them and not because they evolved as Pareto improvements but simply because they cannot do better than to do so.” Once powerful landholders credibly commit to the new institution, it becomes weak landholders’ best response to conform—even if the new institutions put them at a relative disadvantage within the group—rather than to remain outside of the new institution altogether. In the context of our study, herders view those who do not recombine their land as selfish and then enforce social sanctions against them. In one case, a herder who had not recombined his land was told by the other villagers that he no longer had permission to cross their land in order to access water for his livestock. Given this new social context, those who continue with private property—a socially acceptable strategy until recently—are worse off than those who recombine their land, even if they are worse off under common property than they would have been had the entire group continued with private property.            "
"8","But why would weak landholders recombine with more powerful landholders rather than other similarly weak landholders? Powerful landholders are more likely to have access to credit, can provide immediate food relief, and can also contract with weak landholders for labor (e.g., tending to and milking their livestock). But perhaps the most important factor drawing weak landholders to powerful landholders is the immediate need for pasture in order to adapt to the ongoing drought. Only those with extensive landholdings can absorb the livestock of weak landholders; however, for short‐term access to these pastures, weak landholders must pay the long‐term costs of committing to a common property system where they have less power than those with whom they recombine. Thus, while the decision to recombine land into common property is technically voluntary, herders may do so only because there are no other short‐term options to save their herd. Weak landholders thus rationally incur the long‐term risks inherent in asymmetric common property in order to gain short‐term benefits. They do not have the ex ante resources to prolong the bargaining process and wait for more favorable bargaining conditions."
"9","If powerful members of the group use common property to reinforce their power, then the total landholdings in common property groups will be concentrated among just a few large landholders. If the land is thus concentrated, then the common property is more easily controlled by the few powerful households. This leads to the following hypothesis:               "
"10","The preceding hypothesis defines our expectations about the composition of common property groups. But conflict theory also anticipates that those with greater ex ante power will benefit disproportionately from the new institution compared to those with little ex ante power. We thus anticipate that those with large ex ante landholdings will benefit disproportionately from the common property institution ex post. We measure these benefits in terms of the herd size of the household. If a herder exercises power in the common property institution, we would expect him to use that power to increase his herd size. This logic implies an interaction effect: Common property intensifies the relationship between landholdings and herd size. Large landholders will have large herd sizes in both common and private property, but large landholders who enter common property institutions can use their relative power to receive additional benefits from their access to additional acreage. However, this increase in herd size comes at the expense of small landholders who may receive few benefits from common property. Thus, we anticipate that large landholders who join a common property group will have a larger herd than a similarly large landholder who remains in private property and that small landholders who join a common property group will have similar herd sizes to small landholders who remain in private property. Common property disproportionately benefits those with large landholdings. This leads to our final hypothesis:               "
"11","In 2008, we gathered data from eight group ranch areas in the Kajiado district of southwestern Kenya. Table A.1 in the online supporting information summarizes some of the relevant characteristics of the group ranches. Our data collection used multiple methods: focus groups, semi‐structured individual interviews, key informant interviews, direct observation, and archival records.12 These multiple sources of evidence allow for triangulation across the same set of research questions in order to improve the credibility and robustness of our findings.         "
"12","We administered a semi‐structured questionnaire to 539 landowning households across the eight group ranches, out of the approximately 2,520 households in total, for an overall sampling intensity of 21.3%. These data allowed us to quantify information gathered from the interviews, to systematize the information from a random sample of the population, and to preserve anonymity of the respondents. Stratified random sampling was used to select households for interview. The area list—a full listing of landowning households and their parcel sizes—was used to stratify households into large, average, and small landholdings based on the average size of parcels in each group ranch. Household heads were interviewed when possible. Enumerators underwent one week of training, and the survey instrument was also pretested. Summary data collected through the structured interview are reported in Table A.3 in the supporting information. We collected data on household socioeconomic characteristics, their land and animal holdings, and the land and animal holdings of the herders with whom they recombined."
"13","In order to test the cooperation hypotheses, we define two dependent variables: Grazing Intensity and Vegetation. Grazing Intensity measures the number of animals per acre of pasture. If the surveyed household had recombined their land into a common property group, then we asked them to indicate how many total animals all the households in the group pasture on the common property as well as the total acreage being managed as common property. For households that had yet to recombine their land, we asked them how many animals they pasture and the acreage of their parcel. We calculate the Grazing Intensity as the number of animals per acre of land. Vegetation refers to the household's perception of how vegetative conditions in their pasture had changed. We asked survey respondents to rank how the vegetative cover had changed in the past 5 years, which they then ranked on a 3‐point scale: decreased (=1), stayed the same (=2), or increased (=3). We asked them to rank the vegetation cover of grass in general, their favorite grass species in particular, and the vegetation cover of trees on their pasture. The dependent variable Vegetation takes the average of these three rankings and thus is on a scale of 1 to 3. These outcomes are relevant measures of institutional outcomes because of the importance of vegetation cover to provide adequate feed for the livestock of the herders.         "
"14","To test the conflict hypotheses, we define two dependent variables: Land Concentration and Herd Size. Herd Size is measured as the total number of animals pastured by the surveyed household. Land Concentration measures the distribution of land in each of the common property groups. We estimate Land Concentration by constructing a Herfindahl index, a measure of concentration often used by economists assessing market concentration for antitrust purposes (Rhoades 1993). The measure is calculated by summing the squared land share of each household in the common property group. Technically, the measure is constructed as follows:            "
"15","That is, the Land Concentration for a common property group with n members equals the sum of the squared land share from each member. The measure is bounded between 0 and 1, and the intuition of the Herfindahl index is that as the index approaches 1, the entire landholdings of the common property group is concentrated with a single individual. As the index approaches 0, on the other hand, the landholdings are equally divided between all group members.         "
"16","The primary independent variable used to test the cooperation hypotheses is a binary indicator of whether the surveyed household had recombined their land into Common Property (=1) or not (=0). While 77% of the households surveyed in our sample have recombined their land into common property, the remaining 23% of households have not. Cooperation theory anticipates that Grazing Intensity will be lower in common property and Vegetation will be higher.            "
"17","To test the conflict–herd asymmetry hypothesis, we must also consider the Landholdings of the surveyed household; that hypothesis anticipates an interaction effect between the Common Property dummy variable and the Landholdings of the surveyed household. We measure Landholdings as the total landholdings of the surveyed household, whether they recombine their land or not. This is our ex ante measure of power (Mwangi 2007), and it is reported in hundreds of acres.            "
"18","We include control variables to account for differences in private and common property groups, at the group level. First, we include dummy variables for each of the eight group ranches. Some of the group ranches subdivided into smaller parcels of land than others, and this likely affects both the grazing intensity and vegetation in different regions. Second, we include a variable, Kinship, that measures the proportion of the households in the group that are close kin to the surveyed household.            "
"19","Because we do not interview every household in each common and private property group, we also include respondent‐specific control variables that might account for differences in how Landholdings and Grazing Intensity are reported and how Vegetation is ranked. We include the following controls: Title Deed, a binary indicator of whether the household has formal title to their land (=1) or not (=0); Herd Income, a binary indicator of whether the primary source of income for the household is derived from their herd (=1) or not (=0); Male HH Head, a binary dummy variable indicating whether the household head is male (=1) or not(=0); Household Size, the number of people living in the household; Market Distance, the distance to the nearest market in kilometers; Education, a binary variable indicating whether the household head received formal education (=1) or not (=0); Age, in years, of the household head; Migrant, a binary variable indicating whether someone in the household had migrated for work (=1) or not (=0); Social Status, a binary indicator of whether the household had a formal position in local governance (=1) or not (=0); Illiterate, a binary variable indicating whether the household head can read and write (=1) or not (=0); and Unmarried, a binary variable indicating whether the household head is married (=1) or not (=0).            "
"20","Table 1 reports the results from estimating linear regression models to test our hypotheses. Each of the estimated models reports linear regression coefficients for group‐specific and respondent‐specific control variables. The models report estimated coefficient estimates and standard errors that are clustered by the village in which the household resides. To adjust for potential skewness of the variables in these models, we have taken the logarithm of each of the dependent variables (Grazing Intensity, Vegetation, and Herd Size), Distance to Market, Age, and Household Size. Model 1 and Model 2 test the cooperation hypotheses, and Model 3 tests the conflict–herd asymmetry hypothesis.         "
"21","Model 1 of Table 1 yields a positive and significant correlation between Common Property and Grazing Intensity. Because Grazing Intensity is in log form and Common Property is binary, the coefficient can approximately be interpreted as follows: Grazing Intensity is about 26% higher in common property groups than for those who remain in private property, holding all else constant (significant at the .05 level). This provides evidence directly opposing the cooperation‐grazing hypothesis. Grazing is more intense, on average, in common property than private property.            "
"22","Model 2 of Table 1 yields an effect of –0.119 (significant at the .05 level) between Common Property and Vegetation. Again, because Vegetation is in log form, the substantive interpretation of that coefficient is that households in common property groups rate the vegetation about 12% worse than those in private property. This finding provides evidence directly against the cooperation‐vegetation hypothesis. Vegetation is more poorly ranked, on average, in common property than private property. Taken together, the findings from Model 1 and Model 2 do not support the implications of cooperation theory that new institutional forms increase net benefits for those who recombine their land.            "
"23","Of the control variables estimated in Model 1 and Model 2, there appears to be significant variation across the different group ranches in Grazing Intensity, and there is also some variation in rankings of Vegetation. This reflects the fact that some group ranches generally recombined more land, and sooner, than others and that there is considerable variation in the average landholdings in different geographic areas (Mwangi 2007). The respondent‐specific control variables do not indicate that specific types of respondents tend to systematically report differences in the outcome variables.            "
"24","Here we first examine the conflict–land asymmetry hypothesis by investigating whether common property groups have a high land concentration. Figure 1 shows the distribution of Land Concentration, measured by the Herfindahl index, for the common property groups surveyed in the data. Recall that the Herfindahl index ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a highly concentrated group (a single landowner contributed the entire ex ante landholdings) and a value of 0 indicates a perfectly equal group (all group members contributed an equal amount of ex ante landholdings). The Herfindahl index is also used in antitrust regulation to assess the concentration of industries. Guidelines for the Herfindahl index indicate that values below 0.15 indicate unconcentrated groups, values between 0.15 and 0.25 indicate moderately concentrated groups, and values above 0.25 indicate highly concentrated groups, according to the antitrust standards developed by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (2010). To the extent that such criteria are informative of land concentration in this context, it appears that land in common property groups is highly concentrated among a few households: More than 68% of the groups are classified as highly concentrated, nearly 25% are classified as moderately concentrated, and less than 7% are classified as unconcentrated. Thus, the descriptive analysis of these groups provides evidence to support the conflict–land asymmetry hypothesis: The ex ante landholdings contributed to common property groups are usually concentrated among only a few households.            "
"25","Land Concentration in Common Property Groups"
"26","Note: Histogram of the percent of common property groups for each level of the Herfindahl index. Herfindahl index values below 0.15 indicate unconcentrated groups, values between 0.15 and 0.25 indicate moderately concentrated groups, and values above 0.25 indicate highly concentrated groups, according to antitrust standards developed by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (2010).                        "
"27","To examine the conflict–herd asymmetry hypothesis—whether large landholders disproportionately benefit from common property—we examine the results reported in Model 3 of Table 1. We first interpret the main effects of Landholdings and Common Property. The coefficient for Landholdings indicates the correlation between Landholdings and Herd Size for households that remain in private property (i.e., Common Property = 0). The positive coefficient indicates that, on average, Landholdings are correlated with Herd Size, although the correlation is not significantly different from zero. On the other hand, the coefficient on Common Property reports the difference in Herd Size between those who enter common property and those who remain with private property, for households without any landholdings (e.g., Landholdings = 0). We estimate this effect at –0.292 (significant at the.10 level); this implies that households without any landholdings have 29% smaller herd size in common property than they do in private property. In other words, holding all else constant, small landholders who enter common property have smaller herds compared to those who remain in private property.            "
"28","The interaction effect between Landholdings and Common Property is the direct test of the conflict–herd asymmetry hypothesis. The positive and significant (at the .05 level) coefficient of 0.099 implies that Common Property intensifies the relationship between Landholdings and Herd Size. The largest landholders have larger herds if they recombine their land into common property; however, small landholders do not have larger herds if they recombine their land into common property. Thus, the benefits of land recombination are not equally distributed among those who recombine their land into common property: Those who contribute relatively more land to the common property institution also receive relatively greater benefits. This provides evidence that supports the conflict–herd asymmetry hypothesis.            "
"29","In Model 3, both group‐specific and respondent‐specific control variables also influence the herd size of the surveyed household. There are again significant differences between some of the group ranches. In addition, respondents’ resources also significantly predict their herd size: Older, migrant, literate respondents, and those whose primary source of income comes from herding, tend to have larger herds than others."
"30","In this article, we show that conflict theory best explains the institutional emergence of common property institutions among the Maasai. Our quantitative data analysis suggests that common property institutions do not provide larger net benefits to society than private property arrangements: In fact, it appears that common property groups tend to have more intense grazing and worse vegetation than those who remain in private property. Why do the Maasai engage with these institutions? Our analysis shows that the common property groups created from pasture recombination have highly concentrated power. The asymmetric power relationships within these groups enable large landholders to increase their herd size at the expense of small landholders. In particular, we found evidence that small landholders who join common property groups have smaller herds than those who remain in private property, but that large landholders have larger herds in common property than private property. This evidence shows that larger landholders benefit more from common property arrangements than small landholders and circumstantially suggests that large landowners actively use their influence for their own benefit at the expense of the weak."
"31","While the previous discussion focuses almost entirely on quantitative data analysis, our qualitative work confirms this explanation. In focus groups and key informant interviews, there was a general sense that the benefits of parcel reconsolidation were unevenly distributed. Large landholders seemed to prefer the reconsolidated arrangement because it creates additional pasture options for their livestock. When drought sets in, they have the ability to move their livestock to distant pastures (even, if necessary, by lorry) so that their livestock have a higher probability of survival. Thus, they are more likely to overuse common pasture even if it makes the community of users, as a whole, more vulnerable to the effects of drought. Those with small herds indicated that it is difficult to maintain and conserve pastures for the drier period because of unequal herd sizes. Many small herders indicated that overgrazing is a possibility, as animal numbers are not regulated within the common property. Small herders, in general, seem less interested in common property but also often keep quiet because they feel powerless. Also, powerful landholders stigmatized the alternative of pasturing alone—thus restricting access from others—as antisocial."
"32","The finding that conflict theory is a better explanation of institutional change in this case has potential normative implications for the formation and change of property rights and other institutions more generally. The process of institutional formation and change is critical to understand the legitimacy of the costs and benefits that such institutions engender. In this case, it appears that these institutions are created in such a way that they systematically disadvantage weak herders. Knight (1992, 213) challenged scholars to think carefully about the actual empirical outcomes achieved by different institutional forms. There is no a priori reason to believe that institutions—either decentrally or centrally formed—will be either efficiency enhancing or equitable. In fact, this study supports a growing literature that suggests political institutions systematically disadvantage weak political actors. This has normative implications about the operation of our ubiquitous formal and informal social institutions and the way we view the success or failure of actors operating within those institutions.         "
