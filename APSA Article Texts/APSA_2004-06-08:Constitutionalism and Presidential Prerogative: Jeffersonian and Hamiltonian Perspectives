"1","The Founders' repudiation of monarchical government and concomitant endorsement of the rule of law seems to belie any suggestion that they sought to establish a national executive who would possess powers not explicitly granted by law, let alone one who would be permitted to act against the law. After all, prerogative implies a return, however briefly, to a kind of discretionary, and potentially arbitrary, one‐person rule antithetical to the impersonal liberal ideal of government under law. Revolutionary pamphlets and tracts like Samuel Adams' “The Rights of the Colonist” (1792) resound with fiery denunciations of royal prerogative and other arbitrary powers lacking a solid basis in law, but no one linked the primacy of law in American constitutionalism with the rejection of monarchy with greater clarity or conviction than Thomas Paine:"

"3","But where says some [sic] is the King of America? I'll tell you Friend, he reigns above, and doth not make havock of mankind like the Royal—of Britain. Yet that we may not appear to be defective even in earthly honors, let a day be solemnly set apart for proclaiming the charter; let it be brought forth placed on the divine law, the word of God; let a crown be placed thereon, by which the world may know, that so far as we approve of monarchy, that in America the law is king. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other. (Paine 1976, 98)               "
"4","Nevertheless, many reputable and influential liberal thinkers, including Locke, Scottish philosopher David Hume, English jurist William Blackstone, and Genevan constitutional theorist Jean‐Louis de Lolme, developed, in one form or another, a theory of executive power that permitted the use of extraordinary discretionary powers in cases of emergency.4 Perhaps it should come as no great surprise that this notion of prerogative would continue to fascinate a generation that exhibited an “all‐pervasive sense of contingency” rooted in their revolutionary experiences (Ellis 2000, 6). The doctrine that the ends (generally) justify the means was an integral part of early liberal thought, which recognized that necessity forces exceptions to established rules. These writers rejected the legalistic maxim fiat justitia ruat coelum (let justice be done though heaven may fall) in favor of the more pragmatic maxim inter arma silent leges (the laws are silent in time of war). Of the first maxim Hume wrote that “by sacrificing the end to the means, [it] shews [sic] a preposterous idea of the subordination of duties” (Hume 1985, “Of Passive Obedience,” 489). Elsewhere he declared that “[i]n every government, necessity, when real, supercedes all laws, and levels all limitations” (Hume 1983, Volume V, 128).         "
"5","Based on their appreciation for the incalculable contingencies of politics, they developed constitutional theories that allowed for considerable flexibility in dealing with the unforeseeable. Contrary to contemporary caricatures which claim that liberalism is single‐mindedly committed to “a legalistic or jurisprudential paradigm of political philosophy” (Gray 1995, 6), these thinkers demonstrated a keen awareness that the law was not always an appropriate mode of political intervention. Although early liberals sought to minimize the role of individual judgment and make politics a more regular process, they recognized the inherent limitations in politics conducted this way. Even Hume, who measured the progress of a civilization by the regularity of its laws, doubted “whether human society could ever reach that state of perfection, as to support itself with no other controul than the general and rigid maxims of law and equity” (Hume 1983, Volume V, 329). Whenever they noted the continuing need for discretionary judgment, the executive was the most natural candidate for this responsibility (e.g., de Lolme 1822, 381–82). Based on his belief that the impossibility of specifying “eccentrical remedies” to sudden emergencies makes a single executive who can act with vigor and dispatch indispensable, Blackstone explicitly endorsed a distinctively Lockean conception of prerogative, which he described as “the discretionary power of acting for the public good, where the positive laws are silent” (Blackstone 1979, Volume I, 244).5"
"6","Many of these ideas could easily be found in Locke's discussion of prerogative. Despite its apparent inconsistency with the rule of law, Lockean prerogative works toward many of the same ends as the rule of law, but through radically different means. Prerogative is required to deal with multifarious emergencies “which the Law can by no means provide for” (Locke 1988, II, 159; Pasquino 1998). It serves society's more basic commitment to the substantive principles and ends prescribed by the laws of nature, particularly the right—and correlative duty—to individual and collective self‐preservation (Simmons 1992).6 This law of nature is of such fundamental importance that it trumps all other rights, even those vaunted property rights that are often thought to lie at the very heart of Lockean liberalism (Locke 1988, II, 183).7"
"7","Whether or not a particular exercise of prerogative is justifiable ultimately depends on its tendency to promote the public good rather than its legal propriety. “This Power to act according to discretion, for the publick good, without the prescription of Law, and sometimes even against it, is that which is called Prerogative” (Locke 1988, II, 160; cf. Scigliano 1989, 243).         "
"8","Emergencies create exceptions that free the executive from ordinary legal constraints—though never from the fetters of morality contained in natural law. The following passage indicates that the people get to decide whether or not the public good has been served, but it raises more questions than it answers:"
"9","                        "
"10","This power whilst imployed for the benefit of the Community, and suitably to the trust and ends of the Government, is undoubted Prerogative, and never is questioned. For the People are very seldom, or never scrupulous, or nice in the point: they are far from examining Prerogative, whilst it is in any tolerable degree imploy'd for the use it was meant; that is, for the good of the People, and not manifestly against it. But if there comes to be a question between the Executive Power and the People, about a thing claimed as a Prerogative; the tendency of the exercise of such Prerogative to the good or hurt of the People, will easily decide that Question. (Locke 1988, II, 161)               "
"11","The question this passage fails to answer is whether or not the people are required to make an explicit decision about the legitimacy of each and every exercise of prerogative. On the one hand, he seemed to suggest that prerogative is an intrinsic part of executive power wherever there is a separation of powers (Locke 1988, II, 159). Except where a constitution sets precise legal limits on prerogative (which is not always advisable [Locke 1988, II, 166]), it is reasonable to assume that it is an intrinsic part of executive power. On the other hand, he also seemed to say that prerogative is an extraconstitutional power when he suggested that “the Consent and Approbation of the Community” are required to validate an exercise of prerogative after the fact (Locke 1988, II, 158).         "
"12","Since Locke never specified whether or not the executive always has to seek permission after the fact, it is not entirely clear if there is supposed to be a presumption of innocence on the part of an executive who exercises prerogative, or if there is supposed to be a presumption of guilt that the executive has to rebut. The executive is accountable for an abuse of prerogative in either case, but the executive who does not wield prerogative as a constitutional right has to think twice before using it and probably has a lot more explaining to do afterwards. In the first case, the burden falls on the people or their representatives to demonstrate that the executive exceeded his or her authority. In the second case, the burden falls on the executive to prove that exceeding his or her normal authority was necessary. In one case, the executive is required to seek approval from the people; in the other, the executive can safely assume approval.         "
"13","To complicate matters even further, Locke noted a few paragraphs later that the latitude an executive possesses depends to a significant degree on public recognition of his or her personal qualities. English history demonstrates “that Prerogative was always largest in the hands of our wisest and best Princes,” strongly suggesting that prerogative powers vary according to factors that cannot be formalized in law. An exercise of prerogative that is approved in one instance does not necessarily establish an authoritative precedent. But his observation that people have usually “acquiesced in what they did, and without the least complaint, let them inlarge their Prerogative as they pleased” (Locke 1988, II, 165) is not exactly an indication of the basic constitutional authority that all executives inherently possess. As he was wont to do, Locke left it up to actual lawmakers to work out the constitutional specifics for themselves. That ambiguity helps explain the disagreement between Jefferson and Hamilton on the question of justification.         "
"14","Throughout his public career, Jefferson professed adherence to a rigorous criterion of constitutionality that permits no deviations from strict standards of legality, a position best exemplified in his dispute with Hamilton over the constitutionality of the national bank (Jefferson 1984, 416–21). His predilection for viewing constitutions in legalistic terms is also evident in his private correspondence, where he advised those who would (re)design a constitution to follow one precept: “Only lay down true principles, and adhere to them inflexibly” (Jefferson to Samuel Kercheval [July 12, 1816] 1984, 1398).         "
"15","Jefferson's insistence upon a “strict construction” of the Constitution is based on his quintessentially democratic belief that the Constitution represents a social contract among citizens (Jefferson, “Draft Declaration and Protest of the Commonwealth of Virginia” 1984, 482). A Lockean conception of popular sovereignty informs his belief that even the slightest departures from the enumerated powers of the Constitution amount to undemocratic usurpations of authority, which originates in the people (Jefferson 1984, 422; see also Jefferson to Edmund Randolph [Aug. 18, 1799] 1984, 1067). If additional powers are necessary, the only approach consistent with the idea of a written and limited constitution is to appeal to the people for an amendment:         "
"16","                        "
"17","When an instrument admits two constructions, the one safe, the other dangerous, the one precise, the other indefinite, I prefer that which is safe & precise. I had rather risk an enlargement of powers from the nation, where it is found necessary, than to assume it by a construction that would make our powers boundless. Our peculiar security is in possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a blank paper by construction. (Jefferson to Wilson Cary Nicholas [Sep. 7, 1803] 1984, 1140)"
"18","Jefferson's unwavering commitment to the democratic ideal of self‐government might explain why he has seemed indifferent to details of constitutional design and architecture (Ellis 1996, 129) and why he welcomed periodic overhauls of the constitution (Jefferson to James Madison [September 6, 1789] 1984, 959–64). “After all,” he confided to Madison, “it is my principle that the will of the majority should always prevail. If they approve the proposed Convention in all its parts, I shall concur in it cheerfully, in hopes that they will amend it whenever they shall find it work wrong” (Jefferson to James Madison [Dec. 20, 1787] 1984, 918; see also Jefferson, “First Inaugural Address” 1984, 495).         "
"19","As important as the rule of law was to early liberals like Jefferson, it must not be forgotten that they also advocated rebellion in the name of fundamental principles that supercede established forms of law. “Should we have ever gained our Revolution, if we had bound our hands by manacles of the law, not only in the beginning, but in any part of the revolutionary conflict? There are extreme cases where the laws become inadequate even to their own preservation, and where, the universal recourse is a dictator, or martial law” (Jefferson to Doctor James Brown [Oct. 27, 1898] 1905, Volume IX, 211. But to exceed the express limits on power contained in a democratic constitution would be to violate the will of the people.8 Prerogative must therefore be an extraconstitutional power in as much as the Constitution contains no explicit provision allowing the president to exceed the law.         "
"20","In spite of—or perhaps because of—his insistence upon a narrowly legalistic conception of constitutional powers, Jefferson argued that no nation could afford to do without prerogative. As he stated in response to a question about the duties of executives in extraordinary circumstances,"
"21","                        "
"22","A strict observance of the written laws is doubtless one of the high duties of a good citizen, but it is not the highest. The laws of necessity, of self‐preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation. To lose our country by a scrupulous adherence to written law, would be to lose the law itself, with life, liberty, property and all those who are enjoying them with us; thus absurdly sacrificing the ends to the means … In all these cases, the unwritten laws of necessity, of self‐preservation, and of the public safety, control the written laws of meum and tuum. (Jefferson to John B. Colvin [Sept. 20, 1810] 1984, 1231–32)               "
"23","Jefferson did nothing to minimize the contradiction between prerogative and the law. In fact, it is crucial to his interpretive methodology that he accentuate the incompatibility between this extraordinary power and the democratic basis of the Constitution, even raising constitutional questions about his purchase of the Louisiana Territory (Jefferson, “Third Annual Message” 1984, 514)."
"24","What makes the use of prerogative powers thinkable for the dutiful executive confronted with an emergency and what makes it compatible with the principles of liberalism constitutionalism is that it is consistent with the highest aims of the Constitution. In Jefferson's view, there is nothing in the Constitution that gives the executive the power to supercede the laws in case of necessity, but there is nothing in the Constitution that demands capitulation to necessity either. As he indicated in his letter to Colvin, there are ends higher than written law. The Constitution often intimates at these ends but it is not always capable of adequately providing for them. The “law of necessity and self‐preservation” render “the salus populi supreme over the written law.” Self‐preservation overrides all other commitments, even “the laws of obligations to others” (Jefferson, “Opinion on the French Treaties” 1984, 423). When these are at risk, it is incumbent on the executive to take extraordinary action despite the certainty that there is no explicit warrant for such action in the law and to make a public admission of legal wrongdoing. “The officer who is called to act on this superior ground, does indeed risk himself on the justice of the controlling powers of the constitution, and his station makes it his duty to incur that risk. But those controlling powers, and his fellow citizens generally, are bound to judge according to the circumstances under which he acted” (Jefferson to Colvin 1984, 1233).         "
"25","Although Jefferson believed that an extraordinary act of executive power could be both illegal and legitimate, his constitutional theory draws such a close link between legality and legitimacy that each and every exercise of prerogative is necessarily presumed to be criminal until and unless the president convinces the people and their representatives of the merit of his actions. In fact, the president, like any other officer who commits an illegal but necessary and meritorious act, would have to seek an indemnity from the legislature (Wilmerding 1952). Since there is no explicit grant of prerogative in the Constitution, the burden of proof falls squarely on the executive to prove that his or her actions are legitimate in spite of their illegality. Instead of distorting the meaning of the Constitution to justify necessary exercises of presidential prerogative, Jefferson preferred to have executives violate the law outright and let the public judge the propriety of their acts. That was the risky approach he took in purchasing the Louisiana territory without previous constitutional authorization. He never made any attempt to hide the fact that he had “done an act beyond the Constitution” because he was confident that the people would approve the act (Jefferson to John C. Breckenridge [Aug. 12, 1803] 1984, 1138–39). Nevertheless, he thought it was important to emphasize that exceptions are limited to cases of real and unavoidable danger: “The danger which absolves us must be great, inevitable & imminent” (Jefferson, “Opinion on the French Treaties” 1984, 424). Even though the Louisiana Purchase was not an emergency in the strictest sense, it directly involved one of the highest ends—and perhaps the ultimate trump—in Jefferson's ideology: prolonging the republican experiment in self‐government (Ellis 1996, 247–53). This extraconstitutional act was justified because opening up the West to further expansion would indefinitely extend the life of the nation as Jefferson understood it.         "
"26","Because of his boundless and matchless confidence in the ability of the people to discriminate correctly between a meritorious and a pernicious exercise of prerogative, Jefferson believed that the scrupulous and patriotic executive would have nothing to fear. In a letter on the Burr conspiracy which reveals a “darker side” open to various forms of military despotism (Levy 1963), he indicated the factors the public should consider in evaluating the executive:         "
"27","                        "
"28","On great occasions every good officer must be ready to risk himself in going beyond the strict line of law, when the public preservation requires it; his motives will be a justification as far as there is any discretion in his ultra‐legal proceedings, and no indulgence of private feelings. (Jefferson to Governor William C. C. Claiborne [Feb. 3, 1807] 1984, 1172)"
"29","Although Jefferson thought it was unlikely that the people would err (Jefferson to Judge John Tyler [June 28, 1804] 1984, 1147; to Richard Price [Feb. 1, 1785] 1984, 798; to James Madison [Dec. 20, 1787] 1984, 918; see also Matthews 1984, 119–20), he accepted the fact that well‐intentioned executives who fail to convince the public that their actions are justified might be severely punished for breaking the law. It was far worse for the community to tolerate the contempt of its laws than to condemn an innocent executive who was merely their servant. There is a danger that “a prudent acquiescence, at a critical time, [might] be construed into a confirmation of every illegal thing done” (Jefferson 1954, 124). Each exercise of prerogative would have to be judged on a case‐by‐case basis in light of the particular circumstances, regardless of previous instances in which the executive's actions were upheld. To do otherwise would be to introduce illegitimate (because undemocratically enacted) changes into the constitution by way of interpretation and application, much in the way that judicial precedents introduce constitutional changes over time, as opposed to the more direct and democratic process of constitutional amendment.         "
"30","Jefferson believed that constitutional change should occur only as the result of periodic revisions made by the people as a whole in a definite, explicit, and public manner, not through the slow accretion of precedents that circumvent the principle of popular sovereignty. To allow the executive to cite previous cases of prerogative as a valid defense would steadily but surely erode the Constitution. He advocated the notion of a living (but not an evolving) constitution in the sense that adherence to the Constitution should never lead to national suicide. Each generation is completely sovereign and independent of the past, so it can legitimately enact almost any changes it desires (Jefferson to Samuel Kercheval [July 12, 1816] 1984, 1401). However, the fact that certain provisions of the Constitution have become obstacles (or simply obsolete) does not justify the kind of creative reinterpretation characteristic of jurisprudential approaches that strive for contemporary relevance instead of fidelity to the “plain meaning” of the text.9"
"31","The problem with Jefferson's conception of executive power as Hamilton saw it, though, is that it turns the executive into a law‐breaker. In effect, Jefferson required presidents at throw themselves on the mercy of the court of public opinion. Even though actual “necessity” was supposed to be sufficient justification for what Jefferson regarded as unconstitutional exercises of power, his recommended policy left no doubt that the president had violated the law. Under Hamilton's more expansive reading, a president acting with the best intentions for the sake of the nation could always try to find some justification for his actions in the Constitution itself."
"32","As evidenced in his revolutionary writings (Hamilton, “A Full Vindication of the Measures of the Congress” 2001, 10–11, 27, 41; Stourzh 1970, 11–17), Hamilton fully supported the conventional catalogue of rights that Englishmen and now Americans cherished, and sometimes took positions in defense of them more extreme than his contemporaries (McDonald 1979, 32). But unlike many of his more Whiggish contemporaries who had an abiding distrust of power, Hamilton did not believe that precise limits on the powers of government were necessarily conducive to the protection of these rights. Acknowledging the tension between vigilance and responsibility, Hamilton was unique in emphasizing that sufficient power is necessary—indeed indispensable—to the preservation of liberty (Walling 1999). In the very first installment of the Federalist he averred that “the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty … that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidding appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government” (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, I, 89). Political events at the national and state levels following the end of the Revolutionary war only confirmed his belief that a government with insufficient powers could be just as dangerous to liberty and other important ends as a government with overweening powers.         "
"33","According to Hamilton's acute diagnosis, the national government under the Articles of Confederation suffered from a crippling lack of “energy.”"
"34","                        "
"35","Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady administration of laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and high‐handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy. (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, LXX, 402)               "
"36","Although prerogative and energy belong to any effective and sovereign government, these qualities are most naturally suited to the executive. While most Americans at the time were inclined to regard a powerful executive as a warning sign that their liberties were in danger (Elkins and McKitrick 1993, 50), Hamilton considered it a beacon of salvation in times of danger. “A feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the government. A feeble execution is but another name for a bad execution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, must be, in practice, a bad government” (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, LXX, 402).         "
"37","More than any other Founder—and perhaps more than any political thinker other than Machiavelli—Hamilton was preoccupied with the problem of emergencies. References to extremities, crises, necessities, and exigencies abound in his writings, conveying the impression that emergencies are frequent if irregular and unpredictable occurrences. In contrast to Jefferson's rather blithe attitude toward political turbulence in free states (Jefferson to James Madison [January 30, 1787] 1984, 882; to William S. Smith [November 13, 1787] 1984, 911), an awareness and dread of the ever‐possible eruption of unforeseeable emergencies shaped Hamilton's thought on key questions of constitutional design and institutional powers. Since the ideal constitution should be adequate to any emergency, some degree of indeterminacy was not only tolerable—it was indispensable. “The contingencies of society are not reducible to calculations: They cannot be fixed or bounded, even in imagination” (Hamilton, “Speech in the New York Ratifying Convention” 2001, 505). It is thus necessary to leave many things up to executive discretion rather than to spell them out in detailed language that could limit the government's ability to protect what is necessary for the supreme value of self‐preservation (Rosano 2003, 67). Not only is the executive expected to have the expertise necessary to ascertain the “national interest,” but the office is also constituted in such a manner that the executive's interests will coincide with the preservation of the whole (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, XXIII, 186), unlike the more provincial perspectives of legislators who represent smaller constituencies.         "
"38","Even though Hamilton was not completely satisfied with the Constitution that emerged from the Philadelphia Convention, he always defended it as a flexible instrument of effective yet limited government. As a consequence, he maintained that the powers of the proposed government were adequate to any contingency (Farrand 1966, Volume I, 298), obviating the need for extraconstitutional—but not extralegal—exercises of power in cases of emergency. In his view, the powers of prerogative are contained in the very idea of a viable constitution. If others do not see it that way, it is because they tend to make a fetish out of the laws and fail to understand the proper relation between means and ends. It would be more prudent to create a constitution capable of meeting any crisis rather than to fashion a legalistic constitution whose powers are narrowly defined and completely enumerated because it would probably be necessary to violate those limits at some point anyway, thereby eroding respect for the Constitution (Flaumenhaft 1992, 163).10"
"39","                        "
"40","Wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the government with restrictions that cannot be observed, because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws, though dictated by necessity, impairs the sacred reverence which ought to be maintained in the breast or rulers towards the constitution of a country, and forms a precedent for other breaches where the same plea of necessity does not exist at all, or is less urgent and palpable. (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, XXV, 196; see also Stourzh 1970, 161–65)               "
"41","Unless he was willing to call into question his own wisdom and that of fellow delegates, the clear implication is that the Constitution contains few if any serious restrictions that would hinder the government's ability to deal with emergencies. It would never be necessary to violate the Constitution because the government was not limited to the powers specified in the text.11"
"42","Hamilton was much less scrupulous than Jefferson about legal forms or constitutional niceties that interfere with the realization of supposedly vital and uncontroversial ends (e.g., Hamilton to John Jay [May 7, 1800] 2001, 923). In contrast to Jefferson, he drew a sharp distinction between legitimacy and legality, though the two were closely related in his political thought (Stourzh 1970, 30–34). In typically dismissive fashion, he stated “that the idea of governing at all times by the simple force of law (which we have been told is the only admissible principle of republican government) has no place but in the reveries of those political doctors whose sagacity disdains the admonitions of experimental instruction” (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, XXVIII, 204). Emergencies compel the government to resort to measures that have not been constitutionally specified in advance. If there is a single phrase that encapsulates his thinking on this matter it is this: “Extraordinary exigencies demand extraordinary means” (Hamilton to John Jay [March 14, 1779] 2001, 58). Since “future necessities admit not of calculation or limitation,” government should be “free from every other control but a regard to the public good and to the sense of the people” (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, XXX, 214, XXXI, 218). In a striking blend of Jeffersonian rhetoric and Machiavellian reasoning (on Hamilton's use of raison d'état, see Stourzh 1970, 188), Hamilton declared that one of the self‐evident and universal truths of politics is the idea that the powers of government to deal with emergencies “ought to exist without limitation” (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, XXIII, 184), a view shared by the future apostle of strict constructionism James Madison (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, XLIV, 290). Hence, it is the Constitution that has to adjust to the political environment, since political circumstances do not always conform to the Constitution.         "
"43","Hamilton's argument did not allow for the outright violation of express constitutional prohibitions, but it did permit a kind of flexibility inconsistent with perhaps the primary objective of a written constitution: to establish unequivocal procedures and fixed rules for governing."
"44","                        "
"45","Constitutions of civil government are not to be framed upon calculation of existing exigencies, but upon a combination of these with the probable exigencies of ages, according to the natural and tried course of human affairs. Nothing, therefore, can be more fallacious than to infer the extent of any power proper to be lodged in the national government from an estimate of its immediate necessities. There ought to be a capacity to provide for future contingencies as they may happen; and as these are illimitable in their nature, so it is impossible safely to limit that capacity. (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, XXXIV, 227)               "
"46","History teaches “that no precise bounds could be set to the national exigencies; that a power equal to every possible contingency must exist somewhere in the government” (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, XXVI, 198). That power necessarily resides in the executive. It is the only branch of government with the requisite “energy” and “dispatch” to handle unforeseeable contingencies. At a minimum, constitutional government means limited government, but the executive is compelled to push the limits in times of emergency. As long as a necessary measure violates no preexisting individual or state rights and employs no immoral means, “there is a strong presumption in favor of its constitutionality” (Hamilton, “Opinion on the Constitutionality of a National Bank” 2001, 613, 621).         "
"47","Hamilton's discussions of executive power are deliberately ambiguous. Even though he never used the term prerogative in its Lockean sense to describe the powers of the president in the Federalist, his general discussion of constitutional principles provides indirect but unambiguous evidence that the responsibility of coping with contingencies almost always rests with the executive. His extremely narrow definition of a “limited Constitution” as “one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority” (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, LXXVIII, 438) is not only a direct contradiction of the Federalist party line that the proposed government would possess only enumerated powers, but it is also a declaration of his “high‐toned” conception of executive power. His exclusion of executive power from this formulation was no oversight. At the Constitutional Convention he admonished fellow delegates against defining the powers of government too carefully because “something will always be wanting” (Farrand 1966, Volume I, 298).         "
"48","Not until after the Constitution had already been ratified did Hamilton fully explicate his expansive theory of executive power, which was based on a theory of constitutionalism that he and Madison had endorsed more circumspectly in the Federalist (e.g., XL and XLIV). When the United States had to decide in 1793 whether to honor its treaty with Revolutionary War ally France and battle the British once again or to remain neutral and let the newly minted republic spread its revolutionary values on its own, Hamilton advised President Washington to issue a Proclamation of Neutrality that would appease England and keep the fledgling republic out of war. Hamilton's recommendation infuriated the Francophile Jefferson and resulted in a heated pamphlet war between Hamilton and his former coauthor and Jefferson's new protégé, Madison. The central question of the debate was whether the president had the authority to issue a proclamation that arguably contravened a treaty with France, but the dispute had much broader implications for the nature and scope of executive power and the proper construction of the Constitution.

"49","Writing under the pseudonym “Pacificus,” Hamilton asserted in the first essay that the president has sole responsibility for conducting foreign relations, including the construction of treaties, then launched into a dissertation upon the proper constitutional interpretation of executive powers more generally. He contended that the president's power to issue the proclamation derives from the open‐ended language of the vesting clause of Article II, which gives the president vast powers incident to “the execution of all laws, the laws of Nations as well as the Municipal law, which recognises and adopts those laws” (Hamilton, “Pacificus I” 2001, 809, 806). Hamilton's key point was that enumerated powers did not exhaust the powers of government, at least not where the executive was concerned."

"51","It would not consist with the rules of sound construction to consider this enumeration of particular authorities as derogating from the more comprehensive grant contained in the general clause, further than as it may be coupled with express restrictions or qualifications; as in regard to the cooperation of the Senate in the appointment of Officers and the making of treaties; which are qualifications of the general executive powers of appointing officers and making treaties: Because the difficulty of a complete and perfect specification of all the cases of Executive authority would naturally dictate the use of general terms—and would render it improbable that a specification of certain particulars was designed as a substitute for those terms when antecedently used. (Hamilton, “Pacificus I” 2001, 805)"
"52","The general terms of the first clause in Article II are not merely prefatory, but in fact make a general grant of powers. And in contrast to the general grant of executive power, which must be construed generously, exceptions to the president's powers must be interpreted as narrowly as possible."
"53","                        "
"54","The enumeration ought rather therefore to be considered as intended by way of greater caution, to specify and regulate the principal articles impliedinthedefinitionofExecutivePower; leaving the rest to flow from the general grant of that power, interpreted in conformity to other parts of the constitution and to the principles of free government.               "
"55","The general doctrine then of our constitution is, that the Executive Power of the Nation is vested in the President; subject only to the exceptions and qualifications which are expressed in the instrument. (Hamilton, “Pacificus I” 2001, 805; my italics)               "
"56","Although the first “Pacificus” essay makes it clear that the president possesses the full panoply of executive powers not shared concurrently with the legislature (e.g., the appointment power, the war powers, and the treaty power), it is never entirely clear exactly what those powers include since Hamilton never offered a full specification of executive powers. What is clear, however, is that “Undefined powers are discretionary powers, limited only by the object for which they were given” (Hamilton to James Duane [Sep. 3, 1780] 2001, 71). The vast majority of executive powers are bound to be implicit and largely discretionary because “there is and necessarily must be a great number of undefined particulars incident to the general duty of every officer, for the requiring of which no special warrant is to be found in any law” (Hamilton to William Heth [June 23 (‐24), 1791] 1976, Volume VIII, 499). Especially when it comes to dealing with unexpected occurrences, formal rules and regulations are more likely to be hindrances than helps."
"57","Hamilton's defense of the president's unitary nature, duration in office, mode of election, and veto power in the Federalist provides an important clue to why he thought it was so important to fix the discretionary powers of the president in solid constitutional ground. Each of these features of the presidency was designed to enhance the independence of the executive from the caprices of the people. Institutional protections are necessary to insulate presidents from “public passions” and protect their dignity. It is crucial for presidents to maintain some distance from the people since “the public good requires as a primary object that the dignity of the office should be supported” (Hamilton to George Washington [May 5, 1789] 2001, 515). One of the hallmarks of Hamilton's thought is that respectability in government is essential to its success (Flaumenhaft 1992, 148), an idea that echoes Blackstone's defense of the English constitutional maxim that “the king can do no wrong” (Blackstone 1979, Volume I, 50, 233, 234). If presidents have to seek public approval for every act that lacks explicit constitutional sanction, that dignity is likely to diminish to the potential detriment of the nation.         "

"59","The republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those whom they intrust the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men, who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests. It is a just observation that the people commonly intend the public good… . [But] they sometimes err… . When occasions present themselves in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be guardians of those interests to withstand the temporary delusion in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection. (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, LXXI, 409–10)               "
"60","Even though he agreed that public opinion guides rulers “in the general course of things,” Hamilton steadfastly held to the view that “there are certain conjunctures, when it may be necessary and proper to disregard the opinions which the majority of the people have formed” (Hamilton, “Speech in the New York Ratifying Convention”[June 21, 1788] 2001, 488)."
"61","The differences between Hamilton and Jefferson on various issues relating to prerogative belie an underlying agreement that prerogative is often preferable to more highly formalized institutional methods of dealing with emergencies. According to the rather counterintuitive logic of their arguments, prerogative might actually be less dangerous to liberal constitutional principles than approaches that attempt to define emergency powers in law—whether they aim to expand or constrain them. Perhaps nothing demonstrates the continued relevance and force of their arguments better than events that have transpired in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The theory of prerogative suggests that the urge by both critics and defenders of the president's counterterrorism policies to seek explicit juridico‐administrative support for their positions is misguided and potentially counterproductive."
"62","Since so much of prerogative depends on unique and unforeseeable circumstances surrounding an emergency,12 the constitutional dynamics of prerogative are completely unlike those that obtain in other forms of constitutional explication. Jefferson and Hamilton's endorsement of prerogative as a necessary supplement to the ordinary constitutional powers of the national government reveals an underlying belief in constitutional practice beyond the purview of courts (Whittington 1999). There are sound institutional reasons for resisting the growing global trend toward the “judicialization” of politics (Ferejohn 2002) that are easily overlooked when it comes to prerogative. Since prerogative operates outside the parameters of “normal,” i.e., juridical, constitutional practice, its legitimacy has to be determined on an informal, case‐by‐case basis. It appears that both Jefferson and Hamilton wanted to avoid the juridification of prerogative in order to avoid setting formal precedents that would either hamstring the ability of presidents to respond effectively to genuine emergencies in the future or enlarge their discretionary powers in ordinary circumstances. That is to say, prerogative is irreducible to law and beyond the reach of those legalistic rules that ordinarily regulate governmental powers. Yet our penchant for turning constitutional questions into legal disputes means that we often look to the judiciary to resolve what are ultimately political controversies that perhaps should not be turned into precedents—whether they expand prerogative or contract it. Once the courts justify an expansion in one instance, it becomes that much easier to push the limits in circumstances that might not warrant the use of extraordinary powers. Conversely, when the courts rule against the use of such powers in one set of circumstances, it becomes that much more difficult for the president to act swiftly in actual cases of necessity. The chief virtue of an informal, open‐ended approach like prerogative is that it settles nothing and prescribes nothing beyond the immediate present.         "
"63","Unlike the temporary powers formally established through law in an emergency regime, the emergency powers exercised by a president do not necessarily subvert or supplant the existing constitutional order since they are supposed to be temporary exercises of extraordinary powers limited both in duration and in scope by the length and severity of the crisis.13 Jefferson and Hamilton's conception of executive power obviates the need to suspend or overhaul the constitutional system in times of emergency. Unlike the principle of constitutional dictatorship, which often results in a significant transformation of both the substantive concerns and formal institutions of the constitutional system (see Rossiter 2002), prerogative makes it unnecessary to establish institutional changes in the actual structure of the constitution. Even though the aim of a constitutional dictatorship is the eventual and complete restoration of the constitutional status quo prior to the eruption of the crisis that triggered it, there is a real danger that the institutional changes that accompany it will become entrenched and survive even after the crisis has passed.         "
"64","Because each exercise of prerogative is sui generis, it might, paradoxically, be less liable to abuse or misuse than emergency powers that are specified in law because each exercise of prerogative must be justified primarily in terms of the particular circumstances at hand. Even the most carefully drawn provisions can be stretched, bent, or forced to fit circumstances for which they were never intended. Even if they were created to be only temporary measures, it is in the nature of laws—like nearly all formal institutions—to outlive their usefulness and become entrenched. Such permanent changes in the structure of governmental powers might constitute greater threats to liberty in the long run than a temporary and exceptional expedient like prerogative. As Hamilton noted in a discussion of the need for an energetic government, “Schemes to subvert the liberties of a great community require time to mature them for execution” (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay 1987, XXVI, 199). To institutionalize emergency powers only invites their use and threatens to make them seem all‐too‐routine and ordinary. The USA Patriot Act (“Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required To Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act”) is a case in point. Shortly after it was signed into law on October 26, 2001, Attorney General John Ashcroft and others began urging Congress to make permanent those powers which would have expired on December 31, 2005, pursuant to the sunset provision in Section 224. Rossiter's sobering reminder about the history of constitutional dictatorships is worth repeating: “No democracy ever went through a period of thoroughgoing constitutional dictatorship without some permanent and often unfavorable alteration in its governmental scheme, and in more than one instance an institution of constitutional dictatorship has been turned against the order it was established to defend” (Rossiter 2002, 13).         "
"65","What the Bush administration and its critics have in common, though, is precisely that they seek permanent or semipermanent legal changes applicable to circumstances that might be very different in the future. In addition to claiming that the president has the inherent power to try noncitizens in military tribunals, the administration has sought the enlargement of existing powers and the creation of new ones in its ongoing war on terrorism, from the passage of the USA Patriot Act to the proposed Domestic Security Enhancement Act (dubbed the “USA Patriot Act II”). What has alarmed so many civil libertarians is that some provisions authorize the president to take actions that would otherwise have been unthinkable in all but the most pressing emergencies. Regardless of the intent behind these initiatives, the effect is to prolong if not perpetuate a sense of emergency, making the exercise of new powers seem more routine and even normal, whereas exercises of prerogative are understood to be extraordinary reactions to extraordinary occurrences. It is also for that reason that the powers created by the USA Patriot Act might not be sufficient in an emergency. Since it is impossible (and undesirable) to provide for every contingency that might arise, the executive might be compelled to take measures that exceed powers that been specified in law anyway. When Bush's rival in the bitterly contested and controversial 2000 presidential elections called him “my commander‐in‐chief” at a late September 2001 political event in Des Moines, Iowa (even as the as the administration was busy detaining hundreds of suspects without charging them), Al Gore lent credence to Lockean claims that the people will acquiesce in the use of prerogative whenever it appears justified—as it did to many in the weeks immediately after the terrorist strikes."
"66","Both Hamilton and Jefferson opposed the worst excesses of the misbegotten Alien and Sedition Acts on civil libertarian grounds (Elkins and McKitrick 1993, 591, 700–01; McDonald 1979, 339, 442–43), but judicial review was not the preferred method of checking executive power for either statesman. They opted for more vigilance, not more rules. Jefferson's position is of course understandable in terms of his principled democratic objections to an active judiciary, but their theories of prerogative also militate against categorically ruling out actions that might be necessary in a dire emergency, even if they involve violating cherished rights to property (Jefferson to John B. Colvin 1984, 1231–32). Given the judiciary's record in infamous civil liberties cases such as Korematsu v. United States (323 U.S. 214 [1944]), though, it seems that civil libertarians might be doing more harm than good to their causes by seeking judicial as opposed to political relief. Courts frequently take their cues from election returns and the other political branches, especially in times of crisis (Dahl 1957; Klarman 1996; Rosenberg 1991; cf. Casper 1976). Even though the courts normally have a special responsibility to protect individual rights, it might be more prudent to leave matters undecided than to risk the long‐term damage to civil liberties that a negative ruling might do. The reluctance of courts to get involved in current controversies concerning counterterrorism policies might not be cause for celebration, but it might create positive opportunities to develop those deliberative democratic capacities that rule‐bound judicial decision making sometimes preempts (Sunstein 1999).         "
"67","In spite of the surprising parallels between Jefferson and Hamilton, numerous disjunctures remain. Though both would both concede the wisdom of Rossiter's warning about democracies in times of crisis, they would do so for quite different reasons, which have as much—if not more—to do with their attitudes toward democracy as they do with their conceptions of constitutional government. Their disagreement highlights some profound discrepancies between constitutionalism and democracy. As opposed to the way that this opposition is usually framed, with the constitution serving as a brake on the propensity of majorities to rush headlong into action (Holmes 1995, 134–77), Jefferson made the people responsible for making sure that the executive does not act precipitously by claiming greater constitutional authority than actually allowed. Having to rely exclusively on the force of reasonable arguments and a fair presentation of the relevant circumstances that compelled him or her to violate the law, the Jeffersonian president initiates a public dialogue with the public that makes the people more directly responsible for safeguarding the Constitution. The principle of popular sovereignty demands nothing less than active civic engagement in high constitutional politics.14 If self‐government means anything at all, it means the right of the people to judge political and constitutional matters for themselves (Jefferson to P. S. Dupont de Nemours [April 24, 1816] 1984, 1385, 1386; Jefferson to John Taylor [May 28, 1816] 1984, 1394; Matthews 1984, 81). For Jefferson there can be no discordance between the will of an informed public and principles of justice, so there is little danger that a truly meritorious exercise of prerogative would be condemned. The great advantage of democracy is that it is self‐correcting (Jefferson to Edward Carrington [Jan. 16, 1787] 1984, 880), a sentiment often echoed by contemporary democratic theorists who emphasize the reflexivity of the deliberative process (Barber 1996, 353–54). The Jeffersonian view that the unconstitutionality of extralegal acts of prerogative should be forthrightly and publicly acknowledged opens up a potential space for collective exercises in deliberative democracy that Hamilton wanted to close off for fear that it would hamper the executive's ability to rescue the nation from danger.         "
"68","Hamilton was much less sanguine than his rival that the people were reliable or competent enough to judge correctly in the ordinary course of affairs, let alone moments of crisis. Less than a year after America declared its independence he was already expressing reservations about the deliberative powers of the people: “When the deliberative or judicial powers are vested wholly or partly in the collective body of the people, you must expect error, confusion and instability” (Hamilton to Gouverneur Morris [May 19, 1777] 2001, 46). Hamilton was not indifferent to public opinion; indeed, he believed it was entirely appropriate for government to “influence” it, which is why he expended so much energy appealing to it throughout his career (Hamilton, “Memorandum by George Beckwith” 2001, 523; Flaumenhaft 1992, 264; Brookhiser 2000, 7). An honest error in judgment might be excusable under the Hamiltonian scheme, but there is little chance that the public would be as forgiving in a constitutional system where the executive has no inherent right to exceed the law. Even though he predicted “that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station [the presidency] filled by characters pre‐eminent for ability and virtue” (Madison, Hamilton, Jay 1987, LXVIII, 395), Hamilton feared that people who err so often in recognizing the public good might also fail to recognize the upright qualities and intentions of a president compelled to break the law. Without some constitutional cover to protect them from public retribution, even the best executives might hesitate to act in situations where the slightest delay could spell disaster. Moreover, confidence in the constitution as an effective instrument of government would likely erode when an executive who is either overscrupulous or confronted by another branch that insists on legal exactitude hesitates to undertake extraordinary actions that might be necessary. The constitutional system would be much more stable if the authority for extraordinary actions could be located directly in the Constitution. Promoting respect for both the office of the presidency and the person of the president is essential to the maintenance of popular attachment to the Constitution that Hamilton considered vital to its longevity and durability (Manzer 2001, 514).         "
"69","Jefferson's requirement of an explicit admission of constitutional overreaching places the executive in a very different position from that of the Hamiltonian president. In the Jeffersonian model, a legitimate exercise of prerogative is one that gains the assent of the public, even if only after the fact. Where Hamilton's executive would present the people with a fait accompli justified by both the intrinsic rightness of the action and inherent constitutional powers, Jefferson's is obligated to consider and even anticipate public reaction, since it is the only thing that can validate a violation of the law. Hamilton's deep concern was that a president who takes actions that are necessary and justifiable but illegal and unconstitutional in the strictest sense would technically be a constitutional criminal regardless of any future public exoneration. Once that stigma is attached, it becomes impossible to remove completely. A constitutional theory that makes legality the measure of legitimacy invariably “produces” more criminal action than one that takes utility as its standard of legitimacy. However, one that gives the executive—or any governmental officer, for that matter—such wide discretion to act outside the ambit of the law necessarily threatens the very foundations of limited government.         "
"70","The theory of prerogative that emerges from this consideration of early liberal political thought demonstrates that emergency powers are not necessarily inconsistent with the principles of liberal constitutionalism, since those principles include a commitment to formal institutions as well as the substantive values they are designed to serve. As critical as formal institutions are to the realization of such values in ordinary circumstances, they can become impediments to those ends in extraordinary situations. Whether the authority for it ultimately derives from the Constitution itself or from extraconstitutional sources (e.g., the public), prerogative is an extralegal device that temporarily exceeds ordinary legal constraints so that those same constraints do not have to be removed or replaced permanently. Liberal principles, implied Locke, Jefferson, and Hamilton, are sometimes served better by permitting exceptions to rules than by adhering to them rigidly."
"71","If the ultimate purpose of a constitution is to establish a workable but limited form of government, then government must be equipped to handle the unforeseeable contingencies of politics. However, it would be utterly futile to attempt to foresee or provide for future exigencies in anything but the most general way. A viable constitution must simultaneously accomplish two inconsistent goals: first, it must enable statesmen to deal with the ordinary and extraordinary problems of politics; second, it must prevent those same statesmen from becoming threats to the liberties and other values they are appointed to preserve. The second task requires a diminution of discretionary powers, whereas the first requires the preservation of political judgment, which cannot be reduced to legalistic rules or doctrinal formulae. This involves a delicate balancing act, but we must not delude ourselves into thinking that it is possible to achieve both objectives without sacrificing some cherished values. The most important lesson of Isaiah Berlin's classic essay on liberty (1969, 125–26, 167–72) is also its most bitter: the irreconcilability of ultimate ends and values forces us to make tragic choices between them. Though the Founders could not have foreseen all the situations that may call for an extension of executive power and sometimes for its reduction, they anticipated the need for continuous adjustments between discretion and the laws that fetter it. For better or for worse, they left it up to succeeding generations of politicians to establish modes of constitutional practice rather than settling them all in advance."
