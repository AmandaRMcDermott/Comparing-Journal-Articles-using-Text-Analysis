"1","Descriptive representation is a term used to characterize politicians who share distinct physical traits with their constituencies (Mansbridge 1999; Pitkin 1967). Early studies of minority representation were concerned predominately with descriptive representation because the initial question of electoral impact centered on the winning candidate's ethnicity. This research agenda questioned whether electoral structures, primarily the change from at‐large elections to single‐member district (or “ward”) elections, provided added benefits to minority candidates, or whether institutional factors were more important to the process.         "
"2","Early results held that both socioeconomic and electoral structure variables were important to African American representation (Karnig 1976; Robinson and Dye 1978), but contrary findings challenged this conclusion, downplaying the role of structure in the representative process (Cole 1974; MacManus 1978). Later research bolstered the former claim, suggesting that not only were at‐large arrangements critical to black failure at the polls (Davidson and Korbel 1981; Engstrom and McDonald 1987, 1986, 1981; Karnig and Welch 1982; McCrary 1999; Welch 1990; Welch and Karnig 1978) but that these structures were more powerful than socioeconomic characteristics (Stewart, England, and Meier 1989). The most recent studies using data from national samples affirm that structures in general matter for blacks (Canon 1999; Lublin 1997; but see Austin 1998; Sass and Mehay 2003); however, they may not hold for other minorities. Taebel (1978), in a study of city council representation, found that Hispanics gained only marginal benefits from ward elections, conjecturing that residential segregation was not as prevalent for Hispanics as it was for blacks. Susan Welch (1990), using a national sample of city councils from large U.S. cities, found that Hispanics gained almost nothing due to structural variation. Brischetto et al. (1994) similarly found that Latinos achieve little relative to blacks when electoral structures are manipulated; rather their population size has a greater impact on political gains. Polinard et al. (1994), however, found strong positive effects on Mexican American communities in Texas when city councils and school boards changed from at‐large to district elections. More recent national evidence supports these latter findings, suggesting that Latinos are aided significantly by a change from at‐large to district elections (Leal, Meier, and Martinez‐Ebers 2002; Lublin 1997).         "
"3","The impact of electoral variation (between at‐large and ward‐based single‐member district structures) on descriptive representation of blacks (but not necessarily Latinos) appears settled in favor of single‐member district elections.1 Many argue, however, that these gains may be offset by losses in substantive representation. Swain (1993, 205–06) contends that majority‐minority districts (created by subdividing at‐large districts into numerous racially concentrated wards) may dilute overall support for black policies because white candidates no longer have to contend with minority constituencies in their own majority districts. She notes that Republicans actually helped create many of the black majority districts in the early 1990s in order to dilute black political power, which tends to vote Democratic overall. Guinier (1991) takes this argument further to suggest that minority representatives who have Anglo constituents will find it easier to build coalitions with Anglo legislators. If this is true, then black and Latino representatives full of good intentions and supported by a large (ward) constituency will fail to deliver on their promises in office, due to their diluted influence in the political arena. Secondly, these arguments contend that manipulating the electoral system may inadvertently create more racial polarization among voters, and in turn create minority candidates who must behave differently (support majority policy preferences) if elected outside of racially gerrymandered wards. We address both issues in this study.            "
"4","Although Swain and Guinier's arguments make intuitive sense, studies at the local level present evidence that descriptive representation is indeed associated with substantive policy representation.2Eisinger (1980) finds that the presence of a black mayor has a small impact on the percentage of black administrators and professionals in the city. Karnig (1980) also finds that mayoral representation increases social spending on “black” policy issues, although like Eisinger, he makes no such claims about city council representation. Polinard et al. (1994) and Leal, Meier, and Martinez‐Ebers (2002) find a similar relationship between the election of Latino school board members, and the hiring of Latino administrators and teachers. Stewart, England, and Meier (1989), using a national sample of black school board members, affirm that single‐member district structures create more opportunity for black representation, and that this overall representation creates more black administrative and teaching positions. Each of these studies focus on the impact of the number of minorities elected; none of them link substantive representation directly to how a person was elected.            "
"5","The how question involves the interaction of structure and policy outputs. Some early work in the more general area of structural effects focused on progressive reforms and their impact on municipal policy (Aiken and Alford 1970; Lineberry and Fowler 1967; Welch and Bledsoe 1988). While these studies do not concentrate primarily on questions of race, their theoretical thrust is identical to the one employed here. That is, the manipulation of electoral structures (including at‐large and ward designs) changes the decision calculus of elected officials in terms of their constituency focus, and this change produces differences in policy outcomes. Each piece notes that at‐large structures, as part of the progressive reform package, were intended to reduce fractionalized, neighborhood‐oriented politics, and promote general (majority) politics (Aiken and Alford 1970; Lineberry and Fowler 1967; Welch and Bledsoe 1988). Welch and Bledsoe (1988), with the most relevant empirical support, find differences in behaviors due to structural variation (at‐large officials spend less time on neighborhood constituencies, and more time on city wide issues) but do not provide much evidence of policy consequences.            "
"6","In this article, we apply the underlying logic of these municipal studies to racial minority school districts, to make a direct link between structure and substantive representation. Karnig explains why we would expect to see policy losses from minorities elected in at‐large districts: “There would likely be a higher incidence of substantively unrepresentative black councilmen in at‐large cities, where black candidates must appeal to the white electorate in order to gain office. If policy attitudes of black councilmen are basically the same as white councilmen, major changes in policy outcomes are not likely” (1976, 237). If at‐large elected officials are less responsive to the conflicting ethnic and racial needs of groups in the district (Lineberry and Fowler 1967, 715), then we expect (conversely) that ward‐elected Latinos and blacks will be more responsive to these needs. The next section formally explores why this is so.            "
"7","The literature on substantive minority representation is at times conflicting. By looking at black and Latino substantive outcomes in the educational sphere, we contribute empirical evidence that clarifies a portion of the debate. The two systems we study, at‐large and single‐member districts, provide an opportunity to consult the logic of formal theory to show that, contrary to the arguments of Swain and Guinier, that single‐member districts will improve the effectiveness of minority representatives.3 This section gives a formal overview pertinent to our analysis and concludes with a specific set of testable hypotheses.         "
"8","Why might one expect that the quality of representation varies with political structure? That is, why might a black or Latino elected in an at‐large system be less effective at pressing black or Latino interests than one elected from a single‐member district?4 We begin by making three assumptions (albeit assumptions with a great deal of empirical support):         "
"9","                        "
"10","Assumption 1. Voters are rational and will vote for candidates most likely to represent their interests."
"11","Assumption 2. Candidates are rational and, therefore, will seek to satisfy constituency interests (either because they seek reelection for its own sake or seek reelection to pursue policy goals)."
"12","Assumption 3. Ethnicity is an important political issue (that is, political preferences differ based on ethnicity), but blacks or Latinos do not compose a majority of the electorate."
"13"," Figure 1 shows this situation for a jurisdiction that is 80% Anglo and 20% Latino (the logic works for other percentages; the illustrations are just more obvious in this case).5 We have drawn Figure 1 to show Latinos with relatively extreme views; however, the rationale works as long as the median Latino voter ML is different from the median voter MV. The logic for why these differences produce variable descriptive outcomes is similar to the substantive story, so here we concentrate on the latter, in order to thwart redundancy.         "
"14","                 The Pure At‐Large System                      "
"15","To illustrate why the nature of representation is likely to change in different systems, assume two jurisdictions of five members each, identical in all respects except that jurisdiction A (in Figure 1) elects board members at‐large and jurisdiction W (Figure 2) elects them by ward. A Latino (L1) seeking election in jurisdiction A, quite rationally positions himself or herself at MV, the median voter for the entire district.6 A Latino (L2) seeking election in W, faces a much different electorate and takes the position at ML, the median voter in the Latino community. L1, the Latino in the at‐large system cannot run at the Latino median simply because this leaves a large opening for another candidate to defeat L1 at the polls by taking a position between L1 and the median voter. In essence this means that L1 needs to demonstrate his or her value by taking positions similar to MV while L2 is free to position at ML. In less abstract terms, the Latino elected in an at‐large system must moderate his or her push for Latino benefits to avoid alienating the median voter who is not Latino. L2, the Latino elected from a single‐member district, faces no such constraint and can push for policies that reflect ML, the median of the Latino community.         "
"16","                 The Ward System                      "
"17","By defining the match between Latino (or black) constituents and Latino (or black) representatives as the quality of representation, the argument suggests the hypothesis that the quality of minority representation will be greater in ward‐based single‐member district systems than will the quality of representation in at‐large systems.7 This hypothesis could be tested in a variety of ways, but we will focus simply on the distribution of employment opportunities, thus, generating the following testable hypotheses:         "
"18","                        "
"19"," Minority representatives in ward‐based single member district systems will be more effective in hiring more minority administrators than will minority representatives in at‐large systems, all other things being equal.                   "
"20"," Minority representatives in ward‐based single‐member district systems will be more effective in hiring more minority teachers than will minority representatives in at‐large systems, all other things being equal.                   "
"21","Given the wealth of studies at the national level that generate null results on this question, why might one expect different findings at the local level, that is, why might a minority representative who is not likely to be part of the majority on the school board still influence school board decisions? The different sizes of these legislative institutions is likely to make a great deal of difference. A single minority elected to a five‐person school board has a much greater chance of becoming the pivotal member on a vote than does a minority (or even 20 minorities) elected to a 435 person legislature. Large legislatures also have extensive rules and structures that limit what individual members can do. In a school board, small group dynamics will likely create different types of relationships and more opportunities for log rolling. Most school boards, including all those in this study, are also nonpartisan which allows for more fluid coalitional patterns than when preexisting party organizations structure legislative interactions."
"22","The use of race as a voting cue, and its importance as a policy cue, is also elevated in local, nonpartisan elections (Arrington and Watts 1991; Bullock 1984; Hahn and Almy 1971; Jennings and Zeigler 1966; Karnig 1976; Lieske and Hillard 1984; Taebel 1978). The evidence consistently points to race as a substitute good for “party affiliation” in nonpartisan mayoral, city council, and school board contests (Arrington and Watts 1991; Hahn and Almy 1971; Jennings and Zeigler 1966; Lieske and Hillard 1984). Residential segregation and persistent educational outcome gaps between racial minorities and whites in school districts also mean that education policy is more likely to be defined along racial divisions. All of these factors combine to make descriptive and substantive representation more likely on school boards than in state and national legislatures. In simple terms, incentives and opportunities are greater at the local level for both voters and elected officials to behave as our theoretical models suggest they would.         "
"23","This study examines all Texas school districts in 1999 that met two characteristics. First, the districts must either use at‐large or ward elections to select their school board. Texas contains one dependent school district, a handful of others with appointed board members, and several that use a cumulative voting system (Brischetto and Engstrom 1997; Engstrom and Barrilleaux 1991); fewer than 3% of the districts were eliminated with this criterion (26 of 1041; 875 districts use at‐large elections, the remainder (140) use single‐member district ward‐based elections or some combination that includes them). Second, because our hypotheses apply to numerical minorities, in the analysis of each ethnic group, the group had to have less than 50% of the district population.8 That is, it had to be a minority within the district. This eliminated two districts with African‐American majorities and 126 with Latino majorities. Missing data on other variables eliminated a handful of districts leaving 1009 for the African American analysis and 885 for the Latino analysis.9 The districts used in the African American analysis have 6.2% black population, 7.9% black students, 3.9% black school board representation, 3.4% administrative representation, and 2.5% teacher representation. The Latino districts have 15.2% Latino population, 19.8% Latino students, 3.4% school board representation, 2.7% administrative representation, and 2.9% teacher representation.10"
"24","Texas districts share characteristics with most of the other school districts in the United States and thus the findings here should have some generality. Texas school districts are extremely diverse on a variety of dimensions including community wealth, racial diversity, urban versus rural, large versus small. They contain a mix of at‐large and single‐member district elections unlike some states that mandate a single structural form."
"25","Data on school board representation were obtained by a request to the Texas Association of School Boards (TASB). TASB data had several missing data points so we contacted 300 of the districts by phone to fill in the gaps. The school board data are for 1999; the census data used population figures for 2000, and all remaining data are from the Texas Education Agency for the year 1999."
"26","Step one in determining the bias of at‐large elections is to see if the structure itself has a quantitative impact on representation.11 To do so, we regressed the percentage of school board seats held by that minority on their population percentage, a dummy variable for whether or not the district used ward elections, and the interaction of that dummy variable with the minority population percentage.12 This equation, popularized by Engstrom and McDonald (1981) and used by most analyses on minority representation since then (Austin 1998; Meier and Stewart 1991; Meier, Stewart, and England 1989), can be decomposed into separate parts for at‐large and ward‐based systems. As an illustration, in Table 1 for blacks, the intercept and the population slope can be interpreted as the relationship for at‐large systems (because both the ward variable and the interaction of the ward variable with population take on the value of zero and drop out of the equation for at‐large systems). The intercept is insignificant, and the slope suggests that in at‐large systems, a one percentage point increase in black population is associated with a .605 percentage point increase in black school board representatives.13 In short, blacks receive approximately 61% of the representation that they would expect based on population alone. The slope for the ward elections variable shows the difference in intercept between ward‐based systems and at‐large systems. It is insignificant and thus also essentially zero. The ward times population slope shows how different the ward slope is from the at‐large slope. The actual ward slope can be calculated by adding this slope to the population slope. In ward systems, therefore, a one percentage point increase in black population is associated with a .630 percentage point increase in black representation. The t‐test shows that ward systems do not have significantly more black representatives than do at‐large systems controlling for the percentage of black population. In short, blacks do as well in at‐large elections as they do in ward elections.         "
"27","The equation for Latino school board seats appears in the second set of columns in Table 1, and the findings are much different from those for African Americans. The significant negative intercept means that Latinos are unlikely to receive any representation on the school board until they exceed a certain percentage of the population (5.3% in this case, a modest threshold).14 At‐large systems generate a .254 percentage point increase in school board representation for a one percentage point increase in population. Latino representation is significantly enhanced in ward‐based systems; a one percentage point increase in Latino population is associated with a .539 percentage point increase in Latino school board members. The significant ward intercept indicates the threshold level in ward systems is slightly larger (8.0%). The graphs for both sets of relationships are shown in Figures 3 and 4.         "
"28","                 Descriptive Representation Effects for Latinos                      "
"29","                 Descriptive Representation Effects for Blacks                      "
"30","Comparing the relationships for African Americans and Latinos reveals additional information. African Americans are not affected by structural barriers, and they are generally more effective in translating population into representation than are Latinos; this is consistent with past research using national data (Meier and Stewart 1991; Meier, Stewart, and England 1989). Scholars have speculated that these differences in efficiency are linked to higher levels of citizenship among blacks, greater residential segregation of the black community leading to both greater contact and the greater likelihood of fitting within ward boundaries, and the longer history of the African American population in using political action.         "
"31","The theoretical sections of this article argued that the effectiveness of those minority representatives elected at‐large would be less than the ward‐elected representatives. A long literature has linked the election of minorities to governing boards to the subsequent recruitment of minorities to the bureaucracy (Eisinger 1980; Kerr and Mladenka 1994; Mladenka 1989; Polinard et al. 1994). Although some condemn such practices as patronage and detrimental to the performance of school systems (Rich 1996), an extensive literature suggests that access to administrative and teaching positions results in policy outcomes that are likely to benefit minority students (Meier et al. 2001; Meier and Stewart, 1991; Meier, Stewart, and England 1989; Meier, Wrinkle, and Polinard 1999; Polinard et al. 1994).         "
"32","To determine the efficacy of representatives elected under various structures, we used a set of two variables, the percentage of African American (Latino) school board members and the interaction of the use of ward elections with the percentage of minority school board members. The board members' variable by itself will reflect the efficacy of the omitted category, those elected in at‐large systems. The ward interaction coefficient will indicate the difference in efficacy between ward‐elected members and at‐large members. The regression equations will also control for other factors likely to affect the ethnic composition of school administrators or teachers. Specifically for black administrators, the equations will include the percentage of African American population in the district, a measure of education levels of the African American community (percentage of high school graduates), and the percentage of African Americans living in poverty. The Latino administrators equation will include the same measures but for Latinos."
"33"," Table 2 presents the results of these equations showing how well the respective variables affect the composition of school administrators. For African Americans, population is clearly the largest influence. The coefficient shows that a one percentage point increase in black population is associated with a .62 percentage point increase in black administrators, all other things being equal. Both education levels and poverty levels are significant in the predicted direction. For those systems with at‐large elections, an increase in African American school board members has no impact (the coefficient is positive but not different from zero) on the proportion of African American administrators. This lack of influence contrasts directly with the strong positive coefficient for African American school board members in ward‐based systems. For every additional one percentage point increase in black school board representation, these districts see an additional 0.27 percentage point increase in black administrators, all other things being equal. In short, school board representation is associated with greater administrative representation in systems with ward elections but not in those with at‐large systems. So even though black candidates are able to overcome the disadvantages of at‐large elections in gaining school board representation, that representation is less effective than the representation provided by blacks selected from ward systems.         "
"34"," Table 2 presents a similar picture with respect to Latinos. Again population is the strongest single determinant of Latino administrators, but the impact is less than one‐fourth the magnitude of the same coefficient for African Americans. School board representation in at‐large systems again is unrelated to the proportion of Latino administrators in a school district (the coefficient is negative but insignificant). Only those Latino board members elected in ward‐based systems are positively associated with more Latino administrators; a one percentage point increase in Latino board members in ward systems is associated with a .28 percentage point increase in Latino administrators, all other things being equal. The size of this relationship is virtually identical to the coefficient for African Americans. Both Latino education levels and poverty levels are related to Latino administrators in the predicted direction.15Figures 5 and 6 provide visual evidence of the interaction results shown in Table 2.         "
"35","                 Substantive Representation Effects for Latinos                      "
"36","                 Substantive Representation Effects for Blacks                      "
"37","Turning now to the ethnic composition of teachers, we should expect that school board influence is likely to be far less. School boards directly hire the chief administrator and are likely to have some say in hiring top level administrators. Teachers, however, are hired by administrators, by the superintendent in small districts or by a specialized personnel department in larger districts. The influence of school board members is likely to be via adopting policies or advocating affirmative action rather than direct hiring. To investigate the question of teacher representation, we use the same equation as in Table 2, but add the respective percentages of minority administrators to each equation.         "
"38"," Table 3 shows that black population and Black administrators dominate the equation for the percentage of black teachers. A one percentage point increase in African American population has a .26 percentage point increase on the percentage of black teachers, all other things being equal. A similar increase in black administrators translates to a .25 percentage point increase in African American teachers. For those representatives in at‐large systems, a weak positive relationship is apparent. A one percentage point increase in African American school board members is associated with a .081 percentage point increase in African American teachers. In ward systems the coefficients are insignificant which means that school board members in both systems have equal influence on teacher composition. This impact, however, is small and unlikely to generate any large changes in the composition of the teaching faculty.         "
"39","The relationship for Latino teachers corresponds with these findings. Both population and Latino administrators again are the most influential part of the equation, although the size of impacts for Latinos is smaller than for African Americans. Again the representation coefficient is small (.079) but significant. The significant intercept for wards predicts that such systems also have an additional 0.8 percent more Latino teachers overall (a modest difference). The basic conclusion is the same, however, direct representation impacts on the teaching faculty are the same for at‐large and ward‐based systems."
"40","The minuscule direct impact of minority school board members on minority teachers should be qualified, given there is likely to be substantial indirect influence. Because minority school board members strongly correlate with minority administrators and because minority administrators are the most significant influence on minority teachers, the composition of the school board can matter a great deal in terms of explaining the composition of the teaching faculty (see Polinard et al. 1994; Polinard, Wrinkle, and Longoria 1990). Because ward systems are substantially more effective in gaining administrative representation (which strongly influences teacher representation), they also produce higher overall levels of teacher representation.         "
"41","This study examines the potential double bias of electoral structures. The bias that at‐large elections have in terms of electing minority candidates, although well studied, is still a matter of controversy. The bias in the type of representatives that various electoral systems produce is relatively uncharted territory. Using Texas school districts, this study found that at‐large elections were associated with fewer minority school board members for Latinos but not for African Americans. The formal logic suggests that minorities can overcome the electoral biases of at‐large elections by positioning themselves at the median voter (that is, moving away from issues more likely to appeal to minority constituents). While such moves may increase electoral representation (although no more than in a ward system), they come at a cost of better substantive representation."
"42","More important than the electoral bias, the representatives produced under at‐large systems are less effective at pushing the minority group's agenda in one key area—hiring. They are associated with fewer minority administrators being hired which in turn results in fewer minority teachers in the classroom. An extensive literature shows that both African American and Latino teachers positively influence the educational experience of minority students. Minority students are less likely to be tracked into low status classes, more likely to be assigned to advanced and gifted classes, less likely to be disproportionately disciplined, more likely to pass standardized tests, more likely to not drop out and to graduate from high school, and more likely to score higher on college board exams when they are exposed to minority teachers (see Meier and Stewart 1991; Meier, Stewart, and England 1989; Meier, Wrinkle, and Polinard 1999; Meier et al. 2001; Polinard et al. 1994). The biases of election structure, therefore, are likely to reverberate through the entire education system and create additional biases in terms of gaining access to quality education.         "
