"1","Existing research identifies several country‐ and dyad‐level factors that influence how and when civil wars end. Expected utility models of war, for example, suggest that the chances of victory, costs of war, and relative payoffs from winning versus settling all influence war outcomes (D. Cunningham, Gleditsch, and Salehyan 2009; Mason and Fett 1996; Mason, Weingarten, and Fett 1999; Walter 2002). Others focus specifically on factors expected to prolong conflict. Lootable resources, for example, make conflict profitable, and thus, difficult to terminate (Collier 2000; Lujala 2010; Ross 2004; Collier, Hoeffler, and Söderbom 2004). Commitment problems also prolong civil wars, even when both sides prefer settlement as fear of exploitation undermines the ability of combatants to lay down weapons (Fearon 1994a; Fearon 2004; Walter 2002). Existing research shows that third party enforcement (Walter 2002) and power‐sharing provisions (Hartzell and Hoddie 2003; Hartzell and Hoddie 2007; Mattes and Savun 2009) can ameliorate commitment problems, facilitating settlement.         "
"2","These theories provide important insights into the determinants of civil war termination at the country and dyad level. Because they treat rebel and state combatants as unitary actors, however, they provide little insight into how leaders influence wartime dynamics.2 This is a critical oversight as the data collected for this project show that 35% of all civil war leaders are punished as a result of war. Given this high level of vulnerability, it is likely that leaders take the threat of punishment seriously as they make wartime decisions. And if the threat of punishment influences leaders’ decisions, then our theories about civil conflict should also account for leaders’ expectations of punishment. Failure to do so renders existing explanations inaccurate.         "
"3","Take, for example, Colombia's conflict against the EPL. This dyad was characterized by several factors shown to decrease the prospects for settlement, including imbalanced military power, other ongoing dyads, lack of third‐party mediation, and no rebel political wing (D. Cunningham, Gleditsch, and Salehyan 2009; DeRouen, Bercovitch, and Pospieszna 2011; Walter 2009). Despite these obstacles, negotiated settlement was reached in 1990, just six months after two nonresponsible leaders, César Gaviria Trujillo and Anibal Palacios, took power.         "
"4","This example suggests that accounting for leaders’ incentives may improve our understanding of conflict outcomes. The following sections develop a theoretical argument which modifies existing models of conflict termination that rely upon a bargaining framework, by incorporating leaders’ incentives into the standard logic. Bargaining models suggest that war is costly, and as a result, there are strong incentives for termination. Information and/or commitment problems, however, constrain actors’ abilities to effectively bargain and end their conflicts. By relaxing the unitary actor assumption, the theory developed below advances the standard bargaining logic in two ways. First, it identifies an additional barrier to settlement by recognizing that conflict is costly for the group as a whole, but continued fighting may be less costly than peace for leaders who bear responsibility for the conflict. Second, the theory helps explain variation in commitment problems, one of the key barriers to civil war settlement (Walter 2002), by demonstrating that responsible leaders have more difficulty making credible commitments to peace.         "
"5","Existing research demonstrates that state leaders’ accountability to domestic audiences influences their wartime decision making (Bueno De Mesquita et al. 1999; Croco 2011; Goemans 2000; Weeks 2008). The critical question is whether rebel group structures allow internal audiences to similarly punish their leaders for policy failures.3 If so, poor war performance should threaten rebel leaders’ political survival and influence their wartime decision making.         "
"6","To answer this question, two issues must be considered: first, do rebel groups have identifiable leaders who exert effective control over policy, and second, can some constituency within the group coordinate to punish the leader for poor policy choices. The first of these questions can be answered by examining rebel groups’ organizational structures. Like states, rebel groups vary significantly in terms of their institutions and organization. Some, like UNITA and Liberia's NPFL, are clearly hierarchical, led by strongman, charismatic leaders with tight control and personalist tendencies. Others, like the JVP in Sri Lanka and the SNM in Somalia, have clear political structures headed by central governing bodies with an appointed or elected head who has final decision‐making authority. In both types of groups, a leader is identifiable and has clear political/military authority."
"7","Finally, there are some groups with less hierarchical, more cellular organizational structures. While control is less centralized, these groups still often have identifiable central leadership bodies that exert moderate control over activities of the group's constituent cells. For example, leaders of the OPM in Indonesia, despite the group's loose organizational structure, were able to establish group policy (Elmslie 2002). Ultimately, only a very small number of rebel groups lack clear leadership hierarchies (e.g., Algeria's Exile and Redemption or Libya's NTC in the first weeks of conflict) because they are made up of truly autonomous cells or uncoordinated mass movements.4"
"8","Regardless of organizational characteristics, rebel leaders in any group must maintain the support of group elites in order to maintain power. Leaders are vulnerable to punishment if the group's political/military elite enjoy a degree of autonomy from the leader; that is, if the leader does not control appointments and promotions within the group, or if high‐ranking rebels’ fates are not tied to the leader's (Geddes 2003; Weeks 2008). Elites who lack such autonomy cannot credibly threaten to punish the leader as their own fates are directly tied to his (Weeks 2012).         "
"9","In practice, different rebel group structures facilitate different types of punishment. Leaders of dispersed, cellular organizations, when punished, often lose power as factions within the group break off, causing the locus of power within the organization to shift to a rival. This happened when power shifted away from the OPM's first leader Seth Rumkorem toward his rival Jacob Prai as a result of a split in the organization (Szajkowski 2004). Punishment in more hierarchically organized rebel groups, on the other hand, can occur via institutionalized processes like elections or via “extra‐legal” processes like coups. Top commanders of Palipehutu‐FNL in Burundi, for example, ousted rebel leader Cossan Kabura in a 2001 bloodless coup (Agence France Press, Feb. 23, 2001), while groups such as the ONLF in Ethiopia, SNM in Somalia and ABSDF in Myanmar all held party congresses during which leaders were voted out of power. Even personalist leaders are not immune to fears of punishment. Evidence suggests, for example, that UNITA elites were not dependent upon leader Jonas Savimbi for their positions within the organization, but were instead elected at Party Congresses, and that organizational power therefore did not derive directly from loyalty to Savimbi (James 1992).         "
"10","This brief discussion suggests that the vast majority of rebel groups have organizational structures that provide opportunities for leader punishment. More generally, in the data collected for this project, approximately 22% of rebel leaders are punished internally as a result of war. This percentage is remarkably similar to that for state leaders (19%), suggesting that both rebel and state leaders face a nontrivial threat of punishment from their internal audiences."
"11","State and rebel leaders also face an additional threat, deriving from the fact that combatants share a single national territory, fight in close proximity to their bases, and frequently employ leadership targeting strategies during civil war. Specifically, leaders are often punished by their wartime opponent, or adversary elite. The adversary elite includes the political/military leadership of the wartime opponent—those with decision‐making authority on issues of security and justice during and after war. These elites decide whether to directly target their opponent's leadership through attempts to kill, capture, or imprison top opponents.         "
"12","Opponent‐based punishment is a serious threat to leaders in civil war as punishment meted out by the adversary is often severe. Victor Polay Campos of MRTA in Peru, for example, was captured by government forces in 1992 and sentenced in 2006 to 32 years in prison (Szajkowski 2004). More generally, 36% of rebel leaders are punished by their opponents, and state leaders too can be punished quite severely by rebel forces. President Premadasa of Sri Lanka, for example, was assassinated in an LTTE suicide bombing in 1993 (Szajkowski 2004).5 Civil war leaders thus have incentives to avoid punishment from two distinct sources: internal audiences and adversary elites.         "
"13","To account theoretically for leaders’ incentives, it is useful to conceptualize the leader‐constituency relationship in terms of a principal‐agent framework, in which constituents are the principal and the leader their agent.6 This highlights several characteristics of the relationship. First, leaders have interests independent of those of the groups they represent, primary among which is political survival and physical safety. Second, leaders enjoy private information regarding their own level of competence/faithfulness in executing the war and battlefield/negotiating table information.7 Finally, members of the internal audience prefer a leader who is competent and pursues the group's best interests as they fare better personally under these conditions. Internal audiences thus have incentives to punish an incompetent leader; removal improves prospects for success in war and deters leaders from acting against group interests in the future. However, because leaders have private information regarding their type, internal audiences cannot know, with certainty, whether a leader is competent or not.8 Audiences must assess leader competence and decide which leaders to punish, using cues provided by observable conflict outcomes and the leader's responsibility for the decision to go to war.9"
"14","Observed war performance provides evidence regarding the leader's type; failure to achieve stated goals suggests incompetence, while success indicates the opposite. However, the relationship between leader decisions and war outcomes is imperfect. A variety of stochastic factors likely influence the course of conflict, and because the internal audience cannot directly observe the leader's decisions, constituents cannot be certain how much blame to attribute the leader for the war's trajectory."
"15","Constituents, therefore, turn to a second source of information to help distinguish competent from incompetent leaders. Specifically, the leader's connection to the original decision to go to war, or responsibility for the war, shapes the internal audience's assessment of leader competence. Constituents will attribute responsibility for a conflict to two types of leaders: (1) those in power at the conflict's start (first leaders), and (2) those who come to power during the war (replacement leaders) and have political connections to the decision to fight. First leaders are responsible because they directly preside over the transition from peace to war,10 while replacement leaders who share political or familial connections with the first leader inherit responsibility because such connections imply influence over the decision to fight.11 Leaders who inherit an ongoing war upon coming to power but share no ties with the first leader, on the other hand, can concretely avoid affiliation with the decision to go to war, thereby more easily avoiding the “incompetent” designation should the war go poorly.         "
"16","Thus, by linking blame for war outcomes to responsibility for war involvement, internal audiences can distinguish leaders whose bad choices caused war losses (incompetent agents) from those who made sound policy choices but were undermined by the poor decisions of previous leaders (competent agents).         "
"17","Internal audiences’ use of responsibility for the war as a cue to identify incompetent leaders has implications for leaders’ expectations of punishment and their subsequent conflict behavior. Specifically, leaders deemed responsible are more likely to be punished for poor war performance than their nonresponsible counterparts. Internal audiences will judge the former incompetent while sparing the latter from the same fate."
"18","This implies that variation in the expectation of punishment for these two leader types drives variation in their expected utilities for termination. Responsibility for the war makes compromise costly as adopting a conciliatory strategy involves reneging on promises made at the war's start. Even moderate losses earn responsible leaders the “incompetent” designation. This suggests that leaders deemed responsible for the war have a low utility of termination for anything less than victory as victory is the only way to ensure political and physical survival. Responsible leaders therefore have incentives to continue a losing war rather than settle; continuation provides the opportunity, however remote, to turn the tide, achieve victory, and forestall punishment. In other words, the expectation of punishment creates perverse incentives for leaders who bear responsibility for the war to become unfaithful agents and “gamble for resurrection” (Downs and Rocke 1994; Goemans 2000).12"
"19","The logic of this strategy is straightforward. Leaders update their beliefs about the likely outcome of the war as information comes in from the battlefield and the negotiating table. As the likelihood of victory decreases, responsible leaders become increasingly assured of punishment as internal audiences judge them incompetent. Facing near certain punishment, these leaders have nothing to lose by continuing the fight; while victory may not be likely, it remains possible if conflict continues. Settling on compromise terms, on the other hand, renders victory impossible and punishment likely. Responsible leaders therefore will go against the interests of their constituents and continue the conflict because the additional risk of punishment for doing so is marginal while the potential payoff, should they succeed, is high. In contrast, nonresponsible leaders lack incentives to gamble for resurrection when faced with the prospect of compromise because their risk of punishment for such an outcome is low.13"
"20","The above discussion suggests that responsibility for the war increases incentives to gamble for resurrection. Importantly, this incentive to gamble exacerbates commitment problems with the adversary, suggesting that commitment problems, a central cause of civil war persistence (Fortna 2004; Mason et al. 2011; Quinn, Mason, and Gurses 2007; Toft 2009; Walter 2002; Walter 2004), vary in severity by leader. Specifically, leaders deemed responsible are less able to commit to ending the war or implementing settlement deals, as the settlement process threatens their political and physical survival.         "
"21","Recognizing that leaders who are highly vulnerable to internal punishment are unable to commit to ending the war, adversary elites will have strong incentives to try to remove them from power in the hope that a less vulnerable (i.e., nonresponsible) leader takes over.14 These incentives derive from the fact that adversary elites prefer an opponent leader who can make credible commitments to peace. Failed settlement attempts and conflict recurrence, the consequences of an inability to commit, are costly for the adversary's leadership as they increase their own political insecurity (Toft 2009; Walter 2002). Opponent elites are likely to suffer political costs if settlement overtures are rejected or break down during implementation (Huth and Allee 2002). Megawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia, for example, lost elections in 2004 after negotiations with GAM failed: the opponent's inability to commit undermined Sukarnoputri's approval, resulting in loss of power. While adversary elites will not always be interested in pursuing peaceful resolution, they will prefer an opponent who can uphold promises made during negotiations, should the opportunity to settle arise.         "
"22","It follows that internal incentives to gamble for resurrection actually exacerbate the threat of adversary‐inflicted punishment. Adversary elites will seek to remove responsible leaders—those with incentives to gamble—in order to facilitate termination and deter recurrence. Paradoxically, the adversary's incentive to target a responsible leader reinforces that leader's incentives to avoid compromise. Leaders in these circumstances will avoid demobilization or contact with the opponent (e.g., Kony in Uganda) as such steps increase vulnerability (Prorok 2013).15 Even attending negotiations in a neutral location does not preclude punishment; Ghassemlou, a responsible leader of the KDPI, was assassinated by Iranian agents in July 1989 during negotiations in Austria. Facing such threats, responsible leaders will avoid settlement, seeking victory and personal security guarantees to ensure their own survival.         "
"23","Because nonresponsible leaders have fewer internal incentives to avoid settlement deals, they face lower expectations of adversary‐inflicted punishment. These leaders are therefore more trustworthy negotiating partners, and the adversary will be more willing to envisage a postconflict scenario in which they remain prominent political figures. The Democratic Republic of Congo's treatment of two CNDP leaders clearly illustrates the different strategies adopted when facing responsible versus nonresponsible opponent‐leaders. President Kabila made a deal with Rwanda to have CNDP founder and responsible leader Laurent Nkunda arrested in January 2009. Just two months later, Kabila signed a peace deal with Nkunda's replacement, nonresponsible leader Bosco Ntaganda, offering him a generalship in the new national army. Avoiding responsibility for the war affords a leader greater flexibility to settle with the opponent on compromise terms without the imminent threat of adversary‐inflicted punishment."
"24","The above discussion suggests that leaders who bear responsibility for the war will gamble for resurrection rather than settling when faced with dwindling prospects for victory. As a result, they will achieve victory more often than their nonresponsible counterparts, who would have settled on compromise terms when the hope of victory diminished. Having stronger incentives to win, however, does not necessarily translate into victory. Factors such as relative strength, resolve, and strategy impact which gambles succeed, and some groups will end up worse off than they were before. This suggests the following:            "
"25","Leaders viewed as responsible will also be unwilling to make concessions to end the war as their fates are closely tied to the goals they establish at the conflict's start. Compromise on central war aims will be viewed as evidence of the responsible leader's incompetence, increasing the likelihood of punishment.16 Nonresponsible leaders, on the other hand, will be unlikely to gamble for resurrection when prospects for victory decline as they can distance themselves from the first leader's original aims. This reduces the threat of internal and adversary‐based punishment, thereby allowing for compromise.            "
"26","The above hypotheses are tested using original data on rebel and state leaders in all civil conflict dyads (1980–2011) in the Non State Actor Dataset (D. Cunningham, Gleditsch, and Salehyan 2013). A rebel leader is identified as the individual who exerts ultimate decision‐making authority over major group policies. Thus, individuals are coded as leaders if they hold the highest‐ranked position within the group or if sources agree that they are the key power holder in the organization, setting policy for the group. A full discussion of coding rules for identifying rebel leaders, including examples, is included in the online Supplementary Information, pages 1–6.17 Data on state leaders was adapted from the ARCHIGOS data set (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009), which provides information on all state leaders from 1875 to 2004. ARCHIGOS defines leader by emphasizing power over title, excluding figureheads. As such, this definition corresponds well with the criteria established to identify rebel leaders. Because these data are updated only through 2004, additional research was done to identify state leaders between 2005 and 2011.         "
"27","The resulting data set includes 1,279 state and rebel leaders in 331 civil war dyads (384 conflict episodes). Of these, 758 (59.27%) are state leaders and 521 (40.73%) are rebel leaders. The combatant groups in the data set range from having 1 to 12 wartime leaders. These leader‐level data were used to create a group‐level data set for analysis, which includes one observation per combatant, per dyad and uses information on the leader in power at termination. Tests of the punishment mechanism presented below use the full leader‐level data set.         "
"28","Empirical analyses of civil war generally group outcomes into broad categories, including military victory, negotiated settlement, truce or treaty, and low activity, coded at the conflict or dyad level (Brandt et al. 2008; DeRouen and Sobek 2004; Kreutz 2010; Mason and Fett 1996; Mason, Weingarten, and Fett 1999; Toft 2009). While intuitive, these broad categories are inappropriate for the current project, which argues that leaders are likely to refuse settlement on terms that leave them open to punishment. Testing this proposition requires identifying the favorability of a given outcome for each combatant involved. Broad categories, such as negotiated settlement and low activity, mask important variation in favorability that may critically affect a leader's expectation of punishment.            "
"29","For example, Mauritania and POLISARIO signed a peace agreement in 1979, in which Mauritania renounced claims to Western Sahara, recognized POLISARIO as the Saharawi people's representative, and agreed to withdraw troops from disputed territory. Simply coding “negotiated settlement” fails to capture the fact that this agreement was favorable for POLISARIO but unfavorable for Mauritania.18 Importantly, a leader who bears responsibility for the war should willingly settle for the terms received by POLISARIO, but should be unwilling to settle for those received by Mauritania. Simply coding a negotiated settlement therefore generates indeterminate predictions regarding the impact of leader responsibility on outcomes.19 Existing outcomes data is therefore not ideally suited for use in the current analysis.            "
"30","I instead develop a new coding scheme for war outcomes that scores the favorability of the outcome for each actor, relative to its original war aims and the prewar status quo, on a seven‐point scale from 3 (total victory) to ‐3 (total loss). Detailed coding rules are presented in the online Supplemental Information, pages 9–16. I then create a dummy variable for Extreme Outcomes, which is coded 1 if the actor achieves all war aims (total or major victory) or suffers a total defeat, and zero otherwise. This dummy variable captures all instances in which a group either achieves all war aims or achieves no aims and is militarily defeated.20 Two‐hundred thirty‐six combatants (39%) experience extreme war outcomes. This coding scheme overcomes the limitations in existing measures discussed above. Returning to the Mauritania example, what was previously coded a negotiated settlement for both actors is now coded a major victory for POLISARIO and a major defeat for Mauritania.21"
"31","Testing H2 requires a measure of whether or not a group makes concessions at termination. While conflicts that end through negotiated settlement generally involve concessions‐making by at least one party, the measure developed here is novel because it identifies which actors make concessions to end the conflict. Specifically, groups are identified as making concessions if they explicitly compromise on central issues at stake in the war. Explicit compromise is coded if the group makes a direct statement conceding on central war aims, or if it signs an official settlement agreement through which it implicitly gives up central goals. Antonio Bento Bembe of FLEC‐R, for example, signed a peace agreement with the Angolan government in 2006 through which he officially recognized Angola as a unitary and indivisible state, thereby implicitly renouncing separatist claims for control over Cabinda. The concessions variable is coded 1 if the leader makes concessions on central issues at stake in the war, and 0 otherwise. One hundred twenty‐eight groups (21%) receive a 1 for concessions."
"32","Leader responsibility for the war is measured as a dummy variable, coded 1 if the leader is responsible, and 0 otherwise. All first leaders, those in power at the conflict's start, are coded responsible.22 Additionally, replacement leaders with direct political connections to the first leader are considered responsible. Responsibility transfers along political party lines in democracies (Cotton 1986), and to family or political inner circle members in nondemocracies (Croco 2011). Replacement state leaders are therefore considered responsible if, at the war's start, they are members of the first leader's (1) political party, (2) cabinet or political/military inner circle, or (3) family. Ali Hussain Kafi, for example, was the second leader in Algeria's conflict with the MIA/FIS/AIS. Kafi is considered responsible because he was one of five members of the High Committee of State, Algeria's collective presidency, under first leader Mohammed Boudiaf.            "
"33","For rebel leaders, responsibility transfers to replacement leaders who are cofounders of the organization, family members of the first leader, or who hold high‐level positions within the rebel group at the conflict's start. These connections are expected to generate attributions of responsibility analogous to those experienced by replacement state leaders. The key factor, as with state leaders, is the replacement leader's position within the organization at the conflict's start, and therefore, his connection to the decision to fight. Second leader of FRETLILN Nicalau Lobato is coded responsible as he was a founding member of the organization and its Vice President under Xavier do Amaral during the conflict's first two years."
"34","Finally, leaders are coded as nonresponsible if they inherit an ongoing war and (1) share no political or familial ties with the first leader, and (2) held no position of power within the rebel organization or state at the conflict's start. Based on these coding rules, 945 (75%) leaders are coded responsible, and 320 are not; among leaders in power at termination, 495 (80%) are responsible, and 122 are nonresponsible. Additional details on the coding rules for this variable are presented in the Supplementary Information, pages 6–9."
"35","Several alternate specifications of responsibility are included in the Supplementary Information, including a three‐category variable, interactions with tenure and battle deaths to assess whether responsibility's impact diminishes over time or as costs grow, and alternate codings based upon different conventions for conflict start dates. I also recode leader responsibility to account for whether or not the first leader was personalist. In personalist regimes, the leader successfully limits his “supporters’ influence on policy and personnel decisions” (Geddes 1999, 123). This has direct implications for leader responsibility as the key to transferring responsibility from one leader to the next is the perception that the new leader influenced the decision to initiate conflict. In regimes organized around a single strongman, audiences may attribute sole responsibility to the first leader, sparing replacement leaders even if they held high‐ranking positions at the conflict's start. Results for all of these robustness checks are consistent with the main results and are discussed in the Supplementary Information (Figures C–E).            "
"36","Several factors found to influence conflict outcomes in existing literature are controlled for, including combatants’ relative strength, number of conflict dyads, duration of rebel alliances, mediation, third‐party intervention, the incompatibility (territory versus government), leader wartime tenure, rebel political wing, and democracy (D. Cunningham, Gleditsch, and Salehyan 2009; Gent 2008; Regan and Aydin 2006; Thyne 2012; Walter 2002; Akcinaroglu 2012). Measurement information and results for these controls are discussed in the Supplementary Information as are models including additional controls for conflict duration, casualties, and natural resources.            "
"37","This section reports the results of logistic regression analyses run on the group‐level data set discussed above. Robust standard errors are clustered on the dyad to account for nonindependence across observations.23 Models 1 and 2 in Figure 1 present the results for Extreme Outcomes and Political Concessions, respectively. Coefficient estimates are represented by a dot, while 95% confidence intervals are represented by lines surrounding each point estimate. Confidence intervals that do not cross zero indicate significance in a two‐tailed test at a p‐value of 0.05. Control variables generally behave as expected, and due to space constraints, are discussed in the Supplementary Information. Model 1 demonstrates that leader responsibility for the war significantly increases the likelihood of extreme outcomes, supporting H1, while Model 2 indicates that leader responsibility significantly decreases the likelihood of political concessions. As predicted (H2), leaders who bear responsibility for the war are significantly less likely to concede on central issues to end the conflict.         "
"38","To demonstrate the substantive impact of leader responsibility, Figure 2 presents predicted probabilities and first differences for extreme outcomes and political concessions when moving from nonresponsible to responsible leaders, holding all controls at mean or modal values.24 As Panel A shows, the likelihood of an extreme outcome increases from 13% to 54% when moving from nonresponsible to responsible leaders. Conversely, the likelihood of concessions falls from 39% to just 12% when moving from a nonresponsible to a responsible leader. First differences presented in Panel B show that the probability of an extreme outcome increases by 41 percentage points (315%) when moving from a nonresponsible leader to a responsible leader (left‐hand side), while the probability of concessions decreases by 27 percentage points (69%) when moving from a nonresponsible to a responsible leader (right). These first differences are both significant at a p‐value of 0.05 as indicated by the 95% confidence intervals surrounding each. They are also substantively meaningful, exerting an influence on par with key control variables, such as mediation and relative strength (see discussion in Supplementary Information).         "
"39","Substantive Impact of Leader Responsibility"
"40","Note: 95% Confidence Intervals Reported                     "
"41","Several robustness checks provide further support for these results. First, separate rebel and state analyses and a bivariate probit model show that the results hold for both rebel and state combatants, and when accounting for correlations across outcomes within dyads (Supplementary Information Figure/Table A). Second, the results hold for replacement leaders only, suggesting that the results are not simply an artifact of the difference between first and replacement leaders (Supplementary Information Table C). Third, the results are robust to alternative specifications of the dependent variables (Supplementary Information Figure B) and of leader responsibility (Supplementary Information Figure C). Interactions of responsibility with tenure and with battle deaths (Supplementary Information Figures D and E) show that even in long, costly wars, responsibility still impacts how a leader will end his or her war. The results are also robust to inclusion of additional controls, including conflict duration, casualties, and natural resources (Table I in Supplementary Information). Additionally, to ensure comparability to existing war outcomes analyses, the Supplementary Information presents results using a traditional outcome measure coded 1 for negotiated settlement, 2 for military victory, and 3 for low activity. I expect negotiated settlement to be less likely than victory when responsible leaders hold power, and Table B in the Supplementary Information confirms this expectation. These results draw a clear link between the article's main results and existing war outcomes research."
"42","Finally, model fit diagnostics indicate that the models presented above are well‐specified, performing better than baseline models excluding leader responsibility. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) statistics help assess model quality, with lower scores indicating better performance. The baseline Extreme Outcome model's AIC is 693, but drops to 634 in the model of interest, while BIC decreases from 736 to 681. The same occurs for the Concessions model (AIC from 506 to 469, BIC from 550 to 517). Each model's percentage correctly predicted increases with the addition of leader responsibility, and ROC scores also increase from 0.73 to 0.79 for Model 1 and from 0.78 to 0.81 for Model 2."
"43","Overall, these results provide strong support for the article's central hypotheses. However, they tell us little about the underlying casual mechanism: Does the threat of punishment drive leaders’ wartime decision making? If the theoretical argument is plausible, responsible leaders should be more likely than nonresponsible leaders to face punishment when they perform poorly in war (Hypothesis 3)."
"44","This hypothesis is tested using original data on the fate of each leader in the data set.25 Leaders can be punished by internal audiences or wartime opponents, and punishment can take a variety of forms. The analysis uses a dummy variable, coded 1 if the leader experiences any of the following as a result of the war: (1) major fractionalization of the group, (2) loss of political power/office,(3) exile, (4) imprisonment, or (5) death.26 Punishment is only coded if a majority of sources agree that the war was an underlying or precipitating cause of punishment.27 Based on these coding rules, 415 leaders in the data set are coded as experiencing war‐related punishment.         "
"45","Because leader responsibility's impact on punishment is expected to be conditional upon war performance, testing H3 requires interacting leader responsibility with war performance. No existing data sets provide cross‐national information on civil war combatants’ performance over time.28 I therefore created an original measure of war performance at tenure end, coding each leader's performance as poor (‐1), status quo (0), or favorable (1).29 Poor performance is assigned to leaders who suffered significant setbacks on the battlefield or made substantial concessions. Status quo performance is coded if a group failed to gain, but also avoided military and political setbacks. Favorable performance is assigned to leaders who achieve substantial battlefield success and/or concessions. Three‐hundred‐fifty‐nine leaders (31%) receive a ‐1, 511 (45%) receive a 0, and 272 (24%) receive a 1. Controls for casualties, leader tenure, whether the leader is based abroad, term limits, and transitional leaders are included in this analysis.         "
"46","Logit results, as expected, show that the coefficient estimate for leader responsibility is positive while that for war performance is negative (Supplementary Information Table F). However, because these variables are interacted in a nonlinear model, neither sign nor significance can be discerned from coefficient estimates alone (Ai and Norton 2003). I therefore turn to first differences, presented in Figure 3, to determine the impact of responsibility on the probability of punishment, conditional on war performance. Figure 3 provides clear support for H3. Moving from the baseline nonresponsible leader to one who bears responsibility for the war significantly increases the likelihood of punishment if that leader's performance is poor or status quo. Responsibility for the war increases the likelihood of punishment for poor performers by 37 percentage points, while increasing the probability of punishment by 17 percentage points for status quo performers.

"49","Leader responsibility, however, has no significant impact on the likelihood of punishment if a leader performs well. Leaders who perform well have a low probability of punishment, with no significant difference between responsible and nonresponsible leaders. By confirming the underlying mechanism presented above, these results bolster the main results; leaders who bear responsibility for the war are indeed more sensitive to the threat of punishment, which, in turn, affects their termination decisions."
"50","If nonresponsible leaders are more likely to come to power when the war is going poorly, and are therefore more likely to make concessions, the observed impact of leader responsibility may be biased by endogeneity.30 It is possible that poor performance increases the likelihood of leader change. Less clear, however, is whether war performance systematically affects the responsibility of replacement leaders. An overview of the data indicates that leaders who lose office because of poor performance are often replaced by responsible successors, suggesting that endogeneity may not be a serious problem. Ne Win of Myanmar, for example, was replaced by Sein Lwin in 1988 after Win was forced to step down due to war‐related economic policies. Lwin, like Ne Win, bore responsibility for the war due to his high‐ranking post at the conflict's start.         "
"51","More generally, 49% of replacement leaders who came to power while the war was going poorly are responsible, compared to 48% who came to power under status quo or favorable conditions. These similar percentages suggest that replacement leaders coming to power while the war is going poorly are not systematically more likely to be nonresponsible. However, further testing is necessary to systematically rule out endogeneity bias. The Supplementary Information presents additional analyses addressing this threat to causal inference. Using events data from UCDP‐GED (Melander and Sundberg 2013) to create a monthly war‐performance measure, I find that poor performance does not significantly increase the likelihood of a nonresponsible leader taking power, thus providing further evidence that endogeneity is not a serious concern. Results are discussed in the Supplementary Information (Tables D and E).         "
"52","In early 1996, faced with a faltering peace process, a splintering organization, and an opponent intent on his capture, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi told UN representatives that he feared for his own well‐being, stating “Before I had prestige to protect me, but it is being lost” (Weigert 2011, 124). This candid statement from the usually unflappable leader provides a glimpse of what, I argue, is a pervasive concern underpinning the strategic decision making of rebel and state leaders during civil war. Fear of internal and opponent‐based punishment, and the desire to avoid it, influences the wartime decisions of leaders and, as a result, their groups’ war outcomes.         "
"53","This article argued that leaders’ incentives to retain political power and avoid punishment are important determinants of combatant wartime behavior, and further, leaders who bear responsibility for the war face a higher expectation of punishment following unfavorable outcomes than their nonresponsible counterparts. This threat of punishment results in a lower utility for settlement on unfavorable terms. Leaders who bear responsibility for the war, as a result, have perverse incentives to extend losing wars in a gamble for resurrection, ultimately leading to more extreme outcomes and unwillingness to make concessions."
"54","Empirical results demonstrate that leaders deemed responsible for war are significantly more likely to experience extreme outcomes and are less likely to make concessions to end conflict. Further, responsibility for the war significantly increases the likelihood that leaders are punished when they fail to achieve favorable outcomes. A variety of robustness checks and tests to address endogeneity provide strong evidence for the robustness of these results."
"55","This study has several important implications for scholarship on civil war and for policymakers working toward peaceful settlement of the world's internal conflicts. First, by focusing on leaders, this article demonstrates that existing explanations focused on dyad‐ or country‐level factors are valuable but incomplete. Rebel and state leaders have strong personal incentives to avoid punishment during civil war, and importantly, these incentives are independent of group‐level goals. At times, leaders’ incentives will eclipse conflict‐level factors, causing conflict trajectory to differ from that predicted by existing dyad‐ and country‐level theories. Thus, treating rebel groups and governments as unitary actors is a critical limitation in existing research, which this project overcomes as the first to examine leaders’ impact on civil war outcomes."
"56","Second, this project has implications for a variety of other civil war processes. Leader responsibility is likely to not only affect conflict outcomes, but also civil war duration, severity, and the likelihood of negotiations as responsible leaders will extend their wars, fight harder, and avoid making conciliatory gestures in the hope of avoiding punishment. Further, this project has important implications for theories of commitment problems in civil war; variation in vulnerability to punishment likely generates variation in the severity of commitment problems, with responsible leaders particularly likely to have difficulty making credible commitments to peace. This may, in turn, affect the sustainability of civil war settlements. This project, therefore, has implications for many aspects of civil conflict behavior."
"57","Third, this project makes important data contributions by developing an original data set of civil war leaders, 1980–2011. It provides information on leader tenure, responsibility, and posttenure fate. Additionally, it develops a novel coding scheme for war outcomes that accounts for the favorability of the outcome for each warring actor. These new data are compatible with leading data sets on civil war (i.e., UCDP and NSA), and can therefore be easily used in future analyses to examine leaders’ roles in a variety of conflict processes."
"58","Finally, this project has important implications for policymakers. It demonstrates the importance of rebel and state leaders in civil war settlement processes, showing that it is not just the political goals of the group that must be addressed, but also the personal security concerns of responsible leaders, in order to successfully end civil conflict. This implies that the international community's mediation efforts must address leaders’ personal security concerns in order to be effective. Conciliatory offers toward responsible leaders are likely to be unpalatable to a variety of domestic and international actors, however, suggesting that the very situations most in need of mediation are likely to be the most difficult cases to resolve. Thus, the ripest moments for civil war resolution may occur only once nonresponsible leaders take power."
