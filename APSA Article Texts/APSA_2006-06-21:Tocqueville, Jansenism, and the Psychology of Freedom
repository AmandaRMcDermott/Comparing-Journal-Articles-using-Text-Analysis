"1","Wolin identifies two psychologies at work in Tocqueville 's Americans, a Cartesian one and a Pascalian one (2001, 84–90). Both develop out of the equality of conditions or social equality that Tocqueville claims define American life. By equality, Tocqueville means “that all occupations, all professions, all titles, and all honors are accessible to all” (Aron 1998, 187). Equality, in other words, means that one's social status is never assured. Those who start life on the bottom have the opportunity to rise to the top and vice versa, for social classes are supposed to be fluid in their membership. Paupers in America always have the chance of entering the upper classes and the upper classes likewise can descend into poverty.1 Equality inspires a Cartesian disposition for two reasons. The first is that Americans tend to be overly reliant on their own judgment. The second reason, more prominent but not explicitly connected to Descartes in the text, is that the ideological commitment to equality encourages Americans to make sense of their lives through an abstract principle, apart from the world of space and time. The fundamental truth of existence, in other words, is deduced from an intellectually constructed category and not from empirical observation or experience. Americans, Tocqueville reports, view every experience they have through the prism of equality. It colors every interpretation they have of life and serves as an a priori truth.         "
"2","This abstract Cartesian self in turn gives rise to a Pascalian self, which functions as a binary opposite to the Cartesian self. While the Cartesian self is rational and abstract, the Pascalian self is centered on the passions and how humans emotionally experience their lives. It is born from the tensions that emerge when the abstract, Cartesian faith in equality confronts real life experience in the empirical world. According to Tocqueville, applying Cartesian equality to everyday life leads to all sorts of ambiguities and problems. Equality, after all, could lend itself to a variety of meanings. For example, it might be argued that equality only refers to equal political and legal rights. Others might interpret equality in a strict economic sense and demand that everyone have roughly the same amount of material goods. Moreover, there are certain definitions of equality that can never be fully realized in practice. Michael Walzer, for example, argues that strict economic equality is impossible. Even if everyone were given the exact same amount of money, they would use their money differently. Some would spend it; others would invest it, etc. In a very short time, economic inequality would exist (Walzer 1983, xi–xii). As will be shown, Tocqueville's democrats suffer from a similar problem; they too conceptualize equality in a manner unrealizable in the external world.         "
"3","Americans, Tocqueville contends, hold a robust notion of equality. They accept the definition that Aron attributes to Tocqueville, i.e., “that all occupations, all professions, all titles, and all honors are accessible to all” (1998, 187). However, they mistakenly deduce from this “equality of opportunity” definition of equality that everyone has equal value and is as good as everyone else. To some extent, Americans are correct in this supposition. Equality provides everyone with dignity in that each individual enjoys equal political status and equal rights, e.g., no one is born with legally sanctioned political or economic privileges such as extra voting privileges or tax exemptions. Incorrectly, however, typical Americans assume equal dignity entails that each individual be equal in all spheres and aspects of life, including ones that lie well outside the spheres of law and politics.2 Put another way, they generally do not distinguish between political equality, which involves civic status and formal rights powers, and social equality, which comes from social status and touches upon informal social relations. Like Walzer's strict socialism, however, the democratic commitment to social equality is unrealistic. Social status is often determined by personal attributes such as intelligence, physical appearance, financial savvy, etc., that are not distributed equally across the population. It is an inescapable fact that individuals have different attributes and talents, which will invariably translate into some individuals having more wealth and honor than others. The abstract American ideal of equality, therefore, is bound to be frustrated when it rubs up against the real world. Tocqueville thus concludes, “Democratic institutions awaken and encourage the passion for equality without ever being able to satisfy it entirely” (1961a, 204/DA, 198).3"
"4","This tension between the ideal of social equality and the fact of inequality is all the more damaging because of the constant competitions in which Americans find themselves (1961b, part II, chapter 13; Manent 1996, 60–64). According to Tocqueville, the very logic of equality leads to an intense battle for resources. Unlike aristocracies, democrats refuse to grant privileges to any class of individuals based solely on a specific characteristic, including wealth. As such, everyone is equally entitled to compete for society's riches and honors. By definition, therefore, the distribution of wealth in a democracy has to be an open competition for resources, as no one has any preordained rights to material wealth. Thus, by abolishing aristocratic privilege, democrats have almost no alternative for distributing wealth other than through a competition in which everything is up for grabs. This competition leads to an interesting paradox. Although the equality of conditions is responsible for creating this competition, the results of the competition will invariably offend notions of equality. At least, it will offend the vulgar notion of equality—equality in all respects—held by many democrats. By its nature, competition creates winners and losers, thus insuring people will not be equal in all respects. At the end of the day, some will have more money and a greater reputation than others. Equality, therefore, simultaneously socializes democrats to think they are as deserving as everyone else while paradoxically placing them in situations that will necessarily result in inequality (1961b, 144–45/DA, 537–38).         "
"5","Furthermore, the clash between the idea of equality and unavoidable real‐world inequality has profound non‐Cartesian psychological consequences, ones that make Americans strikingly similar to the miserable humans described by Pascal in his Pénsees. For one, Tocqueville thinks social equality simultaneously excites hope and anxiety in individuals. Given that social status is never assured, individuals can always hope they may soon climb the social ladder. At the same time, however, such equality can also lead to a nagging self‐doubt and persistent anxiety about social status, as one's fortunes can decline just as easily as they can rise. This uncertainty can be quite emotionally taxing, often resulting in weariness and bitterness (1961a, 204/DA, 198). The second passion to emerge from social equality is existential angst. For Tocqueville, the American preoccupation with social status is about more than money. It also involves fundamental questions of self‐knowledge; it touches upon their deepest existential anxieties and reflects upon their intrinsic worth. For democrats, central to the notion of equality is the idea that they are as good as everyone else. Indeed, equality is the primary source of their dignity as humans. Whenever they witness someone with more money, talent, etc., they believe their worth as a human has been demeaned. They thus insist that their artificial social status correspond to natural equality. The society‐wide competition for wealth, honor, and social status has tremendous existential consequences and cannot be easily dismissed by the citizens as unimportant and trivial. There is a lot at stake in such competitions, which is why Americans “are tired of the sight of even legitimate superiority” (1961a, 204/DA, 198). Notably, Tocqueville's Americans do not turn to freedom to affirm their natural dignity. This is probably true because people tend to value things less once they are available to everyone. As soon as something is widely accessible, it is no longer a means by which a person might gain distinction. When this is the case, people care less about it. Freedom in this respect is similar to literacy. As soon as literacy becomes the rule rather than the exception in a society, few people are proud of their ability to read and write and hence it is no longer a source of dignity. By contrast, equality as Americans define it is by its nature elusive.         "
"6","To be sure, Tocqueville also argues that Americans are plagued by financial anxieties and long for material comfort. Tocqueville argues in the “Three Races” chapter that in the midst of prosperity, Americans are terrified their social status will decline because “they feel they are getting poor because they are not getting rich as quickly as their neighbors, and they think they are losing their power because they have suddenly come into contact with a power greater than their own”4 (1961a 399–400/DA, 383). However, Tocqueville is careful not to decouple financial anxiety from the great question of self‐worth. When Americans lose out in market competition, “it is their feelings and passions that are hurt more than their interests” (1961a 400/DA, 383). Americans, apparently, fear self‐doubt more than poverty.         "
"7","Third, equality inspires envy and vanity.5 In Democracy, Tocqueville proclaims both that “democratic institutions to a high degree develop the sentiment of envy in the human heart” (1961a, 204/DA 198), and “the restless and insatiable vanity of democratic peoples is sustained by equality and fragility of social status” (1961b, 234/DA, 613).6 The fundamental conditions for both are readily identifiable in Tocqueville's America. First, to reiterate, Americans enter public life with the expectation that they are as good as everyone else. Second, the institutions responsible for distributive justice, the market, compel individuals to constantly compare themselves with their peers in high‐stakes contests in which there will be by definition winners and losers. In addition to this tension, individuals are motivated to care about market competitions and interpersonal comparisons: their financial security and human dignity is on the line. As a consequence, Americans must constantly be attuned to how they compare with their peers and what other people think of them.7 It is therefore understandable why Americans are vain, self‐conscious, and envious. They always have to reflect upon who they are and how they stack up with their peers. And, if they don't measure up, their frustrations will turn into envy once they glimpse the successes of another.         "
"8","This explains, moreover, why Americans have an uneasy relationship with talent. The context surrounding the “democratic institutions to a high degree develop sentiments of envy …” quotation makes this clear. Tocqueville makes the claim while contending that Americans tend to vote for mediocre political leaders because they feel threatened when confronted by individuals with powerful intellects and stirring eloquence. Instead of searching for the best candidate, Americans cannot help but view elections as a referendum on their self‐worth and natural equality. They are yet another reminder that some persons are better than others. Political elections, in short, are just another game in the society‐wide competition that results in discomforting inequality.8 In this passage, we also learn that Americans have developed some important coping mechanisms to help deal with the cognitive dissonance born of the conflict between the expectation of complete equality and the brute fact of inequality. Americans, Tocqueville observes, have become adept at ignoring talent. They shun not only impressive politicians, but all intellectuals. They think general notions of common sense always yield incisive or at least adequate analysis and can be expected to generate a proper solution to a problem (1961b, Part I, chapter 1). This indeed is Americans at their most Cartesian. Through sheer power of abstract rationality, they think they can erase every trace of self‐doubt (Wolin 2001, 85–87).         "
"9","There is one more reason why equality aggravates vanity and envy. When everyone has roughly the same social standing and hence similar claims to public esteem, Tocqueville contends “pride becomes demanding and jealous” (1961b, 234/DA, 613).9 Democratic “sameness” results in the magnification of all differences. Little and seemingly unimportant advantages or idiosyncrasies thus take on tremendous importance. They can quickly alter one's social standing and force democrats to constantly take stock of the evaluations that others make of them. Moreover, rough equality also insures that such slight advantages are never enough to secure one's superiority. Again, as Tocqueville frequently remarks, social life in America is fluid. What elevates someone one day might easily denigrate him or her the next.         "
"10","There is, seemingly, an obvious intellectual solution that might help relax if not eliminate the tension between the Cartesian‐held abstract ideal of social equality and the inevitable fact of social inequality. Americans could be educated to revise their notion of equality to mean only equality of opportunity. In so doing, they could reconcile their ideology of equality to the fact of their existence. Getting all Americans to accept this, however, is easier said than done. Aside from intellectual limitations, i.e., the average person may not be able to handle a philosophical discussion of the meaning of equality; the Pascalian side of the American personality presents perhaps insurmountable emotional obstacles to accepting such an understanding of equality. Recall that for Tocqueville, Americans draw their feelings of self‐worth from the notion that they are equal. Every inequality they experience thus raises disconcerting existential questions and challenges their self‐worth. The notion of equality is constitutive of who they are; it is akin to God's grace for Pascal. To drain the existential importance of equality and make it simply a juridical or economic concept is impossible. The American identity is woven from the cloth of equal worth, not merely equal political rights and economic opportunities. Equality is the source of American dignity. Americans will thus inject existential meaning into any definition of equality, including the one in which equality means equal opportunity. Americans who believe that equality is simply equality of opportunity tend to be in the upper classes and embrace the definition for the same reason many Americans reject it; it says something about their worth as a person."
"11","Tocqueville's preoccupation with the emotional consequences of the desire for self‐worth shares much in common with the theme of diversions in the Pensées and is what ultimately makes his analysis Pascalian. Pascal, to be sure, isn't the only theorist to describe humans as vain and envious. Saint Thomas, for example, dedicates a question to the topic of envy in the Summa Theologica and even links it to social status and equality.10Francis Bacon likewise has a thoughtful discussion of the matter in his Essays, building off of Thomas's theory by detailing the sort of person who both excites and experiences envy.11 Yet, both only focus on the externalities of envy. They fail to explore the psychological depth of the problem and neglect to offer an explanation for the intensity of our emotional experiences. Through his analysis of human misery in the Pensées, Pascal accomplishes both of these tasks.         "
"12","According to Pascal, the human condition is wretched. Thanks to Adam, humans are plagued by “inconstancy, boredom, anxiety” (1976, fr. 127, 85). They are miserable and seek happiness. For Pascal, the problem of happiness is really a problem of salvation. Humans, at bottom, are completely consumed with their ultimate fate. “One needs to know oneself” (1976, fr. 66, 64), Pascal asserts, meaning it is necessary to know if God has bestowed his grace upon us. This question, however, is overwhelming and most lack the courage to ask it. So, we avoid it and spend our time distracting ourselves with stupid and pointless entertainments in a futile attempt to find happiness. We hunt, try to solve seemingly unsolvable algebra equations, best our companions at billiards—anything to avoid the great question of our existence. For Pascal, such diversions are “‘inauthentic substitute[s]’ for what men should really be doing—i.e., seeking God” (Broome 1965, 158). For only through Christ can humans know themselves and attain true happiness.         "
"13","Pascal's description of the human condition is chilling. Temporal life is defined by great questions of individual worth and ultimate fate from which there is no escape. Strategies of ignoring them through diversionary, trivial activities have to fail because questions of salvation and God's existence inspire anxiety and fear. These emotions are part of our condition because death is inescapable. We will all die one day but do not know what happens afterward. In replacing existential questions of salvation with trivial earthly questions like how to successfully kill a hare or solve a math problem, all we accomplish is investing these earthly activities with the same fear and anxiety we have about salvation and God's existence. Thus, the more humans try to make life meaningless, the more restless and anxious they become. Furthermore, humans cannot choose to give up their quest for self‐knowledge and salvation. If they do, they will slip into “the worst kind of unhappiness, which is ennui” (Broome 1965, 153). Inconstancy and anxiety, presumably, at least trump boredom. Pascal would be critical of certain variants of existentialism for exactly this reason. We cannot pretend death is absurd and that all meaning in life comes from life. For Pascal, the only attractive solution to the problems of existence is accepting God.         "
"14","Given this characterization of the human condition, Pascal is very capable of describing the intensity of an emotion like vanity. We intensely love ourselves and demand others do so because we attach to our meaningless earthly activities the emotional energy that comes from our fears of death and salvation, from the ultimate value of our lives. Otherwise trivial games of billiards thus come to have tremendous psychological importance. The opinions others have of us are endowed with all of our existential angst about the meaning of our lives. In short, we ask of our billiard partners what Pascal thinks we used to ask from religion. Thus, we think there is nothing finer than public recognition of our superiority, no matter how trivial the activity for which we are deemed superior. According to Pascal, “The sweetness of fame is so great that whatever we attach to it, even death, we love” (1976, fr. 158, 94). We would, in other words, be willing to forfeit life in exchange for the esteem of our peers. Love of fame can even stretch beyond the grave. Absurdly, humans spend incredible amounts of energy to secure the esteem of a few close neighbors. Even more absurd, humans cling to the hope that future generations will sing their praises, even though they will not be around to enjoy it (1976, fr. 148, 93).12"
"15","Upon first glance, Tocqueville might not appear to be a good candidate for a Pascalian interpretation. While he shared Pascal's religious anxiety, he could never bring himself to accept Pascal's faith.13 As his primary biographer reports, at the age of sixteen Tocqueville had an intellectual and spiritual crisis after reading Voltaire and Rousseau from which he never recovered (Jardin 1998, 62–63).14 Tocqueville became a skeptic and was never able to fully reclaim his Catholic faith. By the end of his life, he professed both “a desire to believe, and his incapacity for belief” (Jardin 1998, 512). Beyond this important difference, however, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that Pascal, and Jansenism in general, shaped Tocqueville's thought. First, his resigned agnosticism should not be interpreted as a complete rejection of Christianity. He deeply admired religion and thought it was crucial for a well‐functioning democracy. In a letter to Gobineau, he specifically defends Christianity and claims that he experiences a “profound emotion” when reading the Bible (O.C. 1959, 57).15 Second, there is a now famous letter to his cousin Kergorlay in which he professes to commune with Pascal, Montesquieu, and Rousseau each day (O.C. 1977, 418).16 This letter had taken on supreme importance for scholars because “Tocqueville was always so discreet about his readings—there are very few explicit references to other authors in his books and relatively few in his correspondence—it is hard to identify his sources” (Furet 1981, 135).17 Thirdly, his education, furnished by the Abbé Lesueur, had a decidedly Jansenist bent (Jardin 1998, 40, 42, 82, 182; Lamberti 1989, 48).18 Lastly, the subtle psychological insights and existential angst of the Jansenists, especially Pascal, are easily identifiable in Tocqueville's works, particularly Volume II of Democracy. Before writing Volume II, Jardin claims that Tocqueville reread both Pascal and Rousseau's Second Discourse, another secular book that borrows heavily from Jansenist psychology. So, just as Locke felt free to borrow the concepts and categories from Leviathan while rejecting Hobbes's conclusion that absolute government was the necessary solution to the problem of anarchy, Tocqueville mines Pascal for insights into human nature while never fully accepting his theological conclusions. In Democracy, Tocqueville's Americans, like Pascal's fallen humans, are eager to know themselves and their self‐worth. This process of coming to know themselves is a painful one that produces intense feelings of vanity, envy, self‐doubt, and anxiety. The great difference between the two is that for Pascal existential angst is a religious problem while for Tocqueville it is a sociological one stemming from the democratic ideology of equality.         "
"16","The Cartesian faith in the abstract ideal of equality and the resulting Pascalian self‐doubt and vanity are, for Tocqueville, a dangerous combination. Ultimately, they threaten the goal of freedom that lies at the heart of democratic life. When confronted with real‐life inequality, individuals have a few choices on how to react in order to protect their Cartesian ideology of equality. Manent suggests they can either improve themselves to compete more successfully or bring their superiors down to their level by insisting the state involve itself in market competition. According to Manent, the logic behind this latter move is that competitions are never truly fair and the state must redistribute wealth so everyone truly has an equal opportunity to succeed (Manent 1996, 61–63). In so doing, Manent thinks the state actually destroys freedom by creating an administrative despotism that paternalistically takes responsibility for even the most trivial parts of a person's life.19Lively advances two other possible solutions to this problem. The first is to hinder prospects for economic advancement through the establishment of rules regulating promotion, such as seniority. The model here appears to be labor unions. The other is to lower one's sights and seek only modest goals, which explains why democrats are so mediocre (1965, 78). As the old fable goes, the fox doesn't have to want the grapes.         "
"17","There is, however, one more possibility that neither Manent nor Lively consider—one that has more textual basis.20 Democrats can avoid the tension between the ideal of equality and the fact of inequality by shunning public life as much as possible. They can refuse to put their Cartesian, abstract faith in equality to an empirical test. If individuals take no existential adventures into public spaces, they will not be able to compare themselves with their superior neighbors and be confronted by real inequalities. Instead, they can let ideology do the work of actual experience and derive their self‐worth from abstract principle alone. Democrats are drawn to solitude, then, to preserve their notions of self‐worth. Upon achieving an almost solitary life, Tocqueville admits Americans can succeed in ameliorating their anxiety and vanity, as well as the cognitive dissonance created by the ideal of equality and the fact of inequality, and cultivate a calm and confident disposition. They can trade in their Pascalian self‐doubt for a serene, Cartesian certainty of their self‐worth.         "
"18"," Tocqueville labels this tendency towards social isolation “individualism,” which he believes is a uniquely democratic phenomenon. “Individualism” is contrasted with “egoism,” which is defined as the “passionate and exaggerated love of self which brings a man to relate all things only to himself and to prefer himself to all” (1961b, 105/DA, 506). Oddly, after describing democrats as envious, petty and materialistic, he suggests that egoism is typically a feature of aristocratic consciousness. Tocqueville thus provides two seemingly disparate characterizations of the American character. The first, reminiscent of Pascal, is the envious and vain American who cannot bring him‐ or herself to recognize the talent of another and is reduced to panic upon witnessing an individual who has amassed a greater fortune. The other, inspired by Descartes, is the individualistic creature of solitude who is able to convince him‐ or herself that he or she is as good as everyone else by defining him‐ or herself solely by the abstract principle of equality and avoiding real‐life comparisons with peers as much as possible. Both personalities, however, are cut from the same psychological cloth and are possible outcomes in democracies. In Democracy, Tocqueville does not predict whether the Pascalian side of the American personality or the Cartesian one will succeed in winning the battle for the American soul. He does tell us, however, the dangerous consequences that would follow from a Cartesian victory.         "
"19","If “individualism” triumphs over “egoism,” Tocqueville thinks freedom in America is finished. Those who succeed in hermetically sealing themselves off from their neighbors, as much they may recover inner tranquility, pay a terrible price. They forfeit their freedom by neglecting to govern themselves. For Tocqueville, Americans are not simply equal but also equally weak and vulnerable. The equality of conditions, Tocqueville argues, makes it impossible for the majority of Americans to survive the vicissitudes of life and the economic market without assistance. In Tocqueville's day, the American economy was productive but had yet to produce the abundance necessary to allow most Americans to be economically self‐sufficient. How Americans contend with this problem has tremendous implications for political freedom. Tocqueville thinks there are two forms of external assistance Americans can rely on to insure their survival. The first is private, locally based civic and political associations and the second is a full‐blown welfare state. If Americans choose the second option, Tocqueville warns, they will unwittingly trade their freedom for a seemingly mild yet soul‐crushing despotism. The welfare state is in Tocqueville's perspective little more than a nanny state that seeks to govern every aspect of a citizen's life, no matter how petty and trivial. As a consequence, Americans will slide into a “perpetual childhood,” incapable of becoming fully human. Their moral and intellectual development will be retarded, the passions in their souls deadened, and they will find themselves helpless and incapable of taking responsibility for their lives. All the while, they will embrace their tyrants as liberators and believe their chains to be freedom. For Tocqueville, this is a dangerous form of existence, mostly because the citizenry will be too blinded by apparent benevolence to notice the invisible violence being done to them."
"20","For Tocqueville, if Americans are to retain their freedom, they must choose to contend with their “weakness” by reaching out to their neighbors through civic associations. In Democracy, Tocqueville identifies several institutions that might encourage such behavior. Jury trials, the simple act of voting, and religion all pull Americans out of their self‐imposed solitude and goad them into public life. Without minimizing the importance of these other contributions, Tocqueville's primary solution is to reawaken the Pascalian tendencies of the American personality.         "
"21","To return to the distinction between “egoism” and “individualism,” Tocqueville contends “egoism” is the emotional fuel propelling individuals to quit their private hibernation and reenter public life. At some point in adult life, Tocqueville thinks some disturbance or annoyance will compel people to involve themselves in local politics. Private disputes between neighbors or businesses and private persons are inevitable, and the resolutions to these conflicts are generally handled politically at the local level. Once prompted to join the public sphere by some annoyance or dispute, Tocqueville thinks something very interesting happens to democrats. Their dormant vanity begins to reawaken and they become eager to attract the esteem of their peers. In the public sphere, this esteem can only be gained by serving the general interest. “When the public governs,”Tocqueville argues, “there is not a man who does not feel the prize of public goodwill and who does not seek to capture it by obtaining the esteem and affection of those among whom he must live” (1961b, 110/DA, 510). Thus, a new public spiritedness arises, though it is hardly motivated by virtuous intentions. Rather it is a product of “disguised pride” and sublimated egoism. Vanity, of course, isn't the only aspect of egoism that inspires democrats to engage in public life. Americans also come to realize that their own financial interest is connected to that of the state. Tocqueville asserts the American “sees the public fortune as his fortune, and he works for the good of the state, not only from duty or from pride, but, dare I almost say, from greed” (1961a, 247/DA, 237). In the famous chapter “How the Americans Combat the Effects of Individualism by Free Institutions,”Tocqueville baldly states, “It thus happens that ambition makes a man care for his neighbors, and in a sense, he often finds his self‐interest in forgetting about himself” (1961b, 110/DA, 510). Therefore, it is through vanity and egoism—traits commonly found among aristocrats—that Americans take responsibility for their political lives, which for Tocqueville is the essence of political freedom.21 Presumably, however, with the reawakening of their Pascalian selves, Americans will once again be tormented by anxiety, restlessness, and self‐doubt. The solution presented here, admittedly, is one Americans will hardly find appealing. As Tocqueville sees it, Americans are faced with a rather unfortunate dilemma. They can either have a political freedom driven by Pascalian egoism or a psychological tranquility promised by Cartesian individualism. They cannot, however, have both.         "
"22","At the same time, there is a danger that the American personality might become too Pascalian. Just as vanity may induce individuals to cooperate with their neighbors, too much of it can make such cooperation impossible. There is a zero‐sum logic to vanity that turns neighbors into enemies. Since social status is determined by comparison with others, it is only possible to raise one's own status at the expense of others. And, if this premise is valid, then helping others may very well have a negative impact upon one's own social standing. Moreover, if vanity becomes frustrated and turns to envy, then there might be incentives for individuals to endure hardships just so a rival also suffers.22 So, it is crucial for Tocqueville's Americans to retain some of their Cartesianism. To prevent vanity and envy from becoming too destructive, Americans ought not live entirely in the public sphere. They need a break from competing for societal esteem via pubic spiritedness. In short, at times they need the will to isolate themselves that comes from their Cartesian intellectual habits.         "
"23","For Tocqueville, therefore, American democracy can succeed only if Americans mildly identify with one another. Although it is necessary that they do not fully distrust each other or lack compassion, it is equally necessary that their ability to identify with one another is limited. They must achieve a delicate balance between vanity and a desire for isolation; the two tendencies must moderate each other. Pascal's victory over Descartes in the battle for the American soul must not be decisive. Fortunately, Tocqueville finds ample evidence that this balance has been achieved. He notes that although Americans can be counted on to help strangers in distress, those who assist the victim are not “profoundly interested in his fate,” and “if it be chance that their efforts to help are useless, they will immediately forget him and return to their own lives” (1961b, 184/DA, 572).         "
"24","Tocqueville's discussion of freedom represents a significant departure from the more famous Anglo ones, such as Locke's. His freedom is not chosen because it is rational or God‐given but rather results from a complicated psychology; one that is a careful mixture of self‐interest, vanity, and a desire for solitude. If Americans are to maintain freedom, it is not because of their ability to make rational calculations or identify strategies for ordering and maximizing their preferences. The passion for freedom can only be satisfied with the help of other passions. Moreover, freedom is not meant to fully satisfy needs of self‐worth and dignity. Rather, it will thrive only if such existential yearnings are partially unmet. Political freedom requires a certain degree of psychological discomfort."
"25","Tocqueville's psychological analysis of freedom raises several historical and philosophical issues. First, his relationship with Jansenism in general and Pascal in particular merits further elaboration. Tocqueville follows the Jansenists in deconstructing seemingly well‐intentioned behaviors and revealing the selfish motives that inspire them. Jansenism held that humans were thoroughly corrupted by the fall and could only enter heaven by a special gift of grace from God. To maintain this pessimistic view of the human condition, Jansenists had to explain away the existence of seemingly benevolent behaviors and emotions, such as charity and pity. They did so by carefully uncovering individual benefits that might be accrued by those who act charitably or make public shows of compassion. In both instances, Jansenists argued that individuals garner the esteem of their neighbors and gain a favorable reputation. The motives inspiring acts of charity are thus not selfless but actually selfish. Tocqueville deconstructs American civic virtue in a manner conspicuously similar to Jansenist deconstructions of charity and compassion. Ultimately, it is motivated by the desires for public praise and financial gain. Notably, vanity plays a prominent role in both the Jansenist conception of human nature and Tocqueville's assessment of the democratic condition. In addition, Tocqueville follows at least some Jansenists, including Pascal and Pierre Nicole, in arguing that selfishness and vanity can often imitate virtue and be redirected to serve the public good. To be sure, most Jansenists viewed vanity or amour propre in completely pejorative terms. They took seriously Augustine's dichotomy between the city of man and the city of God. One either loves this world, i.e., oneself, or God. Amour propre or love of self stood “in radical theological opposition to the love of God: it is incompatible with it and incapable of being compounded with it in any degree” (Levi, 1964, 221). Nevertheless, some Jansenists held that amour propre could be beneficial in the city of man. To return to a previous example, although acts of charity are usually motivated by vanity, they still work to maintain society (Hirschman 1977, 16–18; Keohane 1980, 275–311; Sedgwick 1977, 144–45). Tocqueville likewise believes the vice of vanity to be crucial for a thriving democratic society. Without it, democratic freedom would not be possible. Tocqueville departs from the Jansenists in his relative lack of concern for the City of God. Rather than viewing earthly competitions as dangerous diversions distracting humans from God, he benignly sees them as the stuff of American life. In this respect, Tocqueville is more reminiscent of Enlightenment‐era thinkers such as Bernard Mandeville, Giambattista Vico and Benjamin Franklin who also appropriated Jansenist psychological insights into their largely secular political theories.23"
"26","It is probably worth adding that Tocqueville also has an interesting relationship with Saint Augustine, the philosophical godfather to the Jansenists.24 Like some of his Jansenist descendents, Augustine was not completely dismissive of attempts to rechannel vices such as vanity for positive effects. His crediting love of glory for the rise of Roman civic virtue in City of God is remarkably similar to Tocqueville's claim that American freedom is built upon the bedrock of vanity and self‐interest. However, Augustine ultimately thinks attempts to rechannel vice are bound to fail. According to Augustine, Roman civic virtue resulted from a beneficial marriage between love of glory and freedom.25 To gain public honor and hence satisfy one's appetite for vanity, it was necessary to sacrifice one's own self‐interest to Rome. This consciousness became so powerful in the Roman imagination that citizens “despised their own affairs for the sake of the republic” (Augustine 1978, 165). Augustine cites Quintus Cincinnatus as a perfect exemplar of this consciousness. Growing up in poverty, Cincinnatus joined the military as a young boy and gradually rose through the ranks until he reached the pinnacle of his field, assuming the office of Roman dictator. Despite this success, when his term as dictator expired he resumed his life of poverty. For the Romans at this stage in their history, it would be inconceivable for a politician to take advantage of his position for personal gain. Such an act would lead to swift public censure and personal disgrace.         "
"27","As much as Augustine admired Roman republicanism, however, he thought it could never be sustained by love of glory for an indefinite period of time. Eventually, he surmises, love of glory will attach itself to other objects, such as wealth or domination or beauty. And once it does, freedom is the first casualty. At bottom, love of glory is a vice, not a virtue. Vice can befriend virtue, he thinks, but only for a short amount of time. In due course, vice will become impatient and overwhelm any attempt to rechannel it for good purposes. Ultimately, it is this phenomenon that was responsible for the decline of Rome and opened the door for the Goth invasion. The Romans, including leading thinkers such as Cicero and Sallust, foolishly thought love of glory was a virtue and lost sight of the fact that it was a vice that could be used for evil as well as good. When love of glory found new objects with which to attach itself, Rome was caught unaware and failed to realize it was collapsing under the weight of its own vice."
"28","Augustine would thus be highly critical of Tocqueville's attempts to ground American freedom and republicanism on the vice of vanity. As with Rome, he would contend that while America might thrive under this arrangement for a short while, inevitably their viciousness will catch up to them. Vanity and egoism, he would counsel Tocqueville, are hungry emotions that cannot be fed by love of public service alone. They will eventually feed at the trough of power and wealth. It is just too dangerous to depend on them to build a successful state.26"
"29"," Tocqueville's relationship with Augustine is further evidenced in his treatment of the Puritans, whom he credits with molding the spirit of the nation. As Kessler has argued, although America's founding political principles of freedom and equality can be traced back to New England Puritanism, the influence of the Puritans themselves on political life had, for the most part, receded by the time Tocqueville took his first steps on American soil in the 1830s (1961a, 438/DA, 712, appendix e; Kessler 1992, 785–89). The Puritans were driven by a devotion to God that made them religiously intolerant but civically minded.27 Truth and morality stood at the center of their political lives, which were founded upon their unwavering faith in the authority of the Bible. Tocqueville's Americans, conversely, were primarily Hamiltonian creatures of commerce. They were more materialistic than spiritual. Instead of looking to God and the Bible for truth, they looked to their own reason and majority opinion. They were not motivated by the just and good, but by the prospect of gain. They also lacked the civic commitment of the Puritans. Only occasionally did they pay attention to their neighbors. And when they did lend a neighborly helping hand, they did so not out of divine duty but because they thought such assistance was a means by which to advance their own interests. God‐given political rights, furthermore, were valued “less for their religious significance … than because they (Americans) benefited from them” (Kessler 1992, 788). In short, Tocqueville thought these new Americans were self‐centered and primarily focused on the city of man. Christianity did not disappear from the scene, but it was modified to support the worldly concerns occupying most Americans. For evidence of the demotion of spirituality in American life, one need only cite the newly found religious tolerance and the separation of church and state—two features of Tocqueville's America that would have horrified the Puritans. For Tocqueville, autre temps, autres moeurs.28"
"30","Tocqueville's Americans, I would argue, are similar to Augustine's Romans. By the 1830s, Tocqueville understood the days of deep religious piety in America had passed and were not likely to return. Americans, he thought, were at bottom creatures of vice. However, unlike Augustine's Romans, he thought they could do just fine in the city of man with minor cultural and institutional modifications. For its part, religion, and in particular Christianity, could remain an important force in American life if it accepted a secondary role and remained content with working behind the scenes; if, in short, it would be willing to moderate the new religion of commercialism rather than eliminate it. If it could not live with democratic materialism and insisted upon elevating the democratic soul to unrealistic levels, it would surely perish and democracy would fall along with it. Again, Augustine would interpret Tocqueville's views on these matters as a recipe for eventual failure and a dangerous capitulation to the city of man.29"
"31","Secondly, Tocqueville's adoption of Pascalian psychology ought to concern those who seek to turn him into the “patron saint of American communitarians” (Putnam 2000, 24), particularly by those taken in by the uncharacteristically optimistic language found in the section on civic associations.30 In that section, Tocqueville does state that through participation in civic associations “feelings and ideas are renewed, the heart enlarged, and the understanding developed only by the reciprocal action of men” (1961b, 115–16/DA, 515). This statement suggests the American personality can progress beyond its natural tendencies towards greed, vanity, and anxiety—that there is an antidote to the American condition. It is indeed tempting to read Tocqueville as a neo‐Aristotelian here. Although individuals join civic associations for the sake of survival, it might be argued they remain for the good life of sociability. Nevertheless, there are good reasons not to interpret the phrase “enlarging the heart” too romantically. Read in context of the rest of Democracy in America, it is unlikely civic associations greatly elevate the American soul or expunge vanity, anxiety, and acquisitiveness from the American heart. Given that civic associations were in full bloom by the time Tocqueville arrived on American shores, it is unlikely he thought Americans were in some transitional phase to a higher or nobler form of consciousness. Indeed, as Kessler has demonstrated, Tocqueville believed America was in a state of religious decline by the time of his visit and thought the divinely inspired civic‐mindedness of the early Puritans was a thing of the past. More importantly, he argued civic involvement is often motivated by either pride or naked self‐interest. Republican concerns do not eradicate self‐interest, vanity, and envy, but are in fact another expression of them. Furthermore, in the Souvenirs, Tocqueville explicitly rejects the idea that connecting vanity to some higher end will magically transform it. “Human vanity, without changing its nature,” he avers, “can give a variety of displays” (1964, 99/S, 78).31 Ultimately, the “enlarged heart” comment stands almost alone in a book that repeatedly characterizes the typical democrat (post‐Puritan) as guarded, anxious, incapable of greatness, and overcome by amour propre.32 As Löwith concisely puts it, Tocqueville depicts bourgeois man as “orderly but average, timid and egotistical” and motivated by the petty desires of “private comfort” (1991, 256–57). At best, the republican affection for the others and the collective promised by civic associations operates alongside the baser motives of envy, pride, and greed. It may occasionally inspire admirable actions, but in no way produces a “Grinch‐like” transformation of the democratic heart.33 Ultimately, Tocqueville does not hold a unified conception of the self. Equality induces all sorts of emotions in democratic man, some of which are contradictory. While it does inspire some compassion, “it [also] seems to have led them [democrats] to find new reasons to hate each other” (1961a, 8/DA, 15). There is no reason to privilege the most appealing traits of the democratic personality and assume they cancel out all the negative ones. At the end of the day, we may have to disabuse ourselves of the notion that freedom is some high‐minded affair, as well as the hope that Americans will be cooperative and strongly identify with each other.         "
"32","Finally, American life as described by Tocqueville is psychologically painful. Americans are restless, vain, full of self‐doubt, and always anxious about their social status. In short, Tocqueville thinks Americans are not happy. If Americans are mediocre, they are not sedate. In a nation that in part defines freedom as the “pursuit of happiness” and largely holds a utilitarian notion of ethics (i.e., seek pleasure and avoid pain), maintaining freedom may well prove frustrating. Americans tend to have an exalted view of freedom and democracy and expect much from them. Such lofty expectations, if Tocqueville is right, will inevitably result in disillusionment."
