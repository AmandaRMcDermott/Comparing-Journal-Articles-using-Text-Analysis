"1","Germany after 1969 is a good illustration of how coalition governments are formed as a result of free‐style bargaining among the parties. The Basic Law does not provide any guidance about how electoral results should affect government formation or about the role of the parties in the latter process."
"2","In the election to the Bundestag on September 28, 1969, the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) received 242 seats together (192 and 50, respectively), the Social Democrats (SPD) 224, and the Free Democrats (FDP) 30. The National Democratic Party (NDP) received 4.5% of the votes, less than the 5% hurdle, and thus, they remained unrepresented."
"3","As soon as the election results were disclosed, early in the evening of election day, the CDU/CSU, having obtained the largest number of seats, started pondering whether to open formal negotiations to form a majority government coalition with the SDP or the FDP. On the other side, the SPD with its 224 seats (up from 202 in the past legislature) immediately invited the FDP to form a coalition. The FDP, with a slim 5.8% of the votes, suddenly became the party in the position to decide the shape and direction of the new government."
"4","On the very night of the election, the SPD announced its determination to form a government coalition with the FDP, with the tacit acknowledgment of the FDP, which meant that the party was ready to start negotiations."
"5","What happened in those late hours of election night set a new course for Germany. Excerpts from the Transcript of the Session of the FDP Federal Executive Committee on September 30, 1969 (reprinted in Hofmann 2000), show that the FDP was heavily courted by both parties. The CDU/CSU seemed to be eager to lock the FDP into formal negotiations, promising a generous allocation of cabinet portfolio, but without any specifics. SPD leaders, however, met informally with FDP's leaders and offered them the Foreign and Interior Office, along with a reduction of the total number of ministries through a reform of the cabinet (making de facto the impact of FDP in the Cabinet larger).         "
"6","The official FDP committee met on September 30 and voted to open formal negotiations with the SPD. In the following two weeks, SPD and FDP negotiating teams met to hammer out a government policy program and to decide on the Cabinet composition. The teams ratified the allocation of portfolios that the two parties initially agreed upon, allocating a total of three ministerial posts to the FDP (Interior, Foreign, and Food, Agriculture, and Forestry) and 13 ministries to the SPD.3"
"7","What was revealed on election night is that the emergence of a government coalition may be led by a few key proposals that are described in the model as “proto‐proposals.” The CDU/CSU, the largest party, lacked the willingness and the promptness to offer the “right” compensation in exchange for the role of formateur. Instead, the SPD nailed down an offer that satisfied the FDP and ultimately become formateur. Government policies may be refined and polished, cabinet portfolio allocations can be reshuffled, but key proposals are most likely what lead to the start of formal negotiations and what ultimately shape final agreements."
"8","Consider a legislature with  parties. Each party i has a legislative weight . We can think of these weights as being the proportion of legislative seats held in the legislature. No party has a majority of votes necessary to pass a government proposal ().         "
"9","The relationship between parties and legislators is one of mutual loyalty. Individual legislators  are assumed to be loyal to the party to which they belong, meaning that they do not switch from one party to another and act as a unitary block following directions from party leaders. Parties maintain members’ discipline through the use of patronage, meaning that loyalty is rewarded with office positions that, correspondingly, are denied to renegade members. Yet, members can have different weights inside the party and, consequently, may enjoy different shares of the benefits.         "
"10","A.1. The utility function of party i is represented by the aggregate utility of each of its members: .         "
"11","The main difference between this model and most of the models discussed thus far is that the formateur (the proposer in the bargaining game) is not exogenously designated but is determined in equilibrium by the characteristics of the parties. Parties are rational players and, looking forward, foresee that the formateur might enjoy an advantage in the bargaining game; thus, they are willing to make an offer to the coalition partners in order to achieve this proposer role."
"12","The bargaining game proceeds as follows. Parties behave noncooperatively and decide how to allocate a perfectly divisible homogeneous bundle of ministerial posts (normalized to sum to ) among themselves. Let  denote the set of parties, and ,  denote the set of feasible allocations, where  is the share party i receives. Assume that parties are risk neutral and that they discount the future by a discount factor . Parties care only about their own consumption and have preferences that can be represented by a continuous and strongly monotonic—but not necessarily quasi‐concave—utility function . Since the group of agents decides how to allocate a perfectly divisible surplus of unit size among themselves, we can assume without further restrictions that the utility of each party is the share of the surplus that it obtains: .         "
"13","Each party is assumed to know the preferences of all other parties, and all actions are assumed to be observable (perfect information).4 The interaction between parties is modeled as a sequential game, where the proposing party needs the consent of a quota equal to the simple majority (L/2+1) for its proposal to be agreed upon.         "
"14","In each period , government formation proceeds in four stages. Let  be the history of the game that contains the actions taken at each of the four stages in period t.         "
"15","In the first‐stage h1, parties simultaneously propose to form a coalition with a subset of parties. Let  with  denote a subset of parties. Then party  takes action , that is, party i proposes to form a coalition  where  denotes the set of coalition proposals of party i and .5 The parties with identical matching proposals () become partners of the protocoalition  and proceed to the next stage.6"
"16","In the second‐stage h2, each party  offers a share of cabinet portfolios to each partner in the coalition () in order to be formateur.7 Thus, only the parties in a protocoalition formed in the first‐stage  take action (; and ). The formateur, say m, is the party that offers the highest share of cabinet posts to the partners. The formateur and the coalition partners sign a government “protoproposal” , which assigns  to the coalition partners , the remaining share of cabinet positions ( to the formateur m, and 0 to the parties outside the protocoalition .         "
"17","Intuitively, the protoproposal is the outcome of the free‐style negotiations that precede the official designation of the formateur and the official bargaining stage. The aim of the intraparty talks and negotiations is twofold. First, parties need to explore their possibilities at forming government coalitions with different partners (protocoalitions). Second, parties within the possible protocoalitions try to reach a basic agreement about key policy issues and allocations of executive positions. This basic agreement (here called protoproposal) represents a sketchy arrangement that can be interpreted as the “least common multiple,” often in terms of the numbers of ministries to be allotted, that the protocoalition parties demand in order to form the government coalition. As Mershon (1994) says: [...Politicians first reach a working agreement on the party composition of the government... This decision depends on expectations about portfolios and policies, and permits bargaining over portfolios and policy to proceed...] (p. 66).         "
"18","In the third‐stage h3, the parties belonging to a protocoalition bargain over cabinet positions in accordance with standard, alternating bargaining models. The only difference is that, in case the receiving parties (the parties in the protocoalition which do not have proposal power) do not accept the proposer's proposal, the receiving partner can either fall back to the protoproposal vector  that the coalition parties signed in stage h2, or they can terminate the coalition negotiations and so back to stage h1. The bargaining proceeds with the formateur proposing an allocation  to the coalition partners, and the partners accepting the proposal, rejecting the proposal and falling back to the protoproposal, or terminating the coalition negotiations. Thus, only the parties in a protocoalition formed in the first‐stage  take action (; ; and ). If the formateur proposal  is accepted, it becomes the “protocoalition” proposal. If the formateur proposal  is rejected, the status quo (the protoproposal vector ) becomes the “protocoalition” proposal. If the formateur proposal  is terminated, the game repeats itself at the first stage up to T periods.         "
"19","If the coalition parties agree to the formateur's proposal, the proposal is voted upon by the legislative bodies. Elsewhere, coalition parties may vote to move the protoproposal to the floor (whenever detailed enough) or to terminate the bargaining stage within the protocoalition:            "
"20","The formateur might have significance leverage in designing the final proposal, often meeting specific demands of coalition members. However, the protoproposal represents the benchmark by which the protocoalition partners will measure and judge the formateur's proposal. Whenever the protoproposal is a detailed accounting of the offices assigned to each of the coalition members (as in the German 1979 case study), parties might reject the formateur's reshuffle attempt in favor of the agreed‐upon protoproposal."
"21","In the fourth‐stage h4, every legislator votes on one (or more) protocoalition proposal (either the formateur proposal or the protoproposal). If no protocoalition proposal obtains the majority of votes required to be passed, the game repeats itself at the first stage up to T periods. This process continues until an allocation generates the required number of votes. If at the end of period T no proposal has been passed, a “caretaker government,” composed of nonpartisan individuals,8 takes place, and .         "
"22","I now describe the solution concept. Let  be the history of the game that contains the proposals that have been made, the identity of the protocoalition, the identity of the proposer, and the actions taken at each of the four stages in period t. A strategy  for player i describes a sequence of actions, . A strategy profile  is a subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE), henceforth termed “equilibrium” if it constitutes a Strong Nash equilibrium in each period t and it is history dependent. All moves are sequential, and there is perfect information, so the game will be solved by backward induction starting from the last period.         "
"23","To understand the intuition behind the model's main results, I examine the case in which members inside a party have the same weight.9"
"24","A.2. Let  be the utility of each legislator belonging to party i and  party i’s size; then the utility function of party i may be rewritten as ’.         "
"25","The subgame at period  is solved backward from the last stage. All proofs of the propositions can be found in the appendix.         "
"26","There are two main features that distinguish my model from the existing coalition‐formation models in the literature: first, the endogenous nature of the formateur selection and second, the endogenous nature of the coalition formation."
"27","The endogenous nature of the formateur selection distinguishes my model from the foundational model of Baron and Ferejohn (1989) and all the legislative‐bargaining models that have originated from it. The only bargaining model with endogenous recognition of the formateur is proposed by Yildirim (2007), where every player chooses a costly effort level, which stochastically determines the proposer. The endogenous recognition rule, however, produces a higher “proposer advantage” than a random recognition rule, as more efficient players (with lower effort costs) are more likely to become proposers and allocate the benefits to less efficient players. The endogenous formateur selection in my model is not the outcome of a contest among the parties but the result of a mechanism by which parties exchange their right of being formateur for a share of benefits.            "
"28","The endogenous nature of the coalition formation sets my model apart from the noncooperative models in an important aspect. While the extant legislative‐bargaining models are concerned with predicting coalitions that allow individual coalition parties to maximize their own utility, given which party is selected as formateur, the objective of my model is to predict coalitions that emerge endogenously and that constitute the optimal outcome for each of them. In this respect, it is also fundamentally different from the “demand bargaining” model of Morelli (1999) in which coalitions constitute compatible, but not necessarily optimal, outcomes. In this model, parties foresee the utility of coalescing with others and seek to form a coalition with the parties that allow them to maximize their utility.            "
"29","Carroll and Cox (2007) study a similar endogenous coalition‐formation process in systems where parties can form pre‐election pacts. In their article, during the campaign stage, parties can form pre‐election pacts, which can be viewed as attempts to prenegotiate portfolio allocations.            "
"30","Recently, other studies have focused on the importance of long‐term stability in coalition formation. Indriðason (2010) proposes a legislative‐bargaining model where concerns about the coalition's survival lead the formateur to allocate higher than predicted shares of portfolios to the coalition parties. Penn (2009) considers a dynamic voting game where players face a trade‐off between the immediate value of a proposal and the long‐run stability of the emerging coalition, finding that, in the long run, proposers are better off by allocating shares of benefits to their coalition partners that are large enough to deter them from deviating to alternative proposals. In my model, stability is not induced by the threat of new proposals in the long term but by the endogenous nature of the coalition formation. Players can freely communicate and propose to coalesce with other players. Thus, a coalition proposal needs to be immune to deviations to alternative coalition proposals by both individual players and subcoalitions of players. The immunization to all possible deviations makes the coalition stable.            "
"31","In the last stage of the game, a coalition proposal is put on the floor and voted by the legislature. If more than one protocoalition has formed in the first stage, the largest protocoalition proposal (in terms of voting weight) is put on the floor and voted. If the proposal does not obtain the majority of votes required to be passed, the game repeats itself at the first stage up to T periods. This process continues until an allocation generates the required number of votes. If at the end of period T no proposal has been passed, a “caretaker government,” composed of nonpartisan individuals, takes place. If this is the case, no party receives office benefits . Parties vote in favor of a proposal if .10 Therefore, the unique subgame perfect equilibrium indicates that the largest protocoalition's proposal is passed on the very first stage of the game.            "
"32","Once a formateur is selected, the bargaining process proceeds with the formateur as the proposing party and the coalition partners as the receiving parties. The reversion point is either the protoproposal  that the formateur m proposed to the coalition partners in the previous stage or a vector of zeros if the coalition partners decide to terminate the protocoalition's negotiation. If the formateur proposal  is accepted by the coalition partners, then  will be put on the floor and voted by the legislature. Otherwise, either the protoproposal  will be put on the floor and voted by the legislature, or, since it is the last period of the game, no proposal is put on the floor.            "
"33","Assuming that each member of a party has equal weight inside the party, the share of benefits offered by the formateur to party  may be rewritten as , where  is party i’s size, and  is the benefit each member of party i enjoys. The protoproposal vector may be rewritten as:               "
"34","The proposer's maximization problem is to propose , such that  is maximized, and the proposal is approved by the coalition partners and by the legislature (at the voting stage):               "
"35","The first constraint ensures feasibility, the second constraint ensures that each partner will voluntarily choose  over , and the third constraint ensures that each partner will voluntarily choose  over terminating the protocoalition negotiations. Notice that the third constraint is never binding for any . Hence, any solution must satisfy the second constraint with equality, since the proposer maximizes its own utility by choosing an allocation  that makes the partners indifferent with the offer . Since cabinet portfolios are a homogeneous bundle normalized to , and , the equilibrium proposal is .            "
"36","The coalition parties make an offer to the partners in order to be the formateur of the government coalition.11 This process may be described as an auction in which each party i bids a share  to form a government coalition. This mechanism can be interpreted as a market in which each party pays a share of cabinet portfolios to the partners in order to form a government coalition.               "
"37","Proposition 1.In equilibrium, the bid vector of each party is equivalent to the vector of parties’ weight multiplied by a constant:                     "
"38","Each party has a well‐defined reservation price for the role of formateur because they know the level of utility they would enjoy as formateur for every price . Furthermore, there exists a unique price that makes every party indifferent to adopting the role of formateur or receiving party. This means that the final outcome does not depend on the choice of auction.               "
"39","Proposition 2.The equilibrium bid for each protocoalition is unique and identical for every party (). In equilibrium, therefore, the formateur is selected inside the protocoalition by a tie‐breaking rule that has been agreed upon by the parties.                  "
"40","This is one of the innovative results of my model: because parties compete for the role of formateur, the “first‐mover” advantage traditionally found in other legislative‐bargaining models is completely eliminated."
"41","From the solution of the third stage, we know that the allocation  generated by this process gives each party i in the protocoalition  the same utility of :               "
"42","Thus, the equilibrium allocation is unique no matter which party is charged to form the government. Furthermore, because of the feasibility constraint, which holds with equality, we can derive a closed‐form solution for the equilibrium bid (), where  is the size of the protocoalition. This leads us to our next theoretical result:               "
"43","Proposition 3.If parties are office motivated and the cabinet portfolios are a homogeneous and perfectly divisible good, then the share that each party in the government coalition is allocated in equilibrium is perfectly proportional to the nominal voting weight.                     "
"44","In the coalition‐formation stage, each party proposes a protocoalition. Every party i solves its maximization problem for every possible protocoalition :               "
"45","There are several equilibrium refinements that take into account group deviations, the most relevant being the Strong Nash Equilibrium (Aumann 1959), the Coalition‐Proof Nash Equilibrium (Bernheim 1987), and the Largest Consistent Set (Chwe, 1994). While the Strong Nash Equilibrium requires immunity to all possible coalitional deviations, the Coalition‐Proof Nash Equilibrium restricts attention to a limited class of “self‐enforcing” coalitional deviations, that is, ones that are themselves robust against further “self‐enforcing” deviations by subcoalitions. In this respect, Chwe (1994) proposes the most farsighted refinement, according to which an outcome is in the “consistent set” if it dominates—for all players—the final outcomes of all the possible deviations (but not necessarily the transitory outcomes). The notion of self‐enforceability provides a useful means of distinguishing coalitional deviations that are viable from those that are not resistant to further deviations, while the notion of consistency provides a way to distinguish ultimately relevant outcomes from temporary ones. However, since one can argue that in many circumstances nonviable deviations have successfully upset potential agreements, we will not restrict our attention to the set of strategies that are consistent or robust against self‐enforcing coalition deviations, but we will adopt the more comprehensive Strong Equilibrium refinement (Aumann 1959) to take account of all potential deviations.               "
"46","Proposition 4.If communication is allowed, unlimited, but nonbinding, then there exists a Strong Equilibrium coalition which is the smallest minimal‐winning protocoalition.                  "
"47","Lemma 5.Suppose that cabinet portfolios are a homogeneous and perfectly divisible good and that the utility function of the parties satisfies A.2. Then, there exists an equilibrium coalition , such that:                  "
"48","‐  has the smallest winning size.                  "
"49","‐ Every party  offers to the partners  a share equal to .                  "
"50","‐ The formateur's proposal allocates  to  and 0 to .                  "
"51","The equilibrium of the game is unique as long as there exists a unique smallest minimal‐winning coalition, otherwise at least one party will be indifferent to the choice between coalitions, which will be equally likely to be proposed."
"52","Assuming that the number of periods is finite, the game may be solved by backward induction starting from the last period. There exists a subgame perfect equilibrium in which each party makes the same coalition proposal, the same bid to be formateur, and the same proposal to allocate the cabinet portfolios. The equilibrium strategies are thus unique.               "
"53","Proposition 6.A strategy configuration is a subgame perfect equilibrium for a four‐stage, T‐period, n‐party legislature, with endogenous formateur, if and only if the following properties attain:                     "
"54","In such a framework, at every period of the game, each party proposes the same protocoalition; each party in the protocoalition offers the same share  to be the formateur; and each formateur proposes the same equilibrium allocation .12 The equilibrium strategies are, thus, unique.            "
"55","In the previous section, we saw how the baseline model with parties with homogeneous preferences over the cabinet portfolios predicts equilibrium allocations that are perfectly proportional to the nominal voting weight of the coalition parties. However, parties’ preferences over cabinet portfolios are often not homogeneous. Parties often show intense preferences for particular portfolios reflecting the relative importance different parties give to different issues and policies pertaining to different ministries.13 This is especially relevant for small parties which link their political campaign to specialized policy issues. For example, consider the “Green” party in several parliamentary legislatures. In view of stated interests, one may think that it would obtain a greater utility from holding the “Environment” ministry than other comparable ministries.         "
"56","Qualitative allocation of portfolios in most parliamentary legislatures shows some continuity. For example, in Denmark, the Social Democrats always hold the Ministry of Labour and almost always the Ministry of Social Welfare; the Liberals, advocating farmers’ interests, always hold the Ministry of Agriculture; and the Conservatives, linked to the business interests, always hold the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In Germany, either the Christian Democratic Union or the Social Democrats control the Department of Family Affairs and Labour and Social Affairs, while the Free Democratic Party usually controls the Foreign Ministry or the Ministry of Economic Affairs (Müller and Strøm 2000). Bäck, Debus, and Dumont (2011) analyze the impact of the saliency that government coalition parties attach to specific policy areas on the qualitative characteristics of the cabinet portfolio they control. They find that parties which emphasize certain policy areas in their political manifestos are more likely to be allocated portfolios with jurisdiction over those policy areas.         "
"57","In this section, I relax the assumption of cabinet portfolios being considered as a single good that sum to , allowing parties to extract different utilities from different positions. That is, parties decide how to allocate a perfectly divisible bundle composed of k ministerial positions. Units are chosen so that the k‐vector of goods to be allocated sums to .         "
"58","Thus,  denotes the set of feasible allocations, where  is the k‐vector consumption bundle of party i. Let  denote party i’s continuous and strongly monotonic utility function for .         "
"59","Government formation proceeds in four stages as described in the previous section. The only difference is that each party inside the protocoalition (say ) bids some scalar multiple  of a numéraire . The numéraire  can be any bundle of goods which satisfy a “desirability” property, which is any bundle that every party weakly prefers to the bundle .14 The party bidding the highest share of the numéraire, say m, wins the privilege of being formateur and signs a protoproposal  which assigns () to the coalition partners , the remaining share of the cabinet posts ( to the formateur m, and (0) the parties outside the protocoalition . Assuming again that each member of a party has equal weight inside the party, () may be rewritten as ().         "
"60","At the third stage, the proposer party maximizes its payoff by proposing an allocation , such that:                  "
"61","As in the baseline model, any solution must satisfy the second constraint with equality; however, the equilibrium proposal  is not necessarily equal to the protoproposal . There may exist multiple allocation vectors that make the partners indifferent with the protoproposal, depending on the functional form of the parties’ utility function. The proposer party maximizes its utility by choosing the allocation vector that assigns its most preferred cabinet posts to itself, leaving the rest to the partners. Thus, the utility of the coalition parties is higher when they have complementary (or opposite) preferences.                  "
"62","Proposition 7.If the bundle of cabinet portfolios is composed by n‐ministries and parties have heterogeneous preferences on different cabinet positions, then the equilibrium allocation depends on the party sizes and their preferences. The equilibrium allocation is perfectly proportional to the relative size of the coalition parties if and only if their utility functions are identical ().                     "
"63","To see how coalition parties’ preferences affect the equilibrium allocation of the cabinet portfolios, assume a legislature composed of three parties, none with a majority of seats. Assume that cabinet positions are of two different types, “Interior Affairs” (IA) and “Foreign Affairs” (FA), and that parties have Cobb‐Douglas utility functions over these two types of ministerial positions, with  identifying the preference parameter over the Interior posts:                  "
"64","Figure 2 plots the equilibrium allocations for a coalition government composed of party i and j, where the size and preferences of party j are fixed to five legislators and , respectively, and the size and preference of party i vary.15"
"65","Equilibrium Allocation of Cabinet Portfolio as Function of Party's Size and Preferences"
"66","Note: Equilibrium allocation for a protocoalition composed of party i and j, where party j's size and preferences are fixed to 5 legislators and , respectively. Party i's size varies between 1 and 10 legislators.. The three lines describe the equilibrium allocations when party i's preference , , and .                           "
"67","For every parameter , the larger party i’s size () is, the higher is the share of cabinet posts that party i is allocated. However, the number of cabinet posts increases at the same rate as the number of legislative seats contributed to the government (being perfectly proportional) only when the two coalition parties have the same preferences over the two types of cabinet posts (). When party i prefers one type of post over the other (either  or ),16 party i will be better off by obtaining few posts of the preferred type than many of the less‐preferred ones. Thus, the more skewed party i's preference is, the less than proportional is the share of portfolio that party i is allocated in equilibrium.               "
"68","Each party has a well‐defined reservation price for the role of formateur. Furthermore, if the numéraire is desirable, there exists a unique price that makes every player indifferent to holding the role of proposer or receiver.                  "
"69","Proposition 8.For any numéraire bundle, there exists a unique price () that makes every coalition party indifferent to being the formateur or a receiving party.                     "
"70","The equilibrium bid for each protocoalition is unique and identical for every party (). However, from the solution of the third stage, the allocation  is no longer necessarily equal to the protoproposal , and therefore the equilibrium bid  is a function of both the parties’ size vectors and their preferences.               "
"71","As in the homogeneous case, parties solve by backward induction the maximization problem for every possible protocoalition and propose the coalition that secures the highest utility. However, since the equilibrium bid  for every party i is no longer equal to party i’s nominal voting weight, it is not necessarily the case that parties maximize their utility by choosing the smallest minimal coalition.                  "
"72","Proposition 9.Suppose that cabinet portfolios are perfectly divisible bundles of goods and that parties have heterogeneous preferences on the goods composing the bundles. Then, there exists an equilibrium coalition  that is minimal winning.                     "
"73","To see how heterogeneous preferences affect the formation of the government coalition in equilibrium, assume again a three‐party legislature composed of parties i, j, and k that have Cobb‐Douglas utility functions over “Interior Affairs” (IA) and “Foreign Affairs” (FA) cabinet posts with , , and  representing their preference parameters. Assume now that the sizes of the three parties are fixed, and that party i controls three legislative seats, party j controls four seats, and party k controls two seats (, , and ).               "
"74","Table 1 shows the allocations at the bargaining stage for all the possible protocoalitions for different values of , , and . The numbers in bold represent the equilibrium bids, allocations, and utilities for the equilibrium coalition.               "
"75","As shown in the first panel of Table 1, if all parties are indifferent among the types of ministerial posts (), the equilibrium allocations in the bargaining stage, for each possible protocoalition, are equivalent to the homogeneous case (they are perfectly proportional to the party nominal voting weight). The Strong Equilibrium coalition is the smallest minimal‐winning coalition: both party i and party j would propose to form a coalition with party k, while party k would be better off by proposing a coalition with party i.               "
"76","The second panel shows the equilibrium allocations when party i holds more extreme preferences than party j and k (, ). In such a case, party i would obtain a larger utility than in the case it were indifferent because of the complementarity of its preferences with the other parties. The Strong Equilibrium of the game (in bold) would still be the coalition between party i and party k, but the share of cabinet posts that they obtain () is no longer perfectly proportional to their nominal voting weight (party i would receive 54.5% of the seats, and party k would receive 45.5%, with their nominal voting weights being equal to 0.6 and 0.4, respectively).               "
"77","The third panel shows that, when the preferences of the three parties are sufficiently different from each other (, ), the complementarity benefit may lead to a Strong Equilibrium coalition (in bold) that is not the smallest winning coalition (but still minimal‐winning). In this case, the complementarity benefit would be exploited by a coalition composed by party j and k. Party k would receive a larger utility by forming a coalition with a larger party (party j) with different preferences than by forming a coalition with a smaller party (party i) with similar preferences.               "
"78","Numerical simulations of the equilibrium predictions for all possible permutations of parties’ size and preferences are provided in the online appendix."
"79","Previous empirical studies on government formation have shown that portfolio allocations can be well explained by a “rule of thumb” that assigns offices in proportion to the votes each party contributes to the coalition's total, an empirical regularity called Gamson's Law. For their part, formal theorists have generally analyzed the process as a bargaining game over the resources of government, predicting in equilibrium that proposers—or “formateurs”—should be able to exploit their privileged position for their own benefit, receiving a disproportionately larger share of resources (cabinet portfolios) than their coalition partners. The expectations of these theories, however, are contradicted by the empirical evidence."
"80","This article proposes a theoretical foundation for one of the strongest empirical regularities in political science—Gamson's Law. My theoretical model departs from the existing literature by analyzing the government‐formation problem in a framework where the proposer is not designated exogenously but is selected by the parties that have agreed to coalesce and where government coalitions are not unilaterally proposed by a formateur but emerge endogenously as parties maximize their utility."
"81","This article breaks new ground by theorizing the endogenous formation of the government coalition. It also provides a more realistic perspective on the way that coalition governments form in parliamentary democracies. In fact, in both fully structured and free‐style systems, parties engage in negotiations that aim at both skimming through potential viable government coalitions and identifying prospective formateurs, making the official nomination of the formateur a mere ratification of a decision that the coalition parties have already reached."
"82","The model I develop here makes another important contribution: it is able to explain proportional allocations as functions of parties’ sizes and preferences with regard to cabinet portfolios. In this respect, the model represents an advancement that improves on the noncooperative literature, closing the gap between the theoretical literature and the empirical findings."
"83","The model can also account for how the composition of the equilibrium government coalition changes as a function of the size and preferences of the parties, and it can be fruitfully extended to account for other institutional constraints that can affect the government‐formation process in different parliamentary legislatures. Using this baseline model and assuming parties that are both office‐seeking and policy‐pursing, we should be able to explain why minority and supermajority governments form. The formation and the stability of these governments, like the strong proportionality of the allocation of cabinet portfolios, constitute an important and unexplained paradox in the literature on coalition theory in parliamentary legislatures."
