"1","There are two perspectives on the relationship between racial composition and attitudes. Both perspectives hold that attitudes toward racially based public policies are associated with the racial composition of the area in which individuals reside; however, the nature of the relationship differs between these two perspectives. The intergroup contact literature argues increased interracial group exposure and/or contact is associated with more positive racial attitudes (e.g., Forbes 1997; Jackman and Crane 1986; Sigelman et al. 1996). Alternatively, the intergroup conflict perspective, or the “racial threat hypothesis,” suggests that as the size of a minority group's population increases, prejudicial attitudes increase (e.g., Bobo 1988; Glaser 1994; Key 1949). Our study does not seek to establish if racial context is associated with attitudes, as this relationship has already been demonstrated. Rather, we are concerned with examining the nature of the relationship between racial context and attitudes. We rely on the socioeconomic context research to develop expectations regarding the nature of the relationship between racial context and attitudes.         "
"2","Several prominent works outline the importance of one's socioeconomic “environment” in the structure of racial attitudes (Huckfeldt and Kohfeld 1989; Oliver and Mendelberg 2000; Oliver and Wong 2003). Huckfeldt and Kohfeld argue “the political polarization between whites and blacks is not simply a matter of social relations between whites and blacks but also a matter of social relations within the white and black population” (1989, 54). They argue racial conflict arises not only in response to interaction among the groups, but as a function of other contextual factors that serve to buttress racial animosities. Oliver and Mendelberg (2000) argue that low socioeconomic status settings may lead to greater exposure to high levels of crime, social disorder, and physical decay. This kind of exposure leads to greater out‐group hostility and general distrust of other individuals. Consequently, individuals residing in low‐status environments may harbor greater racial animosity, thus leading to less tolerant and less supportive attitudes toward out‐groups and toward polices designed to benefit a particular racial or ethnic group.         "
"3","The socioeconomic context research and the racial context research demonstrate that the environment in which an individual resides is associated with racial attitudes. However, both lines of research consider the impact of one contextual characteristic in isolation from other contextual characteristics. One exception is Oliver and Mendelberg's (2000) research which considers a conditional relationship between racial context and socioeconomic context. They argue that racial residential segregation has reduced competition among racial groups for political and economic resources. “Because most whites are sequestered in predominantly white, suburban municipalities, they are removed from local political arenas where their power or privilege is contested by African Americans or where the effects of race‐targeted policies are felt” (Oliver and Mendelberg 2000, 575). They argue that other contextual factors, such as socioeconomic characteristics, may impact interracial competition and thus be associated with racial attitudes. However, their findings yield little evidence for the proposed conditional relationship between socioeconomic environment and racial environment on racial attitudes.         "
"4","We argue to garner a better understanding of the relationship between racial composition and racial policy attitudes it is necessary to account for the role of one's socioeconomic environment. Further, we argue the socioeconomic climate in which an individual resides conditions the relationship between racial context and individual attitudes. Explicitly stated, we expect that the structure of racial attitudes varies depending on whether individuals live in a highly diverse and a high socioeconomic context than when compared to individuals residing in a highly diverse and low socioeconomic context. The latter context represents a maximum‐threat context, as the social milieu is racially and ethnically diverse and the socioeconomic environment is poor. In accordance with the intergroup conflict research, we expect in this type of environment, there is increased competition and perceived threat between or among groups. As such, exposure to other racial and ethnic groups is associated with less support for policies benefitting other groups. In contrast, the former environment is most likely to be conducive to positive exposure effects. High socioeconomic environments coupled with high levels of diversity will result in more favorable exposure of whites to minority groups. As the intergroup contact literature suggests, in this type of contextual environment, lower levels of competition and perceived threat between/among groups leads to greater support for racial public policies.         "
"5","Importantly, this hypothesized conditional relationship will provide insight into the discrepant findings of the intergroup contact and intergroup conflict literatures.1 Accounting for the proposed conditional relationship between racial diversity and socioeconomic context allows one to evaluate the conditions under which favorable versus unfavorable racial exposure is likely to emerge. We argue that failing to account for either kind of context or failing to account for the apparent conditional nature of the relationship may result in misleading conclusions.         "
"6","An additional issue we address is the tendency in most of the existing literature to measure racial composition as the proportion of the black population within a given area. The narrow focus on the black population implicitly suggests that the U.S. population is largely biracial, not multiracial and multiethnic. Additionally, the existing research commonly notes that the United States is highly segregated, with whites largely residing separately from blacks (Massey and Eggars 1993; Oliver and Mendelberg 2000). Inherently, the concentration on the size of the black population suggests that areas lacking a nontrivial black population are by default, homogeneous white areas. While it is true that the United States is highly segregated, it does not naturally follow that an area lacking a large black population is necessarily racially and ethnically homogenous. As census reports indicate, Hispanics and Asians are more integrated residentially (or live in closer proximity to whites) than the black population (Massey and Denton 1993; Iceland, Weinberg, and Steinmetz 2002). This suggests that the focus on the size of the black population within an area overlooks the presence of other racial and ethnic groups.         "
"7","For example, Oliver and Mendelberg (2000) measure racial context as the percentage of the black population at the metropolitan level.2 While it is true that a large proportion of the black population resides in metropolitan areas, it is not the case this is the only minority population present. The 1990 Census data indicated 83.5% of the black population resided in metropolitan areas and comprised 12.7% of the overall metropolitan population; 90.4% of the Hispanic population resided in metropolitan areas and made up 10.5% of the metropolitan population; while 93.9% of the Asian population lived in metropolitan areas and comprised 3.4% of the metropolitan population. The practice of measuring racial composition as the percentage of the black population within metropolitan areas ignores other sizeable nonwhite populations. The limitations surfacing in prior research make it difficult to identify the nature of the relationship between racial (and ethnic) composition and attitudes. We now turn attention to the measurement of racial and ethnic diversity.         "
"8","We utilize data from the 1992 National Election Studies survey and 1990 U.S. Census Bureau data to examine the relationship between attitudes and racial and ethnic diversity. This particular data set is utilized because it contains a number of survey items regarding respondents' attitudes toward racially and ethnically based policy items. Census data are used to measure levels of racial and ethnic diversity, proportion college educated, and other geographic characteristics at the county level. The individual‐level NES data and the county‐level census data are merged to account for the racial and ethnic context in which respondents' reside."
"9","The relationship between racial composition and racial attitudes has been observed at many levels including the census tract, neighborhood, zip code, county, and metropolitan area. For the purpose of this study we have selected the county as the geographical unit of analysis. There are both important theoretical and practical reasons for the use of the county as the contextual unit of interest as opposed to other levels such as zip code or metropolitan areas. From a practical standpoint, a person's exposure to contextual conditions likely extends beyond a census tract, neighborhood, or zip code. Individuals on a daily basis may travel beyond the geographical bounds of their neighborhood and/or zip code.3 They are likely to be exposed to a wider array of contextual conditions than the area in which they immediately reside. Individuals' exposure to conditions (racial, socioeconomic, or otherwise) outside the boundaries of a neighborhood or a zip code is not only possible, but very probable.4 In this sense, the zip code, census tract, or neighborhood levels may understate likely exposure to environmental conditions compared to the county level.         "
"10","The county is also preferable to larger geographical units such as metropolitan areas because it is a more refined measure of one's racial and ethnic context and socioeconomic context. There are 3,142 counties in the United States, while there are approximately 319 Censusdefined metropolitan areas. There are also considerable differences in population size between the county and metropolitan level.5 Further, metropolitan areas often include not only single cities or counties, but often multiple cities and multiple counties (that may extend across state lines). Compared to the county, then, the metropolitan level gives a less refined measure of the racial/ethnic and social environment.         "
"11","From a theoretical standpoint, county as the geographic unit of analysis is reasonable based on the fact this geographical unit has substantive political implications for individual‐level attitudes toward social policies. County governments are often responsible for delivering public services such as assessment of property, maintenance of rural infrastructure, administration of judicial and election functions, and oversees programs such as welfare, housing, health, and economic development (NACo 2003; Schneider and Park 1989).6 As such, the county level holds important political and public policy implications (See Baybeck 2001; Schnieder and Park 2001). Given the interest in individual‐level attitudes regarding policies that target racial and ethnic minority groups coupled with the fact that many of these policies involve issues of “redistributive services” (i.e., welfare, employment, and education), the use of county as the geographic unit makes both practical and theoretical sense.         "
"12","We use 1990 Census data for every county's white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian populations to create a measure county‐level racial and ethnic diversity. The measure used in this study accounts not only for the presence of multiple groups, but also for the mixing, or multiplicity, of these groups.7 The measure of racial and ethnic diversity is created using a modified version of the Rae (1967) index.8 The measure of racial and ethnic diversity is constructed as:9"
"13","In addition to accounting for racial and ethnic composition, we are also interested in creating a measure of the socioeconomic environment. Socioeconomic status is measured here as the percentage of college‐educated individuals within the county. Clearly, there are a wide variety of possible indicators of socioeconomic status such as median income or unemployment; however, education level has been found to be the most reliable indicator of contextual‐level socioeconomic status (Huckfeldt and Kohfeld 1989; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995; Oliver and Mendelberg 2000). The observed values of the college‐educated indicator range from 7 to 52%. The mean level of county college educated is 22% with a median value of 21%. We now turn attention to constructing models of individual‐level attitudes.         "
"14","The dependent variables examined involve white, non‐Latinos responses to questions on preferential hiring of blacks, education quotas, welfare assistance, government assistance to blacks, and support for bilingual education.10 With the exception of a question pertaining to bilingual education, each of the survey items required the respondent to place him or herself on an ordered scale. Individual attitudes toward these issues are treated as a function of three sets of covariates: individual‐level attributes; individual‐level core values; and contextual attributes. The individual‐level attributes measure the respondent's age (measured in years), sex (code 1 if female), income level, and education level. Income is coded in terms of two binary indicators with the first denoting whether or not the respondent's income was less than or equal to $15,000 and the second denoting whether or not the respondent's income was greater than or equal to $75,000. Education was also coded in terms of two binary indicators with the first denoting whether or not the respondent had less than a high school education, and the second denoting whether or not the respondent was a college graduate.         "
"15","The individual‐level core values are measured in terms of the often‐used racial resentment scale (Kinder and Sanders 1996) and the egalitarianism scale (Kinder and Sanders 1996; Sears, Henry, and Kosterman 2000). Both value scales are summative scales composed of the relevant NES survey items. The egalitarianism scale is constructed using five items (Kinder and Sanders 1996; Sears, Henry, and Kosterman 2000) and has a Cronbach's α of .83. The racial resentment scale is composed of four items and has a Cronbach's α of .75. This scale is coded such that higher scores indicate less prejudicial attitudes, and the egalitarianism scale is coded such that higher scores reflect stronger egalitarian attitudes.11 We expect these scales to be strongly related to support for policies benefitting racial and/or ethnic groups. In addition to these two scales, two binary indicators are used measuring the respondent's ideology. The first denotes whether or not the respondent identified him or herself as being moderately or strongly liberal, and the second denotes whether or not the respondent identified him or herself as being moderately or strongly conservative.         "
"16","Four contextual indicators are included in the models. The first is an indicator denoting whether or not the respondent's county is in the South. As white (non‐Latino) individuals in the south have typically been associated with having lower levels of support for racially targeted policies, this measure should account for any independent effects of the south region. The second is a measure of the percent urban is included to account for the expectation that individuals residing in rural areas tend to exhibit greater levels of racial conservatism than do individuals who reside in more urban areas. Finally, the two measures discussed in the previous section, racial and ethnic diversity and proportion college educated, are also included in the models."
"17","Several statistical models were estimated to examine the relationship between diversity, socioeconomic context, and attitudes toward racial public policies. Four of the five dependent variables are ordinal and thus require a model appropriate for ordered data.12 Typically with such items, the ordered logit model (or some similar other cumulative link model) is applied; however, the ordered logit model maintains the restrictive proportional odds assumption. This assumption requires that the effects of the covariates on the log‐odds of observing a score on the dependent variable are invariant to the cutpoint parameters. To evaluate the proportional odds assumption for our models, we estimated both an ordered logit model and a “generalized” ordered logit model (Kang Fu 1998) for each of the ordered survey items.13 A likelihood‐ratio test between the models indicated the proportional odds assumption did not hold for any of the ordered items. Consequently, we present the results from the generalized ordered logit model.         "
"18","In Table 1, we present the results from several generalized ordered logit models. This table gives the J− 1 sets of log‐odds ratios (i.e., logits) for each of the survey items (where J denotes the number of category scores on the dependent variable). The ordered response variables are coded such that higher scores denote greater support for the issue or policy in question. To facilitate interpretation of the models, consider the model of attitudes toward education quotas, which is found in the first three columns (C1, C2, C3) of Table 1. The response options are 1 =“oppose strongly,” 2 =“oppose not strongly,” 3 =“favor not strongly,” and 4 =“favor strongly” education quotas. The first column, labeled “C1” (for cutpoint 1) gives the log‐odds of a respondent answering “above” the first cutpoint (i.e., score = 2, 3, 4) versus responding below the first cutpoint (i.e., score = 1); the second column, labeled “C2” gives the log‐odds of a respondent answering “above” the second cutpoint (i.e., score = 3, 4) versus responding below the second cutpoint (i.e., score = l, 2); the third column, labeled “C3” gives the log‐odds of responding above the third cutpoint (i.e., score = 4) versus responding below the third cutpoint (i.e., score = 1, 2, 3). The ordinality of the survey item is preserved in the models, yet the assumption of proportionality is not. Since the parameters in Table 1 are logit estimates, each equation can be interpreted as a “stand‐alone” logit, where the outcome corresponds to placement above or below a given cutpoint. It is important to understand what each cutpoint “model” is showing. In the preferential hiring model, column C2 is a model for the scale's (implied) midpoint. These coefficients in column C2 can be used to determine the log‐odds of responding above versus below the midpoint—support versus opposition to preferential hiring. For racial policy items, where interest usually centers on “support” or “opposition,” contrasts at the scale's midpoint are of greater substantive interest than other cutpoint models.14"
"19","Before turning attention to the diversity and college education measures—the central focus of this analysis—we first consider the results for some of the other covariates from the models in Table 1. The relationship between core values–racial tolerance and egalitarianism–and attitudes is statistically significant across most of the cutpoints for each of the issues and in the predicted direction. In general, higher levels of racial tolerance and high egalitarianism are associated with substantially greater support for racial and ethnic issues. In contrast, more prejudicial and less egalitarian values are associated with opposition to racial and ethnic issues. Amongst the least prejudicial individuals, the odds of supporting bilingual education programs is about 10 times that of individuals who are most prejudicial. The most egalitarian individuals are about five times more likely to support bilingual education programs than the least egalitarian individual. Further, least prejudicial individuals are about 14 times more likely to support the status quo or increase welfare‐spending levels (versus decreasing them) compared to the most prejudicial respondents. The most egalitarian respondents are about five times more likely to answer with the status quo/increase spending option compared to the least egalitarian. Similar conclusions hold across the other policy items.         "
"20","Of course these results are not novel as the effect of values on racial attitudes is well documented; however, what is potentially interesting is to evaluate how the contextual variables influence racial attitudes above and beyond the demonstrably powerful influence of individually held core values. It is to these factors that we turn next."
"21","Typically, research examining the relationship between racial context and attitudes treats this relationship as a “main effect.” This implies that the “effect” of racial context on attitudes is invariant to other contextual factors that may influence attitudes. We theorize that the influence of racial and ethnic composition on attitudes is conditioned by the socioeconomic environment. To evaluate the hypothesized conditional effect, we estimate a statistical interaction between the racial and ethnic diversity measure and the percent college‐educated measure. This interaction is given by               "
"22","In Table 1, the first three covariates specify the interaction in Equation (1). Except for the “bilingual education” model, the interaction term is uniformly positive across each model. In terms of hypothesis tests, Table 2 summarizes the p‐values (based on z‐ratios) obtained for each of the interaction terms.16 For now, ignore the italicized terms. Using the one‐tailed criteria and an upper p‐value of .10, 13 of the 16 interactions are statistically significant, which provides strong evidence for the hypothesized conditional relationship.17"
"23","It is well known that the standard errors for the constituent terms—diversity and college educated—are conditional (see Friedrich 1982). Specifically, the standard errors for the diversity measure are based on the point where the college‐educated measure equals exactly 0; while the standard errors for the college educated measure are based on the point where the diversity measure equals 0. Given that neither of the contextual variables have a natural 0 point, the standard errors for the constituent terms will be larger than they are over the observed range of the college‐educated and diversity measures. As Friedreich notes, if a statistical interaction holds, then “the conditional standard errors will at some values of X1 and X2 be smaller than” the standard errors from a model without statistical interaction (1982, 813). Indeed, there are as many conditional standard errors as there are unique values of the diversity and college educated variable.18 As such, the fact that the constituent terms—diversity and college educated—are in some instances not statistically significant is not a concern, as these estimates reflect points which are outside of the range of observation.            "
"24","The results indicate that the relationship between racial/ethnic composition is conditioned on the type of education context. The positive coefficient on the interaction implies that education context works to amplify the relationship between county‐level racial/ethnic diversity and racial attitudes.19 Hence, the results indicate that when a highly diverse context coincides with a high‐education context, attitudes on racial issues are most supportive. Conversely, when a highly diverse context is coterminous with a low‐education context, attitudes are least supportive.            "
"25","We now turn to some graphical displays. As noted, one advantage of the generalized ordered logit model is that we can assess how the covariates influence the likelihood of an individual responding above or below the scale's midpoint. This is useful because midpoint most clearly demarcates “supporters” of a racial policy from “opposers” of the policy. Notably, the results indicate that the statistical significant of the conditional relationship is strongest for the midpoint models. To see this, consider again Table 2. The italicized terms are the p‐values for the cutpoints corresponding to the midpoint of the scale.20 These points indicate strong statistical significance at any conventional level for both one‐tailed and  two‐tailed tests.            "
"26","In Figure 1, we illustrate the conditional relationships found in Table 1 by plotting the predicted probabilities from each of the “midpoint” models. These figures give the probability of a respondent scoring above the midpoint (i.e., on the “support side” of the scale) versus scoring below the midpoint (i.e., on the “oppose side” of the scale). For each policy item, the relationship between racial and ethnic diversity and policy attitudes is conditioned on two kinds of socioeconomic contexts: “high education” and “low education” contexts.21“High” and “low” education contexts were selected to convey the general direction and range of the conditional relationship. Figure 1 illustrates the consistency across the survey items in the nature and direction of the relationship. Conditioning on high education contexts, we find that as the racial and ethnic diversity of a county increases, the probability of supporting a racial policy increases. In contrast, conditioning on a low education context, as racial and ethnic diversity increases, the probability of supporting a policy decreases.            "
"27","                 This Figure Shows the Relationship Between Diversity and Racial Policy Attitudes, Conditional on Education Levels. The Graphs Are Based on Estimates from the “Midpoint” Models of                                                         Table 1                                                       "
"28","In making reference to probability “increases” and “decreases” we want to be careful to note that for some policy items, white respondents are generally prone to oppose the issue. Thus, the probability scale (i.e., the y‐axis) in Figure 1 varies across the four issue areas. This is most clearly shown on the preferential hiring item. The highest estimated probability (given the covariate profile used to generate the probabilities) is around .10. This clearly indicates that white respondents, in general, are opposed to preferential hiring practices. On the other hand, the probability scale for the welfare assistance item ranges from a predicted high of about .6 to a low of about .35 (again, given the covariate profile for the predictions). Hence, the magnitude of white support for racial issues is contingent on the type of issue asked about.            "
"29","These results lend evidence to reconcile the apparent anomaly in the literature where both positive and negative relationships between racial/ethnic composition and attitudes have been found. For these issues, we in fact do see conditions under which racial composition leads to both support and opposition for race‐based issues; however, in this analysis, the different results are naturally interpretable, not contradictory. Socioeconomic status moderates the strength and direction of the relationship. The results help us to better establish the conditions under which racial composition will influence attitudes. Specifically, the relationship between racial context and attitudes is not independent of the socioeconomic context.            "
"30","For example, for individuals nested within a low‐status context that is also highly diverse, racial hostility may most readily manifest itself. Apart from being surrounded by a poor socioeconomic climate, white non‐Latinos are also surrounded by racial and ethnic minorities that compete for the same set of limited resources likely to be found in the context. Under this condition—a condition of maximal threat—we would expect likely exposure to other racial and ethnic groups to be associated with less supportive and less tolerant racial attitudes. However, in high‐status contexts, individuals who are in close proximity to members of racial and ethnic minority groups may not feel the same kind of competition and threat posed by minorities in low status environments. The material well‐being of individuals in these contexts may mute (or preclude) the anxiety of having to think about policies that benefit minority groups; moreover, minorities in high‐status contexts may themselves be well established and integrated in the community. This integration may go a long way toward counteracting negative stereotypes. Thus in this setting, increased racial/ethnic diversity leads to more favorable attitudes, conditional on the socioeconomic status.            "
"31","Before moving to the discussion section, the potential problem of residential self‐selection must be addressed. Since individuals can self‐select where to live, the factors driving this self‐selection process may be correlated with individual‐preferences, which may generate the appearance of contextual effects when none actually exists (Achen and Shively 1995; Hauser 1970, 1974).22 This suggests that the finding of a conditional relationship between racial diversity and socioeconomic context may be attributable to the fact that individuals may self‐select into contexts that are racially diverse (or homogeneous) and high‐status (or low‐status). For example, suppose that the least prejudicial, most egalitarian, and most highly educated individuals also tend to choose to live in racially diverse, high‐status counties? If this were the case, then the contextual effects found in Table 1 may be spurious as we could not disentangle the contextual effects from the influence of core values (and other individual attributes).            "
"32","One way to address the self‐selection issue is to model the county residence of the respondents. Here, we examine how strongly individual‐level characteristics and core values predict county residence. We created four binary indicators recording whether or not the respondent resided in one of these four types of counties: (1) high‐diversity and high‐status counties; (2) low‐diversity and high‐status counties; (3) high‐diversity and low‐status counties; and (4) low‐diversity and low‐status counties.23 Each contextual indicator is treated as a function of individual‐level attributes and individual‐level core values. The logistic regression results are presented in Table 3. Evidence of strong residential selection effects is not found across any of the models. The results indicate that in no instance are individually held core values related to the type of context in which individuals reside. There is mixed evidence that ideology is related to county‐type residence. The “liberal” is covariate is weakly related to residency in high‐diversity, high‐status counties and is related to nonresidency in low‐diversity, low‐status counties. Similarly, the “conservative” covariate is related to residence in high‐diversity, low‐status counties, but only weakly related (or unrelated) to residency in other county types. There are however no clear patterns that would lead one to conclude that the least prejudicial and most liberal tend to reside in high‐diversity, high‐status contexts.            "
"33","There is limited evidence that income and education are related to the type of context in which a respondent resides. These models suggest that respondents with an income of less than $15 thousand are more likely to live in low socioeconomic contexts. Conversely, respondents having an income greater than $75 thousand are more likely to reside in high‐diversity, high‐status counties. This result is principally driven by issues of “affordability.” This kind of “selection effect” is not the kind of result that weakens our fundamental conclusions from Table 1 and Figure 1. Residency choice is predicated (at least in part) on income level—people choose to live where they can afford to live—but not on attitudinal factors. Finally, the results indicate that college education is associated with the likelihood of residing in two of the four types of contexts. Specifically, a respondent with a college education is more likely to reside in a highly diverse and high socioeconomic context and less likely to reside in a homogeneous and low socioeconomic context.            "
"34","The results in Table 3 do not provide evidence that our major conclusions about racial and ethnic diversity are simply a function of residential self‐selection. While some “selection effects” emerge, county residence is not strongly predicted by individual‐level values and ideology. Rather, residency is best predicted by the socioeconomic covariates of education and income. Given these results, we are confident that the robust findings of the conditioning relationship of socioeconomic status on diversity and racial attitudes is substantive, holding up to any possible self‐selection effects.            "
"35","The principal aim of this article has been to consider the relationship between racial and ethnic diversity, socioeconomic status, and individual attitudes on racially based issues. Our main finding is that the relationship between racial diversity and attitudes is conditioned by one's socioeconomic context. As noted previously, Oliver and Mendelberg (2000) also consider the relationship between racial context and attitudes conditioned on socioeconomic context, but find little evidence of the conditional relationship found in this study. There are several reasons for these differences. First, the Oliver and Mendelberg (2000) analysis and this study address two fundamentally different research questions. Oliver and Mendelberg (2000) argue that residential segregation has largely eliminated competition between racial groups for resources and as a result, has diminished the role of racial composition in the formation of attitudes. They argue the socioeconomic environment in which individuals reside is associated with white attitudes in a manner that is largely unrelated to one's racial context. The present study does not propose that the importance of racial composition has diminished. Instead, this work focuses on how the impact of racial and ethnic composition on racial attitudes varies conditionally by the socioeconomic context in which individuals reside. Hence, the basic question addressed here is fundamentally different from that asked by Oliver and Mendelberg (2000).24"
"36","Second, the two works utilize different measures of racial composition. Oliver and Mendelberg (2000) measure racial context as the percent black population at both the zip code level and the metropolitan area level. As noted, this approach ignores the presence of other racial and ethnic groups; thus, implicitly assumes that an area without a black population is homogeneously white. This measure of racial context understates or discounts the impact of one's context on racial attitudes, which likely results in misleading conclusions regarding the relationship between racial (and ethnic) composition and attitudes. This approach is particularly problematic for the metropolitan level given that over 90% of the Hispanic population and 93% of the Asian population reside in metropolitan areas. The present study uses a broader measure of racial and ethnic context. This measure of racial and ethnic composition provides more accurate view of the impact of diversity on racial attitudes than the typical accounting of the percent black in an area.         "
"37","Third, the results generated from these two pieces render different conclusions regarding the interactive relationship between racial context and socioeconomic context. As noted, Oliver and Mendelberg (2000) find little evidence of the conditional relationship between metropolitan level racial context and zip code level socioeconomic context. Moreover, they conclude that competition or perceived threat only influences attitudes on policies that are geographically proximate to whites. In contrast, the findings here indicate strong and consistent evidence for the conditional effect between racial and ethnic composition and socioeconomic context. These findings provide evidence that helps shed light on the apparent discrepant findings in the literature on racial contact and racial threat. Our results demonstrate how both perspectives' conclusions can hold.         "
"38","In terms of the “bigger” implications of this article, one of main goals has been to argue that the exclusive focus in the race and politics literature on black‐white conflict and competition belies the fact that the United States is becoming an increasingly racially and ethnically diverse country. While it is often pointed out that the United States is highly segregated—which is demonstrably true—it does not necessarily follow that the absence of a large black population implies that a geographical area is racially homogenous. Thus, models that purportedly are measuring racial context may be missing a considerable amount of interesting variability by implicitly assuming the United States is biracial, not multiracial and multiethnic."
"39","To account for the multiplicity and mixing of races and ethnicities in the United States, we have attempted to document the relationship between racial and ethnic diversity on individual‐level assessments of social policies. To that end, we found that the relationship between attitudes and context is considerably more complicated that what initially emerges from a simple model estimating the unconditional effect of racial/ethnic composition on attitudes. Instead, we found that the relationship between diversity and individual‐level attitudes is conditional on the socio‐economic status of the context. Indeed, failure to account for this conditional relationship results in misleading conclusions regarding the impact of socioeconomic status on attitudes, as an unconditional model leads to a conclusion that racial/ethnic composition is either positively or negatively associated with racial attitudes. Here, we find that affluent contexts help ameliorate racially intolerant attitudes. In this sense, the results suggest a “positive” affect between racial/ethnic composition and attitudes of tolerance. Yet because the conditional effect holds “both ways,” there is also an important negative implication for our results. The results indicate that poorer socioeconomic contexts exacerbate racially intolerant attitudes. As such, African‐Americans, Latinos, and Asian‐Americans residing in poorer and economically depressed contexts, who are most in need of assistance (i.e., policy benefits), also live in areas where racial tensions are the highest. Intuitively, this suggests that minorities residing in this type of context are faced with the unenviable task of overcoming socioeconomic challenges as well as racial animosity.         "
"40","The central question of this article centered on the relationship between racial and ethnic composition and racial attitudes. We hypothesized that the effect of racial/ethnic composition on attitudes is conditioned on socioeconomic status. The conditioning relationship found across several of the issue areas examined in this study suggests that the nature and strength of racial composition effects is influenced by the socioeconomic context. To that end, our study helps explain why in some conditions, one finds support for the racial threat hypothesis while in other conditions, one finds support for the racial contact hypothesis. On the face of it, these two hypotheses seem incompatible. Yet when interpreted in terms of the conditional relationship, the results are, in fact, compatible. Both “positive” and “negative” racial composition effects emerge once the relationship is conditioned on socioeconomic status. Further, there is little evidence to suggest these contextual effects are simply (or solely) a function of residential self‐selection."
