"1","There are three players: the incumbent who holds the office, the opposition that wants to be in the office, and the election monitor (the monitor). Let  denote the incumbent's latent support in the population (or his ability to mobilize such support). Let  denote the probability that the incumbent whose support is equal to θ prevails against the opposition in conflict for the office. We assume that δ is an increasing function so that the incumbent's ability to prevail in conflict is increasing with his numeric power (Chacon, Robinson, and Torvik 2011). Within an autocracy, people have good reasons to conceal their aversion toward the government (Kuran 1995), which makes the incumbent's genuine support, θ, uncertain. Following the standard framework (Chernykh and Svolik 2015; Gehlbach and Simpser 2015; Little 2012; Rozenas 2016), the incumbent can observe his electoral support, denoted by , correlated with his true support, θ. Specifically, we assume that the expected vote share of the incumbent, , is increasing in his support, θ. Let  denote the expected probability that the incumbent prevails in the conflict given that his vote share is equal to ν.5"
"2","At the start of the game, elections are held, and the incumbent privately learns his vote share ν upon which he decides whether to step down () or to claim office (). To claim the office, the incumbent must also claim that his vote share exceeded a threshold , stipulated by the electoral rule.6 If the incumbent's goal is to simply win the election, we could assume that , or some other threshold required by the election law. However, the model can also account for cases where the incumbent wants to win a hypermajority in order to make constitutional amendments or to discourage the opposition from participating in future elections (Magaloni 2006; Simpser 2013).         "
"3","All parties hold the common prior belief that the incumbent's vote share ν is drawn from the distribution G, with the associated density g. Having privately observed his vote share ν, the incumbent gains an informational advantage over the opposition and the monitor. This allows the incumbent to claim office even after losing the election. We say that the incumbent commits fraud whenever he claims office () after receiving fewer than w votes (). While the incumbent does not incur any exogenous cost for committing fraud (this could be extended without much impact on the results), he does incur an endogenous cost because committing fraud may incite costly post‐election violence.         "
"4","Holding political office yields the normalized payoff equal to one, whereas being in the opposition yields the normalized payoff equal to zero. If the incumbent does not step down following the election (), then the opposition chooses whether to attempt to take the office by force () or acquiesce (). Throughout the article, we use the terms rebel or start a conflict to refer to the opposition's action . In reality,  can represent any costly action by the opposition that results in a loss for the incumbent (e.g., coup, protest, general strike, insurrection, or assassination attempt).         "
"5","The conflict incurs a commonly known deadweight cost  on the incumbent. To avoid unreasonable cases, we assume that the cost of conflict for the incumbent is sufficiently small so that he never steps down after winning elections:            "
"6","Assumption 1.After winning elections, the incumbent claims the office, .               "
"7","The opposition incurs a privately known deadweight cost  due to the conflict. The incumbent and the monitor share a prior belief that c is drawn from the probability distribution H. Most of our results do not require any specific assumptions about H, but some statements that follow can be analytically proven only by assuming that H is a convex function (e.g., the uniform distribution on the unit interval, , satisfies this assumption).         "
"8","The terminal payoffs for the players are presented in Table 1. The incumbent receives a normalized payoff equal to zero if he steps down, , that is, if he does not commit fraud after losing elections. The incumbent receives the highest possible payoff equal to one if he claims office and the opposition acquiesces ( and ), and he receives the expected payoff  if the opposition rebels ( and ). One could extend the model to assume that losing office incurs an arbitrary (and perhaps even uncertain) loss on the incumbent, which could represent, for example, the risk of prosecution as a result of losing the office. While this more general specification would yield additional insights on how the incumbent's incentives to commit fraud would be driven by the cost of losing office, it would not influence the key logic of the model.         "
"9","The monitor's payoff depends on the extent of election fraud, the monitor's partisan biases (captured by parameter β), and her concern for post‐election conflict (captured by parameter ). Negative values of β indicate that the monitor prefers that the incumbent is removed from office (pro‐opposition bias). Positive values of β mean that the monitor prefers that the incumbent stays in office (pro‐incumbent bias). When , we say that the monitor is politically impartial. When , we say that the incumbent is “conflict‐neutral,” and when , we say that he is “conflict‐averse.” Note that the payoff for the conflict‐neutral and impartial monitor ( and ) depends only on the incidence of fraud, which is captured by the indicator function , which is equal to one if the incumbent commits fraud and equal to zero otherwise.         "
"10","Finally, the opposition receives the payoff equal to one if the incumbent steps down () or the payoff equal to zero if the incumbent claims office and the opposition accepts this claim ( and ). If the incumbent claims office and the opposition starts a conflict ( and ), the opposition receives the payoff equal to .         "
"11","The monitor's role in this model is to provide information about election fraud (or, equivalently, about the incumbent's true electoral support).7 The monitor does not observe the level of fraud directly, but instead receives a noisy signal  correlated with the amount of fraud . The signal s is drawn from the distribution  with the associated density . We assume that the density f has the monotone likelihood ratio so that the signal of fraud s is informative about the extent of fraud (or, equivalently, about the incumbent's true vote share).            "
"12","Assumption 2.The distribution  has full support for each , and the likelihood ratio  is strictly decreasing for , .               "
"13","The monitor's signal s could inform her that the incumbent would likely not have won without stuffing the ballot boxes or rigging the vote count, for example. Alternatively, signal s could represent the result of an exit poll conducted by the monitor. In this case, a low‐value signal s would mean that only a few people in the exit poll reported that they voted for the incumbent. A high discrepancy between the official claim that the incumbent won the election and the result of the exit poll would indicate that the incumbent perhaps would not have won without fraud.         "
"14","Having observed the signal of fraud s, the monitor issues a monitoring report , where  means that the monitor criticizes an election and  means that she endorses an election. Alternatively,  could mean that the monitor does not disclose evidence of fraud or does not report that the incumbent's support in exit polls is low. Our modeling approach where the monitor provides a binary judgment about the democratic quality of elections follows the previous literature (Chernykh and Svolik 2015; Hyde and Marinov 2014). In reality, election monitors not only judge whether elections were clean or fraudulent, but they also provide quite extensive reports. For example, reports by the European Organization of Security and Cooperation provide incredibly detailed accounts of the legal and logistical framework in which elections take place and review the overall political environment in the country, in addition to assessing whether they think elections did or did not fulfill a democratic standard. To fully capture this reality, we would need to assume that the monitor's action space consists of some arbitrarily large set of possible messages. However, as we show in Online Appendix A.1 in the supporting information, the simplifying assumption that the monitor makes a binary judgment does not introduce a significant loss of generality.         "
"15","The players take actions in the following order: (1) the incumbent observes his vote share ν and chooses whether to step down, , or to claim office, , where claiming office after losing an election () requires him to commit fraud; (2) the monitor observes a signal s and decides whether to endorse the election, , or to issue a critical report, ; and (3) after observing the monitor's report m and its opportunity cost for conflict c, the opposition decides whether to accept the election result, , or to reject it and start a conflict, .         "
"16","Each player's strategy is a mapping from his type space to a binary action. The incumbent's strategy assigns action  if and only if  and action  otherwise, where . The monitor's strategy assigns action  if and only if  and action  otherwise, where . Finally, the incumbent's strategy is a mapping from his type c and the monitor's message m to a binary action , such that it assigns an action  if and only if  for . The equilibrium concept is the perfect Bayesian equilibrium (henceforth, equilibrium).            "
"17","Lemma 1. ([Monotone Strategies])In any equilibrium,  iff , where ,  iff , and  iff , .               "
"18","The lemma states that the incumbent will step down if and only if his vote share, ν, is sufficiently low, the monitor will issue a critical report if and only if the monitor observes a sufficiently low value of the signal s, and the opposition will start a conflict if and only if its cost of conflict, c, is sufficiently low. Notice that the opposition's cut‐off  depends on the message by the monitor: If the monitor endorses the election, the opposition's cut‐off is , and if the monitor criticizes the election, the opposition's cut‐off is . We use , , and  to denote the equilibrium strategies of the incumbent, the monitor, and the opposition, respectively.         "
"19","Figure 1 displays the structure of the game. When the incumbent claims victory (), the other two players do not know whether he has actually won the election  or lost and committed fraud (). The monitor's cut‐off  represents her endogenously chosen standard for democracy. When  is low, the monitor behaves very leniently and endorses the election even when there is strong evidence of fraud by stating, for example, that “significant progress was observed despite some shortcomings.” Conversely, when  is high, the monitor behaves very critically and condemns elections as “lacking democratic content,” even if the evidence to support such judgment is weak. Finally, the opposition's cut‐off  represents the maximum cost the opposition is willing to pay in order to gain political office by force. For example, a high value of  could indicate that the opposition would forgo the opportunity to take the office by force because it assigns a significant value to peace and stability. This could also mean that the opposition has a low capacity to mobilize or a low motivation for conflict.         "
"20","To gradually build the intuition about the logic of the model, we start with a benchmark model without a monitor. We then describe the curse of the strategic election monitor. Finally, we identify the exact alignment of the monitor's objectives that allows her to circumvent the curse."
"21","Without the monitor, the incumbent does not face the risk that election fraud will be revealed to the opposition. Yet, despite being able to completely hide fraud from the opposition, the incumbent will not always want to commit fraud after losing an election. Since the incumbent's expected probability of prevailing in conflict is increasing with his vote share, the incumbent who has lost elections by a large margin () knows that he is likely to be defeated in conflict. The incumbent who lost an election only by a thin margin () will be tempted to commit fraud, as he can be relatively sure to prevail in conflict. The equilibrium behavior of the incumbent provides the opposition with partial information on the incumbent's true vote share in the election. This way, the incumbent's decision to use fraud is endogenously constrained by the threat of violence from the opposition.            "
"22","To see this point, let  denote the probability that the opposition would prevail in a conflict against the incumbent given the latter's cut‐off strategy :               "
"23","Proposition 1. ([Benchmark])In the model without the monitor, there exists a unique equilibrium given by the incumbent's cut‐off  and the opposition's cut‐off  where                     "
"24","               "
"25","Proof.All proofs are provided in the supporting information. "
"26","Depending on the exogenous parameters of the model, the game has two kinds of equilibrium outcomes. If the incumbent's deadweight cost of conflict is small, , then he commits fraud irrespective of the margin by which he lost the election, . However, if the incumbent's cost of conflict k is sufficiently large, , then the incumbent commits fraud only after losing the election by a small margin, . Whether the condition  holds depends on the shape of the distribution H, from which the opposition's cost of conflict is drawn. When the opposition's opportunity cost of conflict is likely to be small (H increases steeply), the incumbent is restrained from using fraud precisely because of the high risk of post‐election violence. This underscores the importance of violence as an endogenous deterrent against the use of fraud in contexts where external constraints, such as effective courts and free media, are absent (cf. Chernykh and Svolik 2015). As we proceed to argue now, election monitors can deter fraud and prevent violence only when they can strategically exploit this threat of violence posed by the opposition.            "
"27","The previous discussion demonstrates that the incumbent's decision to commit fraud and the opposition's decision to use violence are intrinsically connected. If the incumbent commits only a small amount of fraud (the cut‐off  is large), then the opposition is less motivated to start a post‐election conflict. This suggests that the monitor can motivate the opposition to be less violent by inducing the incumbent to be less fraudulent. We refer to the monitor who can have such impact on the behavior of the incumbent and the opposition as “effective.”               "
"28","Definition 1. ([Effective Monitor])Let  and  denote the equilibrium strategies of the incumbent and the opposition, respectively, in the model with the monitor. The monitor is effective if  and/or  for some .                  "
"29","The monitor is effective only if the incumbent commits less fraud and/or the opposition commits less violence because of the monitor's report, m. The monitor can induce the opposition to abstain from violence by endorsing the election, and she can induce the incumbent to commit less fraud by threatening to expose fraud and thereby increase the risk of violence. Whether the opposition and the incumbent will act on the basis of the monitor's report depends on whether they find it credible, in equilibrium.            "
"30","Let  denote the opposition's posterior belief that it would prevail in a conflict after the monitor issues a report m, conditional on the incumbent's and the monitor's cut‐offs  and . If the monitor issues a positive report, , the opposition believes that it can win with the probability               "
"31","Proposition 2. ([The Interim Curse])The monitor is effective only if, by criticizing elections, she can increase the risk of violence: .                  "
"32","The above result is quite unintuitive because it implies that the monitor's behavior has two opposing effects on the calculus of the opposition. Whenever the monitor is effective (), the opposition expects that the incumbent has committed less fraud than he would have in the absence of the monitor in equilibrium. Given this inference, the opposition is less willing to use violence precisely because it knows that the effective monitor has reduced fraud—this is the strategic effect of monitoring, which drives the opposition to use less violence. On the other hand, the monitor can deter fraud only if, by criticizing elections, she can induce the opposition to believe that the incumbent did commit fraud—this is the informational effect of monitoring, which drives the opposition to use more violence after the monitor criticizes the election. For the monitor to be effective, the latter informational effect must dominate the former strategic effect.            "
"33","Now consider how the expectation of the interim curse spills over into the monitor's reasoning of what she can attain ex ante, that is, before the election. The ex ante risk of conflict is the probability of a post‐election conflict, in equilibrium before the nature realizes the value of ν:               "
"34","Proposition 3. ([The Ex Ante Curse])The monitor can reduce the ex ante expected risk of violence across all elections only if she increases the risk of violence in fraudulent elections.                  "
"35","The ex ante curse of the election monitor is a direct consequence of her interim curse: If the monitor's actions do not increase the risk of violence in fraudulent elections, then she cannot be effective, which means that she cannot reduce violence (and fraud) in any elections. The monitor can reduce the risk of post‐election violence by discouraging fraud and by endorsing elections that she perceives as nonfraudulent. However, this implies that in those cases where the monitor does perceive elections as fraudulent, her critical report must incite violence.            "
"36","Given the monitor's curse, we now consider how the preferences of the monitor must be aligned for her to be able to make elections less fraudulent and less violent. We start with the conflict‐neutral monitor, who is not directly concerned with violence prevention and who only cares about deterring election fraud and, depending on her partisan biases, might also be concerned with who holds the office after the election."
"37","To minimize the equilibrium level of fraud, the monitor needs to incentivize the incumbent who has lost elections by a large margin to abstain from claiming office. To see how such incentives can be created, consider the interim utility of the incumbent who received ν votes:               "
"38","The larger the interim risk of conflict, the less willing the incumbent is to risk a conflict by committing fraud. This logic is demonstrated in Figure 2, which shows the best responses for the monitor and the incumbent. When the monitor is either very lenient (uses low ) or very tough (uses high ), the incumbent's most favorable response is to commit more fraud—use a low cut‐off . This is because an endorsement of an election by a very lenient monitor or condemnation of an election by a very critical monitor carries little information about the actual extent of fraud. In the extreme cases, as the monitor's cut‐off  approaches zero or one, the incumbent increasingly responds by using the same amount of fraud as he would in the model without monitors, . However, whenever the monitor's cut‐off is in the interior, the best response of the incumbent is to commit less fraud than he would have without the monitor, .            "
"39","Best Responses of the Incumbent, , and the Monitor, .                        "
"40","Note:  is the incumbent's equilibrium cut‐off in the game without the monitor.                        "
"41","The monitor must respond to each cut‐off by the incumbent in the way that forces the incumbent to use a high cut‐off . When the incumbent's strategy is to commit fraud even if he receives few votes ( is low), the monitor's reports are least informative about the actual extent of fraud because the opposition already infers that fraud was likely from the incumbent's strategy. In this case, to impact the beliefs of the opposition, the monitor must adopt a very lenient strategy by setting a low  because a critical statement by a lenient monitor implies that the evidence of fraud must be very strong. Conversely, when the incumbent is using a high cut‐off , the monitor cannot use a lenient strategy because the opposition already expects the fraud to occur with a low probability. To make an impact in this case, the monitor must use a tough strategy (set high ). Ultimately, the monitor selects the interior cut‐off , inducing the incumbent to choose the largest cut‐off . However, as the next proposition shows, the monitor will be unable to select the fraud‐deterring cut‐off, in equilibrium, unless she has no partisan biases.               "
"42","Proposition 4. ([Conflict‐Neutral Monitor])There exists an equilibrium in which a conflict‐neutral monitor  is effective if and only if she is also impartial  and , where .                  "
"43","Two conditions must hold for the conflict‐neutral monitor to be effective. First, the incumbent's cost of conflict k must be sufficiently high so that , or else the incumbent commits fraud irrespective of the margin by which he lost elections. Without monitors, the incumbent abstains from committing fraud when his margin of loss is large only if . Since , some incumbents who would commit fraud when the monitor is absent would be deterred from doing so when the monitor is present.            "
"44","Second, the monitor must be politically impartial, . A monitor with a pro‐incumbent bias () would not criticize elections after observing evidence of fraud () because such reporting would lead to a conflict that is likely to remove the incumbent. Knowing that the monitor with pro‐incumbency bias would not expose fraud, the opposition would simply ignore the monitor's endorsement of elections, rendering the monitor's positive report on elections redundant. Equivalently, a monitor with a pro‐opposition bias () would criticize elections even without observing evidence of fraud (), which would render her critical report noncredible.            "
"45","We now consider the model where the monitor is conflict‐averse, that is, where her utility function factors in a deadweight loss  due to a post‐election conflict. The fear of a post‐election conflict incentivizes the conflict‐averse monitor to abstain from criticizing elections when she expects such criticism to cause violence. In this case, the monitor's curse kicks in with full force: The conflict‐averse monitor does want to prevent violence ex ante, but she can only do so by inciting more violence in some elections ex interim. The conflict‐neutral monitor can prevent violence precisely because she is indifferent toward it, whereas the conflict‐averse monitor finds it more difficult to prevent violence precisely because she wants to prevent it. Despite this curse, however, even the conflict‐averse monitor can be effective if her other objectives are “correctly” aligned.               "
"46","Proposition 5. ([Conflict‐Averse Monitor])When  and , there exists an interval  such that an equilibrium with effective monitoring exists if , where . Moreover, there exists the level of pro‐opposition bias  such that there exists an equilibrium with the incumbent's cut‐off equal to , which is the highest equilibrium cut‐off induced by the conflict‐neutral monitor.                  "
"47","The main message of this proposition is that the conflict‐averse monitor can be effective only if she is moderately biased toward the opposition. The logic behind this result centers on the key role of commitment. An impartial monitor is unable to criticize elections after observing evidence of fraud, even if ex ante committing to such strategy could actually reduce the expected levels of conflict. A monitor with pro‐incumbency bias would be even less willing to criticize elections, because that increases the risk of conflict and also increases the risk of the incumbent's losing office through a conflict. A monitor with strong anti‐incumbent bias (β is a large absolute value and negative) is also ineffective because she has an incentive to criticize elections even without strong evidence of fraud, rendering such criticisms noncredible. Thus, only a monitor with a moderate bias against the incumbent has a well‐balanced incentive to credibly criticize elections when she observes evidence of fraud and to endorse elections when she does not observe such evidence.            "
"48","It is instructive to compare the cases of the conflict‐neutral and the conflict‐averse monitor. Whereas partisan biases render the conflict‐neutral monitor ineffective, the conflict‐averse monitor cannot be effective unless she is moderately biased. It is very intuitive to think that election monitors can foster a self‐enforcing democracy only if they aim to make elections less fraudulent and more peaceful, and that monitors can be credible only if they are impartial. However, this intuition fails in a strategic context where the monitors' credibility is not a given feature (i.e., when we do not assume that the monitor is going to be credible simply because she is impartial), but an endogenous outcome.            "
"49","The most interesting implication of the above argument is that, while the effective monitor (with well‐aligned objectives) always causes more violence ex post fraudulent elections, by doing so she can actually reduce the ex ante expected risk of violence across all elections. In contrast, the ineffective monitor (with misaligned objectives) will not cause an uptick in violence ex post fraudulent elections, but elections observed by such a monitor can be more violent on average. To illustrate this point, Figure 3 demonstrates how the ex ante expected risk of post‐election violence varies between the ineffective and effective election monitor given the equilibrium strategies of all players. The figure is based on a parametric example, which assumes that , , and . We show how the ex ante risks of conflict vary as a function of the incumbent's cost of conflict, k.            "
"50","As the incumbent's cost of conflict increases, the ex ante risk of post‐election violence attenuates because the incumbent becomes more apprehensive about facing post‐election conflict, and, thus, he is more likely to step down peacefully after losing an election. More importantly, for any cost , the ex ante risk of post‐election violence is strictly smaller when the monitor is effective compared to when she is ineffective. This result stems from two sources: First, the effective monitor creates stronger incentives for the incumbent to step down after losing elections, thus preempting the start of a post‐election conflict. Second, the effective monitor also creates stronger incentives for the opposition to accept the incumbent's claim to office after clean elections, so that the losers of elections do not act as “sore losers” who claim that elections are fraudulent anytime they lose. However, as the monitor's curse dictates, the effective monitor can achieve this only by increasing violence in fraudulent elections. The ineffective monitor faces a lower risk of violence in fraudulent elections, but a greater risk of violence across all elections on average. Consequently, the ineffective monitors will be blamed for not being able to prevent violence, whereas effective monitors will be blamed for causing violence in those elections that they do criticize, despite reducing the average risk of violence.            "
"51","In deriving the above results, we have assumed that election monitors are driven by partisan biases, in addition to their concern about election fraud and post‐election conflict. However, instead of partisan biases, election monitors could be driven by a genuine procedural preference for democratic accountability—that is, by a preference that a true winner of elections holds political office. If we think of democratic accountability in terms of the citizens' being able to “throw the rascals out,” we can model this alternative consideration by assuming that the monitor suffers a loss  whenever the incumbent who was actually voted out () remains in office. As the next proposition shows, even in this case, the monitor faces very similar trade‐offs and curses as in our earlier analyses.               "
"52","Proposition 6. ([Democratic Accountability])A conflict‐neutral monitor can be effective only if she is not concerned with democratic accountability, . A conflict‐averse monitor can be effective only if she is moderately concerned with democratic accountability, .                  "
"53","The most remarkable result in the proposition is that the monitor who is excessively concerned with holding incumbents accountable to the electorate (A is large in absolute value and negative) will not exert any influence on either the incumbent or the opposition. The reasoning here is that such a monitor will tend to overcriticize elections in order to increase the likelihood that the incumbent who lost elections is removed from office. Furthermore, the monitor who is not concerned with post‐election conflict can actually be more effective if she does not care for democratic accountability, because caring for accountability would motivate her to criticize elections even without strong evidence of fraud. Thus, only the monitor with a moderate preference for accountability is incentivized to provide sufficiently credible information about election fraud and, in effect, make the incumbent more accountable.8"
"54","The monitor's curse carries important implications for the empirical work on election monitoring and post‐election violence. The existing literature shows that exposure of election fraud by monitors increases the risk of post‐election protests and violence (Daxecker 2012; Hyde and Marinov 2014). One interpretation of these findings is that election monitoring causes post‐election violence. However, our model provides a contrasting insight into the meaning of these results. Just because violence is more likely to occur in elections where monitors do expose fraud does not imply that monitors cause more violence on average across all elections. We suggest that the opposite is likely to be the case: The positive empirical correlation between fraud exposure and the uptick in post‐election violence implies that monitors probably make all elections less violent, on average.         "
"55","To make this point transparently, let  denote the expected amount of violence, in equilibrium, after elections where the incumbent does not step down (i.e., in cases where the opposition has a reason to start a conflict). Using the law of iterated expectations, we can express this quantity as            "
"56","First, notice that the expected violence decreases as the effect of fraud exposure on post‐election violence () increases. The latter is precisely the empirical quantity that has been modeled previously in the empirical literature. If this estimate is positive and statistically significant, then it indicates that monitors are reducing, not increasing, the overall levels of violence. This is because monitors not only make violence more likely in fraudulent elections, but they also make violence less likely in clean elections.         "
"57","Second, there is an indirect selection effect of election monitoring on post‐election violence that is ignored when one compares violence across elections endorsed and criticized by monitors. Notice that the risk of violence is decreasing in the probability that the monitor exposes election fraud, . Since the effective monitor reduces fraud in equilibrium, the probability of fraud exposure decreases when the monitor is effective. Thus, election monitors reduce violence across all elections by making fraudulent elections less frequent—increasing the probability . The existing empirical evidence says that election monitors do deter fraud (Asunka et al. 2014; Enikolopov et al. 2013; Hyde 2007), which suggests that this selection effect could be quite substantial.         "
"58","In sum, the positive empirical correlation between the exposure of fraud by monitors and post‐election violence indicates that election monitoring is making elections more peaceful, not more violent, on average. By increasing the risk of violence in fraudulent elections, monitors create incentives for governments to run cleaner elections and simultaneously incentivize election losers to peacefully accept the results of clean elections. Due to this reduction in the incidence of fraud and the incidence of violence ex post clean elections, we should expect that elections observed by effective monitors will be both less fraudulent and more peaceful on average. However, in those cases where the monitors do claim that elections are not clean, the politicians, the media, and likely the international community will attribute the resulting violence to the actions of the monitors—this is the essence of the election monitor's curse.         "
"59","The goal of this article was to identify the trade‐offs that strategic election monitors face and determine what types of election monitors can be expected to exert a positive impact on elections despite these trade‐offs. To make any election less fraudulent and more peaceful, election monitors must cause more violence in some elections. Because of this curse, only election monitors with very specifically aligned preferences can contribute to a self‐sustaining democracy. In contrast to conventional wisdom, we found that monitors who care about post‐election violence might be less effective than those who do not care about it. We also found that monitors who are moderately biased might be more effective than those who are impartial. In conclusion, to promote a self‐enforcing democracy, election monitoring requires well‐aligned objectives and an inconvenient commitment to cause a few conflicts in order to prevent many.         "
"60","These results offer several new insights on what it takes for election monitoring to work as a viable instrument of democracy promotion. First, successful election monitoring requires a dual commitment. Monitors themselves should be able to commit to criticizing elections even at the risk of sometimes causing violence. But successful monitoring also requires a commitment from those who monitor the monitors—the media, the donors who support election observation missions, and the public—to accept that sometimes post‐election violence will increase because of election monitoring. Those who monitor the monitors should also expect that the governments pliable for election fraud will blame election monitors for post‐election violence.         "
"61","Second, election monitoring can potentially be made more effective by strong delegation. The key problem that a monitor with misaligned objectives faces resembles that of a government unable to commit respect to property rights (North and Weingast 1989) or to keep a low rate of inflation (Kydland and Prescott 1977). Even if committing to such policies would benefit the government ex ante, it has the preference to renege on the commitment ex post. The canonical solution to this credible commitment problem is to delegate some authority to agents who do not have a preference for ex post reneging. Similarly, the election monitor with misaligned objectives (who cannot credibly commit to expose fraud) could attain credibility by delegating the task of judging elections to agents who are indifferent about the interim consequences of these judgments. In practical terms, this kind of delegation would require observers to be highly technocratic and to follow very narrowly defined procedures with little individual discretion.         "
"62","The findings in this article also suggest several new implications for empirical work. First, the positive empirical correlation between criticisms of elections by monitors and post‐election violence is highly consistent with what we would expect if monitors were effective at reducing the average levels of violence across all elections. Second, our analysis indicates that, depending on their objectives, strategic monitors will use different standards to judge whether an election is fraudulent or not. Empirical research aggregating judgments by multiple monitors (e.g., Kelley 2012) should take into account the heterogeneous and endogenously determined standards used by monitoring agencies with different political objectives.

"63","There are several directions in which this research agenda could be productively carried forward. First, elections are rarely monitored by a single organization, and various organizations often disagree on how to evaluate the very same election (Kelley 2009b). Introducing multiple election monitors with competing objectives is technically complicated, but it would be important to know whether having multiple monitors alleviates the curse that individual monitors face. Second, we considered the case where election fraud is committed only by the incumbent, but the strategic interactions could become quite different once both the incumbent and the opposition are able to engage in fraud. Finally, we only considered a model in which both election fraud and monitoring are highly centralized, which is not always the case empirically (Rundlett and Svolik 2016). Our model does capture the situations where the interests of local agents and the central decision makers are aligned (so that local representatives are perfect agents of the government), but not the cases where they are misaligned.
