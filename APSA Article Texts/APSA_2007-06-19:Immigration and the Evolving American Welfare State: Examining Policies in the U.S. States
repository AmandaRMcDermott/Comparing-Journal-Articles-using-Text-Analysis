"1","PRWORA was part of the larger “devolution revolution.” Under PRWORA, state governments increased their roles in formulating and implementing various elements of welfare policy. That discretion included a number of decisions regarding immigrants' eligibility for welfare programs during the first five years of residence when immigrants were not covered by federal funds. Setting immigrant eligibility and benefit levels are complex decisions in which states were allowed to provide benefits to recent immigrants—but those benefits would have to be paid for by the states. In addition, benefit levels for natives and for immigrants who had been recipients in the prewelfare reform period would be subject to the fiscal restraints of the new “block” grants provided by the federal government (these block grants, also part of the welfare reform initiative, replaced the previously existing categorical grants). In short, the states faced a new and distinct set of policy questions about how to address novel immigrant considerations with states' expanded welfare discretion, and in a historical context where race has been a very salient dimension of welfare policy. The new policy flexibility thus provides a rather unique natural experiment from which to gain insight into welfare policy in America. Including recent immigrants in welfare provisions could lead to fewer funds available for other services and potentially factor into benefit levels for all welfare recipients. Whether and why states chose to use that discretion poses substantive and theoretical questions that are significant in their own right, but that take on yet greater significance when situated within broader intellectual and public policy debates about the appropriate bounds and extent of racial/cultural equality concerns in the contemporary American welfare state, and in western democracies more generally.         "
"2","A number of social theorists criticize policies targeted on the basis of racial/ethnic background, often referred to as “multicultural policies” (MCPs), as opposed to allocations made on the basis of economic need per se. Decisions about immigrants' eligibility for programs, such as welfare, may not technically qualify as multicultural by most definitions in that eligibility is formally linked to immigration status and not to a particular racial/ethnic background. However, if particular racial/ethnic groups are, or are perceived as, the primary or disproportionate beneficiaries, the policy may be seen as essentially a multicultural policy, as has been the case of blacks and welfare policy in the United States (cf. Gilens 2003, and see below). Because immigration to the United States over the last generation is so heavily from Latin America, and Mexico in particular, policies regarding “immigrants” may be viewed effectively as policies regarding “Latinos” (Hajnal, Gerber, and Louch 2002). Moreover, the negative effect of Latino population size on welfare‐benefit levels (Fellowes and Rowe 2004; Soss et al. 2001) combined with immigrants' greater use of social welfare benefits during the 1990s (Borjas and Hilton 1995) links Latinos and immigrants to the realm of American social welfare policy.            "
"3","Social theorists' criticisms of racial/ethnic‐based policies are based on one or both of the following reasons. A first, directly normative, challenge made by social theorists is that multicultural‐type policies violate liberal theoretical principles because eligibility for the policies is not determined by what are deemed as appropriately universal criteria, such as financial need, but rather on the basis of racial/ethnic traits. Those who make this claim even include some who generally support a robust welfare state. A second criticism of race‐based policies focuses on their alleged impact on support for the welfare state; i.e., the adoption of such policies is said to fragment an already divided polity and erode the political coalitions that might otherwise support a strong(er) welfare state (Barry 2001; also see Banting and Kymlicka 2005; Wilson 1987).            "
"4","One can infer that the critics who make the former, normative claim would suggest that nonsupport of multicultural‐type policies would (legitimately) be based foremost on fundamental principles, values, and ideological premises such as basic fairness, individualism, a commitment to formal egalitarianism, and similar beliefs that are central elements of the “American Creed” (Barry 2001; cf. Sniderman, Crosby, and Howell 2000), although this creed can and has often coexisted comfortably with racial prejudice and inequality (cf. Smith 1993). In general, variation in the inclusion of immigrants as well as in benefit levels would presumably follow a pattern of more liberal states offering both greater inclusion and higher benefit levels compared to more conservative states.            "
"5","Critics making the second claim—that MCPs erode support for the welfare state—base their argument in several causes. Banting and Kymlicka (2005) identify ways that, according to critics, the adoption of MCPs allegedly erodes support for welfare. One explanation for the erosion is a “corrosive” effect in which support for welfare diminishes as welfare benefits are viewed as being directed to “other” groups to a greater degree than one's “own” group. This effect is said to be especially accentuated with the adoption of race‐based policies because such policies heighten the visibility of target groups and in many cases are seen as (questionably) expanding the coverage of welfare benefits to target populations (Wolfe and Klausen 1997). Whatever the specific grounds, the outcomes asserted by the erosion claims remain the same; MCPs are inversely related to (more general) welfare policies. The erosion model implies that a general liberal ideological orientation leads to more inclusive welfare policy but that broader support diminishes if and as certain racial/ethnic groups are included or singled out as beneficiaries. The United States is often put forth as a leading example of the negative impacts of racially/ethnically targeted policies on support for welfare policies.            "
"6","A substantial body of scholarship demonstrates that race fundamentally shaped the broad design and evolution of the American welfare state (Lieberman 2003; also see Katznelson 2005; King and Smith 2005; Wolfinger 1974). This “racialized” legacy of welfare policy arguably broadened and became more explicit over time, coinciding with the expansion of welfare and the more extensive inclusion of blacks as recipients, and concomitant with the emergence of multicultural policies in the 1960s (Gilens 2003; Skrentny 2002). Until the 1960s, poverty was overwhelmingly portrayed as a “white problem” according to Gilens (2003). But “beginning in 1965, the media's portrayal of American poverty shifted dramatically. Although the true racial composition of the American poor remained stable, the face of poverty in the news media became markedly darker between 1965 and 1967” (Gilens 2003, 101–2). Welfare and race became increasingly conflated and seen as closely linked (Gilens 2003).            "
"7","A sizeable body of research also attests to the ongoing significance of race for welfare policy in the American states, often finding that larger racial minority group presence is consistently associated with less generous welfare policies. The evidence indicates this was so under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the long‐standing major welfare policy (Johnson 2001, 2003; Keiser, Mueser, and Choi 2004), and continued after welfare reform in 1996, embodied in the adoption of the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF, part of PRWORA). Analyzing TANF policies, Soss et al. (2001) found that higher percentages of African Americans on state welfare rolls were related to several areas in which states have increased discretion: stricter sanctions, stricter time limits, and family caps. Similarly, states with higher percentages of Latino welfare recipients tended to have stricter time limits and family caps; higher percentages of each of the two groups negatively affect cash benefit levels as well. In short, race/ethnicity was consistently associated with the various welfare (sub)policies examined (Soss et al. 2001, 385–89). Fellowes and Rowe (2004) reaffirmed these findings regarding “the strong role of race in TANF politics,” as seen in three dimensions of the policy. A higher percentage of African‐American recipients leads to (a) stricter rules governing initial eligibility, (b) less flexibility in new welfare work requirements, and (c) lower cash benefits to welfare recipients. This study also finds a negative relationship between the percentage of welfare recipients who are Latino and cash benefit levels (Fellowes and Rowe 2004). The general importance of the size of black populations on these dimensions of the welfare reform policy is clear, and similar patterns extend to the presence of Latino populations as well.            "
"8","Along with the developments in welfare reform, reactions to multiculturalism policy in, and within, the United States began to be evident in the mid‐1980s; a leading example is the adoption of “Official English” or “English Only” policies. A stream of federal and state laws, judicial decisions, and administrative regulations were largely sympathetic to language rights from the 1960s into the 1970s. Over time, however, opposition to multiculturalism measures developed. The perceived emphasis on “cultural maintenance” (rather than on “learning English”) implied by programs such as the Bilingual Education Act (1967) symbolically “repudiated the ‘melting pot’ as a normative ideal in favor of a ‘multiculturalism’ conception” (Citrin et al. 1990, 537).            "
"9","During the 1980s and 1990s, adoptions of Official English laws spread across the states. While legislative actions defeated such proposals in states with substantial language minority populations, conservative states and states that allowed for mechanisms of direct democracy generally adopted such laws (see Citrin et al. 1990; Preuhs 2005; Tatalovich 1995). In all, about half of the 50 states now have adopted Official English laws. Research also suggests that the adoption of Official English laws was closely tied to resentment toward racial/ethnic minority groups (Preuhs 2005; Tatalovich 1995) and the foreign‐born population (Schildkraut 2001); the impact of ideology per se, as suggested in Citrin's analysis, is not especially apparent in these research findings (cf. Hero 1998, 2003). The 1990s also witnessed other important developments restricting multicultural‐type policies. Most conspicuously, California's Proposition 187 (1994) eliminated undocumented immigrants from eligibility for public services. Other California ballot measures in the mid‐ to late‐1990s ended affirmative action and also dramatically restricted bilingual education. In short, in the American context and the states in particular, the impact of race/ethnicity on welfare policies and racially tinged decisions among other matters is well demonstrated.            "
"10","This pattern of opposition to MCPs is consistent with the general impact of racial and ethnic factors on American social policy. Accordingly, a racial explanation of states' anti‐MCP actions regarding inclusion and benefit levels seems quite plausible: minority group size, particularly the size of cultural minorities, will be negatively associated with both the extent of immigrant inclusion for welfare and the overall cash benefit levels."
"11","Theoretical arguments and previous empirical findings regarding race, culture, and social welfare policy suggest similar explanations for the two policy decisions separately—regarding immigrant eligibility, and cash benefit levels. However, the separate issues of inclusion and benefit levels allow for and seem to require a unique test of each explanation with distinct combined hypotheses. Each model predicts that macropolitical processes link constituent pressure to policy decisions in distinctive ways. Differing policy decisions are thus attributable to broadly ideological, racial, and ethnic diversity, or erosion processes that emerge from constituent pressure. Below, we construct testable hypotheses derived from the three theoretical models presented in the previous section—(1) that an ideological basis for constituent pressures (the ideological model) exists, (2) that constituencies are reluctant to provide benefits, and expand benefits, as a high percentage of minorities (or immigrants) make it more likely that recipients will be racial minorities (the racial diversity model), and finally, (3) that even if constituents are liberal, the inclusion of more target (noncitizen) groups will reduce the generosity of benefits (the erosion model)."
"12","An ideological interpretation, which is also consistent with the normative critique of racially/ethnically based policies, implies that decisions about granting welfare benefits to immigrants should vary according to the ideological orientations of the states' citizenry as governments respond to their pressure; ideology should similarly affect decisions about benefit levels. Specifically, states that are more ideologically conservative would be expected to be less willing to include immigrants for welfare and would also have lower cash benefit levels; more liberal states would be expected to be more “inclusive” and to provide higher benefit levels (as has been consistently demonstrated in previous research; see, e.g., Erikson, Wright, and McIver 1993).            "
"13","The racial/social diversity thesis predicts that since minority groups are generally perceived to benefit inordinately from social welfare programs, decisions regarding both inclusion and benefit levels are affected primarily by the size of racial/ethnic minorities who are perceived to be disproportionate beneficiaries. As dominant groups perceive a link between the size of racial and ethnic minority groups and the size of welfare beneficiaries and associated costs, they will vary their eligibility and benefit levels accordingly. The general expectation is a negative relationship between the size of the minority population and indicators of inclusion and benefit levels since the dominant group seeks to restrict economic resources and policy distributions to minority groups (Fellowes and Row 2004; Giles and Evans 1986; Hero 1998).            "
"14","Finally, the erosion argument assumes that the formal targeting or specific identification of groups for inclusion based on racial or ethnic/cultural considerations diminishes support for social welfare programs more generally. This model in turn suggests that while ideology will shape decisions about inclusion, the degree to which racial or ethnic/cultural groups are included will diminish the level of benefits. The two policy choices individually and combined call for unique predictions for each policy. Specifically, liberal ideology will produce welfare policies for immigrants that allow for eligibility for a broad set of immigrants, but as the immigrant population increases across states, and thus the potential beneficiary group increases, broad benefit levels will decrease. These models are assessed in a way that provides original evidence on the theoretical underpinnings and potential interconnections of race, immigration, and the welfare state."
"15","The core questions examined here concern (a) states' decision on the eligibility of immigrants for welfare (in the first place) and (b) whether adoption of immigrant eligibility for welfare affects support for welfare policy in general. To address these questions in light of the theoretical propositions discussed above, the analysis first examines the degree of immigrant eligibility in state social welfare programs. The measure of immigrant eligibility is then employed as an independent variable to test the second set of hypotheses regarding the effect of the inclusion of immigrants on welfare benefit levels."
"16","The first set of analyses focuses on states' policy decisions regarding the eligibility of immigrants for various social welfare programs. Since individual policies may not adequately capture the overall level of inclusion, we gauge the degree to which states included immigrants in social welfare programs by constructing a factor score based on nine social welfare policies aimed at immigrants that were in place by the fall of 1998. The specific components of this Immigrant Welfare (IW) scale are whether states provided the following to immigrants: state‐funded TANF during the federally imposed five‐year bar on immigrant welfare eligibility; TANF after the federal five‐year bar; state general assistance benefits; state‐funded food stamps; a substitute program for Supplemental Security Income (SSI); state Medicaid funds during the five‐year bar; Medicaid funding for nonemergency care for some undocumented immigrants; state‐funded health care programs; and state‐funded prenatal care. Individual policies were coded 1 if they were in place and 0 otherwise. (The appendix, Table A1, provides descriptions of the policy items included in the scale, sources, and summary statistics.) There is a great deal of variation across the states in terms of individual immigrant welfare programs, and thus a scale best captures the states' overall disposition towards inclusion.         "
"17","The factor‐score approach provides a broad indicator of the inclusion of immigrants in the social welfare programs in each state and is based on the first factor of a principal components factor analysis of the nine policy items. The factor scores for the states range from −1.11 to 1.67, with higher numbers indicating more inclusive social welfare policies. Analyses of both Eigen values and the scree plot reveal that these nine policies are indeed captured by a single dimension. The Eigen value for the first factor is 2.56, while the second factor's Eigen value is .67 and diminishes thereafter. Moreover, interitem reliability is quite high, as demonstrated by a Cronbach's Alpha of .75. In short, the IW scale, while varied in terms of particular policy items, is a reliable measure of a state's general policy orientation regarding immigrant inclusion in social welfare programs.1 This measure serves as the dependent variable in the first analysis, regarding the determinants of immigrant inclusion; it then serves as a key independent variable when we analyze our second set of questions regarding the impact of inclusion on overall benefit levels.         "
"18","The theoretical models presented above lead to two unique hypotheses regarding the effects of ideology and racial/ethnic factors on the degree of inclusion of immigrants in social welfare benefits. To test these claims, the IW scale is modeled as a function of ideological and political variables, racial/ethnic and immigrant population size, and a set of socioeconomic, need, and political variables that are common in studies of social welfare programs."
"19","Two of the models we test indicate that states with more liberal orientations provide a greater degree of inclusion for immigrants in social welfare programs. The normative/ideological model is derived from criticisms of MCPs broadly (see Barry 2001; cf. Sniderman, Crosby, and Howell 2000), which imply that if a state's collective view is that a policy choice to make immigrants eligible for welfare is seen to violate its basic “principles” by favoring certain groups, as the normative critics of multicultural‐type policies suggest, then the state (with its discretion under welfare reform) can choose not to do so and thus not contradict, and instead adhere to, its sense of fundamental values. In short, liberal states will be more likely to include immigrants under social welfare programs while conservative states follow their ideological orientation and deny benefits to immigrants. The erosion model leads to a similar hypothesis, predicting that eligibility will be related to ideology, with recipient population size as a factor in the second, benefit level, decision. The primary measure of ideology in this analysis is Berry and colleagues' (1998)Citizen Ideology score, where higher values indicate more liberal states.            "
"20","A racial/social diversity model argues that it is not the policy itself (as the normative critics would say) but the policy's recipients that explain (non)support for immigrants' policy inclusion (cf. Hero 1998; Sears, Sidanius, and Bobo 2000). The traits of the recipients—here immigrants, and immigrants who are disproportionately of Latino background—explain policy decisions, and the size of the immigrant population is expected to be one of the more influential factors. Thus, the racial diversity model predicts that the level of inclusion will be negatively related to the size of the perceived minority/immigrant recipient base. The analysis relies on two measures of the potential size of the recipient base. First, since the policies examined explicitly include noncitizen immigrants, the percentage of each state's population that is noncitizen immigrants, Noncitizen Immigrants is included in the model.2 Second, with Latinos as both a large segment of the immigrant population and the subject of resentment in welfare benefit levels (Fellowes and Rowe 2004), Latino Population is included in the model. The measure is the percentage of each state's population that is Hispanic/Latino. Both measures would be expected to produce negative effects on immigrant inclusion in welfare programs according to the racial/social diversity model.            "
"21","In addition to these three key variables, the model also accounts for a set of alternative interpretations. Chief among the alternative explanations are the characteristics of the political institutions that ultimately decide if immigrants are included under the state's social welfare programs. Partisan makeup of the state legislature is controlled for by including the variable Percent Legislature Democratic, which is the percentage of legislative seats held by Democrats; in general, a positive relationship with both dependent variables would be anticipated because greater Democratic Party presence is commonly associated with more inclusive or expansive policies and increased social spending. The example of the old South indicates that one‐party (Democratic) dominance alone, however, does not necessarily lead governments to act in certain ways if party competition is not also relatively high. Party Competition is also controlled for in the model since greater competition between parties has been shown to increase welfare generosity (Holbrook and Van Dunk 1993); if the parties are seeking favor with a growing minority population and with potential future voters (if and as immigrants become citizens), more inclusion could well follow. Parties may also compete for the votes of current citizens, particularly Latino and foreign‐born citizens who are sympathetic to immigrant rights. Higher values of this competition variable indicate greater balance between Democrats and Republican seats held in the state legislature.            "
"22","In addition, a new, distinct variable was created to measure state policies towards immigrants in other policy areas; this Multicultural Disposition index includes policies concerning language, education, and some “recognition” policies (as is described in the appendix, Table A2). Higher values on this index indicate states with higher degrees of responsiveness to cultural minorities in other policy areas; we would expect higher scores on “disposition” to be associated with more immigrant inclusion for welfare since these are states with a record of inclusion, albeit in other policy areas. Urbanization and Education levels are included in the models to control for the degree of “cosmopolitanism” in states that may, for various reasons, be more accepting of immigrant inclusion. These variables are measured as the percent of the state's population living within urban areas and the percentage of the state's population with at least a high school diploma, respectively. Since less generous welfare provisions are associated with the size of the African‐American population, we also include Black Population, which is the percent of the state's population that is black. Previous research has also suggested that policies are influenced by neighboring states' policies (Berry and Berry 1990), and we control for this possible diffusion effect by including the mean value of IW policies for neighboring states, Neighbors' Immigrant Welfare Policy. And, since states bordering Mexico, and those with major ports, are subject to a greater immediacy in terms of immigration flows, these factors are accounted for with the dummy variables Mexico Border and Port. Finally, “need” is captured by two variables, Unemployment and Caseload. Unemployment is the unemployment rate in the state, while caseload is the number of TANF recipients per 10,000 residents.            "
"23","The model of immigrant inclusion in social welfare programs is estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The state‐level analysis relies on data from 47 states, excluding Nebraska, Alaska, and Hawaii due to limitations on available data. Temporal causality is maintained by lagging the year in which the independent variables are measured, with the exception of the broad indicator of multicultural disposition which includes policies from a variety of years, and the noncitizen immigrant population which is available only for 1996 (Urban Institute 1999). Formally, the analysis models the degree to which states include immigrants in social welfare programs as follows:               "
"24"," Table 1 presents the results of the analysis. Model 1 is the baseline model of the control variables. The baseline model produces three significant variables. States with higher levels of urbanization, education, and caseloads tended to adopt more inclusive welfare policies. This model also explains a respectable 66% of the variance of the IW scale. Model 2 adds the ideological component to provide a preliminary evaluation of the normative/ideological and erosion explanations. As predicted by these models, the citizen liberalism scale is positively associated with the IW scale; the ideology variable, however, only adds 2% to the explained variance compared to the baseline model. Model 3 presents the baseline model and introduces the variables utilized to test the racial/social diversity argument.3 The results suggest little support for the racial/social diversity explanation for state decisions to include immigrants in their social welfare programs. While both coefficients are negative as predicted, neither is statistically significant. (This finding also undercuts a different, “mobilization” argument [not discussed above]—that larger minority [Latino] populations might push for, and succeed in, increasing welfare eligibility for immigrants, which would be indicated by a significant positive relationship.)            "
"25","Models 4 and 5 present the results of models that include all three variables of interest. Model 4 utilizes all 47 states in the sample. Since the results may be influenced by a few cases, Model 5, which excludes five observations that seem to be the most influential, is also presented. Both models come to the same conclusion regarding significant factors and highlight the robustness of the findings.4 Echoing the results of the baseline model, urbanization, education, and caseload are significant. While these results may indicate greater acceptance of immigrants in more cosmopolitan areas, they may also simply suggest that more educated and urbanized states have a greater need for immigrant labor, particularly in the service sector. Which of these two interpretations best explains the willingness to extend welfare eligibility cannot be answered definitively with the present data. However, for the purpose of this study, the positive and significant effects of ideology, and the lack of significant effects of racial/ethnic and immigrant demographic characteristics are notable. Citizen ideology continues to exert significant influence in the model, even after controlling for noncitizen and Latino populations. Again, the immigrant and Latino populations produce negative coefficients but are not significant. These results generally provide the strongest support for a cosmopolitan/need‐based interpretation, given that caseload, education, and urbanization are the most consistently significant variables. While the finding that caseload helps explain immigrant welfare eligibility might appear unremarkable, recall that states have discretion over the eligibility of citizens (nonimmigrants) as well as immigrants, and can therefore choose to include more or fewer of either and thus shape the composition or profile (nonimmigrant versus immigrant) as well as the aggregate size of the caseload. Moreover, if states were indeed concerned about high caseloads, then the extension of benefits may very well be negatively related to lagged caseloads.            "
"26","Support for the normative/ideological as well as the erosion theories is also evident. Liberal states tend to be more inclusive with their welfare benefits than conservative states. This offers support for earlier research regarding ideology and welfare policy (Erikson, Wright, and McIver 1993), but is in contrast to research that has found that more liberal ideology does not explain social policies as they affect relative outcomes for racial minorities (Hero 2003). Whether ideology continues to drive the decision about welfare benefit levels after spurring greater inclusion or if the racial composition of the potential recipients offsets the effect of ideology is the next test for assessing the validity of the competing interpretations. The absence of a significant relationship between multicultural disposition and immigrant welfare eligibility is also notable and perhaps somewhat surprising; such a disposition might be expected to spill over to immigrants, but that is not the case, suggesting a different view of individuals already established in the United States (citizens) versus relative newcomers (immigrants).            "
"27","Once decisions are made about greater availability of social welfare programs to immigrants, do those decisions affect cash benefit levels? The models discussed above offer different predictions about the effects of ideological and racial/ethnic and immigrant demographic variables. Ideological interpretations predict that liberal states will provide generous benefits, regardless of the groups that are included; or, conversely, states with conservative ideological orientations would be consistent in providing less generous benefits as they are restrictive in terms of eligibility. The erosion model predicts that while ideological orientation may drive decisions about eligibility, greater access to social welfare programs will result in lower overall benefit levels because the additional recipients are frequently perceived as being from “undeserving” racial/ethnic minorities and/or immigrant groups. Finally, the racial/social diversity explanation predicts that racial/ethnic group population size will be negatively associated with benefit levels (although an analogous impact was not found in the analysis of the IW eligibility scale)."
"28","To test these propositions, the maximum cash benefit level for a family of three under the TANF program is employed as the dependent variable. Cash benefit levels provide one of the most visible and valid policy indicators of welfare benefit generosity that are under the control of the state (Rom 2004, Plotnick and Winters 1985). Benefit levels have also been linked to both black and Latino caseload size, which allows for a test of the racial/social diversity model. Thus, our dependent variable is the 1999 maximum TANF cash benefit level for a family of three, which is subsequently adjusted for the cost of living in each state using Berry, Fording, and Hanson's (2000) state consumer price index. To ensure temporal causality and a recursive design, the IW scale and the remaining variables are measured for the year 1998, with the exception of the 1996 observation of the noncitizen population variable. However, since there is a potential for states to anticipate future cash benefit levels, and thus adjust policies regarding inclusion, we also present results of a 2SLS instrumental variable procedure. The basic model of interest for both estimation procedures is formally presented below.               "
"29"," Table 2 presents the results of the analysis of benefit levels. Cells contain the unstandardized OLS or 2SLS coefficients, as noted, and their standard errors. Note that a consumer price correction does not exist for Alaska and Hawaii, and thus they, as well as Nebraska, are excluded from the analysis for a total of 47 states (Models 1, 2, and 3).            "
"30"," Table 2, Model 1 presents a basic model without the interaction term between the IW scale and the noncitizen population. Notably, the IW scale does not show any relationship to states' cash benefit levels. Most other variables—including size of the noncitizen immigrant population and ideology—do not show any relationship either. Variables that do affect cash benefit levels are political competition, black and Latino population, unemployment, states that border Mexico, and a states' neighbors' mean cash benefit level. This preliminary evidence provides little support for the models discussed above, with the exception of the impact of black and Latino population size, which tentatively supports the racial/ethnic diversity thesis.            "
"31","Model 2 introduces the interaction term with the OLS estimation procedure. The interaction term captures instances where both inclusion and immigrant population are high and is thus predicted by the erosion thesis to dampen overall support for welfare‐benefit levels. Including the interaction term increases the variance explained in the model slightly, boosting the R2 from .47 to .51. Moreover, the interaction between the IW scale and the noncitizen immigrant population variable is negative and significant, while the respective baseline terms are not significant; this result appears in line with the erosion model.            "
"32","While the variables are measured at various points in time to ensure temporal causality, there is still the possibility that either the decision regarding benefit levels affects the degree of inclusion, or that the use of the IW scale as both an independent variable and a dependent variable biases our results. Neither of these concerns is born out in the diagnostics for our models. A Hausman specification test revealed no reverse causality, or simultaneity, between the benefit level and the IW scale. It seems that the temporal sequencing is sufficient to negate this concern. Nevertheless, as a precaution against simultaneity, we employed instrumental variables in a 2SLS regression to estimate the model. Model 3 in Table 2 presents the 2SLS regression estimates. Using lagged education, urbanization, and Berry and colleagues' (1998) citizen ideology variables as instruments, few substantive changes in the estimates were revealed.6 Note that with the exception of unemployment, all the significant variables from Model 2 remain significant, in the same direction, and the effects are of about the same magnitude.            "
"33","One final statistical issue is the extent to which specific observations influence our results. A particular red flag regarding this concern is the unexpected positive and significant relationship between states that border Mexico and cash benefit levels. Examination of Dfits and Cook's D statistics indicated that California was an extremely influential observation.7 California was thus excluded from the analysis of both OLS and 2SLS models, with results presented in Models 4 and 5, respectively. A substantial portion of the pertinent findings do not change, and the discussion will focus on the results in Model 5 since it provides the most rigorous set of constraints on our estimation procedure.            "
"34","The results indicate that while more “cosmopolitan” and more liberal states adopted more inclusive policies, those same inclusive states tended to provide less generous welfare benefits when the inclusive policy could affect large numbers of immigrants, as indicated by the negative coefficient for the interaction term. The results also provide support for the racial/social diversity argument in terms of benefit levels. Like other studies (Fellowes and Rowe 2004; Soss et al. 2001), the analysis indicates that states with a higher percentage of blacks in their population tended to provide lower benefit levels to welfare recipients. Latino population size is also a negative factor, but just shy of statistical significance (p < .06, one‐tailed). Party competition drops from significance in Models 4 and 5, and thus political institutional orientations or competition does not affect cash benefit levels.            "
"35","While more liberal states, and states where education and urbanization are higher tended to adopt more inclusive eligibility policies, the indirect effect of these factors on benefit levels is negative in states with large noncitizen immigrant populations; cosmopolitan and liberal states seem to be inclined toward following their fundamental political orientations in the eligibility stage, but these inclinations are offset when benefits are potentially disbursed to relatively large racial/ethnic and cultural minorities. This finding regarding benefit levels is more consistent with research indicating that (liberal) ideology has virtually no predictive impact as policies pertain more directly to spending that is most relevant to racial groups (see Hero 2003) than when social/welfare policy is examined more generally (cf. Erikson, Wright, and McIver 1993). And, interestingly, the impact of these two sets of variables on benefit levels is essentially the reverse of what was found regarding inclusion/exclusion (above).            "
"36","How substantial are the effects of inclusion and minority population size on cash benefit levels? For the size of the black populations, the effect is quite substantial. The difference between states in the bottom 10th percentile in black population size and the 90th percentile is $333 per month, all other factors held constant. Given that the standard deviation for the adjusted TANF cash benefit levels in 1999 is $292, these are substantial changes attributable to racial/ethnic population size that closely match previous findings (Fellowes and Rowe 2004). Moreover, such an amount would surely seem consequential for a family of three that must rely on this assistance to meet their monthly financial needs and obligations.            "
"37","The effect of noncitizen population size is conditioned by the degree of inclusion of immigrants in the states' social welfare programs. Since the IW scale has a range of −1.11 to 1.67, across states that have less inclusive welfare policies regarding immigrants (negative values of the IW scale), noncitizen populations are positively associated with cash benefit levels. In states with more inclusive social welfare policies (positive values of the IW scale), noncitizen populations dampen this positive effect and are even negatively associated with cash benefit levels in the most inclusive states. However, the significance of this relationship can change across values of the IW policy as the conditional standard error changes (Friedrich 1982). The positive relationship between immigrant population and IW scale is found to be significant when the IW score is less than 0.0 (p < .10) or −0.1 (p < .05). The negative relationship is significant when the IW score is larger than 1 (p < .10) or 1.4 (p < .05). As expected, erosion seems to occur when levels of generosity are relatively high.            "
"38","To more precisely interpret the conditional nature of this relationship, Figure 1 presents the estimated marginal effects of the noncitizen immigrant population size on cash benefit levels for the bottom 10th percentile of the IW scale (−1.10) and the 90th percentile of the IW scale (1.40). Both are in ranges where the conditional effect is significant. The conditional coefficients are calculated using the baseline coefficient for noncitizen population size (β2= 31.59) and the coefficient for the interaction term (β3=−90.41). Thus, the conditional marginal effect of the noncitizen population on cash benefit levels is calculated as (β2+β3* IW) * (Noncitizen Immigrant Population). The conditional effects of the noncitizen population size are quite striking. Across states in the bottom 10% of the IW scale, an increase of one standard deviation in the noncitizen population (sd = 3.74%) results in approximately a $491 increase in the monthly cash benefit level. However, in the 10% of states with the most inclusive social welfare policies, a one standard deviation increase in the noncitizen population leads to a $356 decrease in cash benefit levels. Taken together, the conditional impact of a one standard deviation increase in noncitizen population can lead two states with diverging decisions about noncitizen inclusion to differ by almost $847 in monthly cash benefits, all other factors held constant. This difference grows as the increase in noncitizen population is extrapolated beyond one standard deviation. While the conditional coefficients differ from zero at various levels of IW policy, the point on the IW scale where a positive conditional coefficient transforms into a negative one is at a value of approximately 0.04, or in 42% of the states.

"40","These findings are further supported in Figure 2, which presents scatterplots and bivariate linear predictions of the observations included in Model 5 of Table 2 for noncitizen population and TANF cash benefit levels for states in each of the four quartiles of the IW scale, from the least inclusive (Panel 1) to the most inclusive quartile (Panel 4). Note how the pattern between noncitizen population and cash benefit levels changes across levels of the IW scale, from positive relationships in Panels 1 and 2, to negative relationships in Panels 3 and 4. These graphic relationships conform quite well to the substantive effects estimated through the regression analysis and provide visual confirmation of our statistical results.            "

"42","This study shows that understanding the relationships and interconnections of race/ethnicity, immigration, and welfare policy in the American states is complex and eludes simple description and explanation (cf. Tichenor 2002). At the same time, the analysis provides some theoretically provocative findings and nonfindings.         "
"43","Generally, the findings of this study seem most consistent with an “erosion model.” As predicted by the erosion model, liberal states were more likely to adopt inclusive social welfare policies, as evidenced by the significant effects of citizen liberalism on the IW scale. However, in states where inclusion of immigrants is more extensive and the noncitizen population is larger, there is a reduction in cash benefit levels. Ideology plays a modest role in the decision to make immigrants eligible for welfare, but it does not, contrary to expectations of the ideology/normative thesis, affect the benefit level once we account for the inclusion and size of the potential recipient pool. The significant and negative effects of minority group size on welfare benefit levels are consistent with the racial/social diversity model. But the absence of a significant negative effect of the noncitizen population on the inclusion decision is not consistent with an overall reaction against minority (racially or culturally) population size. (Although it may be that pragmatic considerations of the need for service sector labor plays a role here as well.) In short, the evidence points to a “cosmopolitan,” need‐driven, and partly ideological basis for inclusion. But that is substantially tempered by lower benefit levels in states that both include immigrants in their social welfare programs and have a relatively large noncitizen population. States thus appear to act somewhat in accordance with their ideological leanings but only to the extent that potential costs in terms of redistributive benefits are relatively low or are perceived to benefit nonminority or immigrant groups. When the costs of inclusion are high, benefit levels are reduced.         "
"44","These results are reminiscent of a widely held interpretation of the cause of variation in welfare generosity in the American states historically (cf. Albritton 1990). Southern states with large black populations objected to providing African Americans substantial redistributive benefits. Decisions regarding eligibility were shaped by national standards of need but states had significant control over eligibility and a great deal of operational discretion over who was to get benefits and under what conditions. A major option for Southern states was to mitigate the impact of redistribution by adopting meager benefit levels. Thus, Southern states, in response to their large African‐American population and having limited power to exclude minority groups, tended to provide relatively low levels of welfare benefits to a large number of recipients. This phenomenon appears to again be manifest under the welfare reform regime as suggested by the negative effects of population size on benefit levels and the key finding that greater inclusion of immigrants leads to lower welfare benefit levels in states with the most inclusive immigrant eligibility programs. That this is the case regarding immigrants (not blacks) and in cosmopolitan, liberal settings (not the old South) is quite remarkable. This suggests an intersection of race/ethnicity and welfare policy (with reforms granting states increased discretion) that echoes but is also substantially different from what has been the case historically because immigration, and perhaps certain immigrant groups, introduce distinct political dimensions (cf. Tichenor 2002).         "
"45","Understanding this dual‐decision process required a more nuanced examination of several major models that may explain the intersection of race/ethnicity, immigration, and welfare decisions in the American federal system. It also suggested the need for novel additional variables not previously included in welfare policy analyses (e.g., an immigrant eligibility indicator and a multicultural disposition indicator) that we created. The analysis highlights the need for better models by examining the determinants of inclusion in social welfare programs, unlike other studies that focused on benefit levels alone. While the racial/social diversity model holds in the analysis of benefit levels, the erosion model is perhaps the best explanation for variation in both the inclusion and benefit decisions.         "
"46","These findings seem at once paradoxical yet not surprising. American values regarding redistributive policies are strongly influenced by an ideology of individualism but also acknowledgement that certain circumstances may require governmental action. While the United States often considers itself a “nation of immigrants,” that outlook has historically been tempered in that not all immigrant groups were equally embraced (Smith 1993) and their distribution and social/political situations across the states may differ considerably. And, American welfare policy has been profoundly shaped by racial considerations. This study suggests how these, and other, social and political phenomena are more or less relevant and intertwine to shape immigrant eligibility and other dimensions of the evolving American welfare state.
