"1","For our analysis, we set aside the question of how individuals solve the coordination and free‐riding problems associated with protest (Bueno de Mesquita 2010; Chong 1991; Hardin 1996; Kuran 1989, 1991, 1995; Schelling 1960; Tucker 2007) and instead focus on the incentives to protest in a setting where these collective action problems are solvable. We begin with the question of why individuals who chose at time t to engage in a protest that ends up being successful might choose not to engage in protest at time t+1. Put another way, ought we to expect Tunisians to return to the streets in five years if they are similarly dissatisfied with the performance of their next government?11"
"2","We can, of course, easily come up with some trivial answers to this question. If in the intervening time since the original successful protest the cost to individual citizens of protesting has increased—e.g., the government has started shooting everyone who participates in a protest12—then it will not be surprising to find citizens choosing not to participate in a future protest. Similarly, if we set the costs of protest in the future low enough—e.g., imagine a “negative cost” where everyone is paid $5,000,000 to participate in protests—then people will indeed turn out to protest again. Another uninteresting scenario is one where following the original successful protest, citizens are completely satisfied with the performance of their new government; here again, we would not expect to see citizens taking to the streets to replace a government of which they approve.         "
"3","The more interesting cases, however, are ones in which the new government is not “good,” and the costs of protest have not changed significantly since the original protest. In a stationary setting, we would expect to see the exact same pattern of behavior as in the original protest, i.e., citizens taking to the streets to throw the “bad” government out of office. So why, then, absent the obvious reasons mentioned previously, would we ever witness protest in one period followed by nonprotest in the next period even though government performance between periods has not improved? A natural question to ask, and one that motivates the remainder of this article, is what could citizens have learned in the meantime that could have caused them to react to similar stimuli with a different response?"
"4","It is possible that citizens could learn something about the quality or “type” of their current government. By this we mean that citizens may have acquired new information that leads them to either upgrade or downgrade their assessment of the government. For example, they may have learned that it is quite responsive, effective, efficient, concerned about citizen welfare, and seems to obey the rules. Alternatively, they may have learned that it is unable to obtain results, sloppy, disinterested, slow, uninterested in citizen welfare, and willing to engage in corruption."
"5","The central intuition of our argument, however, is that as a consequence of learning about this particular new government, citizens may also be updating their beliefs about the universe of potential governments, or put another way, about the entire distribution of potential governments in their country. Thus, by seeing that the new government performs poorly, they may decide that subsequent governments are also more likely to perform poorly. Moreover, we contend that this updating about the distribution of potential governments is likely to have a larger effect in new democracies than in old democracies. In established democracies, where voters have experience with many democratically elected governments, a single new observation is simply that: one additional observation. In new democracies, by contrast, citizens have very little information about whether democratically elected governments can be of a “good” type. They know that the previous regime produced at least one “bad” government (and, in many cases, multiple bad governments). However, they may hold out hope that having not only gotten rid of one “bad” government, but also changed regimes as well, the new era or political institutions will usher in a period of “good” governments. Finding out that this new government—we can think of it as the first government of a potentially democratic era—is also “bad” could have a devastating effect on people’s beliefs about the potential for good government under the new regime in their country. Simply put, the blame for previous bad governments may shift from the nature of the previous regime to just the belief “that’s the way things are in this country.” And if all governments are just going to turn out to be bad, then why bother taking to the streets?13"
"6","As an example, consider the comments of Olena Tregub, writing in the Kyiv Post after Yanukovich’s 2010 victory in Ukraine. She notes that Ukrainians’“gloomy mood” about their political options was nicely captured by a new joke making the rounds: in terms of the election, “there is good and bad news: the good news is that Yulia Tymoshenko didn’t become a president, the bad news is that Viktor Yanukovych did.”14 The joke perfectly captures the spirit of our intuition. Even though neither of the heroes of the Orange Revolution, Tymoshenko and Viktor Yushchenko, were exactly new to the Ukrainian political scene in 2004, at the time they represented the promise of a new regime. By 2010, though, Ukrainians were sufficiently disenchanted with the promise of that regime—Yushchenko did not even make it to the second round of the presidential elections—that now Tymoshenko and Yanukovych were being mentioned in the joke almost interchangeably.15 The promise of something new had turned into “there’s nothing new.” Similarly, in regard to Niger, Davis and Kossomi write that “Because of the extreme dissatisfaction of the body politic with the dire economic situation and political gridlock of the mid‐1990s, Baré [the leader of the 1996 coup] was granted a honeymoon period”(2001, 82). Again, dissatisfaction with the performance of the democratic regime apparently undermines people’s incentives to undertake costly action in the future.         "
"7","In the following section, we formalize this argument. To be perfectly clear, our goal is not to explain what happened in Ukraine or Niger per se but rather to understand what features make it more or less likely that other cases will follow a similar path to these cases. As with any formal model, we abstract a bit from the richness of any real‐world example of the behavior we are trying to understand. One simplification is that in the third section, we employ a three‐period model; we do, however, remove this simplification in the fourth section. A second, and perhaps more important, modeling choice is the decision to focus on pure adverse selection. Here we do not treat government policymaking as a strategic choice variable; rather, it is determined by the type of government. We do so in order to highlight the importance of assumptions about what citizens are learning: we wish to present the simplest model possible to deal with learning and adverse selection before moving on to richer, but much more complex, models that combine questions of adverse selection and moral hazard. And while it is certainly possible that governments may restrain from pursuing bad behavior in the second period because they anticipate the possibility of future protest, our focus in this article is clearly on the actions of the protestors: given certain behavior by the government, when will citizens choose to return to the streets and when will they not?"
"8","Nevertheless, we believe the model captures many of the most interesting features of the dynamics described above and leads to a number of interesting observations, which we discuss in greater detail in the following section. Overall, then, the goal of the analysis is to better understand how a few features of the environment—features that have very natural empirical referents—can be related to protest dynamics."
"9","We now consider a stylized model to focus on some of the key trade‐offs in the previous discussion. This analysis illustrates how two different features can sometimes support the one‐shot‐deal behavioral pattern. The first feature is the value of the future. It is possible for citizens to be willing to protest in one period and then not protest in the future if in the second period their concern for downstream outcomes is smaller than it was in the first period. Second, and more subtly, citizens may be willing to protest early and then lose their taste for such actions if they are learning about the political environment (and not just about particular individuals). If, following a protest, the new government also turns out to be “bad,” this may lead the citizen to believe that most “new” governments are likely to be bad and thus the price of protesting is not worth paying."
"10","Drawing on the idea that electoral fraud can serve as a focal point to help solve coordination problems (Tucker 2007), we abstract away from the complexities of coordinating a protest and focus on a single representative citizen, v. The citizen lives for three periods. In each of two periods, , the citizen experiences government performance and must decide whether to replace the government (by undertaking a costly protest) or retain the government for the next period. In period t=3, the citizen consumes the performance (as in the earlier periods) but takes no actions (think of the citizen as dying before the chance to replace the government or just not caring about all periods after t=3). We also look at the case where the citizen is short‐lived or myopic, meaning that at any period in which she must decide whether to protest, she cares only about the next period of government performance.         "
"11","As discussed previously, we treat the performance of any particular government as exogenous. In particular, the performance of a new government in period t is  with  We let gt=1 denote a well‐behaved government and gt=0 denote a corrupt one. The payoff to the citizen from a government with performance level gt is just gt. We assume that the performance of a particular government is persistent or perfectly correlated over time, so that the performance of a particular government in period t (if it is retained) coincides with its performance in period t−1.16 If, however, a government is replaced, then the new government’s type is a new draw (taking the value 1 with probability ). To capture a situation in which the citizen faces uncertainty not just about a particular government but also about the pool of possible governments, we allow for the fact that  itself is unknown to the citizen. The citizen has a prior belief about this parameter, namely, she starts the game with the belief that  with 0< l< h<1. Let  and . It is natural to interpret  as indicating that governments tend to be bad, i.e., there is a low probability that any particular government is good, and  as indicating that there is a high probability that any government is the good type. In each period, the citizen observes gt and decides whether to replace the government by protesting or to accept the government for the next period. We assume that a protest is costly to the citizen and denote this cost by c. The parameters l, h, q, c allow us to see how changes in the form of uncertainty and costs influence citizen behavior. In particular, as l and h get closer together or q gets close to 0 or 1, there is little uncertainty about the underlying distribution from which government types is drawn. As l, h, and/or q increase, government quality improves on average (and thus, so do the expected gains of replacing a low‐quality government relative to the cost of protesting). Finally, as c increases, protestation becomes more costly relative to the potential gains of improving the quality of government.         "
"12","The model is a fairly simple, extensive‐form game with imperfect information. As such, it is natural to focus on perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBE). Accordingly, in making decisions at any history of the game, the citizen selects actions which are optimal given her beliefs about  as well as the type of government in office, and these beliefs are consistent with Bayes’ rule (when it is defined). In principle, one might want to appeal to a refinement, but since the government(s) do not actually make decisions in this game, there is little gain to strengthening the rationality requirement beyond PBE.         "
"13","We begin by considering the subforms in which a citizen is in the second period. At any of these histories, the citizen has observed the draw g1, and she has observed g2 with the latter coming either from the same government or the result of a replacement. She has, thus, seen either one or two draws from the distribution of government qualities. There are a total of eight distinct histories or combinations of realizations of random variables and previous actions that may have occurred prior to the second period. Equilibrium strategies depend on beliefs that are defined for each of these histories. At each such history, the citizen has an assessment of both the quality of the current government as well as an assessment of the underlying parameter  We denote a history in the following manner, (g1, r, g2) where gi denotes, as before, the service level from the government in period i, and  denotes whether the government was replaced in period 1; let 1 denote a replacement and 0 retention. Accordingly, when r=0, then g1=g2, and when r=1, they are different draws from a Bernoulli process.         "
"14","The assumptions that performance is persistent and protesting is costly make two conclusions immediate. If g1=1, then the citizen will not protest, and the government will endure for all three periods, providing good performance in each period. A sample path of performance like this is as good for the citizen as possible. Moreover, if the government is replaced and then g2=1, then the new government will not be replaced. Accordingly, the only interesting histories are the two in which the previous government or governments has/have provided poor performance, and the citizen must decide whether to protest or not. Letting Q denote a belief about  i.e., an assessment of the probability that  held by a citizen in period 2, the expected payoff of protesting is Qh+(1−Q)l−c, whereas the expected utility of retaining the incumbent performing at g2=0 (which will result in g3=0) is 0. We will now pin down appropriate equilibrium values of Q."
"15","The posterior probabilities that  conditional on histories of this form are given by Bayes’ rule as follows.            "
"16","Observing two episodes of poor performance with replacement is a worse signal about  than two periods of poor performance without replacement. In other words,  Or, put more intuitively, observing two different governments in a row that perform badly is a stronger signal that one is living in a country with a low‐quality distribution of potential governments than simply observing the same government continue to perform poorly over two periods. Accordingly, if protesting is a best response following poor performance and replacement, then it is also a best response following poor performance and no replacement. Conversely, if protesting is not optimal following poor performance without replacement, then it is also not optimal following poor performance with replacement. The intuition behind these conclusions rests on the fact that it is only when the citizen believes that it is sufficiently likely that a replacement will be of type gt=1 that she is willing to suffer the costs of a protest. So the higher she believes the probability is that , the higher the net expected payoff to protesting. The relevant comparison following two failures and replacement is that a protest is optimal if            "
"17","Our key interest is in the possibility that a citizen would find it worthwhile to protest early but then after observing poor performance would chose not to protest again. In order to investigate when this pattern of behavior can be supported in this model, we focus on the possibility that the citizen optimally decides not to replace a government following g2=0 (specifically at the history (0, 1, 0)). This requires that            "
"18","Following g1=0, the assessment is as follows. A protest involves cost c and will lead to g2=1 and g3=1 with probability            "
"19","Alternatively, with probability 1−P, it will lead to g2=0 and g3=0. Moreover, given that g2=0, the citizen will then decide not to protest (under the assumption in 5), which implies that g3=0. So the expected utility to protesting at this information set is Ph2+(1−P)l2−c. Accordingly, protesting at this first history is optimal if            "
"20","Thus, the inequalities 5 and 7 characterize the requirements on the parameters in order for the citizen to protest following g1=0 but not following the history involving g1=0, replacement, and g2=0."
"21","These conditions can be rewritten as             "
"22","One important observation is that when there is no aggregate uncertainty about the distribution from which governments are drawn—just uncertainty about the realization of any individual government—these inequalities reduce. In particular, as h and l converge to z, we have the following limit:            "
"23","In particular, if the citizen can only learn about a particular government and not learn about future governments, the pattern of protesting in the first period and then deciding not to protest following another failure relies just on the fact that costly activity early has more value because there are more periods from which to gain from replacement. This type of rationale is less likely to persist in a model without an explicit endpoint, i.e., an infinite horizon problem. It could, however, survive in a model in which discount values change as one ages (perhaps capturing the idea that the value of the future is proportional to the probability of being alive in the future). If the citizen is short‐lived, then the condition reduces to , and the existence of a cost that supports this pattern of behavior is “knife‐edged,” requiring c=z."
"24","On the other hand, when there is uncertainty about the distribution that governments are drawn from and the citizen can update about the nature of the distribution, the rationale for this pattern of behavior does not hinge on the fact that costly action is less profitable later in the game. In particular, if the citizen is short‐lived—captured by the assumption that at any period she only cares about policymaking in the next period—the relevant constraint is            "
"25","In order for there to exist a range of values of c satisfying these inequalities, we need            "
"26","This is true as long as             "
"27","This condition is true as long as l< h. Inspection of the previous inequalities produces some comparative statics on how the exogenous parameters influence whether the one‐shot deal occurs in equilibrium.         "
"28","If there is no aggregate uncertainty about the distribution from which governments are drawn (l=h) and the citizen is short‐lived, then no generic values of c satisfy the two inequalities. The difference between the right‐ and left‐hand sides of Inequality 12 can be conceived of as a function of q, h, l. For fixed values of h, l, this difference can be maximized by selecting  For example, if h=.75 and l=.25, a value of q=.839 maximizes the size of the interval of c’s for which the one‐shot scenario is an equilibrium phenomenon. If the values of h and l converge to, say, .6 and .4, then the maximizing value of q reduces to .648. Interestingly, for fixed values of l, h, the size of the set of costs that yield the one‐shot deal is not monotone. Moreover, the fact that the value of q that maximizes the size of this set is typically not  captures the fact that left‐ and right‐hand sides of Inequality 12 typically have different partial derivatives with respect to q.17 Of course, as the cost c vanishes or gets extremely large, it will fall outside the interval defined by Inequality 11. We will say more about comparative statics in the next section.         "
"29","So what can this model teach us about our question of interest, i.e., whether citizens in countries that have successfully used protest to throw “bad” governments out of office are likely to do so again in the future. The most interesting insight of the analysis is the idea that if citizens are likely to be learning not just about the quality of any particular government but also about the overall distribution of possible governments, then the one‐shot‐ deal scenario is possible. For people to bear the costs associated with a protest aimed at removing a government from power, they need to believe that the replacement government will be better; otherwise, there is no point in bearing the costs associated with protest. So while poor performance by a particular government is a bad signal about that government, it can also be a bad signal about governments in general. This connection is particularly plausible in settings where citizens believe they are experiencing a form of politics that differs substantially from the past.         "
"30","Somewhat counterintuitively, then, repeated failures in attempting to remove governments from office may increase the likelihood of protest in the future more than actual success! The logic here is that a failed protest leaves the same “bad” government in office and thus provides no new information for updating one’s beliefs about the universe of potential governments; put another way, citizens can continue to maintain the belief (fantasy?) that if only the good guys could throw the bad guys out of office, the possibility exists for a better government. However, once the good guys have actually thrown the bad guys out of office (i.e., in the terms of our model, once a bad government is replaced following period 1), then if the new government also turns out to be bad, it becomes that much harder to maintain the belief that if only the present government could be removed, there is a potentially better government out there that is likely to replace it.18"
"31","Another important finding from the model is that possibility of a one‐shot‐deal scenario unfolding increases as uncertainty about the pool of potential governments gets larger (i.e., as h and l are increasingly distinct from one another). If h and l are quite similar to one another, then the range of potential distributions of possible governments is quite small. We suspect that cross‐national as well as intertemporal variation in these parameters is important, as countries new to democracy (or any other particular form of governance) are likely to possess citizens with more uncertainty about what to expect from governments in general.         "
"32","In order to make the intuition as stark as possible, we developed the simple three‐period model of the previous section. It is natural to ask how these ideas might carry over to a setting in which there is a longer (perhaps indefinite) horizon. To answer this question, we extend the model. Now imagine that the citizen lives for an infinite number of periods,  , and that she discounts future payoffs with the discount rate . To keep things simple, we carry over as much of the structure of the previous model as possible. Thus, the performance of a government in period t depends only on whether its type is gt=1 or gt=0 and any particular government’s type is perfectly persistent. At the beginning of the game, the prior probability that any particular government’s type is gt=1 is . As before, we assume that the citizen faces uncertainty about this parameter, believing it is h with probability q and l with probability 1−q. At any period t, if a new government is drawn, its type is an independent draw taking the value 1 with probability .         "
"33","Unlike the three‐period model, here a citizen faces the decision to protest in every period  . Before thinking about optimal behavior for the citizen, it is useful to review the data that she has at her disposal in deciding whether to protest in period t. The history of observations that a citizen may condition her period t decision on includes the performance of the current government over its tenure, as well as the performance of all previous governments. Given the assumption of perfect persistence, it is clear that a sufficient description of the histories includes the number of candidates that the citizen has previously observed, N, the number that were well‐behaved, G, and whether the current government is well‐behaved or not, gt. We include the current government in these tallies. The first two quantities are sufficient for the citizen to update her beliefs about q, the probability that the next randomly chosen government will be good, and the last quantity informs the citizen about whether the current government is good.         "
"34","As in the simpler three‐period model, the choice of a citizen at period t when gt=1 is trivial. The current government is as good as they get, and thus the cost of protesting cannot be justified. Given this, a citizen who behaves optimally will never find herself at a history in which the record of previous performances included some good performances, yet the current government produced gt=0. To get to a history like this, the citizen must have mistakenly protested against a government that was going to produce good output in all future periods.19 Thus, the interesting histories are those in which the current government is performing poorly, gt=0, and all N previous governments performed poorly, G=0. It does not actually matter how many periods each of the previous governments served, as their first period of service provides the citizen with all of the relevant information about them as well as the distribution of government qualities.         "
"35","Given this argument, at a nontrivial history occurring in period t, the citizen faces the decision of protesting or retaining the current government and cares about the quantity N, as this will influence her beliefs about the value of . If she retains the government today, she will learn nothing, and thus the decision that she faces in period t+1 will look identical to the one she faced in period t (N is unchanged). This fact allows us to reach an important conclusion:         "
"36","Remark:  If in equilibrium at any history of t periods in which the current government has performed poorly, gt=0, it is the case that the citizen’s strategy is to not protest, then the citizen will never protest in any subsequent period. In other words, every equilibrium has the property that with probability 1, retention of a government is an absorbing state.            "
"37","More substantively put, this result tells us that rationality in this model does not produce sample paths of behavior in which we observe poor performances that do not lead to protests and that following yet another poor‐performing government citizens decide to protest, unless something about the underlying process has changed. This finding is then consistent with the one‐shot‐deal (or more aptly n shot deal) behavior, but it does not yet justify the conclusion that a citizen will ever start or stop protesting. To explore this possibility, we must characterize optimal protest rules as a function of N.            "
"38","We now gain leverage on the remaining open question about equilibrium: at what nontrivial histories will the citizen decide not to protest? From Bayes’ rule, we can compute the posterior probability that ,               "
"39","Importantly, this posterior is decreasing in N, capturing the feature that the larger the number of bad draws, the more pessimistic the citizen will become. It will be useful to add a time subscript to the quantity N, allowing us to keep track of the period at which the citizen has a history described by Nt. Given our remark, that not protesting is absorbing, we know that the future stream of payoffs to not protesting at period t with history summarized by Nt is just . Alternatively, the future stream of payoffs following protesting is c today and then  if in fact the next government turns out to be a good type. On the other hand, if the citizen protests and the next government produces gt+1=0, then the payoff will depend on whether the citizen is going to protest following Nt+1=Nt+1.            "
"40","Given the above conclusions, a characterization of the citizens’ strategy involves only specifiying how many consecutive periods the citizen is willing to protest, . In other words, following any good performance, the citizen will not protest, and the good government will continue to provide gt=1 in every subsequent period; if, however, she begins with a bad government, she will protest, and if the next government is bad, she will again protest until she has protested  times or been lucky and realized a good government (in which case she sticks with that government forever). If a good government has not been found by the th protest in subsequent periods, she will not protest and hence retain this bad government forever. Thus, there will be at most  protests, protests will be consecutive, and eventually protests will stop happening (by at least period ).            "
"41","To characterize this equilibrium value , we begin by setting up a simple dynamic programming problem. The continuation payoff, or expected value of the future stream of payoffs starting in the next period, will depend only on how many bad governments the citizen has currently observed. This connection stems from the fact that the citizen’s assessment of the probability that she will get a good draw in the next period depends on the number of bad draws she has already gotten (and in particular is decreasing in this quantity). Let V(N) denote this continuation value. In period t if the newest/current government is bad, the citizen’s continuation payoff is               "
"42","The payoff of 0 reflects the continuation payoff obtainable from not protesting and thus receiving gt=0 for all subsequent payoffs. The complimentary term captures the possibility of protesting at cost c, then either getting a good draw or a bad draw and optimizing in all future periods. The bad draw puts the citizen in a similar dilemma next period, albeit with the knowledge that there were N+1 bad draws.            "
"43","The most immediate way to solve for  is to use the fact that the citizen will never protest after period . In other words, . Thus, it is the case that  is the largest counting number for which,               "
"44","Substituting equation (14) into inequality 16 allows us to obtain a formula for . It is the largest counting number less than k where k solves the equation,               "
"45","Solving allows us to express  as the largest counting number less than k, , where               "
"46","Importantly, this quantity is finite (for any meaningful combination of parameters). This conclusion alone tells us that the citizen will eventually stop protesting. Two qualitative features of the equilibrium represent natural generalizations of the one‐shot deal. In equilibrium, a citizen will never protest after a period in which she did not protest a bad government, and after enough bad draws, the citizen will learn that the odds that a future government is good are too low to justify the cost of additional protests. Of course, this solution is not meaningful if k<1. In this case, the cost of even the first protest is too high, and the citizen will live with whichever government she gets in the first period. In order for  to be at least 1 (so that at least one protest is possible), we need . Substituting equation 18 into this condition, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the equilibrium to be such that the citizen will protest following at least the first poorly performing government:               "
"47","Inspection of inequality 18 illustrates that in equilibrium, the number of costly protests the citizen is willing to engage in, , is decreasing in the cost, c, increasing in the value of the future, , and increasing in the prior probability of h, parameterized by q. If we let  is sufficient for  to be decreasing in m. This conclusion mirrors the conclusion from the three‐period model and captures the fact that it is more likely for the citizen to quickly learn that protesting is not worth the cost when there is a lot of aggregate uncertainty (here parameterized by the gap between h and l). As in the three‐period model, we may ask what values of the parameters c, q, h, l produce the one‐shot phenomenon. Mathematically, this would involve simultaneously satisfying equation (19) and equating the left‐hand side of equation (18) with the value 1. The set of parameters satisfying these conditions is open, which indicates that even strictly speaking, the emergence of behavior that conforms to the one‐shot deal is not a knife‐edged phenomenon. More interestingly, equilibria will always have the flavor of n shot deals. The relevant comparative statics can be obtained from equation (18). The quantity, , is increasing in the patience of the citizen, , and decreasing in the cost of protest, c. In reasonable cases as the difference between h and l increases,  decreases. This last result captures the fact that as uncertainty about the distribution from which governments are drawn gets higher, the number of bad governments sufficient to discourage the citizen gets smaller.            "
"48","In the aftermath of events like the Arab Spring and the Colored Revolutions, we are once again confronted with the question of what the long‐range effects are likely to be of regime change ushered in by citizens taking to the streets. Such moments are often filled with optimism about the potential for people to seize control of their own destiny and finally demand accountability from their governments. The model we present in this article does not deny that this optimistic chain of events can come to fruition, but it does lead to important insights as to when such a scenario is more or less likely."
"49","First, there is likely to be a fundamental difference between what happens following a protest that leads to regime change as opposed to one that leads merely to a change of government without changing the regime. So a protest in France that leads to a change in the government—for example, the 1968 protests and subsequent resignation of de Gaulle (Cerny 1970)—is not likely to change citizens’ minds about the overall distribution of the quality of governments available through French democracy. Citizens may feel that they have received a “bad” draw from this distribution, and thus it is worth trying to throw the current government out of power and replace it with a new draw from the same distribution. In these circumstances—provided the cost of protesting remains constant—there is no reason not to expect French citizens to take to the streets to protest against their government in similar numbers in the future.         "
"50","In a new democracy, however, we suggest that citizens may be simultaneously updating about the quality of the current government and the potential quality of all governments available under a democratic regime. This learning may be rather dramatic during the first governments of the new regime. If these initial governments after a democratic transition should prove to be little better than previous nondemocratic governments, citizens might be unlikely to take costly actions in order to curtail new abuses or even deter a blatant disregard for the new rules calling for periodic elections. Thus, we are probably most likely to see a one‐shot‐deal scenario when the initial governments following a democratic transition are perceived as no better than the ones that preceded the transition. Conversely, repeated protest might be more likely if there are a few “good” governments—thus leading respondents to think that the average quality of government is indeed better under democracy—before a government that might threaten democracy appears again. The bottom line is that if the type of learning that underlines our model is indeed occurring in newly democratic regimes, then the stakes for these regimes during the initial post‐transition governments are likely to be high indeed.         "
"51","Taken together, these points suggest the potential for the following patterns to emerge. The size and strength of protests may increase over time in a nondemocratic regime, but once the initial goal of removing the old regime from office is accomplished, the ability of prodemocracy forces to bring their supporters to the street may diminish significantly.20 The intuitive explanation for such a pattern would normally be that “the goal has been met,” but our model suggests a different story: it may not be so much that the goal has been met as the goal no longer seems to be quite so valuable. Again, this points to the importance of “getting it right” in the first transitional elections.         "
"52","The model also generates a number of other insights. Two of these are fairly obvious and should serve as reassurance that the model is compatible with real‐world politics: good governance can remove the necessity for protest in the future, and changing the cost of protest can have an affect on its likelihood. This latter effect can work both ways. Governments can consciously strive to communicate to their citizens that protest in the future will be costly; two very explicit examples of this behavior include the reaction of the Revolutionary Guard and Basij militia in Iran in 2009 to the “Green Revolution”21 and the violent response of the Uzbek government to protest in Andijan, Uzbekistan in 2005.22 But we also see examples of cases where the costs of protest apparently decrease, such as following the emergence of the piqueteros in Argentina in 2001–2002, civil society groups that provided the organizational infrastructure for the protests that became increasingly common in that country in the years that followed (Garay 2007; Weitz‐Shapiro 2006).23"
"53","The other two factors, however, are less obvious and prove important in the workings of our model and possibly the success of transitional democracies. First, we demonstrate how those with a less myopic view of current events may be more willing to protest, which suggests an interesting avenue for future research; see equation (18), which shows that  is increasing in the value of the future . The observation that individuals with a longer time horizon are more likely to undertake actions which are costly in the current period but likely to realize benefits in the future is hardly earth shattering. Nevertheless, such a prediction does yield some interesting avenues for empirical examinations: to the extent we can successfully estimate individual discount rates, we should be able to get a good predictor of who protests. Absent direct measures of one’s discount rate, one potential line of inquiry might involve seeing whether young citizens were more likely to protest than older citizens, although one would have to think seriously about how to control for factors such as ability to protest and the opportunity costs (expected to be lower for students than workers) for doing so. One potential way around this might be to compare the propensity to protest of people of similar ages who are childless with those who have children or grandchildren, with the assumption being that the latter will have a longer time horizon. Some theories might also suggest that poorer citizens are generally used to thinking in terms of shorter time horizons than middle‐ and upper‐class citizens; if so, it might be interesting to examine the class‐based makeup of protestors.         "
"54","Second, the analysis hinges on an interesting observation about updating of beliefs: two bad governments in a row are likely to do more to demoralize a population about its prospects for good governance than one government that stays in office over two periods. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of other theoretical work to point out this distinction and believe that it has interesting applications beyond the protest story we have explored in this article."
"55","We also hope to make two modest contributions to the formal literature, which has hitherto focused primarily on the adverse‐selection issues confronting citizens when (1) they are choosing to vote governments out of office in regularly scheduled elections, and (2) it is natural to ignore learning about the political process from the performance of individual governments. As large proportions of the world continue to live under political systems that do not afford them a legitimate opportunity to actually “throw the bums out” in elections, it is important that the theoretical literature consider the means that citizens have at their disposal for doing this outside of the context of free and fair elections. Second, in thinking about the extent to which citizens can actually select good governments in countries that have recently experienced transitions, it is important that agency models capture the features of the informational environment that are peculiar to transitional systems."
"56","All of these points taken together provide an interesting vantage point for interpreting the Iranian protests of the summer of 2009 (Halliday 2009). Simply put, the failure of the protests to dislodge the current regime from power should not necessarily be taken as a sign that future protest is unlikely. Clearly, the government has attempted to convince citizens that the cost of protest is going to be high. Nevertheless, the ongoing protests in the country suggest that at least some portion of the population—and especially of the younger population—probably believe they are living in a world where the odds of getting a substantially better government next time (to us ) is not trivial. This in turn brings us back to the Arab Spring. As we finish our final edits of this article in December 2012, we confront a region that is still largely in flux. Clearly, citizens have seen that change can result from protest, and much of that change is still ongoing. Looking forward, our model suggests that as resolution comes to some of these countries, the initial “post‐protest” period of governance will be crucially important, perhaps even more so than previously thought. It also suggests that when regime change is on the menu, failed protest today may be a better recipe for successful protest tomorrow than successful protest today, an insight that should be of interest to both governments and oppositions the world over.
