"1","Individual perceptions are as important as objective facts in the politics of problem definition. As a result, a condition can be objectively serious for long periods of time, but individuals may not publicly define a condition to be a problem. For example, blackened skies and dirty water persisted in the industrial centers of the northeastern United States through the nineteenth and much of the twentieth centuries. Obviously there were adverse health effects and unpleasant environments from these conditions, yet there was very little public concern for dirty air and water until the '50s and '60s (Crenson 1971; Jones 1975). There are numerous similar examples of a disjuncture between objective conditions and problem definition, including discrimination, smoking, child abuse, drunk driving, hunger, and Mexican immigration (Best 1989). In all of these cases, the objective conditions existed long before being socially defined as public problems.            "
"2","Why does a disjuncture often exist between objective conditions and problem definition? In answering this question it is important to recognize that perceptions of conditions are both individual and social. The prevailing social interpretation of a condition is a special type of aggregation of individual interpretations. Feedback from the social interpretation may cause individuals to conform to a social evaluation that is out of sync with their true private evaluations (Noelle‐Neumann 1984).            "
"3","At the individual level, citizens evaluate conditions privately, but their private evaluations may not correspond with their public positions due to social pressures (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995; Mutz 1998). An objectively serious condition may be viewed as normal by the community and evoke neutral or even favorable responses by those exposed to the condition. Values and culture produce inertia in individual perceptions and issue images. Norms and expectations develop that glue individual behavior to the beliefs of the community. As habitual acceptance of a condition permeates the community it becomes riskier for the individual to oppose the arrangement. Citizens abide by prevailing arrangements without much thought. Thus, social interpretations affect the propensity of individuals to mobilize against what they may perceive privately as undesirable conditions. As a result, the prevailing social interpretation may be out of sync with the objective costs and benefits of a condition.            "
"4","Counteracting these social pressures are tolerance costs to individuals for failing to publicly state a true evaluation. The objective costs of a condition for an individual are one major cost of remaining silent. However, perceptions of the objective costs and benefits of a condition can vary widely across individuals based on exposure to an analysis of information (Zaller 1992). Individuals proximate to or more severely affected by the condition have different experiences relative to those only tangentially exposed. As a result, individuals may arrive at disparate evaluations of the objective costs and benefits of the condition. Personality differences may also result in different perceptions of costs and benefits across individuals. Reticent individuals may evaluate the objective costs and benefits of a condition differently than activists. Another tolerance cost is an integrity loss from failing to publicly state a true assessment. Integrity losses are greater when there is a large disparity between the individual's private and public assessments of the condition. For all of these reasons, tolerance costs will vary widely across individuals, leading to different propensities toward taking a public stand.            "
"5","When the costs of tolerating the condition become sufficiently large, an individual will cross a threshold of public nonacceptance of the condition. However, the threshold of public nonacceptance varies widely across individuals due to different tolerance costs and values attached to siding with the majority. As a result, there is an empirical distribution of thresholds of public nonacceptance across society. Each individual's position relative to the threshold leads to the binary state of public acceptance or nonacceptance of the condition. The aggregation of these binary states across society results in a proportion of individuals publicly accepting or not accepting a condition. This is the prevailing social interpretation."
"6","Political activists and advocacy groups may attempt to change this social interpretation through image manipulation, mobilization, and public education (Baumgartner and Jones 1993; Cobb and Elder 1972). However, this may be difficult due to inertia and the nonlinear relationship between individuals' private assessments and the prevailing social interpretation. Private assessments are related to the prevailing social interpretation, but do not linearly determine the prevailing social interpretation. In the extreme, virtually everyone in the system may privately believe a condition to be nocuous, but fail to publicly identify the condition as a problem. As noted above, examples abound of a disjuncture between objective conditions and public perceptions. Thus, the efforts of activists and groups often produce only incremental change.            "
"7","On the other hand, their efforts can alter the setting for problem definition by shifting the distribution of thresholds at which issue redefinition occurs. When the cost to the individual of tolerating the condition outweighs the cost to the individual of active opposition, then the individual becomes mobilized against the condition. When the two types of costs are precisely equal, then the individual is indifferent between actively opposing and continuing to tolerate the condition. This threshold of indifference can be changed through image manipulation and public education and is critical to understanding the dynamics of changing problem definition. When the disparity between private and public evaluations becomes sufficiently large for many individuals, thresholds become fragile so that only a small shift in expected social nonacceptance is required to produce change. When this occurs, say due to stochastic events, a cascade of change occurs toward a new equilibrium of social nonacceptance of the condition.            "
"8","The preceding discussion is consistent with a threshold model of collective behavior. Threshold models have been formalized by various scholars, but have never been applied toward understanding the politics of problem definition. For example, Schelling (1971a, 1971b, 1972) developed a threshold model to study the process of residential segregation, where thresholds are for leaving one's neighborhood as a function of how many of one's own color have already left. Granovetter (1978) developed a general framework for studying threshold models, suggesting that the concept could be applied to the propensity of individuals to join a riot, as a function of the number of individuals who had previously joined the riot. Arthur (1988, 1989, 1990) studied the existence of both negative and positive feedback in the economy, arguing that the economic system can become “locked in” to inferior technologies due to the existence of thresholds for acceptance of new technologies. Chong (1991) studied the mutual dependence of individuals joining the civil rights movement and the collective success of the movement. Kuran (1989, 1991, 1995) used threshold models to describe the persistence of India's caste system, communist domination of Eastern Europe and the subsequent fall of the communist block, and racial segregation and affirmative action in the United States. In addition, Lohman (1994) studied the effect of demonstrations on the propensity of individuals to join the bloodless revolution in East Germany.            "
"9","We restrict formal presentation of the threshold model as it pertains to the politics of problem definition to a graphical analysis.6 Let lower case p be the actual proportion of the population that fails to publicly oppose a condition. Then  is the individual's expectation of the proportion of the population that fails to publicly oppose the condition. Each individual has a private assessment of the condition, Oi, based on a ratio of costs to benefits plus costs of the condition (i.e., ). Note that according to this formulation Oi is scaled to range from zero to one. Figure 1 plots a hypothetical distribution of thresholds for individuals with private assessments, Oi, and expected social nonacceptances, . The heavy line represents the threshold at which individuals with different costs and expectations of social nonacceptance are precisely indifferent between publicly accepting versus not accepting the condition. The space to the left of the heavy line contains mappings where individuals publicly accept the condition through action or inaction, while the space to the right of the heavy line contains mappings where individuals publicly voice nonacceptance of the condition.            "
"10","                 Threshold of Nonacceptance of Adverse Condition                         "
"11","For example, in Figure 1 individuals who privately assess the costs of the condition to be offset by zero benefits (i.e., Oi= 1) move to public nonacceptance only if they have expectations that the proportion of social nonacceptance is greater than 0.40. Individuals who privately assess costs at three times the benefits (i.e., Oi= 0.75) move to public nonacceptance if their expected proportion of social nonacceptance is larger than 0.50. And individuals who assess the costs and benefits as equally weighted (i.e., Oi= 0.50) would require the expected proportion of social nonacceptance to be greater than 0.70. From this example we can see that the system is biased toward the status quo, because a high degree of expected social nonacceptance is required to mobilize individuals who see the costs and benefits as equally weighted. The magnitude of this bias is a function of the slope and shift of the threshold curve.            "
"12","Suppose now that interest groups or the media do an especially good job of educating the public about the costs and benefits of a condition. Such a process might not result immediately in a changed problem definition due to inertia and the prevailing social interpretation. However, it could produce a gradual change in the intercept or slope of the function representing the distribution of thresholds, as individuals altered their private evaluations and expectations of social nonacceptance. For example, consider the new hypothetical distribution of thresholds shown in Figure 2. Under this scenario individuals seeing costs but no benefits to a condition (Oi= 1) would engage in public nonacceptance if their expected social nonacceptance exceeded 0.20. Those with private assessments of costs three times benefits (Oi= 0.75) would publicly oppose a condition if their expectations about social nonacceptance exceeded 0.30, while those seeing the costs and benefits as equal (Oi= 0.50) would require expected social nonacceptance to exceed 0.50 to oppose the condition. And those seeing benefits but no costs to the condition (Oi= 0) would only follow the crowd to actively oppose the condition if expected nonacceptance grew larger than 0.80. Thus, interest groups, the media, and other actors can make the setting more conducive to changing problem definition by altering the distribution of thresholds for individuals.            "
"13","                 Shifted Threshold of Nonacceptance of Adverse Condition                         "
"14","Now consider the threshold function in relation to an empirical distribution of social nonacceptance. Figure 3 superimposes a cumulative density function of social nonacceptance (the dashed line) onto the threshold function depicted in Figure 2.6 The upper horizontal axis records a hypothetical proportion of actual social nonacceptance of the condition, given private cost‐benefit evaluations. The purpose of Figure 3 is to illustrate the nonlinear manner in which an actual empirical distribution of social nonacceptance can produce cascades of public nonacceptance of an adverse condition. We also define dynamic equilibrium conditions using this graph.            "
"15","                 Threshold Model of Nonacceptance of Adverse Condition                         "
"16","Consider first the dotted arrows on the left of Figure 3. These arrows illustrate the force operating on certain individuals for accepting the adverse condition. In this example, individuals having private assessments of costs and benefits of about 0.85 (i.e., costs about 5.67 times benefits) will cross their threshold of nonacceptance after perceiving that a population proportion of 0.25 publicly rejects the condition. However, the upper axis shows that the actual proportion of social nonacceptance for individuals with this cost‐benefit mapping is only about 0.15. Thus, the perception that actual social nonacceptance is lower than the threshold of nonacceptance results in an equilibrium of silence. Indeed, all individuals with thresholds to the left of the Tipping Point are exposed to negative feedback pulling them toward accepting the condition. The strength of the negative feedback on individual behaviors is reflected in the variable length of the dotted horizontal line for 0.75 > Oi≥ 1.            "
"17","The equilibrium proportion of public nonacceptance occurs when the actual level of nonacceptance equals the threshold level of nonacceptance (i.e., when the length of the horizontal line is zero). In Figure 3 there are three equilibria: one on the far left where everyone remains silent about the condition , a second at the Tipping Point of 0.30, and a third on the far right where everyone publicly rejects the condition . The first and third equilibria are stable pulling individuals toward their implied levels of social nonacceptance. The Tipping Point equilibrium is unstable and pushes nearby individuals away from its implied level of social nonacceptance.            "
"18","Consider now what happens for individuals with thresholds to the right of the Tipping Point. The hypothetical dotted arrows on the right correspond to a private assessment of costs and benefits of about 0.55 (i.e., costs about 1.22 times benefits). At this cost‐benefit assessment, individuals move into public nonacceptance when they perceive social nonacceptance to be greater than 0.45. However, note that the actual proportion of the population publicly rejecting the condition at this mapping is much larger at 0.65. Indeed, all mappings to the right of the Tipping Point have actual social nonacceptance greater than the threshold function. Individuals with costs‐benefit assessments to the right of the Tipping Point perceive that actual social nonacceptance is greater than their individual thresholds. Therefore, they join in a cascade of increasing public nonacceptance of the condition."
"19","Assuming a status quo of silence, then on the left side of the Tipping Point there is negative feedback pulling individuals toward continued silence. In contrast, on the right side of the Tipping Point there is a bandwagon effect pushing individuals toward nonacceptance of the condition. Regardless of private evaluations, as individuals perceive a larger crowd than their threshold rejecting the condition, an even larger proportion joins the public opposition. Perceptions of higher nonacceptance to the right of the Tipping Point produce a cascade of increasing actual opposition to the condition. As shown in Figure 3, this bandwagon effect is nonlinear as more and more individuals join the social nonacceptance of the condition.            "
"20","The model in Figure 3 holds several implications for explaining how and why adverse social conditions become redefined as public problems. These can be summarized as follows.            "
"21","                              "
"22","The most likely candidates among all conditions for changing problem definition are those where there is a wide disparity between private cost‐benefit assessments and public positions. When costs significantly outweigh benefits for many individuals, but there are few individuals publicly voicing nonacceptance, then the system is ripe for change. This is because a large disparity between private and public assessments shifts the threshold function to the left, as shown by Figures 1 and 2, and may also produce a steeper slope. Additionally, large private costs relative to benefits for many individuals produces an empirical distribution shifted upward, thereby again moving the Tipping Point left on the scale of nonacceptance. For example, the dashed line in Figure 3 shows that at least 70% of all individuals assess the costs of the condition as larger than the benefits. The larger this proportion and the further to the left the Tipping Point of nonacceptance, the more likely the bandwagon effect described above will occur.                     "
"23","Problem redefinition can occur incrementally, as the stable equilibria in Figure 3 move around due to changing empirical distributions and threshold functions. The hypothetical results in Figure 3 depict stable equilibria corresponding with conditions where either all individuals are silent or all individuals publicly reject the condition. However, these results can easily be altered to find stable equilibria at any proportion of public acceptance or nonacceptance. What moves these equilibria of social nonacceptance around? Interest groups, coalitions, the media, political leaders, and other actors may alter the threshold function through a process of image manipulation (Baumgartner and Jones 1993), education, or the more direct processes of interest‐group mobilization (Cobb and Elder 1972). Altered perceptions of tolerance costs, benefits, and mass nonacceptance shift the positions of the stable equilibria. However, changing social nonacceptance of a condition solely through these means is likely to be slow.                     "
"24","Problem redefinition can also occur in a punctuated fashion as a result of a rapid shift from one equilibrium to another. As noted above, when there is a large disparity between private and public assessments of a condition, both individual and social acceptance of the condition can become fragile. A positive feedback scenario can easily develop in which a shock in expected social nonacceptance produces a bandwagon effect driving collective behavior a new problem definition. The sources of potential shock have been discussed at length by various authors, including Schattschneider (1960), Cobb and Elder (1972), Arthur (1988, 1989, 1990), Kingdon (1995), Baumgartner and Jones (1993), and Jones (1994). They can emerge from many sources, including entrepreneurial leadership, crises, disasters, media events, symbol manipulation, or even abrupt shifts in attention due to serial processing. The Tipping Point described in Figure 3 marks the level of expected social nonacceptance that a shock must produce for the system to move to a new equilibrium of nonacceptance of the condition. The further left the Tipping Point, the more likely that shocks will result in movement from one equilibrium to another.                     "
"25","While the threshold model presented in this section is consistent with earlier descriptive accounts of the politics of problem definition, formalizing the process provides a more precise organizing and theoretical framework. The model also accounts parsimoniously for the conundrum of why problem definition proceeds at times only incrementally and at other times through sudden shifts. We turn now to a discussion of how researchers can test the applicability of threshold models to the politics of problem definition and other research more generally."
"26","At the root, a threshold model such as that described in Figure 3 is a depiction of how individual behaviors aggregate dynamically to produce collective behavior. Testing such models using individual level data would be very difficult because of the stringent data requirements. The individual behaviors associated with threshold models are Bernoulli distributed. That is, individuals either join or do not join the aggregate behavior as a function of their expectations of how the aggregate has already behaved or is likely to behave in the future. In order to use individual‐level data for evaluating threshold models, measures would be required for each individual's (1) current decision to join/not join in public nonacceptance, (2) assessment of private costs and benefits associated with the condition, (3) expected social nonacceptance required for mobilization, and (4) actual social nonacceptance at the time of the decision. At least three of these measures involve very subjective judgments. Additionally, since threshold models imply dynamics, the individual‐level data would need to exist over many time points to track changes in individual decisions. Needless to say, these data requirements impose significant obstacles for researchers seeking to evaluate empirically threshold models with individual‐level data.         "
"27","However, it is possible to use aggregate data to observe the joining behavior of individuals, since the aggregate changes as individuals either join or do not join an evolving process.6 The model in Figure 3 implies that the aggregate will exhibit switching properties as more and more individuals move from the equilibrium of silence to the equilibrium of nonacceptance. If we view the process over time, there should be an initial stable equilibrium of silence. If the problem definition is ripe for change, then a stimulus can invoke a cascade of joining by individuals. As more and more individuals join the aggregate, inertia develops which reinforces the joining propensity of other individuals. Change in the aggregate should be highly inertial until a new equilibrium problem definition is achieved. Such processes are readily observed using time‐series intervention methods. Box and Tiao (1975) transfer‐function methods are explicitly adept at tracking movements between equilibria as a function of an exogenous stimulus, as well as the degree of inertia associated with such movements.         "
"28","The model in Figure 3 also implies the nature of feedback associated with such a system. Prior to the occurrence of a critical event causing movement from one equilibrium to another, feedback should be negative as described in the discussion of Figure 3. That is, the feedback should reinforce the stable equilibrium by reducing the number of individuals expressing public nonacceptance. After the occurrence of a critical event causing movement from one equilibrium to another, feedback should turn positive as a cascade of individual nonacceptance of the condition develops. The dynamics of this changing polarity of feedback should be nonlinear, as can be seen by tracking the changing length of the horizontal arrows in Figure 3. We can observe the nature of feedback in our dynamical system using time‐varying parameter regression methods (e.g., Kalaba and Tesfatsion 1989). We now illustrate such an analysis using an example from the politics of sexual harassment.         "
"29","The phrase “sexual harassment” was coined in the late 1970s by the feminist movement to describe workplace exploitation of women by men. In the last year of the Carter administration the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) explicitly recognized the phenomenon when it promulgated an amendment to its Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex to include a definition of sexual harassment. Through the 1970s and 1980s, women's groups attempted to focus attention on the issue. Groups such as the National Organization for Women (NOW), the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL), and the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) initiated programs of public education and attempted to mobilize public support. In spite of these efforts, there was little systemic attention to sexual harassment before the 1990s.            "
"30","This widespread lack of systemic attention to the issue may not have fully reflected the scope and severity of the objective condition. Among federal employees, a U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board study found that 42% of women (and 14% of men) working for the federal government had experienced unwanted sexual advances between 1985 and 1987 (U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board 1987). A study of workers in California found that 54% of women surveyed had experienced what they considered sexual harassment, including about 8% who claimed quid pro quo harassment (Gutek 1985). A Washington Post/ABC News poll reported in October 1991 that 23% of women had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. These statistics suggest that the objective condition of sexual harassment was common in America before the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings. Yet, few individuals were speaking out about the condition.            "
"31","The Thomas nomination hearings in September and October of 1991 quickly altered the political landscape for the issue of sexual harassment. Justice Thurgood Marshall, an African American who had been very influential in promoting the 1950s civil rights movement, resigned from the Supreme Court on June 27, 1991. Shortly thereafter President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas, a conservative African American on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and former Chairman of the EEOC, to be his replacement. The Thomas nomination was highly visible for several reasons. Justice Marshall was the only African‐American Supreme Court justice and a potent symbol for the African‐American community. Additionally, Marshall was a liberal to be replaced by an individual who could potentially threaten much of what had been achieved in civil rights and the liberal agenda."
"32","Beginning on September 10, 1991, the Senate Judiciary Committee held eight days of hearings on the Thomas nomination. During the hearings, Thomas portrayed himself as a man of humble beginnings who could identify with the downtrodden. Under intense questioning from the Democratic side, he gave ambiguous answers on such issues as abortion, civil rights, and other liberal causes. Opponents charged that he was being manipulative and evasive and were distrustful of Thomas's responses. Women's groups claimed that he would provide the swing vote on conservative causes and could be the critical factor in overturning Roe v. Wade (1973). On September 27, after a tied Senate Judiciary Committee vote, the nomination was sent to the full Senate without a recommendation for approval. The full Senate began debate on the nomination on October 3, with a vote scheduled for October 8.            "
"33","However, on October 6 a spectacular story surfaced on National Public Radio (NPR) that spread quickly through national and local media outlets. There were allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court nominee, and the Senate Judiciary Committee had kept these allegations secret under a cloak of anonymity for the alleged victim. Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law professor who had worked with Thomas at the Department of Education and EEOC, claimed that he had repeatedly made sexually explicit comments to her about X‐rated movies, and in an unseemly context asked her for dates. A day after the story broke on NPR, Professor Hill appeared at a news conference and made her allegations public. The pressure from the public and interest groups was so great that the scheduled vote was postponed in order to give the Senate Judiciary Committee time to investigate the charges."
"34","Beginning on October 11 and ending in the early morning of October 14, there were nationally televised hearings into the allegations. In large numbers Americans watched as the two sides stated their cases, also becoming more educated and aware of the issue of sexual harassment. Hill went into excruciating detail on national television concerning the allegations, reiterating the charges claiming that Thomas had used explicit sexual language that could be construed as harassment (New York Times 1991). She even took a lie detector test to affirm the truthfulness of her charges. In response, Thomas flatly denied the charges and likened the allegations to “a high‐tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves…” (Reuters 1991). At the end of the hearings public opinion had swung solidly in Thomas's direction, with polls showing 2‐to‐1 support for confirmation among the general population (Kolbert 1991). The national soap opera ended on October 16 when the Senate confirmed Thomas by the narrowest margin ever for a Supreme Court justice.            "
"35","At the time they occurred, the Clarence Thomas hearings were widely considered to be a failure for the women's movement and remedying sexual harassment in America. A professional woman who was highly articulate and believable had stated her case in a national forum and was soundly rebuked in the court of national public opinion. Americans by a 2‐to‐1 majority deemed her allegations less believable than the more authoritative nominee who was also her ex‐supervisor. There was the widespread perception that an all‐male Senate Judiciary Committee had “foo foo‐ed” the allegations and was unsympathetic to victims of sexual harassment. The full Senate confirmed the nominee as a member of the nation's highest court, which would be judging future controversies involving victim's rights. At the time of the hearings, there was strong evidence that the phenomenon of sexual harassment would continue to be tolerated and that individuals who made such allegations had a very low probability of affecting change. Seemingly, the hearings magnified the negative feedback that biased the system toward continued tolerance of sexual harassment in America."
"36","Yet the Clarence Thomas hearings were also an event that produced increased attention to the issue, as well as outrage among women who had become increasingly sensitive to the condition. Caldeira and Smith (1996) evaluated the dynamics of public opinion surrounding the Thomas nomination and found that citizen mobilization increased significantly during the nomination process. The increased mobilization was higher among women than among men, with the proportion of women holding an opinion on the Thomas nomination more than doubling by the end of the process. Furthermore, a gender gap of sentiment toward the nominee widened through the nomination process, with women substantially less favorable than men.            "
"37","Were the events surrounding the Thomas nomination sufficient to produce a bandwagon of social nonacceptance of sexual harassment such as might be suggested by the threshold model in Figure 3? To address this question empirically, we obtained data from the EEOC on the monthly number of charges of sexual harassment from January 1988 through December 1997.6 A graph of these data is in Figure 4. The data show the number of individuals who definitively crossed the threshold of public nonacceptance of sexual harassment by actually filing charges. We take this measure as a surrogate for overall social nonacceptance.            "
"38","                 Sexual Harassment Charges Filed with the EEOC                         "
"39","Visual examination of the graph in Figure 4 suggests that the monthly number of charges filed prior to the hearings was in equilibrium. The timing of the hearing seems to correspond with the initiation of an increase in the number of charges filed. The change following the hearings in Figure 4 was not abrupt, but nonlinear and cascading until a new higher equilibrium of charges filed was reached. This dynamic is what we should expect if the threshold model applies to changing public nonacceptance of sexual harassment. However, more rigorous tests should be applied to verify movement from one equilibrium to another, as well as the nature of feedback associated with these processes.            "
"40","Thus, we statistically modeled the effect of the hearings on charges of sexual harassment using Box‐Tiao (1975) intervention methods. The transfer function model explains about 99% of the series variance, and the results are very robust. Table 1 presents the results, which confirm inertial movement from a preexisting equilibrium before the hearings to a higher equilibrium of social nonacceptance after the hearings. In the two years prior to the hearings, the equilibrium number of charges per month was about 301.6 During the month of the hearings the number of charges increased by about 26 per month. After about two years, a new equilibrium was reached of about 782 charges per month . This was about 2.6 times the preintervention average of 301 charges per month. The large denominator for the charges transfer function (δ= 0.95) indicates that change was highly inertial.6 This suggests that the cascading process of Figure 3 was at work, since there was inertial movement to a new equilibrium. However, the Box‐Tiao (1975) analysis provides no evidence concerning the nature of feedback before and after the hearings.            "
"41","If the process of problem definition for sexual harassment followed the pattern suggested by Figure 3, then there should have been negative feedback from expected nonacceptance to actual nonacceptance prior to the hearings. After the hearings this feedback should have switched to positive, with expectations of nonacceptance producing greater levels of actual nonacceptance. In order to test this expectation, we constructed measures of actual and expected nonacceptance of sexual harassment. Actual nonacceptance was taken as in Figure 1 and Table 1 to be the number of sexual harassment charges filed per month with the EEOC.            "
"42","We included three measures intended to capture individuals' levels of expected nonacceptance.6 The first measure of expected nonacceptance was the number of charges filed in the prior time period. Our theoretical discussion surrounding Figure 3 indicates that a major determinant of individual propensities to cross the threshold of nonacceptance of a condition is their expectation of the number of individuals who have already crossed the threshold or are likely to cross it in the future. The lagged number of charges captures the first part of this concept and reflects directly the empirical distribution in Figure 3. As individuals file charges in prior time periods, individuals considering their own charges should become emboldened.            "
"43","A second measure of expected nonacceptance was the number of charges that were successful in the prior time period.6 In measuring charge successes, we considered charges to be successful when the complainant withdrew the charge after receiving benefits (M1 resolutions). We also deemed charges successful when the EEOC forced a settlement that achieved benefits for the complainant (M2 resolutions). We summed the monthly number of both types of outcomes to measure the number of successes at the EEOC. Larger numbers of successful charges suggest that sexual harassment became less acceptable to the institutions responsible for policy implementation. This increases the expectation that more charges will be filed in the future due to a higher probability of future success and potential benefits.            "
"44","A third measure of expected nonacceptance was perceptions deriving from the news media. We measured media attention by counting the number of minutes per month of news stories highlighting sexual harassment on the three major television networks. Specifically, we searched the Vanderbilt Television News Abstracts using keywords to capture stories about sexual harassment. Since media attention to sexual harassment was disparaging of the phenomenon, especially after the hearings, greater media attention should have produced higher expectations of social nonacceptance, both currently and in the future.6"
"45","The model depicted in Figure 3 suggests a regime‐switching model to capture differences in feedback on each side of the Tipping Point. However, standard regime‐switching models do not allow nonlinear parameter variation within regimes. The model in Figure 3 suggests that there should be nonlinear parameter variation within each regime due to the changing horizontal distances between the threshold function and actual empirical distribution. Therefore, we selected an estimator that allows regime switching, but also allows parameters to vary within regimes in nonlinear fashion. Flexible Least Squares (Kalaba and Tesfatsion 1989) was used to evaluate feedback before and after the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings.6"
"46","Are the vectors of time‐varying coefficients from FLS consistent with the theory in Figure 3?Figure 5 graphs the estimated time‐varying coefficients. The results show clear evidence of a shift in regimes for all three variables at about the same time as the hearings. Note that for all three variables the time‐varying coefficients are negative prior to the hearings and switch to positive shortly after the hearings. Before the hearings, increased prior charges and successes produced fewer new charges suggesting that negative feedback maintained the preintervention equilibrium. After the hearings, increased prior charges and successes produced more new charges and successes, suggesting a cascading effect to the new equilibrium. Similarly, before the hearings greater media attention to sexual harassment actually produced fewer charges, but after the hearings the effect of media attention on new charges escalated dynamically.

"48","Past theory and research on agenda setting have neglected the processes whereby individual preferences are aggregated into collective behavior. Preference based models of agenda setting emphasize the cost‐benefit assessments of individuals, but tend to ignore the effect of information and social forces. In contrast, our model illustrates how individual evaluations of costs and benefits combine with information and social forces to produce dynamic change in collective behavior.6"
"49","We propose that the problem‐definition process can best be explained using a threshold model of collective behavior. According to this perspective, the dynamics of collective problem definition depend critically on the distribution of individual thresholds of nonacceptance of the condition across society. The propensity of individuals to cross the threshold of nonacceptance of a condition depends on their cost‐benefit assessment of the condition, as well as their expectation of the number of individuals who have already crossed the threshold or are likely to cross it in the future. Threshold models predict that the dynamics of problem definition will be nonlinear. If most individuals are perceived as accepting a condition, then negative feedback maintains a stable equilibrium of continued acceptance. Even those individuals predisposed toward nonacceptance will accept the condition due to the social costs of opposing the majority. However, if a critical mass of individuals develops thresholds of nonacceptance near a tipping point, then positive feedback can occur. Under this scenario it takes only a small change in perceived collective nonacceptance to produce cascading movement to a new equilibrium. Thus, threshold models can explain how problem definition evolves through either gradual or punctuated change processes."
"50","We applied this theory toward explaining the dynamics of nonacceptance of sexual harassment in America after the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings. Prior to the hearings, a wide gap existed between private and public evaluations of sexual harassment for many individuals. The condition was widespread in America, according to much of the survey evidence. Yet, widespread social tolerance prevented most individuals from active and open opposition. The Clarence Thomas hearings focused attention on the costs of sexual harassment and sparked increased media and public attention. Charges immediately increased as a result of the stimulus. The negative tone of media coverage following the hearing highlighted the costs of the condition and also caused individual perceptions of the phenomenon to change. Charges and charge successes bred more charges as inertia was established. Increased media and public attention resulted in more charges, more successes, and more media attention. In turn, the continuing escalation of the process sparked an increased perception that change was possible. More charges resulted through a process of positive feedback until a new equilibrium of social nonacceptance was reached. In this case, the new resting point was one at which political acceptance of sexual harassment was quite low. For other conditions the magnitude of change could be more or less dramatic."
"51","The case of sexual harassment offers limited empirical support to the theory. However, few generalizable frameworks are satisfactorily evaluated with a single case, so the theory should be applied to other issue areas. We have demonstrated methods that will allow analysis of other cases, as well as the empirical applicability of threshold models generally. We suspect that the framework presented here fits nicely for many other conditions such as environmental pollution, discrimination, second‐hand tobacco smoke, child abuse, drunk driving, and abortion rights. Wherever there is a preexisting condition that many find privately costly, but with widespread public acceptance, the system is ripe for change. Individuals affected by adverse conditions may remain passive for long periods of time due to social convention or the perception that their efforts will do little good. However, this passivity masks the potential for change that lies hidden just beneath the surface. Given that many such conditions exist in America at any one time, and given that disturbances are quite likely to occur at some point in the future, sudden change becomes an underlying feature. The two faces of change are therefore predictable and ever present in the continual play of the American policy system.         "
