"1","Previous studies demonstrate that legislative responsiveness has a number of dimensions (Eulau and Karps 1977; Jewell 1982; Pitkin 1967); however, probably none is more fundamental to notions of representation than policy responsiveness. Articulating the wishes of constituents and aiding in the passage of legislation that is in their interests (however defined) is a major focus of legislator effort (Fenno 1978). Given its centrality to normative concerns of representative government, various studies over the years have examined how responsiveness affects the reelection potential of leaders.         "
"2","Most of the literature on policy responsiveness considers its influence in congressional elections and uses a variety of perspectives and measures. For example, some consider the degree of moderation or extremism in a member's voting record relative to other lawmakers (e.g., Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Erikson 1971; Erikson and Wright 1980). Other studies focus on the congruence between a member's policy positions and those of the election constituency (e.g., Abramowitz 1988; Johannes and McAdams 1981; McAdams and Johannes 1987, 1988; Whitby and Bledsoe 1986). While a few of these studies consider policy influences on candidate emergence and strength (e.g., Bond, Covington, and Fleisher 1985; McAdams and Johannes 1987; Ragsdale and Cook 1987; Squire 1989), most are ultimately concerned with the effects on voting (e.g., Abramowitz 1988; Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Erikson and Wright 2001; McAdams and Johannes 1988; Wright and Berkman 1986). The general finding to emerge from this body of work is that policy voting can affect a member's reelection efforts.         "
"3","Most studies addressing this question rely on a Downsian theoretical approach to understand the causal process at work (1957). Such a perspective assumes a large role for voters, first as they take into account the level of responsiveness exhibited by lawmakers, and second as they register a reaction at the polls. Specifically, candidates positioned closer to the center of the political spectrum, or near the median voter, will derive electoral benefits while those farther away will be harmed. Indeed, aggregate‐level analyses of congressional elections demonstrate that incumbents who stake out more partisan policy positions receive a lower percent of the vote (e.g., Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Erikson and Wright 2001).2"
"4","A major assumption regarding Downs' theory involves the role of voters in this process. In such a model, voters are aware (or are made aware by elites) of policy differences among candidates and choose candidates closer to their own particular policy position. The key question for the present study is whether this theory is applicable in the state legislative setting. From one perspective we might expect policy responsiveness to be influential given the small size of the state legislative districts and the close proximity of constituents to state lawmakers. The population of state legislative districts is generally quite small compared to the population of congressional districts and this closeness may allow greater voter scrutiny of legislator activities. When legislators stray too far from the wishes of the constituency, the electorate may take this information into account when making their voting decision. The result may be that policy positions are as important as, or even more important than, what we observe in congressional elections."
"5","While such a scenario is possible, it seems unlikely given other characteristics of legislative elections that result in very low levels of voter knowledge. For example, because state legislative districts are so small (especially when compared to congressional districts), there is a low level of congruence between the districts and surrounding media markets (Gierzynski and Breaux 1996). This means that news coverage of incumbent legislator activities as well as legislative campaigns themselves will be lacking.3 Because of the small amounts of time devoted to state political news (Gormley 1978; Graber 1993), there are simply few opportunities for citizens to learn about individual legislators. Given these basic structural features, it is little wonder that so few citizens possess even basic information such as their state representative's name, party affiliation, or the positions taken on important policy matters (Patterson, Ripley, and Quinlan 1992; Songer 1984). This low level of knowledge becomes strikingly clear when one compares what citizens know about their state legislator to what they know about their member of Congress. For example, Songer finds in a 1981 survey of Oklahoma citizens that while 49% of respondents could correctly recall the name of their member of Congress, “barely one‐fourth (25.2%) of the registered voters surveyed were able to name their state representative” (1984, 390). With regard to issue stands, he shows that “the level of knowledge about congressmen is approximately three times as high as the knowledge about state legislators” (392). Overall, these findings strongly suggest that citizens are uninformed or unaware of their state legislator's activities, particularly compared with what they know about their representative in the U.S. Congress.4"
"6","Given the low levels of information that voters typically hold about state legislators or state legislative elections, it seems unlikely that policy responsiveness would have much impact on citizen voting behavior.5 If its impact is felt anywhere, it is most probably on the behavior of elite actors, namely potential challengers to the incumbent.6 While the average rank‐and‐file voters in a legislative district may pay little attention to the incumbent's voting record, party activists, financial contributors, and especially potential candidates are probably watching very closely. Do we find that incumbents with lower levels of policy congruence are more likely to see the emergence of a challenger in the general election? How might policy congruence affect the ability of such challengers to raise levels of funding sufficient for mounting a credible campaign?         "
"7","As the above discussion suggests, if Downs' theory has any purchase in the state legislative setting, it is most likely limited to an elite‐level response and manifested as an increased probability of challenger emergence. However, another possibility regarding the effects of policy responsiveness is that its influence may be in a direction contrary to what Downs' theory would suppose. It is at least conceivable that policy positions closer to the incumbent's base of support (and therefore farther from the average voter) may lead to electoral benefits. Incumbents may be “responding” to their core base of support, and this provides an electoral reward. Given the low‐information environment in which candidates operate, it seems at least plausible that responding to core supporters might be beneficial to one's reelection efforts. For incumbent candidates who are merely trying to remobilize their base (not trying to persuade or convert voters), such an effort might contribute positively to their vote totals. Studies at the presidential and congressional levels certainly indicate that candidate positions are influenced by forces such as party activists, interest groups, and electoral conditions (e.g., Aldrich 1983; Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart 2001; Baron 1994). And recent work finds that positions of candidates running for the state legislature are also affected by a similar set of conditions (Frendreis et al. 2003). Given such influences and the low‐information environment of state legislative elections, it seems that a legislator may have little to lose and much to gain by taking positions that are farther from the median voter and closer to the party's base of support. It is at least plausible that such a strategy could result in a net gain of votes for an incumbent.         "
"8","A final possibility regarding the effects of policy voting is that its influence may vary depending on the context of the campaign. Specifically, where certain voters have higher levels of information, an incumbent's policy positions may have a greater impact. Previous studies indicate that campaign spending increases voter knowledge of candidates and issues (Coleman and Manna 2000), so one way to gauge variation in information levels is to consider elections when the relative levels of incumbent and challenger spending differ. For example, we may find that more partisan policy positions have a negative effect on incumbent vote margins in campaigns where challenger spending is heavy. Given that challengers often focus their campaigns on an incumbent's record in their attempt to mobilize their own fellow partisans and swing voters, we may find that challengers who spend heavily ultimately reduce the incumbent's vote share. However, the opposite effect for partisan policy voting might be seen in an election where an incumbent spends heavily compared to the opponent. Under such conditions incumbents target their campaigns toward their partisan base of supporters who are probably quite happy to hear about their partisan positions. The influence of partisan policy voting under these conditions could very well be positive. To measure these possible effects, an analysis is conducted in which the measures of campaign spending are interacted with partisan policy position (challenger spending × partisan policy position; incumbent spending × partisan policy position). If challenger spending reduces the positive effect for partisan policy position, the coefficient for this interaction term should be negative. Similarly, if incumbent spending increases the positive effect for partisan policy positions, the coefficient for this interaction term should be positive.         "
"9","Overall, the state legislative setting, therefore, provides an interesting context to test not only whether policy responsiveness plays a role, but also how it might influence incumbent reelection efforts. As indicated earlier, research on this topic in the state legislature is quite limited. The few existing studies show that policy voting effects are rather small compared to those of district and state factors (Hogan 2004) or are conditioned by other forms of responsiveness such as casework (Serra and Pinney 2004). A more comprehensive look at policy responsiveness is clearly warranted, particularly one that considers policy position relative to the incumbent's partisan base of support. Past studies at the congressional level demonstrate that an incumbent's policy position matters a great deal, with more extreme partisan positions causing electoral harm (e.g., Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Erikson and Wright 2001). Do we find a similar result for state legislative incumbents? The low‐information environment of state legislative elections provides an interesting test of this hypothesis.         "
"10","The goal of the analysis is to examine the effects of policy responsiveness on incumbency reelection efforts on distinct components of the electoral process: the decision of a candidate to challenge a sitting incumbent, the amounts of money challengers raise and spend relative to the incumbents, and the votes ultimately received by incumbents in contested races. The first dependent variable is therefore a dichotomous indicators of whether an incumbent is challenged by a major party candidate (1 = yes, 0 = no). The second dependent variable is a percentage measure calculated as challenger spending divided by incumbent spending. This enables us to see if spending by a challenger (relative to the incumbent) is affected by the incumbent's policy positions.7 Finally, the third dependent variable examined is simply the percentage of the two‐party vote received by incumbents in contested elections. Considering these three distinct components of the election process enables us to more thoroughly assess the influence of the various independent variables.         "
"11","The major independent variable of interest is policy responsiveness of state legislators. Previous literature has examined this aspect of legislator behavior from a variety of perspectives using a range of estimation techniques. For many studies, legislator policy voting is simply compared to that of other legislators to determine whether a legislator's voting is moderate or extreme (e.g., Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Erikson and Wright 2001). In other studies, legislator behavior is linked to constituency preferences by comparing a particular vote or series of votes to estimates of public opinion based on voter surveys (e.g., Miller and Stokes 1963; Serra and Moon 1994), referendum voting (e.g., Kuklinski 1978; McCrone and Kuklinski 1979), or district characteristics (e.g., Bond, Covington, and Fleisher 1985; McAdams and Johannes 1988). Given the focus of the present analysis on matters of policy responsiveness, the theoretically appropriate perspective is one that compares legislator voting to estimates of constituency preferences.8"
"12","To construct an operational measure of policy responsiveness, two critical pieces of data are needed: an indicator of a legislator's policy positions and the preferences of the constituency represented by the legislator. For the first piece of information, I rely on legislative voting scores compiled by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). This probusiness association has an affiliate organization in nearly every state that monitors legislative activity on economic and regulatory issues. The organization rates legislators over a two‐year period on the percentage of times his or her roll‐call votes match the organization's probusiness position on key issues before the legislature. The scores are similar to those produced by organizations that rate members of Congress such as Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), Chamber of Commerce of the United States (COC), and American Conservative Union (ACU). The NFIB scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing greater support for the conservative position on economic and regulatory policies."
"13","The use of interest group voting scores is common in studies at both the congressional (e.g., Abramowitz 1988; Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; McAdams and Johannes 1988) and state legislative levels (e.g., Adams 1996; Dow and Endersby 1994; Entman 1983; Hogan 2004; Overby and Kazee 2000). Although these scores have shortcomings (e.g., Fowler 1982; Snyder 1992), there are a number of reasons to believe they are appropriate and valid indictors of legislator policy voting behavior. First, from a conceptual standpoint, they are based on roll‐call voting—a highly visible form of legislative activity. Legislators know these votes become part of the official legislative record and recognize they may be called upon to account for them at some future time. Therefore, a legislator's roll‐call voting record is probably a very good indicator of his or her policy position. Secondly, these scores have a high degree of external validity given their strong correlation with other indicators. As we might expect, these roll‐call votes on matters of economic conservatism are highly correlated with political party and several demographic features of legislators' districts. In addition, they are highly correlated with other interest group scores in a subsample of states where comparisons are possible (e.g., Chamber of Commerce and AFL‐CIO).9 For these reasons, the NFIB scores appear to be excellent indicators of legislator voting behavior on a conservative‐liberal dimension regarding matters of economic and regulatory policy.10"
"14","The second piece of information needed for creating a measure of policy responsiveness is an indicator of citizen preferences. Because public opinion data are not available at the district level, the analysis uses population characteristics of constituency voters.11 An OLS equation uses these characteristics to create a predicted value for each legislator's voting record (using the NFIB scores as the dependent variable). The demographic variables used as independent variables include average annual income, percent college educated, percent receiving social security, percent African American, percent Hispanic American, percent employed in farming, percent employed in government, percent employed in manufacturing, percent living in urban areas, percent living in rural areas.12 Predicted values from this equation are then subtracted from the actual voting score for each legislator to create a distance score. The absolute value of this distance represents the degree of divergence between the legislator's voting and median voter preferences in the district. In order to facilitate comparisons across chambers, the resulting measure is divided by the standard deviation of the NFIB score for each legislative chamber and year.            "
"15","Similar estimation procedures used in studying congressional (Bond, Covington, and Fleisher 1985; Johannes and McAdams 1981; McAdams and Johannes 1988; Ragsdale and Cook 1987; Whitby and Bledsoe 1986) and state legislative races (Hogan 2004) demonstrate that absolute levels of divergence affect incumbent reelection. However, such a technique does not enable us to determine whether the direction of the divergence from the median voter matters. For measures using absolute divergence, positions at identical points on either side of the median voter have the same value. In other words, placement closer to the incumbent's party and placement closer to the opponent's party are expected to have a similar effect. However, it would seem that positions farther from the median voter and closer to the extreme of one's own party would be the most detrimental. Such positions would create a clear opening for candidates to emerge from the opposing party. In addition, these more extreme positions would appear to give declared challengers ammunition in making credible claims that the incumbent's voting record is “too conservative” (for Republicans) or “too liberal” (for Democrats) for the district. Conversely, positions away from the median voter and toward the opposing party probably would have the opposite effects. Such placement would probably deter challenger emergence and contribute positively to an incumbent's overall voter appeal.            "
"16","As indicated earlier, findings from the congressional literature show that incumbents with extreme partisan voting records are disadvantaged, but what effect might such a voting record have on a state legislative incumbent running in a low‐information environment? To make this determination, the absolute deviation measure discussed above is altered. Instead of using the absolute distance from the predicted to the actual vote score, the positive or negative value of this difference is taken into account. For a legislator whose record is farther away from the extreme of his or her party (and therefore more moderate), the measure becomes negative. As a legislator votes toward the extreme of his or her party (and therefore away from the median voter), the measure's value becomes positive.13 Given the measurement of this variable, we expect the coefficient in the regression analyses will have a positive sign in predicting challenger emergence and spending while it has a negative sign in predicting percentage of the vote for incumbents. Such results would show that voting closer to one's party's base would increase the likelihood of challenger emergence, increase challenger spending, and decrease incumbent vote share.14"
"17","To clearly estimate the effects of policy responsiveness it is necessary to control for a wide assortment of variables identified by previous research as having an effect on both challenger emergence and incumbent vote percentages. These variables can be grouped into three basic categories: candidate‐, district‐, and state‐level factors."
"18","Candidate‐level factors include individual characteristics of incumbents. Past studies demonstrate that several variables influence both the likelihood of challenger emergence and incumbent vote share: number of years in the legislature, majority status, and leadership position in the chamber (e.g., Holbrook and Tidmarch 1993; Pritchard 1992; Van Dunk 1997).15 While there is no expectation regarding the influence of political party affiliation (Democrat = 1, Republican = 0), it is included as a control.            "
"19","An important candidate‐level factor that is likely to have an influence at the voting stage of the process is campaign spending. Previous studies show this variable has a large impact on candidate vote percentages in state legislative races, although its effects are somewhat less for incumbent candidates (e.g., Gierzynski and Breaux 1991). Separate measures of spending by the challenger and incumbent are therefore included. Given the wide variation in population sizes of legislative districts, these spending totals are divided by the average eligible voting population for each district. Past literature demonstrates a diminishing returns aspect of campaign spending so a logged value of spending per eligible voter is used.16"
"20","District‐level conditions have also been shown to have a strong influence on the dependent variables examined. District support for the incumbent's party is a key indicator that affects both the likelihood of challenger emergence and the percentage of the vote that incumbents receive (e.g., Gierzynski and Breaux 1991; Pritchard 1992; Van Dunk 1997). Support for the incumbent's party should be negatively related to challenger emergence but positively correlated with incumbent vote percentages. The concept of incumbent party support is measured using two separate variables. The first takes into account the long‐term partisan proclivities of voters by incorporating population characteristics of the district. The measure is similar to one developed by Koetzle (1998) for use in congressional elections that calculates the partisan leanings of the district and is based here on five key population characteristics. Higher values of the variable represent greater support for the incumbent's party.17 The second variable taps the more short‐term partisan forces at work in the district and is simply the incumbent's vote percentage won in the last election.            "
"21","District population is another district‐level factor that may influence incumbent reelection prospects. Where there are many potential voters to contact and campaign costs are high, candidates are required to raise large campaign treasuries and such prospects may deter many candidates from running. Thus, we expect to find a reduced likelihood of challenger emergence in large districts. However, larger population size might work against an incumbent's prospects when a challenger does emerge. Large districts may not afford incumbents the opportunities for developing personal contacts with a sizeable number of voters, and this may result in a lower vote percentage than we might otherwise observe. There are wide differences in average district population size among the states examined in this analysis. For example, the lower house districts in Alaska, Maine, and Utah have fewer than 20,000 potential voters while the upper houses of 6 of the 14 states examined contain over 100,000. Given these disparities, a district population variable is included (measured in thousands of eligible voters).18"
"22","An institutional variable that is expected to have a large influence is legislative professionalism. Past studies indicate that this contextual condition has a strong influence on incumbent reelection efforts (Berry, Berkman, and Schneiderman 2000; Carey, Niemi, and Powell 2000; Cox and Morgenstern 1993). Professional legislatures, compared to what are termed “citizen” legislatures, are characterized by their longer sessions, higher member pay, and larger staff and institutional resources for conducting constituency services (Squire 2000). These attributes are likely to have an influence on incumbency reelection in two important ways. First, the higher pay and amenities of professional legislatures are expected to make these institutions more attractive to potential challengers, and, second, the staff and institutional resources of professional legislatures may enable incumbents to insulate themselves from electoral challengers who emerge. Indeed, past research finds that challenger emergence is more likely in professional chambers (Hogan 2004; Squire 2000), although these challengers have a harder time matching the incumbents' fundraising abilities where the costs of running tend to be quite high (Hogan 2000). Several studies indicate that the ability of incumbents in professional legislatures to engage in extensive constituency service is responsible for their electoral advantages in contested races (e.g., Cox and Morgenstern 1993; Weber, Tucker, and Brace 1991). Given these previous findings, including an indicator for this institutional characteristic is necessary for assessing the relative influence of policy positions. An index of legislative professionalism developed by Squire (2000) is used that ranges from 0 to 1.0 with greater values indicating higher levels of professionalism.            "
"23","Other institution‐level indicators are also used as controls. Given the importance of chamber control to political parties, we might expect chamber‐level competition to have an effect. Chamber competition is measured as the percentage of the seats held by the minority party prior to the election and is expected to positively affect both contestation and competition. A dichotomous indicator for chamber (upper house = 1, lower house = 0) is included to take into account differences between the two houses. Given that upper chambers are considered higher offices on a state's career ladder (Francis and Kenny 2000), I expect contesting and competition to be higher for these offices. Finally, a measure for election year (1996 = 0, 1998 = 1) is included to account for possible differences that might exist between presidential and nonpresidential elections.19"
"24","Information on legislative candidate, districts, and state‐level indicators was obtained for approximately 2,686 incumbents running for seats in upper and lower houses of the legislature in 14 states across two election cycles (1996 and 1998).20 Data were obtained from as many states as possible; however, several practical concerns limited the number of states that could be examined. While election results and candidate characteristics were easily obtained from each state's Election Division of the Secretary of State's Office (or its equivalent) as well as from publications produced by the Council of State Governments, other information was harder to come by.21 Campaign spending allocated by candidates and policy voting scores (provided by the NFIB) were two of the most difficult pieces of data to obtain for each incumbent legislator.22 While no group of states can be said to “represent” all 50, these 14 do provide important variation on a number of key dimensions such as legislative professionalism, party competition, and political culture.23"
"25","Does policy responsiveness affect challenger emergence?Table 1 displays the results of a logistic regression analysis in which the dependent variable is whether the incumbent is challenged in the general election. Along with the column containing the coefficients, there are two other columns label “low” and “high.” These values represent the likelihood of a challenger emerging when each variable is altered while all the others are held at their mean values. For dichotomous variables (e.g., year) the low and high values represent the probabilities when the variable is changed from 0 to 1. For continuous variables (e.g., past general election vote percentage) the values represent the difference between one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above the mean. Such a perspective enables us to observe the degree of influence that each statistically significant variable has when holding all the others constant.         "
"26","The major independent variable of interest in this analysis is partisan policy position. As indicated earlier, this measures the degree to which an incumbent votes with his or her party base relative to the median district voter. Higher values represent more liberal voting for Democrats and more conservative voting for Republican legislators (all in relation to the district's citizens). As the positive coefficient for this variable indicates, a position closer to the extreme of the party's base increases the likelihood of challenger emergence. However, the coefficient is only marginally significant (p‐value = 0.07) and its substantive impact is quite small. As the low and high values indicate, for incumbents positioned farther from their party base (the low category) the likelihood of challenge is .74 while for incumbents positioned closer to their party's base (the high category) it is only about .77. Thus, the substantive effect of policy position on challenger emergence is very small.         "
"27","The limited effect of partisan policy position is small indeed if one compares its effects to those of several district and institutional factors. As the findings from Table 1 show, two of the three statistically significant district‐level variables have a rather large influence on challenger emergence. The probability of challenger emergence decreases from .82 to .67 when moving from small to large districts. Past general election vote of the incumbent has an even greater influence. The likelihood of a challenge moves from .48 when the incumbent won the last election by a large margin to .91 when an incumbent won by a much smaller margin. Two contextual and institutional features also have a sizeable effect. Challenger emergence is about 10 percentage points less likely in a nonpresidential election year. More importantly, we see that the probability of a challenger emerging is .65 when the legislature is low on the professionalism scale but is .84 when the legislature is highly professional. Such findings comport with those of previous studies indicating that the greater amenities afforded to lawmakers in professional settings make their jobs attractive to would‐be challengers.         "
"28","So far, these findings demonstrate that voting closer to the party base has only a marginal effect on the likelihood that an incumbent is challenged. But how might this affect the ability of challengers to raise money?Table 2 presents the results of an OLS regression where the dependent variable is calculated as challenger spending as a percent of incumbent spending. One can see that many of the coefficients that were statistically significant predictors of challenger emergence have an influence here as well. For example, an increase in one standard deviation on the party advantage index (14.3) favoring the incumbent's party reduces the percentage of challenger spending by approximately 3 percentage points. An even larger effect can be seen when one alters the incumbent's past winning margin. An increase of one standard deviation (19.5) reduces challenger spending (as a percentage of incumbent spending) by nearly 13 percentage points. Interestingly, leadership, which had no influence on challenger emergence, has a rather large influence here, demonstrating that party leaders have little difficulty in outspending their opponents. In addition, chamber competition has an effect along with legislative professionalism. Consistent with past findings, challengers have a much more difficult time keeping pace with incumbents in professional legislatures where costs of running are higher. An increase in one standard deviation on the professionalism index (.15) reduces the challenger's percentage by nearly 17 points. Of course the most interesting effect for our purposes is the influence of policy position. This variable is an influence that was expected—challengers who oppose incumbents with more partisan policy positions raise and spend more money. While the effect is not substantial, it does show that these challengers facing incumbents whose voting record is one standard deviation higher on the measure of partisan policy voting spend nearly 5 percentage points more. As indicated earlier, such an effect may be due to several factors. One may be that challengers have an easier time raising money from donors when the opponent is perceived to be out of step with mainstream voters. Another possible explanation is that incumbents with extreme positions attract more credible or quality challengers who are simply better at fundraising. Either way, this effect suggests an elite‐driven response whereby potential challengers, financial donors, or both are affected by the policy positions of the sitting incumbent.24"
"29","Finally, how might voting record influence an incumbent's performance once challenged? Does a partisan policy record have a negative effect as some studies have assumed, or might it have a positive effect on incumbent vote margins?Table 3 presents the results of an OLS regression analysis where the incumbent's vote percentage is used as the dependent variable. Along with all the variables used in the earlier models, the analysis also examines the effects of campaign spending by challengers and incumbents. In addition, the model includes variables that examine the possible interactive effects of campaign spending and policy voting. As indicated earlier, whether policy voting has a positive or negative influence may depend on the relative levels of spending allocated by the competing candidates.         "
"30","The results presented in Table 3 show that many of the variables that were statistically significant in the earlier models continue to be influential here. For example, the incumbent's past winning percentage along with his or her party advantage in the district serve to increase the percentage of the vote received. Interestingly, for some of the variables, their effects on voting are very different than they were on challenger emergence. Whereas professionalism increased the likelihood that an incumbent is put in jeopardy (increases the probability of challenger emergence), here we see that the variable positively affects the percentage of the vote incumbents receive. In other words, challengers are more likely to run in professional legislatures; however, they do not perform as well as challengers who run against incumbents in citizen legislatures. Such an effect is most certainly due to the perks associated with more professional legislatures that give incumbents abundant resources to assist voters. Another differential effect is also seen with regard to district population. Challenger emergence is less likely in larger districts, but challengers who run in larger districts ultimately receive a higher percentage of the vote. This effect is probably due to the difficulty that incumbents have in building a personal following in heavily populated districts. Overall, these differential effects appear to be in line with previous studies, particularly those for professionalism (e.g., Berry, Berkman, and Schneiderman 2000; Hogan 2004; Squire 2000).         "
"31","The most interesting findings, however, are those related to partisan policy position and campaign spending. The direct effects of campaign financing for incumbents and challengers have an influence in a manner that we have come to expect given past studies on both the congressional (Abramowitz 1988; Jacobson 1978) and state legislative levels (e.g., Gierzynski and Breaux 1991).25 Here we find that challenger spending has a strong negative effect on incumbent vote margins while the influence of incumbent spending has almost no effect. Regarding the direct effect of partisan policy position, we see that the variable is not statistically significant. This is not too surprising given that this represents the effect of policy voting when both challenger and incumbent spending is 0. What is very interesting here are the conditional effects of partisan voting as shown by the interaction terms. Both interactions of policy and spending are statistically significant and demonstrate that campaign spending is conditioning the influence of partisan policy voting.26 Spending by the incumbent increases the positive effects of his or her partisan voting history whereas spending by challengers reduces the positive effects of partisan voting history. While such effects are detectable as they influence aggregate vote margins, it is important to note that these factors do not have much of an effect on the likelihood of winning or losing. Subsequent analyses conducted but not shown indicate few effects on the probability of incumbent reelection. Such a finding is not too surprising given the high probability of incumbent reelection coupled with the relatively larger substantive effects of campaign spending and district partisanship.27"
"32","Given the offsetting influences of incumbent and challenger spending, a clearer sense of how these factors interact with incumbent policy voting can be gained by graphing these effects. Figure 1 shows the influence of partisan policy voting on incumbent vote percentages under three different incumbent‐challenger spending scenarios. Each line represents a different campaign spending matchup where challenger to incumbent spending is set at 10%, 30%, and 100%.28 As one can see from this display, the magnitude of partisan policy voting varies with the relative level of campaign spending. When challenger spending is quite minimal (around 10% of incumbent spending), there is a positive relationship between partisan policy voting and incumbent vote percentage (approximately 32% of challengers spent 10% or less of what the incumbent spent). Moving across the range of partisan policy voting values (the end points of the graph represent two standard deviations in both directions from the mean), we see that incumbent vote percentages improve when they are voting closer to their party base of support (going from about 63% to about 67% of the vote). In races where challengers spend about 30% of what the incumbent spends, partisan policy voting continues to have a positive impact on incumbent vote totals; however, the slope is shallower. Finally, in situations where challengers spend 100% of what the incumbent spends (in the dataset only about 17% of challengers spent 100% or more of what the incumbent spent), incumbent vote percentages change hardly at all over the range of values for partisan policy voting. In these situations, an incumbent's voting record has almost no effect on his or her electoral margin.         "
"33","                 Interaction of Challenger Spending and Partisan Policy Voting on Incumbent Election Percentages                      "
"34","Overall, the findings from Table 3 and Figure 1 demonstrate that relative levels of spending by incumbents and challengers influence the relationship between partisan policy positions and percent of the vote incumbents receive. When challenger spending is sufficiently high relative to the incumbent, the information environment of state legislative races is altered. Such a context increases voter information about an incumbent's policy positions (particularly among swing voters), and this reduces the benefit that an incumbent might otherwise receive from having a more partisan policy record. One very interesting element of this is that it takes a very large amount of challenger spending to eliminate the positive effects of partisan policy voting by incumbents, much less to begin making it reduce an incumbent's vote margin. Given the generally high levels of spending by incumbents, then, it would appear that partisan policy votes by incumbents rarely have a negative influence, and very often have a positive effect on their vote margins. Such a finding is clearly counterintuitive from a standard Downsian perspective and is contrary to recent congressional research showing that moderate voting records benefit incumbent reelection efforts (e.g., Canes‐Wrone, Brady, and Cogan 2002; Erikson and Wright 2001). As indicated earlier, the low‐information context of state legislative elections creates an environment where incumbents can cast roll‐call votes in a manner consistent with their core partisan supporters and receive a small increase in their electoral margin for doing so. At best, even well‐financed challengers can only reduce the positive benefit of partisan policy voting. While these positive effects of partisan policy voting are not tremendous and are often outweighed by other factors such as campaign financing and district partisan conditions, they are sufficiently strong to affect aggregate vote margins.         "
"35","This analysis has examined the role of policy positions on the reelection efforts of state legislative incumbents. In terms of challenger emergence, incumbents who take policy positions farther from constituency preferences (and closer to the base of their party) are only slightly more likely to be challenged in the general election. Many other factors, namely legislative professionalism, district population, and past electoral margin, have a much greater influence on the likelihood that a challenger emerges. Such findings contrast with past studies at the congressional level and call into question the applicability of Downs' theory to state legislative elections. Political candidates and other political entrepreneurs (e.g., interest groups, party activists, etc.) are apparently motivated more by political conditions and institutional features than by the policy stances of current officeholders. However, some of these actors appear motivated to contribute funding to challengers who do emerge to run against more extreme incumbents. As the analysis of challenger spending demonstrates, partisan policy positions of incumbents serve to provide some improvement in a challenger's ability to keep pace with incumbent spending. Perhaps challengers use an incumbent's policy voting record as a way to elicit greater funding from donors."
"36","If Downs' theory does not appear to explain the motives of challenger entry, how does it fair in explaining average citizen behavior as observed in aggregate voting patterns? As the findings demonstrate, Downs' theory would appear to be turned on its head. It is not simply that incumbent policy positions fail to have an influence on their electoral prospects, but positions closer to the party base actually enhance the incumbent's vote share (although it does not affect an incumbent's probability of winning reelection). One might consider this to be counterintuitive, and compared to findings from the congressional literature it certainly is. But such a finding seems to make a great deal of sense if one considers that state legislative races are off the radar screen for the vast majority of voters, many of whom cannot even name their state representative. For the incumbent's core supporters, his or her activities while in office are quite important for their continued support. For these voters and other party activists, what Fenno (1978) would refer to as the “personal,”“primary,” and “reelection” constituencies, an incumbent's legislative voting record is critically important. A legislator who is unresponsive to these key constituencies risks losing their support. Policies that appeal to these supporters result in incumbents receiving a higher rate of return for their campaign spending.29"
"37","Such an interpretation certainly fits with our understanding of how modern campaigns are conducted. Practitioners know that for incumbents, the key to winning is in mobilizing one's base of support—party activists and people who believe strongly in the incumbent's cause. In a setting where there is little media to engage voters and no major party apparatus to stir support among independents, what better way to energize existing primary and election constituencies than by taking policy positions consistent with the preferences of those most likely to be convinced to turn out? The practical politics literature demonstrates that candidates often use a campaign strategy of tailoring campaign messages to core supporters (e.g., Shea 1996), particularly in low‐profile state legislative races (Loftus 1994). Among incumbents in particular, campaign messages are not intended to reach every voter, but are geared for remobilizing existing support (e.g., Goldenberg and Traugott 1984). Given this mixture of strategy combined with a low‐information environment, it is little wonder that partisan policy voting has a net positive influence on incumbent vote totals.         "
"38","Evidence to support such an underlying causal process can be observed in the conditional effects of challenger spending. As challenger spending rises (relative to the incumbent), the positive influence of partisan policy voting is diminished. This suggests that when a wider variety of voters (not just members of the incumbent's reelection constituency) are provided information, they are more likely to recognize the divergence of an incumbent's voting record from the district's preferences. Because challenger spending is focused on members of their own party along with “swing” voters and independents, the net effect is likely to be a smaller number of votes for incumbents who diverge from constituency preferences. Such a causal process, therefore, suggests that Downs' theory is applicable primarily in contexts where voters have greater information."
"39","Finally, in considering the influence of partisan policy position on incumbent reelection, one must be mindful of this factor's relative importance. As the results indicate, factors such as campaign spending, past partisan support in the district, and legislative professionalism have a much larger influence than policy positions. And, indeed the partisan policy position does little to influence the overall probability that an incumbent wins reelection. From such results one might conclude that an incumbent's voting record is not very important. However, such a conclusion seems unwarranted for at least three reasons. First, unlike party advantage in the district and legislative professionalism, how a legislator votes on matters of policy is completely within a legislator's sphere of control. The fact that this affects elections, if only by a small amount, means that the voters' level of satisfaction with the incumbent on matters of policy is registered by the political system. Such a finding should give solace to those worried that only external factors and not policy matters affect elections. Secondly, in considering the relative influence of policy positions one should remember that this observed effect results from activities of a highly strategic group of political actors. State legislators certainly recognize potential consequences of extreme policy positions and tailor their roll‐call record accordingly. In other words, the anticipated effects of negative electoral sanctions are also probably playing a role. The fact that we can observe such an effect at all suggests that the full influence of policy voting is probably quite large.30 Finally, because partisan policy position has an effect on vote margins, its influence may extend beyond the current election. As the results in Table 1 indicate, percentage of the vote won by incumbents in the last election strongly influences the likelihood that an incumbent is challenged. Thus, the incumbent's partisan policy position has an indirect electoral effect that spills over into the next election cycle.         "
"40","Overall, this article demonstrates that partisan policy positions affect the various stages of the reelection efforts of incumbents in state legislative elections. However, the mechanism responsible for this influence has less to do with challenger entry than it does with challenger spending and aggregate voting patterns. Challengers running against incumbents positioned closer to their party's base of support in the district receive greater funding but incumbents in such races ultimately receive a larger proportion of the general election vote (although this does not increase their likelihood of winning in the current election). Such findings provide insight into the causal process by which legislator activities can have electoral consequences. Policy voting does play a role, albeit in a fashion that does not necessarily reward responsiveness to median district voters."
"41","From a normative perspective, these findings would seem to raise concerns about representation in state legislatures. The fact that responsiveness to average voter preferences hinges, in part, on the ability of opposing candidates to raise significant amounts of money would seem to be particularly troubling given that challengers are so often outspent in both state legislative (e.g., Gierzynski and Breaux 1991) and congressional campaigns (Herrnson 2000; Jacobson 2004). These findings suggest that in order to enhance the role of policy responsiveness in elections, some solution is needed for increasing the amounts of money that challengers are able to raise and spend. Or, some alternative mechanism is necessary for increasing voter knowledge in these elections.         "
"42","From another perspective, however, these findings might not be too troubling. The fact that individual state legislators are responding to their own partisan base in their district does not necessarily mean that average citizen concerns are being ignored. The aggregate result of these individual legislators' behaviors could be a situation where the legislative institution collectively adopts policies that are congruent with the preferences of the state as a whole. Previous studies certainly find a high correlation between state public opinion and policies at the state level (e.g., Erikson, Wright, and McIver 1993). Future work will be needed to determine whether such an aggregation process is at work before any final assessment can be made.         "
"43","Beyond their implications for understanding state legislative elections, these findings also provide insight into how responsiveness may affect elections generally. As the findings demonstrate, the information environment performs a crucial conditioning role. Previous literature shows that campaign spending by candidates increases voter knowledge (Coleman and Manna 2000), and here we see how it affects the manner in which responsiveness ultimately influences elections. Invariably such effects are also present in congressional races due to variation in voter knowledge brought about by differences in campaign spending, media market congruence, and general population characteristics. This means that the ability of responsiveness to affect elections, a key mechanism for achieving accountability in representative democracy, varies considerably across political jurisdictions. Future research should consider the extent to which these and other factors play a conditioning role in the representation process.         "
