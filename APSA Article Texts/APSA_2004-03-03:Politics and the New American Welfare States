"1","Redistributing wealth to the indigent is one of the most contentious activities of American government. The unique political dynamics of these policies have interested political scientists at least since Lerner and Lasswell (1951) first began studying policy processes. Over the five decades of work that has followed from their pioneering studies, the major theories that have been developed to explain redistribution politics concentrate on the influence exerted by constituents, institutions, paternalistic goals, or state resources.         "
"2","One group of redistribution theories focuses on the influence of constituents. Three types of citizen characteristics have received close attention. First, Erickson, Wright, and McIver (1993) argue that state policy, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Medicaid policy in particular, was caused by public liberalism. Their models show that AFDC expenditures linearly increased, for instance, as state opinion became more liberal (McIver, Erickson, and Wright 2001). The influence of public liberalism on welfare policy is replicated in numerous other studies (Brown 1997; Ringquist et al. 1997). Second, racism has influenced redistribution politics. Hero and Tolbert argue that “much of state politics and policy is a product of racial/ethnic diversity” (1996, 853) and that Medicaid expenditures, in particular, linearly decrease as states become more diverse. The effect of race has been replicated by studies that show growing African American proportions on welfare rolls cause states to become less generous in their welfare policies (Brown 1997; Fording 1997; Hero 1998; Soss et al. 2001). Finally, class differences among voters have influenced policies in redistribution programs. Hill and Leighley argue that “the greater the degree of upper‐class bias in a state's electorate, the greater the degree to which distributive policies will favor the interests of higher‐income citizens” (1992, 353). Their evidence that differences in state levels of voter class bias caused variance in state AFDC expenditures is also replicated in additional studies (Ringquist et al. 1997). The expectation of each of these constituent pressure theories is that as citizens become more favorable toward welfare (i.e., more liberal, less racist, or less class biased), state policymakers pass more generous welfare policies.            "
"3","Another group of redistribution theories is based on the effect of institutional characteristics. There are two types of institutional characteristics that scholars have emphasized. First, party control influences the generosity of redistribution programs. Smith (1997) found that every additional Democratic seat in a state legislature caused an increase in state welfare expenditures. Barrilleaux, Holbrook, and Langer (2002) also find a party effect on welfare generosity, but show that Democrats were more likely to increase welfare spending as competition for their seats intensified. Another institutional explanation of redistribution policy is the government ideology thesis. Erickson, Wright, and McIver (1993) find that more liberal state governments spend more on welfare than less liberal governments, a finding that is replicated in a longitudinal analysis by Berry et al. (1998). The expectation of each of these theories is that as institutional pressure for welfare generosity dissipates (i.e., Republicans gain legislature seats, Democrats are elected by wider margins, or a state government becomes more conservative) the generosity of a state redistribution program will decrease.            "
"4","A third group of redistribution theories are based on the “paternalistic” role of government (Mead 1997). This argument, that government actively pursues a moral agenda in redistribution programs, is developed in two different theories. First, the reproductive behavior of citizens may influence state policymaker decisions about redistribution policies (Mead 1997). Soss et al. (2001) test this theory by hypothesizing that states may pass less generous welfare policies as the proportion of children born to unwed mothers increases. Presumably, state policymakers act to make welfare increasingly less attractive as this “immoral” behavior grows, since welfare may be seen as a viable source of funds for “immoral” behavior (Murray 1984). But, we test this hypothesis as a two‐sided alternative, since Murray (1984) also suggested that it is the compassionate reaction by state policymakers to growing numbers of children born out‐of‐wedlock that sustains this “immoral behavior” an argument many used to suggest the efficacy of AFDC was Losing Ground. It is also an argument some are using to endorse more austere and “paternalistic” TANF policies (Maynard 1997). Second, the welfare dependency of a state's population may cause policymakers to decrease welfare generosity. As the proportion of a state's population receiving welfare increases, Soss et al. (2001) hypothesize that policymakers may act to make welfare less generous so as to discourage further enrollment. Like their study, we test this effect as a two‐sided alternative, since policymakers also may react compassionately to the increasing number of their citizens in need of assistance. The expectations of the paternalism theories are more contestable than expectations for the effects of constituents, institutions, and resources. One set expects that as paternalistic pressures (i.e., out‐of‐wedlock birth rates and welfare dependency) increases, redistribution programs become less generous; while the other set predicts that paternalistic pressures are positively associated with welfare generosity.            "
"5","Finally, the resources of a state have influenced past redistribution policies. Two resource pressures, in particular, have influenced these programs. The first, state financial resources, influences welfare budgets. Tweedie (1994) finds that states with more resources will provide more generous benefits than less wealthy states, since wealthier states may have more slack resources to afford more generous welfare expenditures than less wealthy states. The second, state competition over resources, has also influenced redistribution programs. This theory predicts that as neighboring states reduce benefits a state will reduce their own benefits so as to avoid becoming a “welfare magnet” for enterprising welfare clients (Peterson and Rom 1989; Rom, Peterson, and Scheve 1998). The expectation of each of these theories is that policymakers will pass welfare policies that are less generous as state financial resources decrease and the interstate competition over these resources increases.1"
"6","State constituents, institutions, paternalistic goals, and resources are expected to influence the generosity of state redistribution programs. To test these expectations we examine the monetary and social policies in one of the largest intergovernmental welfare programs, TANF. We measure TANF monetary policy as a state's maximum benefit for a family of three.2 Similar to AFDC, states are able to set the TANF benefit levels (Weil and Finegold 2002). Some states have increased their benefit levels, others have maintained their levels, while still others have lowered their benefit levels.3 Generosity in monetary policy is measured as the amount expended on this benefit: more generous states expend more money, less generous states expend less.         "
"7","Two additional dependent variables are used to estimate the effect of politics on new social policy in welfare. Social policies refer to the rules that govern every stage of welfare, from the initial application to on‐going behavior requirements to the transition out of welfare. Since there are as many combinations of state social policies as there are states (Holcomb and Martinson 2002), many useful trends in state rules have been used to make generalizations about the generosity of state TANF social policy decisions. One of the most widely used trends is state decisions in work incentive and eligibility policies, or “carrots and sticks” (Hedge, Johnson, and Currinder 2000; Karch 2002; Zedlweski 1998). Others have focused on both eligibility rules and benefits (Weil 2001), and still others have focused on specific policy decisions, such as state time limits on welfare (Weil and Finegold 2002; Soss et al. 2001).         "
"8","Common disadvantages threaten the validity of using these trends as generalizable measures of welfare generosity. Most obviously, each measure only focuses on a particular stage of welfare programs, leaving much of the variance in and between state programs unobserved. Carrots and sticks, for instance, leave the wide variance in state work exemption laws out of any analysis. Each has also only focused on a handful of unique rules in the universe of TANF policies that states have promulgated under their new authority (Rowe 2000). Finally, many of these analyses are based on cross‐sections, even though the timing of reform varied across states (Holcomb and Martinson 2002). For these reasons, we develop alternative measures to characterize the generosity of TANF social policy over time.4"
"9","Two broad dimensions of welfare social policy were identified.5 The first are 28 unique state‐eligibility rules. Similar to studies that have focused on sticks (Hedge 2000; Karch 2002; Zedlweski 1998), we include in this measure the rules that govern the initial eligibility of applicants. For instance, some states give families the option of whether or not they want to include a stepparent in the assistance unit, whereas other states prohibit the inclusion, and in still others states, their inclusion in the unit is mandatory. Eligibility decisions are not limited to rules that determine who is initially eligible for welfare, however. In fact, there are many rules that determine the continuing eligibility of recipients, or rules that govern how a recipient must behave to continue receiving benefits. For instance, some states have adopted a rule that determines whether a unit would lose eligibility if the dependent children in the unit were not in school and meeting certain specified levels of achievement. Both the initial and continuing eligibility rules determine the type and number of people that the state will support with welfare. Each state is assigned a 1 if the rule is in place and 0 if it is not. Totals for each state and every year were calculated, where higher numbers indicate a more strict approach to eligibility policy; or that more rules are in place to limit welfare participation. More information about the rules in this index is included in Appendix A.6"
"10","The second dimension of social policy is 12 state decisions on the flexibility of new welfare work requirements, a component of state decisions that has frequently been excluded from analysis.7 Federal law mandates that most welfare clients now enter the workforce after 24 months of cash benefits, but some states have enacted a variety of rules to exempt several types of clients from this requirement. For instance, some states have passed a rule that waives work requirements for clients that are caring for a child under 12 months of age. Some states have also allowed clients not to enter the workforce by allowing them to fulfill their requirements by taking work training or education (e.g., G.E.D.) classes. All of these rules exempt welfare clients from entering the workforce and can extend the duration of welfare benefits. Each state is assigned a 1 if the rule is in place and 0 if it is not. Totals for each state and every year were calculated, where higher numbers indicate a more flexible policy approach. More information about the rules in this index is also included in Appendix A.8"
"11","The implications of the redistribution theories for the generosity of TANF monetary and social policies are quite straightforward. States are expected to pass more generous TANF monetary policies, less strict eligibility policies, and more flexible work rules, when any of the following changes occur: (1) state liberalism increases, (2) the proportion of African American, or (3) Latino TANF recipients falls,9 (4) the level of high class bias in the electorate falls; (5) Democratic legislative composition increases; (6) government liberalism increases; (7) the proportion of unwed mothers (in)decreases; (8) the proportion of a state's population receiving welfare (in)decreases; (9) state resources increase; or (10) the neighboring states adopt more generous policies. Measures and sources of data for each of these explanations are in Appendix B.         "
"12","In Table 1 we test our expectations for the political determinants of postreform welfare policies. The time series is 1997–99; the cross section is all states but Alaska, Hawaii, and Nebraska.10 Our findings confirm the strong role of race in TANF politics that Soss et al. (2001) recently reported, but we find that other constituent characteristics, and institutions, paternalistic goals, and state resources also have a consistent influence on welfare policy.         "
"13","Model 1 tests our expectations for the approach states have adopted toward TANF eligibility. Why is it that some states have aggressively enacted rules at every stage of TANF, from the initial application to on‐going behavior requirements, which limit TANF participation? Our results suggest that differences in state constituents and institutions explain much of this variance. Together, measures for the nine explanations account for nearly half of the variance in state eligibility approaches, and eight of the nine explanations have significant estimates."
"14","Like Soss et al. (2001) our results suggest that the proportion of African American recipients has a significant effect on the strictness of eligibility policies. Our model predicts, ceteris paribus, that states with a 75% African American caseload have eligibility policies that are 15% more strict than in states where 25% of the caseload is African American. But the effect of race on eligibility strictness is not constant on eligibility policies. States with a 25% Latino caseload are predicted to have eligibility policies that are 29% less strict than states with a 75% Latino caseload. These effects seem to be separate from each other, however. The Pearson product‐moment correlation between the proportion African American and Latino variables is −.21, which suggests that the strong, negative reaction of policymakers to a large proportion of African American recipients is not mitigated by a large Latino proportion. We will find, however, that the proportions of both African Americans and Latinos have a similar effect in later models discussed in this article.         "
"15","Significant parameter estimates for the measures of public liberalism and high‐income representation bias confirm the dominant role constituents play in TANF policy. The interpretations of these data in Table 3 show that liberal states have less strict eligibility policies than conservative states, and states with larger levels of high‐income representation bias put up more barriers for TANF eligibility.11 Both of these effects are robust and are consistent with our expectations.         "
"16","Institutions also have an effect on eligibility policy approaches, though one that is smaller relative to constituents.12 We find evidence that Smith's (1997) finding that Democrats pass more generous AFDC welfare policies than Republicans is also true of TANF policy. Effects of each additional Democrat are quite small, but the differences between a statehouse controlled by Democrats and one controlled by Republicans are quite large. Our model predicts that statehouses where 25% of the legislators are Democratic enact eligibility policies that are 15% more strict than statehouses populated by a 75% Democrat majority. We also find that more liberal governments enact fewer welfare‐eligibility restrictions than conservative governments, indicating that liberal governments pass more generous welfare policies.         "
"17","In contrast to these robust constituent and institution influences, the effects of resource pressures on eligibility are nearly absent. States with more slack resources did not enact more generous eligibility policies, even though they may have had the funds to afford more clients. Further, states seem to be only mildly concerned about the effect that their eligibility policy has on attracting welfare clients in neighboring states. However, state policymakers do seem to react compassionately to growing need among indigent families. Our models predict that policymakers make welfare more available as either the unmarried birth rate or welfare demand in a state increased."
"18","In Model 2 we turn to our analysis of policy flexibility. Why is it that some states allow a great number of exemptions from traditional work requirements, for instance, while others allow only a few? The results suggest that the flexibility of a state's welfare work requirements has a great deal to do with once again, constituents and institutions. Although the results indicate these flexibility policies are not affected by Latino proportion of clients, the African American proportion of TANF recipients exercises a significant influence on the flexibility of work‐requirement policies. Our model predicts that welfare work requirements are 19% less flexible in states with a 75% African American clientele than in states with only a 25% African American proportion, a difference that is nearly identical to the effects on eligibility policies. These findings further emphasize the Soss et al. (2001) finding that policymakers have a strong, negative reaction to growing proportions of African American recipients.         "
"19","Contrary to their findings, however, we find that several other pressures constantly influence welfare policy. Our model predicts that states with high levels of high‐income representational bias that are one standard deviation above the mean, show 16% less flexibility to their welfare recipients than in states with low levels of bias, one standard deviation below the mean. The direction of the public liberalism variable is also consistent with our expectations, indicating more liberal states have passed more rules to allow welfare clients to continue receiving benefits without working."
"20","The institutions that produce welfare programs are also a significant influence on the flexibility of welfare policies. Once again we find that welfare generosity increases as the proportion of Democrats in government increases. Our model predicts that a statehouse with a 25% minority of Democrats will pass policies that are 22% less flexible than states with a 75% majority of Democrats. More liberal governments are also predicted to show more flexibility in their welfare work requirements than conservative governments, although the effects are smaller relative to the direct‐party effects. These findings show that clients in states led by Democrats and liberals are much more likely to be offered exemptions from traditional work requirements. Both findings conform to our expectations, and to intuitive policy differences between Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals."
"21","Similar to Model 1 findings, the resource and paternalism pressures are a less robust influence on welfare work requirements, each with a joint effect that is much smaller than the constituent and institution pressures. States with more slack resources allow more clients to continue receiving benefits while not meeting traditional work requirements. Also, we find further evidence that state policymakers react compassionately to growing need, by showing more flexibility to welfare clients. But welfare demand does not trigger any significant changes to flexibility policy and, once again, states do not seem to take into account the work policies of neighboring states."
"22","The set of results in Table 2 are from the models we ran to determine why there is so much variance in the amount of money states give to TANF families. In 2000, for instance, the mean benefit for a family of three was around $600, but the standard deviation was over $240, and Florida, Vermont, and Washington each gave the average family of three over $1,000 in cash benefits. Our model suggests that constituents, institutions, resources, and paternalistic goals all exerted influence on this benefit variability.         "
"23","Once again we find that the African American proportion of TANF recipients continues to exercise influence on welfare generosity, making it one of the most consistent predictors of the nine we consider. States with a 25% African American proportion are predicted to give families of three 31% more money than in states with a 75% African American proportion, a difference of over $100. This is a significant difference that is felt by individual clients, since an average family of three between 1997 and 2000 received $620 in cash benefits. We also find, contrary to Model 1 findings, that the effects of race on cash benefits are constant across minority races. As the proportion of Latinos increases from one standard deviation below the mean Latino proportion to one above, the results in Table 3 indicate that states are expected to decrease benefits by 26%. This evidence further emphasizes the strong role of race that Soss et al. (2001) report.         "
"24","The two other constituent pressure variables also exercise influence on welfare generosity. Our model predicts that a state one standard deviation more liberal than the average state gives about 19% more to a family of three than a state one standard deviation more conservative than the mean. That the average benefit is about $620 during this period suggests again that this difference is one that must be felt by individual clients. We also find that states with more high‐income representation bias provide higher benefits than states with less bias. This is likely the case because we have found that these same states make welfare much more difficult to receive and are much less flexible with their clients, suggesting that benefits are paid to relatively less people and for a shorter time period."
"25","Institutions also influence welfare monetary policy, although to a lesser degree than social policy. A state government one standard deviation more liberal than the average state government is predicted to give a family of three an insignificantly different amount than a state government one standard deviation more conservative than the typical state government. However, the effect of Democratic control is significant, but in the opposite direction to a standard party expectation. Since this effect is in the predicted direction in Models 1–4, it may be that Barrilleaux, Holbrook, and Langer's (2002) finding that competition effects party welfare spending differences may be important in this model.         "
"26","Turning to the parameters that test the resource and paternalism hypotheses, we find more support than in the two previous analyses. States appear to closely track their neighbors' benefits, lowering their benefits as the average neighboring state lowers their benefits. It would seem from this evidence that state policymakers think that enterprising clients track neighboring monetary policies, but are less likely to track social policies. Slack resources generated by higher levels of GSP also produce higher benefits, since states can afford to be more generous. We also find that the effects of the reproductive behavior of state citizens is not considered by policymakers in our models, making it the least influential and consistent influence in all of the models we consider. Finally, the effects of welfare demand remain influential, suggesting that state policymakers watch and react systematically to changing levels of need in their states. Since the range of this variability is perennially quite low in all states, however, the actual cost to state governments posed by this policy change is likely quite low."
"27","This project was designed to determine why there is so much variability in the welfare policy approaches taken by state governments under devolution. We examined these policy approaches by creating measures of the new welfare rules that determine who can receive welfare, what types of clients are exempted from new work requirements, and the monetary value of benefits. Our results indicate that different approaches to welfare are attributable to the unique, and very potent, combination of political characteristics in each state."
"28","In particular, our results confirm the strong negative reaction that Soss et al. (2001) found states have to growing African American proportions of TANF recipients. As this proportion grew, states reacted by lowering benefits and making eligibility rules stricter and program work requirements less flexible. We also find that other constituent characteristics and institutions, resources, and paternalism goals have a consistent influence on welfare policy. Although the amount of pressure exerted by constituents, institutions, resources and paternalism goals is variable between policies, our results indicate that all of these political variables are generally influential in state welfare policy.         "
"29","These findings indicate that the politics of TANF policy closely resembles what scholars identified as the politics of prereform welfare policy, despite the major programmatic changes caused by reform. Implementation of TANF may have radically changed the power structure of welfare politics by shifting a substantial amount of policy authority to the states, but it has not changed the politics of welfare policy. Indeed, state policymakers have seized the new autonomy granted to them under reform, acting on the unique constituent, institutional, resource, and paternalistic pressures in their respective states."
"30","For welfare clients, this empowerment of state representatives has meant that their experience on welfare will vary even more widely between the states. Successful applications for welfare or petitions to miss work in one state, for instance, can be rejected in other states. These different outcomes for a poor person seeking assistance show that devolution has empowered many different approaches to welfare. While it will be the task of future work to determine the effectiveness of these unique approaches, our article has shown that these welfare policies are created in an extremely politicized environment, an environment that any proposal to change welfare policy will have to take into account."
