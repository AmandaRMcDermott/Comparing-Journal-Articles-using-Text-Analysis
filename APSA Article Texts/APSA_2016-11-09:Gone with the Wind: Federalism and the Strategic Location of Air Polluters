"1","Federalism is often promoted as an institution that provides numerous societal benefits. Some scholars argue that devolution to subnational governments creates conditions conducive to economic growth, so‐called market‐preserving federalism (Qian and Weingast 1997). Others posit that federalism improves political outcomes, including protection of individual rights (Buchanan 1995), reduced corruption (Brennan and Buchanan 1980; Fisman and Gatti 2002), and dampened ethnic tensions (Lijphart 1977; Lustick, Miodownik, and Eidelson 2004). Still others contend that federalism creates innovation (Shipan and Volden 2006; Walker 1969), and that policy successes diffuse across subnational governments (Volden 2006).         "
"2","Devolving policy authority to subnational governments does not, of course, guarantee salutary results. The realization of the beneficial outcomes enumerated above is circumscribed by political, economic, and institutional factors (Bednar 2011). Moreover, the theories of federalism underpinning most of these arguments rely on important assumptions that are certainly violated in some circumstances (Oates 1972; Tiebout 1956). One such assumption is the absence of interjurisdictional externalities. In fact, the existence of negative interjurisdictional externalities is one of the strongest justifications for assigning policy authority to central governments. Subnational governments often lack incentives to consider their policies' effect outside their geographic boundaries. From the point of view of the nation as a whole, decentralized policymaking in the presence of externalities thus can generate suboptimal policy outcomes. Problems of policy coordination emerge, as exemplified by the question of how to coordinate the management of natural resources, such as rivers, that cross state borders (Heikkila and Schlager 2012; Lubell et al. 2002).         "
"3","An important manifestation of interjurisdictional externalities concerns whether states export their pollution across state borders. States have strong incentives to promote this type of spatial externality so they can capture the benefits of economic development within their own borders while shifting the environmental and health costs to their neighbors (Hutchinson and Kennedy 2008; Oates 2002; Revesz 1996). The central idea is that state officials desire the employment, tax revenue, and other economic benefits that come with industry, but they also want to limit intrastate environmental impacts when they can. These perverse incentives to export pollution—or what is commonly referred to as environmental free riding—may confound pollution control efforts in the United States due to the central role that state governments play in implementing environmental policy (Lowry 1992; Revesz 1996). Indeed, there is a long list of instances in which the U.S. states have accused each other of deliberately exporting pollution to other states. These types of disputes date as far back as a 1907 U.S. Supreme Court case, Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., in which Georgia claimed that sulfur dioxide emissions from Tennessee‐based copper smelters were despoiling forests and orchards and creating health problems for residents of bordering counties in Georgia.         "
"4","Scholars are paying increasing attention to the free‐riding problem and its implications for environmental policy. Formal models of federalism suggest that incentives to free ride pose a significant threat to environmental quality in nations that decentralize environmental quality control, such as the United States (Hutchinson and Kennedy 2008; Silva and Caplan 1997). Empirical assessments suggest that pollution levels are systematically elevated near state borders relative to interior regions (Helland and Whitford 2003; Sigman 2005). The combined scholarly and real‐world emphasis that has been placed on the issue produces a strong expectation that states engage in environmental free‐riding behavior.         "
"5","Yet studies that directly assess subnational governments' regulatory actions have found limited support for the contention that differences in pollution levels near geographic boundaries are the result of regulatory decisions (Gray and Shadbegian 2004; Konisky and Woods 2010, 2012). These results have led to speculation that, at least within the U.S. context, either top‐down efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or bottom‐up efforts by local policy networks may be sufficient to overcome state incentives to promote spatial pollution externalities (Konisky and Woods 2012).         "
"6","In this article, we reconcile these conflicting findings. We posit that environmental free riding is at least partially a function of the geographic location of polluting facilities themselves. We argue that states have strong incentives, as well as the capacity, to encourage the siting of facilities in locations where their pollution can be exported to neighboring jurisdictions. Moreover, we argue, firms seeking to minimize local opposition to polluting facilities have their own incentives to locate polluting facilities near downwind borders."
"7","To test our argument, we employ spatial point pattern analysis—a method novel to political science—to determine whether large, stationary air pollution sources are disproportionately located near downwind states. Based on a national data set of 36,747 industrial locations, our results indicate that air‐polluting facilities are significantly more likely to be located near a state's downwind border than a control group of other industrial facilities. This core result is evident across a wide variety of model specifications, and the effect is particularly pronounced for facilities emitting more harmful air pollution."
"8","Finding strong evidence of environmental free riding through facility location, we then examine three explanations that may account for this geographic configuration of industrial facilities: the use of state environmental regulation, the use of alternative state‐level policy tools to influence industrial siting decisions, and strategic firms' responding to “not in my backyard” (NIMBY) political dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates support for each explanation, suggesting that spatial pollution externalities may be generated both by explicit state policy and from rationally acting firms. In either case, they suggest a political explanation for the tendency of large air pollution sources to be located downwind from state neighbors. These results point to both policy opportunities and constraints, which we examine in the conclusion.         "
"9","Environmental free riding has been empirically examined in two streams of literature. One approach examines evidence of transboundary pollution. Higher pollution levels near borders relative to interior area suggest that governments seek to induce pollution externalities. Studying the U.S. states, Helland and Whitford (2003) find that industrial toxic chemical releases to the air and water are systematically higher in counties that border other states. For toxic air emissions, they find a particularly strong effect in counties on the eastern edge of states, where prevailing wind patterns are most likely to carry pollution across state lines. Other research shows that water pollution levels in rivers are higher downstream from U.S. state (Sigman 2005) and international (Sigman 2002) borders than in interior locations. Some studies, however, find mixed or no evidence of elevated air and water emissions near U.S. state borders (Gray and Shadbegian 2004, 2007).         "
"10","A second body of work examines government regulatory behavior directly. Studies in this literature explicitly test the central theoretical prediction of the environmental free‐riding argument by directly assessing subnational government decision making. Empirical studies have examined whether U.S. state government agencies inspect polluting facilities or enforce pollution control laws with less vigor if their pollution is likely to migrate out of state. In general, researchers have found sparse evidence of differential inspection and enforcement activity near state borders, although the results do indicate significantly weaker state air enforcement near international borders, suggesting that states may strategically allocate their enforcement effort in ways that serve to export pollution to Canada and Mexico (Gray and Shadbegian 2004; Konisky and Woods 2010, 2012).         "
"11","Thus, there is a disjuncture in the literature. Studies of transboundary pollution largely find evidence of higher pollution levels near borders, but analysis of regulatory activity largely suggests that this is not the result of government behavior. One possible explanation for this paradox is that environmental free riding is the result of the spatial distribution of polluting facilities, rather than differences in how regulators treat these facilities after their siting. In other words, the observed spatial pollution externalities may stem from decisions made by government or firm decision makers at the time a facility's location is determined."
"12","Many scholars claim that American states can or do encourage polluters to locate near borders (Bednar 2009; Hall 2008; Mank 1995). On air pollution, Revesz notes that “the level of pollution externalities is affected by the location of sources. In the eastern part of the United States, where the problem of interstate pollution is most serious, the prevailing winds generally blow from west to east. Thus, states have an incentive to induce their sources to locate close to their downwind borders so that the bulk of the effects of the pollution is externalized” (2008, 51). Similarly, Landrigan, Halper, and Silbergeld (1989, 320) analyzed the U.S. Metals plant in Carteret, New Jersey, which emitted large quantities of lead onto Staten Island, New York. They conclude: “The geography of trans‐boundary pollution illustrated by this episode may describe a paradigm for the siting of point sources of air pollution. … In the New York‐New Jersey‐Connecticut tristate area, prevailing winds are west to east. Perhaps to take advantage of this wind pattern, a high proportion of existing and proposed resource recovery plants are sited on the eastern boundary of the regulatory entity in which they are located.”1"
"13","Broadly speaking, there are two types of policy tools that state governments may employ to induce facilities to locate near borders. The first is environmental regulation itself. Consider the Big Stone II power plant, a proposed 500‐megawatt coal‐fired plant that was controversial in the mid‐2000s. Although the major utilities involved were Minnesota‐based and the power generated was primarily intended for the Minneapolis region, the plant was to be located just across the border near Milbank, South Dakota. Doubtless one of the reasons for this locational choice was that South Dakota was willing to approve a permit for the plant that did not require it to install state‐of‐the art pollution control equipment (Clean Water Action 2009), possibly because the prevailing winds meant that almost all of the effects of the pollution would be felt in Minnesota, a fact the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources noted in opposing the permit (Meersman 2006).2"
"14","Past research has largely rejected the common assertion that states are more lax in their regulatory enforcement of facilities near state borders relative to facilities in interior parts of the states (Gray and Shadbegian 2004; Konisky and Woods 2010, 2012). However, as the Big Stone II example indicates, states may use other environmental policy tools to achieve this goal, such as the permitting process that licenses major pollution sources to operate. States may, for example, include more relaxed pollution control obligations for facilities when emissions are expected to travel across state boundaries.3 There is considerable research indicating that new firms are systematically more likely to site facilities in locations with lower regulatory compliance costs (Becker and Henderson 2000; List et al. 2003).            "
"15","Firm location in border areas may also result from states using non‐environmental policy tools. In fact, studies of industry location typically suggest that factors other than regulatory compliance cost differentials are important when deciding where to locate a new facility (Jaffe et al. 1995). Because state environmental agencies generally have an organizational culture that values environmental protection, states may find alternative policy tools more effective in inducing free‐riding behavior. A wide variety of such tools could be employed to induce firms to locate near borders, including tax incentives and subsidies (Revesz 2008).            "
"16","Although the literature on environmental free riding posits that subnational governments promote interjurisdictional externalities, we argue that firms may systematically choose to locate near leeward borders even in the absence of state policy intervention. A firm interested in siting a facility whose environmental effects may be perceived as being noxious will expect to face significant opposition from concerned local residents (Kraft and Clary 1991). These NIMBY dynamics may lead to substantial political and legal costs, including the costs of participating in regulatory proceedings and court battles or the opportunity costs imposed by a delay in construction (Kimelberg 2010; Rabe 1994).            "
"17","A rational firm will consider these potential costs ex ante in making location decisions. Generally, the amount of opposition to a facility reflects two considerations: (1) the value that residents place on environmental amenities, and (2) their ability to overcome collective action problems to mobilize opposition (Hamilton 1993; Lubell, Vedlitz, and Zahran 2006). We argue that a third important factor is access to the appropriate political, regulatory, and legal channels necessary to voice effective opposition. If a large percentage of those threatened by a firm's location are out‐of‐state residents, then access to these avenues for expressing opposition are significantly diminished. Out‐of‐state residents largely lack political representation and may have reduced opportunities to contest the site in regulatory and legal arenas. Thus, a rational firm seeking to minimize organized political opposition will seek to locate in places where pollution largely affects nonresidents.            "
"18","Either strategic decision making by states seeking to minimize environmental and health costs on state residents or strategic decision making by firms seeking to minimize political opposition to polluting facilities should lead us to observe a specific geographic configuration of industrial locations. Large, stationary sources of air pollution, whose pollution is likely to have significant environmental and human health impacts, should be disproportionately located in places where this pollution is more likely to cross state boundaries. This basic logic leads us to our principal hypothesis: Air‐polluting facilities should be systematically located toward downwind borders. Evidence consistent with this expectation would provide an explanation for past observations of higher pollution levels near interstate borders, despite little evidence of differential state regulatory efforts."
"19","Moreover, the incentives that states and firms have to engage in locational free riding should be stronger when the facilities produce pollution that involves greater risk to human health. The social costs associated with these facilities are greater, thereby providing additional incentive for polluters to locate in places where those costs will be shouldered by a neighboring state. Therefore, we hypothesize that facilities that emit more harmful air pollution will be located closer to downwind borders than other types of air polluters."
"20","Each of the above hypotheses could be supported irrespective of the causal process that underlies them, as the logic underlying both strategic state behavior and strategic firm behavior discussed above will produce observationally equivalent results. However, our data also allow us to investigate conditional patterns of polluter location across states to help shed light on these underlying causal processes, which we discuss later in the article. We turn next to developing an empirical strategy for testing these hypotheses."
"21","To test our hypotheses, we need to model where in latitude and longitude a state's air‐polluting facilities tend to be located, ideally in comparison to a control group of facilities that have similar siting requirements but do not generate pollution externalities on state neighbors. Point pattern analysis is ideal for this purpose. Spatial point pattern analysis models the risk for an observation to occur relative to a broader underlying population. Epidemiologists often use this technique to analyze where cases of disease occur relative to the population at risk. The classic example of this methodology is John Snow's map of cholera deaths in London in 1854, showing that residents nearest to a particular well were most at risk to contract cholera. Many researchers since have used this technique to discern how patterns in disease can shed light on causes of public health concerns. We believe that this technique also can be applied to political questions.         "
"22","At the most basic level, a spatial point process can be thought of as an inhomogeneous Poisson process where events can occur in an arbitrarily small space (Cressie 1993, 650–57). If the larger area where events could occur were divided into a grid, each cell would contain a certain count of observations based on the spatially varying Poisson process. Typically, an inhomogeneous Poisson process is modeled as a smoothed process, where the estimator of the spatially varying intensity parameter is (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gómez‐Rubio 2008, 165):            "
"23","In epidemiology, the spatial propensity for a case of a disease is not as interesting without reference to the population of interest. Disease cases are more likely to occur in densely populated places, and similarly, large air polluters are more likely to emerge in industrially developed regions. Hence, the relative risk of a disease or a polluter given the underlying population interests us. Studying the relative risk requires modeling an appropriate control group's underlying point process. With models of cases and controls, the relative risk is            "
"24","Turning to the approach we use, Kelsall and Diggle (1998) later observe that pooling cases and controls and using a binary estimator yields another valid estimate of relative risk:            "
"25","We fit a point pattern model to the pooled locations of two industrial groups. The case group is major air pollution sources, which are a category of large stationary sources (e.g., power plants, factories) regulated by the 1970 Clean Air Act.5 The control group is large‐quantity generators of hazardous waste.6 These facilities are similar to major air pollution sources in important ways, but as we define them, they are not large sources of air pollution.            "
"26","Following Kelsall and Diggle (1998), we pool cases and controls in a binary estimator and fit a logistic generalized additive model. This means that we nonparametrically estimate the baseline relative risk of a major air polluter emerging at a particular place, yet also incorporate covariate terms into the relative risk. Equation 1 presents the formalized model:               "
"27","In our case,  contains a constant and the covariate of distance from the leeward border. Our primary hypothesis is that the coefficient for this covariate will be negative: In other words, the farther a site is from the downwind border, the less likely it should serve as the site of a major air polluter. We subject this hypothesis to a stringent test because  is a data‐driven spline function that takes on higher or lower values based on local averages of the predicted probabilities. This smoothed term may vary in any way that will capture spatial changes in the relative risk, which could emerge for a variety of reasons. Therefore, distance from the downwind border has to offer additional explanation above and beyond this data‐driven term that can control for a wide array of processes.            "
"28","This research design provides a powerful test of the environmental free‐riding hypothesis as it pertains to facility location. With this design, it is unnecessary to control for the factors (e.g., market demand, natural resources, labor supply, infrastructure) that correlate with facility siting for two reasons. First, these factors are similar in their distribution in upwind and downwind parts of states. For example, major air polluters often locate near water features. Many manufacturing processes are water‐intensive, and being located near a major waterway provides a means for transporting inputs to a facility, finished products to downstream markets, and waste to disposal facilities. Although major water features tend to form the borders of states, they are not systematically located on the downwind border. Population centers serving as markets and labor pools are similarly distributed."
"29","Second, the observed siting pattern is identified relative to a carefully selected control group: large‐quantity generators of hazardous waste. As with major air polluters, these hazardous waste generators tend to be manufacturing and other industrial facilities; thus, the factors noted above that are important in site selection for major air polluters similarly apply to hazardous waste producers' siting. Using these facilities as a control group thus acts as a surrogate for many factors that lead industrial facilities to locate in particular areas. However, unlike major air polluters, there is no strong reason to locate a site that produces non‐airborne hazardous waste either upwind or downwind. EPA regulations require these sites' pollution to be contained, and solid waste is not subject to the same type of long‐range dispersion through airsheds.7 The placement of large‐quantity hazardous waste generators should not be subject to the same kind of free‐riding motivation that we suggest is present for major air polluters, but if similar motivations are present due to real or perceived worries of leakage, then our test of environmental free riding is more conservative.            "
"30","To specify the model presented in Equation 1, we gathered polluter site information from the EPA's Geospatial Data Access Project. These data identify the populations of major air polluters and large‐quantity generators of hazardous waste, along with the latitude and longitude coordinates for each site. Facilities in both groups are treated as major air polluters. Our outcome variable is the probability that a particular site hosts a major air polluter rather than a hazardous waste generator.            "
"31","Our primary hypothesis is that the farther a site is from the leeward border, the lower the relative risk of a major air polluter. To measure distance to the downwind border at all 36,747 sites we analyze (16,211 cases and 20,536 controls), we use a three‐step process. First, we estimate the wind direction at each site. Figure 1 displays the prevailing wind direction for 299 weather stations across the United States (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 1998). To interpolate the prevailing wind direction at all polluter sites, we fit a circular kriging model to forecast at new locations. With any data for which the outcome variable should be treated as an angle, the model needs to account for the unique features that angular data can pose (Gill and Hangartner 2010). For instance, if the wind is blowing due north, that is 360° on a compass. Slightly deviating values might be 359° or 1°, and such values need to be recognized as similar (a feature many models would miss). We follow Morphet's (2009) approach, which addresses the needs of a circular outcome and forecasts using kriging. Kriging is common to fields like meteorology and produces forecasts through two components: a trend term and a weighted average of residuals from the trend model, with the residuals of more geographically proximate observations getting more weight (Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand 2004, chap. 2). In our case, the wind direction forecast at each polluter site consists of a prediction from a trend term (based on the site's latitude and longitude) plus a weighted average of the residual direction from the model fitted over 299 observed weather stations (with more proximate stations getting greater weight). Hence, we use broad trends in wind direction as well as unique features of local patterns to interpolate the prevailing winds at each site.            "
"32","The second step in calculating distance to the downwind border is to find the latitude and longitude coordinate of the spot on the border that is directly downwind. By drawing a long ray based on the interpolated wind angle at each site, we can identify where this ray intersects the state border.8 With the latitude and longitude coordinates of the polluter's location and the coordinates for the downwind point on the border, we can compute the distance from the leeward border, using the great‐circle formula (Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand 2004, 17).            "
"33","Third, we divide the distance at each site by the longest distance in the state. In other words, for each state, the distance between the site farthest from the downwind border defines the scale for the variable. Hence, our measure ranges from 0 at the downwind border to 1 at the farthest distance. We rescale in this way to prevent the result from being driven by industrial differences between states with small versus large land areas. Thus, in three steps, we compute our primary covariate of interest, scaled distance to a site's downwind border."
"34","Table 1 presents the results from estimating the model in Equation 1. The table reports five specifications of the model. The first column presents our primary result, using our measure of scaled distance from the leeward border. We obtain a negative and discernible coefficient on the input of scaled leeward distance. Consistent with our hypothesis, as the distance from a downwind border increases, the relative risk that a site will host a major air polluter decreases. Therefore, the concentration of major air polluters relative to large‐quantity generators of hazardous waste is higher closer to downwind borders. To move from a site on a state border to the site that is farthest upwind diminishes the odds of a major air polluter relative to a hazardous waste generator by a substantial 22.4%. In fact, even moving a tenth of this distance diminishes the odds of a major air polluter by 2.5%. Recall that rather than looking at the concentration of air‐polluting facilities alone for this result, we examine the preponderance of these facilities controlling for an area's level of industrialization. Moreover, we model the relative concentration with a nonparametric baseline relative risk, meaning that even in a model of the relative preponderance of major air polluters, any number of unobserved factors shaping local trends is controlled for. Therefore, this negative and discernible effect is strongly indicative of locational free riding.         "
"35","Table 1 also verifies this effect's robustness with alternative versions of this model using different distance measures. The second column uses an unscaled measure of distance to downwind border—kilometers from a site to the point on the border directly downwind. Again, the effect of this covariate is negative and discernible. The third column shows the results when we use scaled distance to the due east border. We fit this model because average prevailing winds in the United States have a somewhat eastern tendency, and high‐altitude winds have a stronger eastern tendency. This result further supports our claim with a negative and discernible result. The fourth column, by contrast, uses scaled distance to the upwind border. Because most states have a concave shape, this model could contradict our finding if air polluters are being located toward the nearest border, upwind or downwind. This model's coefficient is positive and significant, which is what we would expect if polluting facilities within a state are less likely to be located upwind of residents. Similarly, the fifth column uses scaled distance to the due west border and yields the expected positive and significant coefficient. Using several measures, then, we consistently observe that major air polluters are located downwind relative to large‐quantity generators of hazardous waste.9"
"36","We also examine the extent to which our findings hold up with different subsets of the data in order to determine whether the findings are driven by particular types of major air polluters. Table 2 presents five specifications over various subsets of our data. Each model is specified just like our primary model above—with scaled downwind distance as the predictor of interest and a smoothed intercept term to capture the baseline relative risk of a major air polluter. In the first four models, all of our control group is used, and only a subset of the major air polluters is included. In the last model, we also have the ability to subset the control group, so we do so in order to present a within‐industry comparison.10"
"37","The first column of Table 2 presents the results when power plants are removed from the sample. Power plants have unique siting requirements, such as water access, so this model is presented to ensure that these are not driving the results, given that rivers often define borders. In this analysis, the observed effect of leeward distance remains just as strong as was found in our original analysis. Second, we estimate a model that only includes power plants as our case observations of major air polluters, still compared to our full group of controls. We still observe free riding, even though power plants are less locationally flexible than many kinds of sites due to the need to be proximate to electricity consumers, transmission infrastructure, and water sources.         "
"38","In the next two models presented in Table 2, we contrast publicly and privately owned air polluters. In the third column, the coefficient is not significant, indicating that there is not a discernible tendency among publicly owned air polluters to locate closer to downwind borders than control observations. Privately owned facilities, however, are analyzed in the fourth column and show a strong tendency for free riding. The process of siting public facilities differs substantially from the process employed by businesses, and public facilities may be less prone to respond to pressures that lead to environmental free riding due to these distinct processes. For example, many major air polluters that are publicly owned are hospitals, the location of which is driven by factors different from most industrial polluters.         "
"39","Finally, the fifth column of Table 2 presents the results of a model of manufacturing facilities. In this model, unlike the others, we have the option to subset both the case (air polluter) and control (large‐quantity generator) observations only to factories. Since factories' location is flexible relative to many other industries, locational free riding should be particularly feasible for this group. Further, by subsetting to 9,325 manufacturing facilities, we compare cases and controls that are especially similar in nature by virtue of being in similar industries. As expected, this analysis reveals that the probability that a factory is a major air polluter decreases the farther it is from the leeward border. Collectively, these robustness checks suggest that environmental free riding is prevalent across most facility types.         "
"40","We expect increased locational free riding when the major air polluter in question releases more harmful emissions into the air. We examine this possibility in terms of toxic releases. Toxic emissions are likely to have adverse health consequences for those downwind of the pollution, so there is extra incentive to see that state residents are upwind of such sites. Therefore, we would expect that the coefficient on distance from leeward border would exhibit a stronger negative effect when studying toxic major air polluters."
"41","To assess this, we use data from the EPA's 2010 Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). The TRI program requires facilities in several industrial sectors to report their emissions of toxic substances if they are beyond a minimum threshold. Thirty percent of major air polluters (or 13% of our total sample) reported their TRI emissions in 2010.11 We used these data to subset our air polluter data into three groups: air polluters that released below reporting threshold levels of toxics into the air (including none whatsoever), polluters with toxic releases below the median level for reporting polluters, and air polluters that were above the median level for reporting polluters. For the sake of comparison, we also bundled all toxic polluters into one group (regardless of whether they were above or below the median) and contrasted these groups to the results from the full data. With the subsetted data, we reestimated the model of Equation 1. Each model included all of the hazardous waste generators as controls.            "
"42","Figure 2 presents a forest plot of the coefficient for standardized distance to leeward border from each of five models. The horizontal axis presents possible values of the coefficient. The vertical axis lists the subset of the data, moving from the set with the lowest theoretical incentive for free riding at the bottom of the axis to the highest theoretical incentive at the top of the axis. The points represent the estimate of the coefficient, and the lines represent the 90% two‐tailed confidence intervals for the estimate. As the figure shows, all coefficients are significantly less than zero (at the one‐tailed 95% level). We also see that the point estimates generally become more negative as facilities emit more air toxics, a finding broadly consistent with our hypothesis. While we would expect a slightly stronger effect for low‐level emitters than non‐emitters, both groups show weaker results than the model using the full data.12 Therefore, it appears that the threat that air toxics pose to a state's citizens shapes the degree to which we observe free‐riding behavior.            "
"43","Coefficient Estimates and 90% Confidence Intervals for the Effect of Distance from the Leeward State Border on Relative Risk for a Major Air Polluter"
"44","Note: Coefficients are presented for subsets of major air polluter data based on level of toxic emissions. Confidence intervals correspond to one‐tailed hypothesis tests at the 95% confidence level.                        "
"45","The results reported so far do not speak directly to the specific tools that state governments use to influence industrial locations or to the process of firm decision making that leads to this outcome. This issue has long plagued researchers because the decision making in question is either unobserved or unavailable (Revesz 2008). It is particularly challenging in our case because we examine tens of thousands of siting decisions made over many decades.         "
"46","Although facility‐level analysis is not possible, we can gain some leverage on the underlying process by investigating a set of state‐level characteristics that theoretically should influence the degree of free riding. Specifically, we conducted another analysis using data to characterize (1) states that may be more willing to reduce pollution control obligations, (2) states that more aggressively pursue industrial (re)location through economic development policy, and (3) states where NIMBY political dynamics may push firms to locate polluting installations in places where harms will more likely affect out‐of‐state residents. We measure environmental policy stringency using a common index that rates states on 67 indicators of policy effort (Hall and Kerr 1991). We capture state efforts to attract industry with a measure of locational development policy, which is based on a content analysis of over 1,000 state‐level programs (Saiz and Clarke 2013). Finally, we measure the density of environmental interests with Gray and Lowery's (2001) lobby registration data.         "
"47","We fit a model in which we interact these three features with the measure of scaled distance to the leeward border. Figure 3 presents a forest plot of the effect of distance to the downwind border conditional on the values of three moderator variables. The horizontal axis of this figure shows possible coefficient values. The vertical axis presents different values of the interactive variables of environmental interest group density, emphasis on locational development, and the Green Index. For each variable, the effect is shown when that variable is at its maximum, at its mean, and at its minimum. The other two variables are held at their mean in each case. Each point represents the conditional estimate of the coefficient for distance to downwind border, and the line represents the 90% confidence interval of the estimate, serving to conduct a one‐tailed test for a negative effect at the 95% level.

"48","Conditional Coefficient Estimates for the Effect of Distance from the Leeward Border on Relative Risk for a Major Air Polluter"
"49","Note: The figure displays the results of altering the values of the interactive variables of interest group density, locational development, and Green Index. Lines represent 90% confidence intervals, which correspond to a one‐tailed hypothesis test at the 95% confidence level.                     "
"50","Figure 3's bottom three lines show how the effect varies based on the degree of a state's environmental commitment. We posit that states that are less willing to impose pollution control costs on industrial polluters will exhibit more of a tendency to have major air polluters located closer to downwind states. In the figure, the line marking high Green Index presents the coefficient for states at the maximum level of environmental policy. This coefficient shows no discernible effect, which would suggest that free riding is not prevalent in the “greenest” states. The next line shows the effect for states at the mean level of environmental policy, and we now see a negative and significant effect. Lastly, the line marked low Green Index represents states at the minimum level of environmental protection, and we see that these states show the strongest evidence of free riding with a more substantial negative effect.         "
"51","Figure 3 also shows that free riding is stronger in states that pursue locational economic development strategies. This is consistent with the argument that states use development incentives to induce free riding. The line marking high locational development shows a strong negative coefficient for states at the maximum level of locational development policy. In these states, the probability of a site hosting an air polluter decreases precipitously as the distance to the downwind border increases. The effect is still negative and significant at the mean level of locational development, but there is no evidence of free riding at the minimum level of locational development. All of this indicates that the more emphasis states put on locational economic development, the stronger the evidence of free riding.         "
"52","Finally, consider the density of environmental interest groups. Free riding is strong in states with a high density of environmental organized interests, and we can see the strongest negative coefficient is on the first line where we consider a state that has the maximum number of interest groups. These groups can organize and petition policy makers and businesses with NIMBY concerns, which can heighten the attention given to whether an air polluter is located upwind of state residents. For a state with the mean number of interest groups, the effect is still negative and significant, but not as strong. For the minimum number of interest groups, the coefficient is indiscernible, suggesting no evidence of free riding."
"53","Overall, this supplementary analysis provides evidence consistent with each explanation. This suggests that the general tendency for air polluters to be disproportionately located more proximate to downwind neighbors is related to state policy choices (environmental and otherwise) and firms rationally responding to the incentives created by NIMBY dynamics."
"54","Our results show that major air polluters are more likely to be located near a state's downwind border than hazardous solid waste polluters. This result is robust: Under many different measurement strategies and model specifications, our analyses indicate that distance from a downwind border reduces the probability that a geographic site hosts a major air polluter. This effect is especially pronounced for facilities with greater toxic air emissions. Collectively, these results suggest that air‐polluting facilities are strategically located in places that export the environmental and health consequences of pollution to other states' residents."
"55","To arrive at these conclusions, we employed a method that is novel to political science—a spatial point pattern analysis that models where events occur in geographic space. We believe that scholars will find this method useful in other applications. For example, an application in the conflict literature might focus on locations of battle skirmishes. In elections research, the location of campaign events for presidential candidates presumably would depend on how pivotal particular counties would be to the election as well as access to major media markets. Further work on environmental policy might examine water pollution: States and firms presumably would prefer to avoid polluting their own residents' drinking water. More analysis could also be pursued on air pollution spillovers, using different political geographies, such as international borders or zoning laws within large metropolitan areas, to evaluate whether pollution sources are located in a pattern consistent with environmental free riding. Point pattern analysis thus has a variety of potential applications in political science."
"56","In our findings here, we offer a resolution to a paradox in the literature: Why is there little to no evidence that state regulators are less stringent on downwind air polluters, yet pollution tends to be elevated in downwind counties? The answer that our analysis suggests is that free‐riding incentives shape strategic actors' behavior earlier in the process. States may use regulatory or economic development policy incentives to induce air‐polluting firms to locate near downwind borders. Moreover, forward‐looking companies themselves, when choosing a site, may realize that upwind sites are more likely to generate effective local political opposition. The political dynamics of industrial site selection may be enough to produce the pattern of locational choices that we observe even in the absence of state government inducements."
"57","While our data do not allow us to examine these processes directly, our analyses provide suggestive evidence that each of them may be at work. States with stronger environmental programs evidence a lower propensity to free ride, suggesting that these states may be less willing to use environmental regulation (e.g., differential permitting or enforcement) to encourage polluters to locate near downwind borders. States that make greater use of locational economic development incentives to encourage industry to relocate to their state are significantly more likely to evidence free‐riding behavior, suggesting that these incentives may similarly be used to push air polluters to downwind sites. Finally, our results also indicate that states in which there is a greater number of environmental interest groups also evidence greater environmental free riding in industrial location, which fits the hypothesis that industry is more likely to choose locations that export pollution to nonresidents in cases where there is a higher likelihood of effective organized opposition among state residents. We stress that our results cannot establish the microfoundations of the facility‐siting process; further research is necessary to investigate this process in more detail."
"58","These results pose a profound challenge to policy makers in federal systems. The phenomenon of environmental free riding observed here suggests that the challenge of managing pollution externalities may be even greater than many observers have suggested. Traditionally, greater centralization of environmental policy authority is advocated as a solution for the problem of subnational free riding. Our findings support this contention; the supporting information reports an additional analysis of power plants sited before and after the Clean Air Act of 1970.13 We find evidence that the increased federal role since the passage of the law may have mitigated locational free riding, at least with respect to power plants.         "
"59","To the extent that locational free riding is the result of state environmental regulatory choices, therefore, policy centralization may mitigate the problem, but it is likely to take a long time. Although regulatory effort at existing facilities may in principle be altered quickly, polluting facilities tend to remain in place for decades, making managing locational free riding a rather intransigent, long‐term problem. Additionally, states have other, nonregulatory tools at their disposal to encourage polluting firms to locate in particular places. Thus, if a state finds it can no longer successfully employ environmental policy for these purposes, it may switch to other types of incentives to accomplish the same objectives. Moreover, locational free riding as a result of decentralized firm decision making is an even more difficult process for policy makers to successfully address."
"60","Yet the pattern of polluter location varies systematically across states and time in ways that suggest it is responsive to state and national public policy. This suggests that it is possible to counteract the processes that lead to locational free riding with the right mix of national‐level environmental controls and incentive systems directed at subnational governments and firm decision makers. Future research into these processes may thus lead to policy changes that mitigate the adverse environmental consequences of free‐riding behavior."
