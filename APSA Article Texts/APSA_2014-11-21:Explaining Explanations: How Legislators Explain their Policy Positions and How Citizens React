"1","Explanation of Washington activities is one of the three components of a legislator's “home style” identified by Fenno (1978). The other two components, presentation of self and allocation decisions, have received significantly more scholarly attention (e.g., Adler 2000; Adler, Gent, and Overmeyer 1998; Evans 1982, 2004; Fiorina and Rohde 1991; Grimmer 2012; Grimmer, Messing, and Westwood 2012; Grose 2011; Lipinski 2004; Parker and Goodman 2009; Sinclair 1990). The lack of systematic study of explanations is surprising. Interview‐based studies of legislators’ voting decisions emphasize how legislators actively anticipate the possibility that they will need to explain a vote in the future. This process can lead legislators to abandon a policy position they personally prefer if it is difficult to explain to a subset of constituents (Kingdon 1989, 47). It also has effects that echo through the entire legislative process, placing a premium on designing policies and procedural strategies in ways that afford explanatory opportunities to potential supporters (Arnold 1990; Kingdon 1989, 51–54; but see Bianco 1994), in addition to attempts to hurt the minority party brand (Woon and Pope 2008).         "
"2","Explaining also plays a theoretically important role in representative democracy. Fenno argues that “[the] explanatory process helps link Congress and the citizenry…Explanation involves legitimation, whereby the acts of representatives are accepted as authoritative by those they represent” (1978, 169). Others have expanded upon this view, arguing that deliberative communication “substantially shapes perceptions of authority” (Karpowitz, Mendelberg, and Shaker 2012, 545), particularly when deliberation is from a representative to a citizen (Mansbridge 2003; Pitkin 1967). Yet basic questions remain about how legislators explain their votes, how the electorate interprets these explanations, and how the interaction influences the functioning of our democracy.         "
"3","One unresolved question is the extent to which legislators vary the policy positions embedded in their explanations depending on the views of an audience. Mayhew (1974, 63) writes that            "
"4","“Outside the roll call process the congressman is usually able to tailor his position to suit his audiences…Division or uncertainty in the constituency calls for waffling…On a controversial issue a Capitol Hill office normally prepares two form letters to send out to constituent letter writers—one for the pros and one…for the antis.”"
"5","“I had expected to find members of Congress explaining their Washington activity differently to their various constituencies…But I have found little trace of such explanatory chameleons in my travels…[Legislators] give the same explanations for their Washington activity before people who disagree with them as they give before people who agree with them—before non‐supporters as well as supporters….”"
"6","We argue that explanations are messages used to serve legislators’ electoral goals, and that the two perspectives of Mayhew and Fenno are not as far apart as they initially appear. Missing from past accounts is how legislators use explanations strategically. Because legislator explanations allow for an elaboration of multiple policy actions, legislators can maintain consistency in reporting on how they voted on a particular roll call to both supporters and opponents of their positions. Yet at the same time they can tailor their explanations so as to further strengthen electoral support among constituents who are policy congruent and blunt electoral blowback from those that are not."
"7","Explanations not only allow legislators to state how they voted on a key policy issue, but also provide reinforcing or compensating information to constituents. This tailoring is common in modern campaigns (Hillygus and Shields 2009) and we argue that it also occurs in legislator explanations well after the election is over. For instance, congressional rules allow for “amendments that are popular with ordinary voters but that…have no chance of becoming part of the final law” (Bawn et al. 2012), and legislators can point to these popular amendments in tailoring explanations to constituents. When queried by a constituent regarding a particularly controversial policy, the legislator can admit to voting against a constituent's preferred position on one roll call but use other votes, amendments, requests to bureaucracies, and policy actions to compensate for the wayward vote. Even if a legislator voted in congruence with the constituent's position, the legislator can still use an explanation to point to additional, reinforcing areas of constituent agreement.            "
"8","Moreover, the increasing “disconnect” between the polarized views of legislators and the moderate views of constituents (Fiorina and Abrams 2011; Hetherington 2009) may increase the pressure to offer tailored explanations of roll calls. In the past, when legislators had more centrist voting records, they may have had greater freedom to represent these records in an untailored manner without alienating middle‐of‐the‐road voters. As legislators’ voting records have become more extreme and partisan, the range of votes that could become electoral liabilities with pivotal members of the electorate has grown and thus the electoral necessity to point to tailored policy positions may have increased.            "
"9","In sum, our strategic explanation hypothesis suggests that explanations are used by legislators to enhance citizen opinion of the legislators and their policy positions, thereby enhancing legislators’ electoral prospects. For those constituents in which the legislator voted in favor of the citizen's preferred policy choice, the legislator should trumpet that position and reinforce this congruent policy position by pointing to similar policy actions. When voting against the constituent's wishes, the legislator should target the explanation toward the opposing constituent by providing additional compensating policy positions where the legislator agrees with the constituent. This hypothesis implies that legislators can simultaneously acknowledge how they voted on a particular roll call, though also create tailored and targeted messages towards different constituency groups by pointing to other policy actions in the same issue area.2"
"10","An alternative hypothesis simply suggests that legislators will report back the same position to different constituents and therefore the explanation of policy actions by the legislator will not differ at all. Yet another hypothesis is that all communications will be tailored without regard for explanatory consistency, including concealing or dissembling about the key roll call of interest to disagreeing constituents."
"11","Because legislators strategically tailor their messages to achieve electoral goals, these explanations should influence mass opinion. One possible effect is that tailored explanations cause individuals to perceive greater issue congruence with legislators. Bawn et al. (2012, 585) contend that legislators point to popular votes to obscure unpopular votes so that “voters can't figure out what is going on” and consequently shift the citizen's perception of the legislator's true policy position. McGraw, Timpone, and Bruck (1993) argue that explanations can persuade voters to change their views. An explanation tailored toward a citizen's issue opinion may therefore lead the person to think the legislator is working in the individual's policy interests.            "
"12","If tailoring explanations via the inclusion of compensating and reinforcing policy positions increases perceived issue congruence with the senator, this may help at the ballot box. Mayhew (1974, 51) argues that legislators are rewarded for taking positions and not “achieving effects.” Furthermore, if tailoring is an effective strategy for legislators, we expect explanations that include additional, compensating policy positions should reduce clarity among citizens about the precise issue positions of legislators, thereby blunting electoral blowback.            "
"13","An alternative hypothesis would be that explanations have little effect on shifting opinion about legislator policy positions or citizens’ propensities to vote for the legislators. If explanations are not effective at achieving electoral goals, tailored legislator explanations should do no better than untailored explanations at increasing voter favorability toward or the likelihood of voting for legislators. Echoing this null expectation, Kingdon (1989) argued that legislators provide explanations because something must be said on specific policies when queried. The act of saying at least something is more important to the mass public than the policy content of what is said. Legislator explanations may thus simply be a form of responsive advertising where the legislator uses communications to enhance name recognition.            "
"14","To test the legislator behavior expectations, we conducted a within‐subjects field experiment using U.S. senators serving in the 110th Congress (2007–08) with the assistance of constituent confederates located throughout the country.         "
"15","In the experiment, each U.S. senator was subject to two treatments.3 On March 5, 2007, we sent half of the senators a letter on behalf of a constituent that was pro‐immigration reform and the other half of the senators a letter from a constituent that was anti‐immigration reform. Eight weeks later, on April 30, 2007, we sent another wave of letters. Senators to whom we had sent the anti‐immigration letter in March were sent the pro‐immigration letter, and the senators to whom we had sent the pro‐immigration letter in March were sent the anti‐immigration letter. The two treatments were counterbalanced in this way in an attempt to control for the impact of time.4 Because the pro‐ and anti‐immigration letters were similar in format, we staggered their arrival to avoid raising suspicion about their authenticity. We chose to initially contact and receive senators’ responses via postal mail instead of email as some congressional offices may be more likely to respond to postal mail.5"
"16","We crafted the letters to be as authentic as possible, purposely including common misspellings and grammatical errors. The language used in each letter was chosen in part to be similar to language used by citizens with opinions on immigration (e.g., use of “illegal immigrant” instead of “undocumented person”). Additionally, while the content of the message in the two letters was distinct, we wrote the letters to be approximately the same length, using the same phrasings where possible. The exact texts of the pro‐ and anti‐immigration letters, which were sent to all 100 senators, can be found in Online Appendix 1. The total number of senators analyzed is 97.6 Treatment letters were typewritten and printed on a laser printer, but addresses were handwritten on the envelopes.            "
"17","We recruited two constituent confederates (one for the pro‐immigration letter and one for the anti‐immigration letter) who were willing to receive the senator's response at their home addresses in most of the fifty states. These confederates had not previously sent mail to their U.S. senators. In states where we could not recruit confederates, we purchased mailboxes.7 Within each treatment group, the only differences in the letters were the names and addresses of the constituent. The task of identifying two unique addresses per state (i.e., 100 total confederates) was arduous but critical. Our study's significantly higher response rates (compared to response rates of state legislators to emails in other studies) may have been due to the legislators being contacted by actual home state constituents, the use of postal mail instead of email, and the high degree of professionalism of the U.S. Senate.            "
"18","When confederates received replies from senators, they mailed the senators’ responses to the researchers in self‐addressed stamped envelopes provided by the researchers (those sent to purchased mailboxes were automatically forwarded). We assiduously followed up with confederates whenever responses were not received, calling or emailing to ask if they had been received. After nine months, we sent a follow‐up to each senate office that had not yet responded to the initial query. This follow‐up was the same text as the initial letter that was sent.8"
"19","Our two letters from constituents yielded responses from a large majority of senators, as 86 of 97 senators wrote a letter responding to at least one of the treatments. Fifty‐six senators responded to both the anti‐ and pro‐immigration letters from constituents and their responses compose the 112 (56 × 2) within‐subject observations that are the focus of most of the analysis. Of the 56 pairs of letters, 20 (36%) were mostly substantively identical. Thus, a clear majority of senators (64%) who responded to both letters did so in a way that made message targeting possible, though a sizable minority did not target messages. We discuss potential selection issues later in the article."
"20","Immigration was chosen as the subject of the constituent letters as the issue was at the forefront of policy discussions by Washington elites and attentive publics during the time period in which the study was fielded. It is also one of the most important contemporary policy issues. In addition, members of both parties are cross‐pressured by constituents on both sides of the issue so it would not be unusual for senators to receive both pro‐ and anti‐immigration reform constituent letters."
"21","During the 110th Congress (2007–08), the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act and related measures were debated in the U.S. Senate. The bill did not come up for a direct vote on the floor due to a filibuster by senators opposed to the bill. On June 28, 2007, there was a cloture vote to end a filibuster of the bill. Sixty votes were needed to move the bill forward, but the cloture motion received only 46 votes, effectively killing the efforts at comprehensive immigration reform. The cloture vote was not party‐line, with about one‐third of senators voting opposite their party's majority. We used this roll call as the key vote on the immigration bill during the 110th Congress to identify whether each senator was “pro” or “anti” immigration reform, and reclassified the letters each senator received as coming from constituents who shared or opposed the senator's position on immigration.9 For ease of interpretation, we refer to senators who voted for cloture as taking the pro‐immigration position and those who voted against cloture as taking the anti‐immigration position.            "
"22","We analyze the cloture vote because in the Senate it is the critical roll call on most issues (Koger 2010; Krehbiel 1998). However, given that cloture failed and senators did not have the opportunity to vote on final passage, one might question whether our results would be different for non‐cloture votes. The answer is not clear. On the one hand, cloture is a confusing concept to ordinary citizens and it could allow legislators to more effectively obscure their positions. On the other hand, an additional final passage vote would haven given senators an additional opportunity to offer a complicated and tailored explanation, meaning that we might understate the degree and effectiveness of targeting that would have occurred had the issue proceeded past cloture.            "
"23","Within‐subjects designs are usually implemented when few subjects are available for study due to their statistical efficiency (Boniface 1995, 94). Given our maximum potential subject pool of only 100 U.S. senators, this design was optimal.10 An important strength of the design is that all possible confounding factors related to each individual subject are controlled for. In our case, factors specific to each senator (e.g., political party, intention to run for reelection) are constant across observations. Thus, any variation that exists between multiple positions taken by the same senator can be attributable only to some feature of the treatment that prompts the senator's position. We have effectively controlled for all potential omitted variables via the within‐subjects design.            "
"24","Since the treatment letters to the senators did not ask how they voted on immigration reform but instead laid out a clear position from the constituent in favor of or opposed to immigration reform, our letters provide an excellent test to determine whether senators are forthright with their constituents conditional upon the constituent's position. The first dependent variable, Mention of roll‐call position, is coded 1 if the senator mentioned how s/he voted on the cloture vote and 0 if s/he did not. One might anticipate that senators who cast the roll call favoring the immigration bill will be less likely to mention their roll‐call position to constituents who are anti‐immigration than to constituents who are pro‐immigration; and vice‐versa for senators who cast the roll call against cloture.            "
"25","The second and third dependent variables encode whether the senators offered examples of compensating or reinforcing policy actions. The second dependent variable, Mentions pro‐immigration actions, was coded 1 if the senator mentioned institutional action(s) that reduced restrictions on immigration or immigrants separate from the comprehensive immigration reform roll call (and coded 0 if not). These institutional actions include votes on amendments, amendments offered by the senator, other bills sponsored or co‐sponsored, or actions taken by executive branch officials in response to a legislator request. An example that would be coded 1 for this measure is one Northeastern Democratic senator's response to a pro‐immigration constituent: “That is why I introduced an amendment that enables parents of U.S. citizens to more easily unite with their families here in the United States by increasing the number of green cards.”            "
"26","The third dependent variable, Mentions anti‐immigration actions, was coded 1 if the senator mentioned institutional action(s) restrictive of immigration or immigrants and 0 if not. We coded the same types of institutional actions as for the Mentions of pro‐immigration actions variable. An example of a senator's letter coded 1 for this measure was a Midwestern Democratic senator's response to an anti‐immigration constituent where he stated: “I was proud to vote for an amendment by Senator Graham that…would provide resources for greater border security. This amendment would provide $3 billion in emergency spending for operational control of the border.” The senator continued to detail that President Bush and the Department of Homeland Security were implementing this amendment. All three authors read and coded every letter in order to generate the dependent variables used in the analyses. We note that the mentioning of pro‐ and anti‐immigration actions does not violate explanatory consistency in a strict sense. Rather, these are means by which legislators can tailor their explanations in order to persuade constituents.            "
"27","If senators provide the same explanations to all constituencies, they will be equally likely to reveal how they voted on cloture to both pro‐immigration and anti‐immigration constituents. They also may not systematically manipulate the extent to which they mention additional pro‐immigration or anti‐immigration actions to compensate for or reinforce their positions on the key roll call. However, if our hypothesis is correct, then we should see evidence of tailoring to different constituent audiences."
"28","Because we observe comparable data from only 56 senators who responded to both letters, the data are censored. This selection does not compromise the internal validity of any estimates obtained from within‐subjects analyses of these 56 senators. Rather, there may be external validity concerns if senators strategically decided to respond to only the agreeing letter, or if their decision about whether to respond was correlated with a non‐strategic factor that might influence the content of their response."
"29","Three analyses suggest that this is not a concern. First, senators are not more likely to respond to constituents who agree with their positions. When the constituent expressed a similar position to the senator's roll call on immigration, 71.1% of letters received a response. 75.3% of letters sent from disagreeing constituents received responses, an insignificant difference (p = 0.58).11 This difference is identified entirely by senators who only responded to one letter and shows that senators were not disproportionately more likely to respond to either agreeing or disagreeing treatment letters. Second, we estimated multivariate models predicting responsiveness using a number of covariates to test for the possibility of strategic or non‐strategic selection.12 As shown in Online Appendix 2a and 2b, no observable variable significantly predicts response to constituents (and therefore whether a senator appears in our within‐subjects sample). Further, the overall fit statistics in these models are all statistically insignificant, suggesting there is no structural component to response. Third, in some analyses (presented below) we make the conservative assumption that all unobserved data are “zeroes.” In other words, if we do not receive a letter from a senator, we treat that senator as if he or she responded but did not take the opportunity to reveal a vote, or tailor his or her letter by mentioning other pro‐ or anti‐immigration policy actions. This approach treats letter non‐response as if it is one strategy that senators use to avoid revealing their votes or actions. The results are not demonstrably altered even when invoking this conservative assumption. Thus, it appears that an examination of the 56 senators in the within‐subjects design is appropriate given the minimal evidence that strategic or non‐strategic selection is biasing our findings. Lastly, we note that our stimulus is very realistic; thus, the responses we received are what the constituents themselves would actually observe.            "
"30","As shown in the first column of Table 1, there was no difference across treatment conditions in whether the senator mentioned how she voted on key immigration roll calls in the sample of senators responding to both constituent letters (53.6% versus 51.8%, p = 0.99). In the two rightmost columns, we present results including senators who did not respond to both letters, coding non‐response as not mentioning the roll‐ call vote. Although the point estimates are somewhat larger under this conservative assumption (with senators more likely to mention their votes to constituents who agree with them), the differences fall far below conventional levels of statistical significance. Thus, there is at most, minimal evidence of tailoring at this level. This is somewhat surprising given the conventional wisdom that “avoiding issue discussion in the district is typically an easy task for representatives, since they control most of the communication” (Larson 1990). Legislators did not try to hide their cloture votes, and actively revealed them in equal amounts to constituent supporters and opponents.            "
"31","Supporting our argument, senators appear to have strategically changed whether they mentioned pro‐immigration or anti‐immigration actions in their explanations depending on the constituent's position (see Table 2). When receiving a pro‐immigration letter from a constituent, 23.2% of letters mentioned reinforcing or compensating pro‐immigration actions (see second column of results in Table 2). This was nearly double the 12.5% of letters that mentioned pro‐immigration actions in response to anti‐immigration letters (p = 0.07). We found a symmetric pattern when examining anti‐immigration actions mentioned by senators. Pro‐immigration letters from constituents resulted in 42.9% of letters mentioning anti‐immigration actions, significantly lower than the 55.4% of letters that mentioned such actions in response to anti‐immigration constituents (p = 0.04).            "
"32","We can also estimate the difference‐in‐difference: whether the difference in letters mentioning pro‐ or anti‐immigration actions varied by constituent position. As shown in the final column of Table 2, the difference‐in‐difference estimate is a substantively large 23.2 percentage points (p < 0.01). Anti‐immigration constituent positions received letters that were 42.9 percentage points more likely to mention anti‐immigration actions than pro‐immigration actions; this difference was only 19.7 percentage points in response to pro‐immigration constituent positions (see rightmost column, Table 2). When including the senators who only responded to one letter, we also obtain a statistically significant difference‐in‐difference estimate (17.5 percentage points, p = 0.02; see Online Appendix 2c). Table 2 also reveals a higher observational propensity for senators to include anti‐immigration actions over pro‐immigration actions. This is likely due to the opinion climate at the time of the study, which was significantly more anti‐immigration at the national level and in most of the 50 states.13"
"33","In addition to the results in Tables 1 and 2, in Online Appendix 3 we also considered whether our results might differ due to the timing of the key cloture vote. In addition to the 2007 vote that killed the immigration bill, there were earlier votes (e.g., a cloture vote in 2006) that also revealed senators’ policy preferences on immigration. We also present results measuring senator agreement and disagreement with these additional immigration votes (see Online Appendix 3). These results are consistent with those presented in Tables 1 and 2.14 For instance, when we use the 2006 immigration vote to identify senator‐constituent agreement, 55.3% of senators mentioned how they voted on cloture to agreeing constituents and 57.5% of senators mentioned the roll call to disagreeing constituents. These results are similar to the finding of no difference between agreeing and disagreeing senators when using the 2007 vote reported in Table 1.            "
"34","In Online Appendices 4 and 5, we also estimate the results from Tables 1 and 2 conditional on senator characteristics such as party. For instance, consistent with the results in Table 1, among Democratic senators, there was no difference in the frequency of mentioning the cloture vote to constituents who agreed and to constituents who disagreed (47.1% mentioned to agreeing constituents, and 47.1% mentioned to disagreeing constituents; see Appendix 4). Also consistent with Table 1, there was only a small, statistically insignificant difference in the frequency of mentions within agreeing Republican senators (63.6%) and disagreeing Republican senators (59.1%; see Appendix 4).            "
"35","When examining senators engaging in compensating behavior, conditional on political party, we uncover some interesting results (see Appendix 5). Among Democratic senators, only 35.3% mentioned an anti‐immigration action to a pro‐immigration constituent while 52.9% mentioned an anti‐immigration action to an anti‐immigration constituent (a 17.6 percentage point difference, consistent with the overall results in Table 2). Among Republican senators, however, the gap in anti‐immigration mentions between pro‐ and anti‐immigration constituent letters was much smaller (a 4.5 percentage‐point difference). When examining whether senators mentioned pro‐immigration actions, the result is nearly a mirror image of the anti‐immigration actions. Republican senators mentioned pro‐immigration actions in 22.7% of responses to pro‐immigration constituents yet in only 4.6% of responses to anti‐immigration constituents (an 18.1 percentage‐point difference). Conversely, Democratic senators exhibited only a 5.8 percentage‐point gap in pro‐immigration mentions to pro‐ and anti‐immigration constituents. These conditional party results suggest that the evidence presented in Table 2 that senators took compensating positions is due in part to the reputation regarding which political party owns the pro‐ and anti‐ sides of the issue of immigration. While there were supporters and opponents of the bill in both parties, more Democrats supported immigration reform and more Republicans opposed it. Thus, the actions highlighted in the letters may reflect an effort by senators to compensate for party reputations with Democratic senators doing their best to combat party‐brand‐based skepticism among anti‐immigration constituents, and Republicans doing likewise among those in favor of immigration reform.            "
"36","Thus, in Experiment 1, we observed little difference in whether senators mentioned their positions on the key 2007 roll call conditional on constituent positions. This supports a view that legislators are willing to give similar explanations to different constituent groups. Even though constituents did not ask senators how they voted, senators were equally likely to discuss how they voted on cloture to agreeing and disagreeing constituents. However, per our strategic explanation hypothesis, senators appear to explain their positions in ways that allow more latitude (as captured by the final two dependent variables). In short, senators make a point of mentioning Washington actions that accord with the views expressed by the constituent with whom they are corresponding, and by failing to mention actions that do not. When senators are in agreement with a constituent, this type of letter has the effect of reinforcing that agreement. When they find themselves in disagreement, it has the effect of compensating for that disagreement."
"37","We showed in Experiment 1 that senators responding to constituent queries about immigration tend to selectively emphasize compensating and reinforcing actions they have taken in accord with the preferences of their constituent‐correspondents and de‐emphasize actions that are not. This suggests that legislators engage in this behavior to curry favor with voters on both sides of an issue. However, in Experiment 1, we also found that legislators do not tailor or hide their positions on key roll calls. Thus, any tailoring of explanations is second order, focusing on additional compensating or reinforcing legislator actions. Given that the tailoring is subtle, is this method effective at shaping mass perceptions of legislators’ policy positions? If our argument that legislators engage in tailored explanations for electoral reasons is correct, tailored explanations should affect citizen attitudes about perceived issue agreement and electoral support."
"38","To determine whether tailored legislator explanations influence mass opinion, we conducted a between‐subjects survey experiment to see how ordinary people responded to these types of tailored messages.15 To enhance external validity, we used a selection of the actual letters received in Experiment 1 as stimuli. As described below, for both senators who took pro‐ and anti‐immigration positions we identified two types of exemplary letters: (1) those that selectively tailored the mention of actions depending on whether they accord with the views of a constituent‐correspondent; and (2) those that use the same language across letters regardless of the views of a constituent correspondent. By comparing how respondents evaluate senators who sent targeted messages to the senators who sent untargeted messages, we can assess whether targeting is an effective strategy to enhance opinions of legislators and legislators’ policy positions. The basic structure of the experiment was as follows: (1) we first measured pre‐treatment attitudes on immigration policy; (2) we next presented respondents one randomly assigned letter written by an anonymous senator in our first experiment (edited by the researchers for comparability); and (3) we then asked participants a series of post‐treatment questions about the senator that represent our outcome measures, which capture the theoretical concepts of interest (electoral support for the senator and perceptions of the senator's positions). Question wordings can be found in Online Appendix 6.            "
"39","We collected data from 1,195 U.S. adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk).16 Subjects were paid $2.00 to complete the survey. The experiment required respondents to carefully read and respond to questions about a somewhat‐lengthy letter. Accordingly, we chose not to run the study on a traditional Internet panel because the cost would have been prohibitive given the extent of text to be read by respondents. Further, discussions with analysts at survey research firms revealed that panelists are not used to reading stimuli as detailed as ours in the context of a questionnaire. One environment conducive to running the study would be a traditional experimental laboratory on a college campus, as respondents can be monitored so that they focus closely on the task. In order to obtain a more diverse and national sample that could devote a sufficient amount of time and attention to reading a senator's letter, we used MTurk. Unlike traditional Internet panelists, MTurk respondents are “workers” who are accustomed to completing lengthy tasks in exchange for payment, making them an ideal sample on which to run the experiment. Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz (2012) show that researchers can effectively use MTurk to obtain more diverse samples compared to most laboratory studies, and that MTurk subjects are not widely out of line on several variables compared to interviews conducted by the American National Election Studies (ANES). We compare demographic and political characteristics of our sample to the unweighted 2008 ANES in Online Appendix 7 and we find they are substantively similar on many variables.            "
"40","We timed how long each respondent read the letters. Respondents spent an average of 2 minutes and 34 seconds reading the letters from senators displayed before post‐treatment questions were asked.17 In addition, respondents could refer back to the letters during all post‐treatment survey questions. The careful attention suggested by the mean reading time is due to the fact that MTurk is a task‐oriented platform.            "
"41","The aim of our second experiment is to assess how ordinary people broadly respond to explanations from elected officials. Hence, we are interested in the more cognitive question of how people generally react to legislator tailoring or consistency, and not how specific constituents react to specific senators. A different question would be to explore how individuals within their senators’ constituencies respond to individual senators’ letters. We leave that question to future researchers who can utilize our sample of letters as stimuli for experimentation. Further, as explained below, we did not adopt the traditional experimental approach of keeping most of the stimuli text exactly the same and changing a small amount of text across conditions. Accordingly, this limits our ability to pinpoint the specific language that causes the differences across conditions. However, that is not what is substantively important as we are interested in testing the effect of tailored messages mentioning compensating or reinforcing policy positions. All experiments require a tradeoff between internal and external validity, and we chose to maximize external validity by using language from real letters. Importantly, though, as we describe below, we chose and edited the letters to be comparable on dimensions not related to tailoring."
"42","We first measured respondents’ views on immigration legislation by asking them the following: “A comprehensive immigration reform proposal that would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants was recently considered by the United States Senate. Do you support or oppose this proposal?” (response options: “strongly support,” “somewhat support,” “somewhat oppose,” “strongly oppose”). We bifurcated responses into those expressing support and opposition to tie them to the senator's dichotomous position on the legislation (see Online Appendix 8 for analyses considering respondent extremity)."
"43","From the set of letters we received in Experiment 1, we selected prototypical letters of six types, representing the six treatment conditions to which respondents were randomly assigned. Two letters were from Senator A, a pro‐immigration senator who sent a tailored letter to a pro‐immigration constituent (Treatment Group 1) and a different, tailored letter to an anti‐immigration constituent (Treatment Group 2). Tailored letters like these are typical of what we found broadly from senators (see Table 2), in that they mentioned actions that would appeal to the policy preferences of each constituent. In Experiment 1, 26.8% of senators were like Senator A in that they were pro‐immigration and sent two different tailored letters. We chose to use two tailored letters from the same senator for these first two treatments to control for idiosyncratic components of the treatment letters that may have occurred had we chosen two prototypical, tailored letters from different senators. The third letter (Treatment Group 3) was from Senator B, a pro‐immigration senator who sent the same, untailored letter to both the pro‐immigration and anti‐immigration constituents in Experiment 1. In Experiment 1, 17.9% of senators were like Senator B. Even though an untailored message was less common in Experiment 1, we use a completely untailored pro‐immigration message as a contrast baseline case (Treatment 3) to determine whether a tailored message from a pro‐immigration senator (Treatments 1 and 2) is effective at influencing opinion.            "
"44","The remaining three conditions were parallel to the first three, except that the senator writing each letter voted against the comprehensive immigration reform bill. Two letters were from Senator C, an anti‐immigration senator who sent different, tailored letters to an anti‐immigration constituent (Treatment Group 4) and a pro‐immigration constituent (Treatment Group 5). Again, two letters were chosen from the same senator, Senator C, in order to control for idiosyncratic aspects of writing that may have varied had we chosen two different legislators. In Experiment 1, 33.9% of senators were similar to Senator C. The sixth and final letter was from Senator D, an anti‐immigration senator who sent the same, untailored letter to both the pro‐ and anti‐immigration constituents (Treatment Group 6). About one‐fifth (21.4%) of senators were similar to Senator D in Experiment 1. The experimental design and sample sizes are summarized in Table 3.            "
"45","We selected letters that varied little across other dimensions. Where this was not possible, we edited the letters to make them similar and comparable so that each letter: (1) had similar length and readability (as measured by the Flesch‐Kincaid level), (2) had only four short paragraphs, (3) stated how the legislator voted on cloture, and (4) mentioned the cloture vote in or near the second paragraph."
"46","We emphasize that in all six treatment letters, the senators stated how they voted on the cloture vote that killed the immigration reform bill. This mimics the predominant pattern we observed in the first experiment. It also means that the survey experiment represents a “hard test” for the effectiveness of explanations to persuade citizens since the senators’ discussions of compensating actions would have to overcome their explicitly stated cloture roll‐call votes. Additionally, respondents had been primed to seek the information about the roll‐call vote in the letter due to the measurement of the pre‐treatment attitude."
"47","Texts of the treatment letters are presented in Online Appendix 9a; the letters as they appeared to survey respondents are presented in Online Appendix 9b. We enhanced the realism and authenticity of the letters as much as possible by keeping them on Senate letterhead. We also rendered them anonymous by redacting key identifying information about each senator. With respect to both reality and perception, individuals were responding to actual correspondence written by U.S. senators and were told the letters were from senators. The letters remained visible on the computer screen to the respondents above all post‐treatment survey questions."
"48","We also randomized whether respondents were told that the senator was a “Republican” or a “Democrat.” We did this to provide additional information to respondents so they would not try to infer the partisanship of the senator. Results were fairly consistent across conditions so we pool them. We present full results by senator partisanship in Online Appendix 10."
"49","Using each respondent's stated position on immigration that was measured pre‐treatment, we collapse the six treatment conditions into three variables: (1) an indicator for a letter targeted toward the survey respondent (e.g., a pro‐immigration senator's letter addressed to a pro‐immigration constituent if the respondent is pro‐immigration); (2) an indicator for a letter targeted away from the survey respondent (e.g., a pro‐immigration senator's letter addressed to a pro‐immigration constituent if the respondent is anti‐immigration); and (3) an indicator representing an untargeted letter. In Online Appendix 11, we present results separately for pro‐immigration and anti‐immigration senators.            "
"50","The dependent variables measure respondent opinion in three areas that coincide with our hypothesis about citizen response to explanations: (1) perceptions of the senator's issue position, (2) favorability toward and electoral support for the senator, and (3) accuracy and certainty of perceptions of the senator's position.18 We expect that tailored explanations should make people perceive that the senator shares their positions on immigration, foster more positive evaluations of the senator, make people more likely to vote for the senator, and have less accurate and less certain opinions about the senator's true position. These outcome measures are based on standard ANES survey questions designed to capture overall voter assessments as well as the policy‐based inputs to those assessments. The full text and response options of the survey items are presented in Online Appendix 6.            "
"51","Respondents were asked if they agreed with the senator's position on the immigration issue, a dependent variable we call Reported agreement (measured on a four‐point scale where 4 represents “strongly agree”).19"
"52","We asked respondents to rate the senator on a 100‐point feeling thermometer. We also measured the respondent's Vote Intention (5‐point scale where higher values indicated greater likelihood of voting for the senator).               "
"53","The dependent variable Perceived Roll‐Call Accuracy coded whether the respondent correctly perceived the senator's roll call based on the senator's cloture vote reported in the letter. We created a similar variable, Perceived Immigration Position Accuracy, indicating whether the respondent accurately perceived the senator's immigration position. A naïve assumption for these variables is that most respondents would accurately judge the senator's positions as all six treatment letters noted the senator's cloture vote. Respondents also reported their Certainty in the senator's position (5‐point scale; higher values indicates more certainty). Finally, respondents reported their Perceived Ideology of the senator on a 7‐point scale (higher values indicate conservatism).               "
"54","To estimate an overall average treatment effect, we apply post‐stratification weights based on the distribution of pre‐treatment immigration attitudes in the sample (Miratrix, Sekhon, and Yu 2013). We employ this post‐stratification weighting procedure to improve the efficiency of our estimator by adjusting for random differences in the distribution of pre‐treatment opinion across experimental conditions. Moreover, this procedure also allows us to combine the reaction to two letters into a single estimate that reflects our quantity of interest. For example, when we examine how people respond to letters targeted towards them from senators with whom they disagree, we combine the reactions of pro‐immigration respondents evaluating an anti‐immigration senator who wrote a compensating letter with anti‐immigration respondents evaluating a pro‐immigration senator who wrote a compensating letter. Thus, the response to each “type” of letter that we present is actually the response to two distinct letters from respondents with opposed pre‐treatment attitudes, weighted to reflect the prevalence of the overall immigration attitudes in the total sample. The tables and figures below present the mean estimates of the dependent variables (and 95% confidence intervals) for these collapsed treatment conditions. Additional information regarding methods of analysis for the second experiment, including the statistical model, is presented in Online Appendix 13. We estimate OLS regressions.20"
"55","Table 4 presents the results regarding respondents’ perceptions of senator issue positions and senator favorability across the six treatment conditions. Although there are numerous treatment conditions we can compare against one another, we focus most of our discussion on two comparisons that are of theoretical interest. The first comparison gauges how much a senator who disagrees with a respondent can gain by writing an explanation targeted to the respondent rather than writing an untargeted explanation. To estimate this difference, we compare the “letter targeted toward voter” condition (among respondents who disagree with the senator's roll‐call vote) to the “letter not targeted” condition (among respondents who disagree with the senator's roll‐call vote). The second comparison gauges the extent to which a targeted message compensates for a wayward roll call. To estimate this difference, we compare the “letter targeted toward voter” condition (among respondents who disagree with the senator's roll‐call vote) to the “letter not targeted” condition (among respondents who agree with the senator's roll‐call vote).21 These two treatment comparisons are illustrated in Figure 1, in addition to being displayed along with the other treatment conditions in Table 4.            "
"56","Respondents’ Evaluations of Legislators: Differences across Selected Treatments"
"57","Note: Panel (a) plots the difference in disagreeing respondents’ evaluations of senators (normalized to lie between 0 and 1) when reading a targeted letter vs. an untargeted letter. Panel (b) plots the difference in respondent evaluations of senators between a disagreeing respondent reading a targeted letter and an agreeing respondent reading an untargeted letter. 95% confidence bar illustrated.                        "
"58","We find strong evidence that when senators explain their votes by selectively mentioning certain additional actions, respondents change their perceptions of senators’ positions. Respondents who read untargeted explanations from senators who disagree with them report an average rating of 2.32 on the 4‐point Reported agreement measure, closest to “somewhat disagree” (Table 4, first column). In contrast, when they read explanations from disagreeing senators targeted towards the respondent, they offer an average rating of 2.94 to the senators, closest to “somewhat agree.” The increase in agreement due to targeting is 0.62 points. This difference is displayed in the leftmost column of Figure 1a. In the figures we rescale all dependent variables to lie between 0 and 1 to allow for comparability across different native scales. The 95% confidence bar in Figure 1a indicates that this difference is significant at the p < 0.05 level. Thus, our experiment strongly suggests that a senator who disagrees with a citizen can reduce the extent to which the citizen perceives the disagreement with a targeted explanation.            "
"59","Our experiment allows us to assess the extent to which a targeted explanation can compensate for a wayward roll call. This is the second key comparison. We compare a targeted explanation to a respondent who disagrees with an untargeted explanation to a respondent who agrees. As mentioned above, respondents reading a letter from a senator who disagrees but targets his letter toward the respondents rate the senator at an average of 2.94 on the 4‐point Reported agreement scale. The average level of reported agreement rises to 3.22 when respondents read an untargeted letter from a senator that actually agrees with them (second cell, second column, Table 4). The difference of 0.28 scale points is statistically significant. When mapped on to a 0 to 1 scale (see leftmost column in Figure 1b), this represents a shift of around 7 percentage points.            "
"60","We next turn to the overall electoral consequences of targeting explanations (last two columns of Table 4). First, consider generalized affect for the senators as measured by a 100‐point feeling thermometer. Compared to writing an untargeted letter, targeting the explanation toward the respondent's position improves the senator's favorability. In particular, a letter targeted to a respondent who disagrees with a senator increases the average feeling thermometer rating to 61.2 from 46.7 for an untargeted letter (second column in Table 4), a statistically significant (p < 0.01) and substantively meaningful difference of 15% of the scale (also see the middle column of Figure 1a, where the feeling thermometer is rescaled to range from 0 to 1). Note that targeting improves the feeling thermometer rating from lukewarm to positive. Moreover, it is interesting that the 61.2 rating is statistically indistinguishable from the 62.9 rating respondents give to a senator who actually agrees with them and wrote an untargeted letter expressing this agreement (third column of Table 4 and the middle column of Figure 1b). Thus, when it comes to overall affective judgments, targeted letters appear capable of fully compensating for policy disagreement.            "
"61","Targeting also increases the likelihood of the respondent voting for the senator (rightmost column, Table 4). A letter targeted to a respondent who disagrees increases the likelihood of voting for the senator to 3.00 (“somewhat likely to vote for the senator”) from 2.38 (closer to “not too likely”) for an untargeted letter. This difference represents a substantively meaningful shift of 0.62 points (p < 0.01), over 15% of the length of the five‐point scale (rightmost column of Figure 1a). Moreover, the mean 3.00 rating that respondents gave a senator who was out‐of‐step with their immigration views but targeted the letter is statistically indistinguishable from the 3.17 rating that respondents provided a senator who actually agreed with them and sent an untargeted letter (rightmost column of Figure 1b).            "
"62","Targeting also obscures respondents’ abilities to certainly and accurately assess the positions of senators on the immigration issue. In Table 5 we compare the “letter not targeted” condition and the “letter targeted toward voter” condition when the voter disagrees with the senator's roll call. Compared to an untargeted letter, a letter that is targeted to disagreeing respondents decreases correct identification of the senator's immigration position by 34.5 percentage points (p < 0.01; first column of Table 5). Considering that the senator explicitly mentioned her roll‐call vote in the letter, this result is quite astounding. By tailoring their explanations, senators can convince citizens that they actually took opposite positions from their roll‐call votes. Similarly, as shown in the second column of Table 5, correct perceptions of senators’ roll‐call votes decreased by 37.2 percentage points due to targeting (p < 0.01). When reading untargeted letters, citizens come close to perfectly knowing how the senator actually voted on the legislation (90.2% accuracy). However, targeting reduces citizen accuracy to a coin flip (53.0% accuracy). Finally, as shown in the third column of Table 5, targeting reduces reported certainty of the senator's position by 7.5 percentage points (p < 0.01).            "
"63","Finally, we examine the effect of explanation targeting on assessments of senators’ overall ideologies. In Table 6, we compare the condition in which the letter is targeted to a voter who disagrees with the senator, the condition in which the letter is not targeted, and the condition in which the letter is targeted to a voter who agrees. We find that a pro‐immigration senator who writes a letter targeted toward an anti‐immigration respondent (condition 1 in Table 6) is viewed as significantly more conservative than a pro‐immigration senator who writes an untargeted (condition 2 in Table 6) or reinforcing (condition 3 in Table 6) letter. We find a symmetric pattern for the anti‐immigration senator, with targeting causing respondents to see the senator as more liberal. For example, people who read a compensating letter from a pro‐immigration senator placed the senator, on average, at 4.40 on the 7‐point ideology scale (top cell, first column of Table 6), whereas people who read an untargeted letter from a senator with the same position placed the senator at 3.66 (second cell, second column of Table 6)—implying a 0.74‐point shift (p < 0.01). The analogous shift for an anti‐immigration senator is a larger 1.37 points (3.67 to 5.04, p < 0.01). Thus, targeting via explanation not only affected individuals’ views of the positions that senators held on immigration, but perceptions of the ideologies of the senators broadly.            "
"64","We conducted a field experiment using sitting U.S. senators as subjects to examine whether they tailor their responses to constituent inquiries about a policy issue to suit the views of the constituents making the inquiries. We found strong evidence that senators do, in fact, vary key elements of their descriptions of their Washington activities in this manner. However, we find no evidence that senators are explicitly deceptive. For example, senators are just as likely to mention the key vote they have taken on an issue independent of whether that vote is in accordance or discordance with the views of a constituent. Instead, senators employ a more subtle strategy when tailoring their explanations, which is to selectively provide information about secondary Washington actions that accord with views of the constituents with whom they are corresponding. Thus, without being openly dishonest, senators nevertheless convey different faces to different audiences."
"65","Scholars have long suspected that legislators engage in targeted messaging (Mayhew 1974) though the empirical evidence has been weak or non‐existent (Fenno 1978). We help resolve this uncertainty in the literature. We find that legislators display substantial consistency in revealing central elements of their voting records, and they only engage in tailoring at a secondary level. As a result, absent the power of our within‐subjects experimental design, identifying the targeting that does occur would be quite difficult. Of course, the sort of message shading we are able to identify might seem relatively unimportant if not for the findings of our second study, which provides strong evidence that the message targeting senators engage in is quite effective at currying electoral favor. We find that by selectively discussing Washington activities, senators can nearly erase the consequences of fundamental and openly acknowledged disagreements with constituents on roll calls.         "
"66","Our experiment focused on legislator explanations and citizen responses to constituent correspondence, but the implications of our study extend beyond this form of political communication. The particular mode of communication we examine allowed for a straightforward, within‐subjects experiment to identify message targeting by senators, but legislative communication occurs in a number of other venues where targeting is also feasible. In the contemporary period, media and communications are increasingly fragmented, making the tailoring of messages from legislators to constituents quite possible. Whether speaking in town meetings before different constituent groups, appearing on competing television networks reaching audiences with different partisan or ideological preferences, or microtargeting written communications or campaign advertisements to different groups of voters, legislators can deliver messages that are sensitive to the policy preferences of the audiences they are addressing. Our findings lead us to anticipate some level of targeting in each of these venues, though there may be interesting differences depending on context. One important consideration in more public venues (e.g., debates) is the possibility that targeted messages will reach those for whom they are not intended. One potential advantage of the subtle targeting strategy detected by our experiments is that it offers legislators protection against accusations that they are being openly dishonest or deceptive. And while more study is necessary, our findings suggest delivering a mis‐targeted message is not as damaging to a senator as one might anticipate. In our view, future work could profitably explore both the format of legislator explanations and the reception by constituents across a range of settings.         "
"67","The effectiveness of explanation targeting suggests a number of positive and normative theoretical conclusions. On the positive side, our findings relate to work on elite polarization and strategic ambiguity. Message tailoring and its effectiveness may help explain the persistent and growing “disconnect” between legislators’ voting records and the positions held by the voters in their districts (Fiorina and Abrams 2011). While our findings do not speak to how or why this representational mismatch has arisen, they do suggest that, with appropriate tailoring, legislators can reduce the electoral penalty they pay for being more extreme than the pivotal voters in their electorates. In effect, with targeting they are able to widen the “blind spot” of the electorate to allow themselves additional policy leeway (Bawn et al. 2012). Further, our study speaks to a longstanding theoretical account and more recent empirical work, which suggests that candidate ambiguity can be a politically valuable strategy (Tomz and Van Houweling 2009). The canonical treatment of the strategic use of ambiguity, however, assumes incumbent legislators will have difficulty beclouding their true positions on an issue, making the strategy of ambiguity available to challengers alone (Shepsle 1972). Our findings imply, however, that with targeted messaging incumbents can credibly shift constituents’ perceptions of their policy stances and the uncertainty surrounding those perceptions. Future work should examine how these effects influence not just perceptions about a single incumbent, but also how they affect the outcome of electoral contests.         "
"68","The fact that legislators accurately reveal their core positions to constituents with opposing views offers some normative comfort, but that comfort is tempered by the effectiveness of legislators’ more subtle messaging. Implicit in most normative theories of political representation is the importance of two‐way deliberation between constituents and elected officials (Disch 2011). When elected officials communicate effectively with constituents, democratic legitimacy is enhanced. However, such deliberation can become manipulation when communications from the representatives shift constituents’ perceptions in ways that are politically beneficial to the representatives. Mansbridge (2003, 519) distinguishes “manipulation” from “education” by noting that deception by elected officials is manipulation and education is “influence” over the voters’ preferences after receiving the elected official's explanation. She states that “the existing apparatus in the United States does not facilitate well the processes of mutual education, communication, and influence [of representatives and voters]” (519–520).         "
"69","On the one hand, the back and forth between constituents and legislators that we study does have the potential to educate constituents on basic facts about the legislators’ actions and the policy at hand (Fenno 1978). For example, despite the fact that constituents’ letters to legislators did not explicitly inquire about legislators’ roll‐call positions, the legislators did not deceive or hide their votes to disagreeing constituents but actively revealed them. Nevertheless, legislators’ statements about how they voted, accompanied by reinforcing and compensating information, shaped and changed public opinion about legislators and their policy positions in ways that seemed more manipulative than educational. Our experiments suggest that communications that might appear to be normatively desirable education by a legislator may, in practice, represent normatively undesirable manipulation of citizen opinion.
