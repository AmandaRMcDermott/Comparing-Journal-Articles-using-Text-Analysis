"1","Parliamentary parties are usually treated in theoretical work as both policy seekers and office seekers, and the policy horizon approach is consistent with much that is implied by this perspective. Under the approach, for instance, parties still prefer to minimize the costs associated with policy compromise, and they may covet cabinet portfolios as well; under certain circumstances they may even trade policy for offices. As noted earlier, however, the approach also anticipates that a party might refuse an opportunity to join a proposed government even though its refusal would result in policy outcomes diverging further from the party's preferences (and, of course, costing it office benefits as well). Such a decision fits poorly within the standard framework."
"2","Parties might make this choice, however, if they are concerned not just with which policy is implemented but also with who implements it. In particular, the choice might follow from an unwillingness on the part of party leaders to participate in governments whose intent is to implement policies that are too far away from the party's stated commitments. The notion of being “too far away” implies the existence of a threshold for each party delimiting the policies it considers acceptable as a basis for government participation, and this, in essence, is what the horizon hypothesis proposes. These thresholds should hold regardless of any office benefits that might be on offer (which means that policy can only be traded for offices up to but not beyond the threshold) and regardless of how it affects the subsequent evolution of the coalition formation process."
"3","The ways in which this line of reasoning differs from the standard policy‐seeking assumption underlying most coalition theories can be brought into sharper focus by placing both in a spatial voting framework. Policies in that framework are represented by points in a policy space of one or more dimensions; the greater the distance between points, the more dissimilar the policies they represent. The threshold effect can be captured by surrounding each party's ideal point (most preferred policy stance) with a boundary or “policy horizon” that circumscribes the set of policies acceptable to the party as a basis for government participation. Only policies within this horizon would meet the criterion of acceptability, although a party would prefer those that entail lower distance costs, other things being equal."
"4","This method of representing policy horizons brings to mind the indifference contours that are often used to join policy points of equal utility in spatial representations. This is especially the case when the contours are drawn through some status quo or reversionary point, since then they separate policies the party would prefer to that point from those it would not. Unlike this type of indifference contour, however, horizons are not drawn with respect to any particular policy and will not change as that reference point changes (usually with every change in government). In addition, since it is perfectly possible for a party to be willing to associate itself with larger policy concessions in one direction than another, a horizon may lack the symmetry about the party's ideal point that is typical of indifference contours. What this means is that the cost a party attributes to a given policy distance may vary not just across dimensions but also within them, depending on the direction in which they are taken."
"5","Why parties might have horizons is an open question. As noted earlier, it may be because party supporters expect reasonably faithful adherence to policy commitments and leaders fear that they will become disaffected if that expectation is not met; alternatively, it could be because the leaders themselves believe the party's longer‐term interests (and theirs as well) are best served by cultivating a distinct ideological identity, or even because the leaders themselves are committed ideologues. Whatever the case, the key point for present purposes is that the existence of horizons affects the coalition formation process by limiting the set of governments that could be formed to those composed of parties with intersecting horizons. The reason is evident: without such an intersection, there would be no point in the policy space that they would all accept as the government's policy position. The policy horizon hypothesis thus takes the form of a two‐pronged necessary condition: (1) for a party to participate in a government, the government's proposed policy position must fall within the horizon surrounding the party's ideal point that circumscribes the set of policies acceptable to it as a basis for government participation; and therefore (2) for a government to form, the horizons of all parties participating in the government must intersect one another in the policy space.1"
"6","It is important to note that the policy horizon hypothesis cannot provide a complete explanation of government formation in parliamentary systems because the necessary condition it stipulates can never be uniquely satisfied. Even in the extreme case where no two parties have intersecting horizons, any one‐party government would still satisfy the condition (by implementing a policy that falls within its own horizon). The hypothesis therefore has a more limited purpose: to advance a change in the way in which a key building block of any viable theory, the cost of policy compromise, is conceptualized."
"7","Limited changes may nonetheless have major consequences. Under the hypothesis, parties do not evaluate potential governments simply on the basis of the policy distance costs they would entail (along with office or other inducements they would provide); instead, coalition options may be ruled out absolutely on the basis of policy, regardless of other considerations. How much this contingency affects outcomes depends largely on the degree of tolerance parties have for policy compromise. Broad horizons (i.e., high tolerance for compromise) imply little impact, but if horizons are narrow enough to eliminate a substantial proportion of potential governing coalitions, their existence could profoundly influence the dynamics and outcome of the government formation process."
"8","The expert survey that provides the policy data for the present investigation covers 13 West European parliamentary systems that have experienced sizeable numbers of postwar government formations not dominated by a majority party.2 Potential survey respondents, some 731 in all, were identified from the list of respondents to Huber and Inglehart's (1995) expert survey, the membership directory of the European Consortium for Political Research, literature searches, and referrals from other respondents.3 They were contacted by mail and, in some cases, recontacted one or more times over the 2000–2002 period. The 163 responses that were received are distributed so as to provide at least 10 expert respondents for each country.         "
"9","Unlike some earlier expert surveys that solicited information on just one policy dimension (e.g., Castles and Mair 1984) or left the identification of other relevant dimensions to the respondents (e.g., Huber and Inglehart 1995), this survey attempted to facilitate the establishment of multidimensional policy spaces in each country by requesting data on three general dimensions and by allowing respondents to identify a fourth dimension of particular relevance to their country, if they wished. The specified dimensions are (1) left‐right, (2) clerical‐secular or libertarianism‐authoritarianism (the respondent had to choose one), and (3) materialism‐postmaterialism. This choice was indicated by a substantial body of previous research pointing to these dimensions as significant axes of political competition and conflict in a variety of countries (e.g., Warwick 2001). Although this format structures the responses to a certain degree, it is offset by a request to rate the salience of each dimension. This makes it possible to identify the key dimensions in each country and, more importantly, to weight all calculations by these saliences. Thus, if a dimension that is not of particular importance in a given country is included in the analysis, its relative lack of salience can be taken into account.         "
"10","The survey's principal novelty is that, for each dimension, respondents were asked not only to locate each party's position (on a scale running from 0 to 10), but also to locate the upper and lower limits of the party's willingness to compromise for the purpose of joining a coalition government.4 It should be noted that respondents were not left with the stark choice of (indirectly) subscribing to the horizon hypothesis by providing limits or else refusing to answer the question. The nature of the hypothesized horizon effect is such that it diminishes to the extent that horizons are broad, and it was made clear to respondents that placing a party's limits at or near the ends of the various dimensions would be equivalent to saying that horizons do not constrain that party's coalition behavior at all. Respondents were thus free to eviscerate the hypothesis' substantive content while conforming totally to the demands of the survey.         "
"11","A second noteworthy feature is that respondents were specifically admonished not to estimate horizon bounds on the basis of parties' coalition behavior. The purpose here is to ward off, as much as possible, any temptation to identify bounds on the basis of the phenomenon they are intended to explain. One way to check whether this admonition was followed is to determine whether interrespondent agreement on the location of bounds is greater for parties that are frequently in government or simply more often present in the legislature when governments are formed; if either were true, it would suggest that respondents use coalition behavior to inform their estimates. Testing reveals, however, that there is no significant association between the uncertainty associated with a party's horizon bounds and either of these indicators of the amount of information provided by its past coalition choices.5"
"12","The demanding nature of the questionnaire, as well as the fact that the survey was conducted by mail, undoubtedly accounts for the response rate of 23.1%. This naturally raises the question of the accuracy of the results. An indication of the ability of this sample of experts to provide good estimates can be obtained by correlating its mean estimates of party positions with position estimates provided in other expert sources. These expert sources, it is worth noting, are often used as the standard against which the accuracy of other measurement procedures, such as those utilizing party electoral manifestos, are judged (e.g., Gabel and Huber 2000).         "
"13","The most extensive comparisons can be made for the left‐right dimension, since several other sources are available. These include: (1) Browne, Gleiber, and Mashoba's (1984) assessment of party positions on an “economic conflict” dimension; (2) mean left‐right positions from Castles and Mair's (1984) expert survey; (3) mean positions on Laver and Hunt's (1992)“taxes vs. services” and “public ownership” dimensions derived from their expert survey; and (4) mean left‐right positions from Huber and Inglehart's (1995) expert survey. The correlations, which range in magnitude from .88 to .99, suggest a very high degree of consistency between the results of this survey and those of other estimation efforts. Far fewer comparisons can be made for the clerical‐secular and post‐materialism dimensions due to the paucity of previous efforts to rate parties on these dimensions, but those that can point to an equally high degree of consistency across sources.6"
"14","When it comes to policy horizons, we can expect less accuracy. For one thing, the request to estimate horizon bounds is unprecedented and may have obliged respondents to think of politics in their countries in an entirely unfamiliar light. Almost all proved willing to try, but several expressed doubts about their own estimates, especially for dimensions beyond the left‐right dimension. To make the task easier, the initial strategy was to solicit estimates only for the left‐right dimension and to use the salience estimates for the other dimensions to rescale the left‐right bounds to accommodate those dimensions. This proved to be unviable because the expected linkage between the width of the bounds and the salience of the dimensions was not borne out in the survey results;7 many respondents were therefore sent follow‐up questionnaires asking them to provide bounds for the other dimensions. Needless to say, not all did and the consequence is that there are considerably fewer estimates of party bounds than for party positions in dimensions other than the left‐right dimension.         "
"15","An indication of the increase of uncertainty associated with the location of policy horizons can be garnered by looking at the standard errors of the means. There seems to be a substantial degree of agreement on the location of parties on the left‐right dimension; the average standard error for a party location is just 0.25 units. The average standard errors for the location of horizon bounds, however, are noticeably larger at 0.32 units for the lower bound and 0.30 units for the upper bound. For the second dimension, all three scores are approximately doubled, and for the third dimension, the standard errors for the bounds are larger still.8 Clearly, there is less certainty in estimating horizon bounds than in estimating positions (and less certainty in estimating all parameters for the second and third dimensions than for the first).         "
"16","Much of this may have to do with the smaller numbers of respondents supplying bound estimates, especially for higher dimensions. One means of addressing missing data problems that has received a lot of attention lately is the multiple imputation procedure (King et al. 2001). As applied to these data, the procedure would use the strong correlations that exist between the positions of parties and the locations of their upper and lower horizon bounds on each dimension to impute estimates of the latter for those respondents who had provided only estimates of positions. Unfortunately, despite considerable experimentation, this technique did not prove to be of any clear value in augmenting the data.9"
"17","Although it proved impossible to enhance the data through imputations to reduce the uncertainty associated with the locations of policy horizons, there is another means of dealing with the uncertainty: incorporate it into the measurement of horizon intersections. The statistical program developed to analyze the data enables this goal to be achieved by means of simulations in which the uncertainty associated with each parameter is used to alter randomly that parameter's estimated value. In the next section, I describe the nature of this program and the procedure by which simulations can be used to generate an estimate of the probability of intersecting policy horizons for each combination of parties in any given coalition formation situation. These estimates constitute a key ingredient in the testing of the horizon hypothesis, which will occupy the remainder of the article."
"18","The most appropriate statistical means for testing hypotheses concerning coalition government formation is McFadden's (1973) conditional logit method, which estimates the effects of various traits on the odds of achieving some outcome conditional on being a member of the choice set or set of alternatives at play. For any given government formation situation, the choice set consists of every possible combination of parties (or “protocoalition”) and the outcome in question is the emergence of one of these protocoalitions as the government. In order to test the policy horizon hypothesis, the use of this method requires the ability to determine which of the protocoalitions in each legislature have intersecting horizons. The numbers involved can be very large; a legislature of nine parties, for instance, contains 511 protocoalitions.10"
"19","The analysis must also include the policy distance spanned by each protocoalition. As noted above, it is well established that policy distance is inversely related to the likelihood of forming a government; policy distance, moreover, is highly likely to be correlated with horizon intersections (the further apart parties are, the less likely it is that their horizons intersect). Indeed, the policy horizon hypothesis may function as a refinement of the policy distance hypothesis: both see the odds of any set of parties forming a government as decreasing with the distance among them, other things being equal, but the horizon hypothesis postulates a threshold or cut‐off point whereas the distance hypothesis sees only a smoothly declining probability. Thus, what we seek is evidence that the policy distance relationship is qualified by a threshold effect, and both variables must be measured to make such a determination."
"20","I have therefore developed a program, Horizons 3D, to address these measurement issues.11 Given that the raw data for a party's horizon consist of the mean survey estimates of its upper and lower bounds on each dimension, Horizons 3D constructs the horizon by joining these bounds up in a smooth, concave perimeter surrounding the party's ideal point. There is no requirement that the horizon form a regular shape such as a sphere or an ellipsoid; irregular shapes are perfectly acceptable. Nor is there any requirement that the ideal point be located at the geometric center of the shape—parties can be willing to compromise more to the right than to the left, for example. The sole assumption made about the shape is that parties trade off concessions in one dimension against those in another. This implies that when a party has reached its limits of compromise on one dimension, it will not also be making concessions in other dimensions.12"
"21"," Horizons 3D displays these horizons in two or three dimensions so that the user can visually examine the pattern of horizon intersections in a given legislature. An example of one such display, a representation of the 1972 Italian parliamentary party system, is shown in Figure 1. The reproduction lacks two important features of the original—the color coding for the parties and the ability to rotate the configuration in all three dimensions for better visual inspection. Nevertheless, the wire‐frame horizons (which are actually three‐dimensional shapes) give some idea of how horizons are constructed.         "
"22","                 Spatial Display of Party Horizons: Italy 1972                      "
"23"," Note: The left‐right dimension is represented on the horizontal axis and the clerical‐secular dimension on the vertical axis. In this graphic representation, party horizons appear to be superimposed when in fact they intersect. PCI = Communists; PSI = Socialists; PSDI = Social Democrats; DC = Christian Democrats; PLI = Liberals; PRI = Republicans; MSI = Italian Social Movement (Neo‐Fascists).                     "
"24","In addition to displaying the party horizons of a legislature, the program calculates whether or not a common horizon intersection exists for each of the protocoalitions in the legislature. It also calculates how much distance is spanned by the two most distant parties in each protocoalition.13 This operationalization of the concept of policy distance is predicated on the idea that, since any member party can destroy a coalition by leaving it, the policy viability of a potential governing coalition is reflected in the maximum policy divergence among its members.         "
"25","The distance calculations, however, must also take dimension saliences into account. One reason is to deal with the potentially difficult issue of which and how many dimensions to include for each system. As its name implies, Horizons3D can handle up to three policy dimensions, which is as much as or more than is usually prescribed for any West European party system.14 Rather than setting some arbitrary criterion for identifying how many “ significant” policy dimensions each system has, the three most salient dimensions for each system, as judged by mean survey estimates, have been included.15 Then, to allow for the fact that disagreements on important issues matter more for coalition viability than disagreements on less important ones, distance calculations are weighted by the saliences the parties attribute to the dimensions in question. This means that the distance between any two parties, A and B, need not be the same when seen from A's and B's point of view. (In the former case, A's dimension saliences will be used as weights; in the latter, B's saliences are applied.) The program therefore calculates two distances between every pair of parties in each protocoalition and selects the maximum distance overall to represent the protocoalition's policy diversity.         "
"26","A second reason for using salience‐weighted distances is to level the playing field with respect to policy horizons. Although it may not be apparent at first sight, policy horizons incorporate information on saliences. As noted earlier, to attribute a broad range of acceptable compromise on a given dimension to a party is equivalent to saying that issues on this dimension do not matter very much to the party; conversely, a narrow range indicates that the party cares a great deal about realizing its own position on that dimension. Although the survey data do not reveal this connection at the individual level (see note 7), the pattern clearly emerges when the responses are aggregated by party. Thus, for parties that were rated by at least five respondents, the correlation between mean dimension salience and mean horizon width is r =−.588 (p < .001, n = 61) for the second dimension and r =−.402 (p < .001, n = 52) for the third dimension. Since other factors are also likely to affect horizon width—some party leaders may have more room to maneuver at any given level of salience because their parties are less united on policy issues, for instance—these correlations are quite impressive."
"27","The final methodological element that needs to be discussed is the use of simulations. We have seen that there is substantial disagreement among survey respondents over the location of policy horizons; the average estimate for the lower horizon bound on the second dimension, for example, has a 95% confidence interval of more than three units on the ten‐unit scale—a very considerable range indeed.16 Yet the horizon hypothesis is likely to be especially vulnerable to measurement error of this sort. Unlike hypotheses that stipulate only an association between continuous variables, this hypothesis rests on an all‐or‐nothing measurement of the independent variable—either a common horizon intersection exists or it does not. If there is a good deal of inaccuracy in the location of horizon bounds, it is quite possible that a substantial number of non‐intersecting horizons will be miscategorized as intersecting, and vice versa.         "
"28","As noted earlier, the best means available for coping with the substantial risk of measurement error in these data is to incorporate the error into the analysis. This can be done most propitiously by performing a large number of simulations in which each position and bound parameter is altered by adding an error term drawn from the sampling distribution for that parameter. For example, if a given party had a mean estimated lower horizon bound located at 3.5, with a standard error (SE) of 0.5 and 5 degrees of freedom (df), a term from a t‐distribution centered on zero with that SE and df would be drawn and added to 3.5 to create a new estimate for the location of that horizon bound. The next simulation would repeat the process anew to generate another estimate for the bound, and so forth. In each simulation, all position and horizon parameters would be altered in this fashion, each according to its own level of uncertainty, and intersections recalculated. The end result of this process is a tally of the proportion of simulations in which an intersection occurred for each protocoalition. This proportion or rate can be interpreted as a measure of the probability that the horizons of the protocoalition's member parties intersect.17"
"29","These procedures were applied to relevant government formation situations in the 13 postwar West European systems included in this investigation. What makes a formation situation relevant for our purposes is that (1) there is no majority party, (2) positions and horizons are available for all sizeable parties (defined as those that held 5% or more of legislative seats), and (3) the formation situation involved a real choice of government, not just a nominally new government occasioned by, say, the death or retirement of the prime minister. These exclusions leave us with 33,296 protocoalitions in 248 formation situations, distributed across countries as shown in Table 1. The issue addressed in the next section is, how well do the rival causal factors, policy distance and horizon intersections, account for which protocoalitions formed the governments in these situations?         "
"30","Let us begin the analysis with the policy distance effect. In order to estimate this effect accurately, it is necessary to control for the size of the protocoalition in two respects. First, we must separate majority from minority protocoalitions: although the former are likely to be more ideologically diverse, the majority principle on which government survival and legislative effectiveness are based creates a bias in their favor.18 Second, the same principle suggests that the preference among minority protocoalitions will be to the benefit of those that are closer to majority status, despite the likelihood that closeness will bring with it extra parties and hence extra policy distance. Thus, the true test of the hypothesis is not whether more compact protocoalitions are preferred to less compact ones in general, but whether this preference holds among protocoalitions of a given size. Majority status, which classifies protocoalitions according to whether or not they encompass a parliamentary majority, and Closeness to majority status, which records the percentage of legislative seats a protocoalition falls short of majority status, capture these two conditions.19"
"31","The impact of (salience‐weighted) policy distance with these two controls in place is given in the first model of Table 2. It shows that (conditional on being in the choice set) the odds of a protocoalition emerging as the government are significantly enhanced if it is majoritarian, to the extent that it approaches majority status (for minority protocoalitions), and to the extent that the policy distance it encompasses is small. Further testing reveals that the assumption of independence from irrelevant alternatives, upon which logit models depend, is satisfied (this turns out to be true of all the models estimated here).20 Thus, we can be reasonably confident that the expected policy distance relationship is indeed present, but what about the hypothesized horizon effect?         "
"32","The horizon hypothesis argues that the influence of policy distance is qualified by a threshold effect: if parties are so far apart that their horizons do not intersect, they cannot coalesce. Given that intersections become more likely as distance decreases (ceteris paribus), support for the horizon hypothesis requires evidence that the existence of a common horizon intersection affects a protocoalition's odds of forming the government over and above the effect conveyed by policy distance. This possibility is tested in Model 2 through the addition of the dichotomous Horizon intersection variable, which records whether or not all protocoalition members have a common horizon intersection.21 Although the estimated effect of this variable has the predicted sign, it falls well short of statistical significance. On this evidence, it would appear that policy horizons do not constrain the choice of parliamentary governments in coalition situations.         "
"33","Such a conclusion, however, would be premature. We have seen that one problem with the use of this measure of horizon intersections is that it takes no account of the existence of substantial uncertainty over where party horizons should be located. To tackle this problem, each legislature was subjected to 500 simulations in which party positions and bounds were randomly varied as described in the previous section. Given the unbiased nature of the random errors generated for the simulations, one would expect that the mean party positions across the simulations would match the original positions very closely, which is indeed the case.22 For the horizon intersections, however, the correspondence will not always be so exact. If the original horizons of two parties narrowly fail to intersect, for instance, one would expect that intersections will occur in a fair proportion of the simulations. Similarly, if the original horizons just barely intersect, nonintersections should turn up quite often in the simulations.         "
"34","The bar chart in Figure 2 illustrates the correspondence between the Horizon intersection rate produced in the simulations and the original horizon dichotomy for the protocoalitions in the data set. In the figure, the intersection rate is grouped into ten categories of equal width, and the bars are shaded to separate the protocoalitions that had a common intersection according to the intersection dichotomy from those that did not. It is evident that the vast majority of protocoalitions have intersection rates that are close to one extreme or the other (0 or 1); these cases mirror the categorization of the horizon dichotomy very precisely. The ambiguous cases—those with middling intersection rates—are not only few in number but also tend follow the horizon dichotomy closely: most of those with intersection rates below 0.5 originally had nonintersecting horizons, while virtually all of those with rates above 0.5 had intersecting horizons. This high degree of correspondence between the horizon intersection dichotomy and the intersection rate is reflected in a very high correlation between the two variables of r = .92.         "
"35","                 Horizon Intersections and Intersection Rates                      "
"36","The intersection rate is thus very similar, in fact identical, to the horizon dichotomy for the vast majority of cases. Where it differs is mainly over the small number of “near‐misses” and “near‐hits,” for which it captures the considerable uncertainty that exists concerning the presence of an intersection. This is clearly a more reasonable rendering of the state of our knowledge about these situations; moreover, it is achieved with only a modest increase in the degree of collinearity with policy distance (the correlation with policy distance rises from r =−0.60 to r =−0.68 when the intersection dichotomy is replaced by the intersection rate). But how much difference can it make, given that so little has changed? The third model in Table 2 shows that the modest changes to the measurement of intersections brought about via the simulations generate a substantial change in outcomes: the intersection rate shows a much larger and highly significant net impact on government formation. Correspondingly, the policy distance effect is reduced, indicating that some of the role previously attributed to policy distance actually reflects the role of horizons.         "
"37","The result reported in Model 3 indicates that uncertainty over the location of horizons, particularly in situations where the estimated horizons just barely intersect or just barely fail to intersect, had obscured an existing horizon effect. But it does not follow that any estimation errors on the part of survey respondents are purely random; it may be, for instance, that horizons on a certain dimension or for a certain kind of party proved to be particularly difficult to estimate. In this section, the nature of the anomalies is explored."
"38","The key anomalies involve situations where the necessary condition of the hypothesis—that governments must come from the set of protocoalitions that have intersecting horizons—is violated. This happened in about one‐third (36.7%) of government formations. If these exceptions were the result of random estimation error, one would expect a scattering of cases implicating parties with no discernable similarities. In fact, a very different picture emerges. Of the 91 exceptions, fully 62 consist of governments in which the horizon of a Christian Democratic party does not intersect with those of one or more of its coalition partners (30 governments in Italy; 16 in Belgium; six in the Netherlands; and 10 in Germany). The other noticeable commonality is made up of 15 Finnish and four Swedish governments that lack an intersection between a Center/Agrarian party and a Liberal party.23"
"39","These cases are clearly not a random assortment of government formations; instead they mostly involve just a few parties of two particular types. Evidently, the survey respondents have established a degree of separation for the Christian Democratic and Agrarian/Center parties in certain countries that does not accord well with actual coalition behavior. Figure 1 illustrates the problem. Although the Italian Christian Democratic party is located in the center of the left‐right (horizontal) dimension in close proximity to a number of other parties, it is at the opposite end of the clerical‐secular (vertical) dimension from most of these parties. As a result, its horizon intersects only with those of the neo‐fascists (MSI) and the tiny Social Democratic party (PSDI). This would suggest that its coalition options were severely limited, whereas in fact it appeared in coalition with parties such as the Liberals (PLI), the Republicans (PRI), and the Socialists (PSI) numerous times between the founding of the republic and the party's demise in the early 1990's.         "
"40","One possible interpretation of these anomalies is that the hypothesized constraining effect of policy horizons is simply not operative for these parties; the horizon hypothesis, in other words, does not apply to them. A more nuanced view would be that, given the specialized nature of the issues in question, other parties may have been prepared to turn over prime responsibility to the parties most concerned with them. Thus, policy differences on issues that implicate religion, such as education or morality, may have been resolved by delegating decision‐making power to the Christian Democratic parties; similarly, agricultural issues may have been delegated to the Agrarian/Centre parties in Nordic countries.24 Finally, it may be that horizon violations were acceptable in these instances because the governments in question foreswore significant legislative initiatives in the areas of disagreement; clerical issues, for example, may simply have been put on the back burner so that governing coalitions could be formed.         "
"41","We cannot adjudicate between these possibilities fully with the data at hand, but we can cast some doubt over the first interpretation, the one that argues that the six parties identified above are constrained little or not at all by policy horizons. The fact that our respondents were willing to locate the parties well away from potential coalition partners and to give them fairly narrow horizons indicates that they saw policy on these dimensions as relatively constraining; to argue that the parties in question were not constrained at all flies in the face of such evaluations. It would also sit poorly with other evidence that policy in the relevant areas mattered to these parties. Laver and Hunt's (1992) expert survey asked respondents to rate the importance of various issues for the parties included in their survey. Two of the issues are “anticlerical/pro‐clerical” and “pro‐urban interests/antiurban interests.” The mean importance rating for the four deviant Christian Democratic parties on the former issue is 14.7 on a 20‐point scale; the mean rating for the Swedish and Finnish Agrarian/Center parties on the latter issue is 17.6. Such high ratings clearly suggest that, according to the experts polled by Laver and Hunt, achieving policy goals in these areas is important to these parties.         "
"42","The possibility of a delegation of responsibility to the most affected parties, in contrast, does have some empirical support: Budge and Keman (1990, 102–03) detected a strong tendency for Center parties, when in government, to take agriculture portfolios and similarly for Christian Democratic parties to take education portfolios (clerical‐secular disputes have often involved school policy). But why would their coalition partners be willing to defer to these parties on agricultural or clerical issues? Various possibilities can be suggested (see note 24), but the critical one for present purposes is the possibility that the issues do not matter very much to them. The reason this possibility is critical is that it would suggest that their horizons have been drawn too tightly on the relevant dimensions. Here, the Laver and Hunt data are also informative. They show that the coalition partners in question (e.g., the Republicans, Liberals, and Socialists in Italy) placed a great deal less importance on these issues: their ratings, on average, are less than half as great as the figures cited above. The substantially lesser importance these parties attribute to clerical or agrarian issues implies that their horizons ought to be much broader on the relevant dimensions, but this is not the case—in fact, they are slightly narrower, on average.25 Thus, our respondents have given the coalition partners of these six Christian Democratic and Center parties much tighter horizons than the Laver and Hunt's importance ratings would lead one to expect, and the consequence is a set of anomalous nonintersections involving these parties.         "
"43","It would appear, then, that the survey respondents overestimated the extent to which the clerical‐secular and rural/urban cleavages produced incompatible coalition partners in these systems. These issues may not have been as highly charged, at least for some of the implicated parties, as our respondents believe them to have been. Why the respondents concluded otherwise cannot be answered with the data at hand, but it is possible to assess the extent to which this pattern of anomalies undermines the strength of the horizon hypothesis. This can be achieved by the simple expedient of reestimating the model excluding all formation situations that involved any of these parties.26"
"44","The results are presented in the Table 3. The first column simply repeats the coefficients reported in Table 2, which utilize all available formation situations. In the second column, formations in which the six Christian Democratic and Agrarian parties in question were present are excluded from the analysis. It is evident that these exclusions produce a huge boost in the magnitude of the horizon effect.27 The third column goes one step further by excluding formations involving the suspicious nonintersection of Communist/Progressive Alliance and Progressive Party horizons in Iceland (see note 23). This anomaly has not been considered thus far because it is idiosyncratic to that one country, but if we allow for it by making the appropriate exclusions, we can see that a further increase in the horizon effect is produced.         "
"45","These results make it clear that the anomalous nonintersections involving this small set of parties had powerfully depressed the overall estimate of the role of policy horizons in constraining the choice of a government. While these exclusions eliminate more than half the formation situations, further testing indicates that the remaining formations are reasonably representative of the full set in other relevant respects.28 The stronger horizon effects are not therefore the consequence of using a highly biased subsample.         "
"46","Removing anomalies will always have some strengthening effect, to be sure, and it naturally tends to raise suspicions that the data are being manipulated to make things look better. If the anomalies represent instances where the real world simply fails to conform to the hypothesis, such suspicions would certainly be warranted. The justification for excluding anomalies in this case is that there are good reasons for believing that they result from measurement error rather than coalition behavior that it inconsistent with the hypothesis. If this conclusion concerning the source of the anomalies is correct, the results in Table 3 suggest that the structuring effect of horizons on government formation in coalition situations is a good deal stronger than the overall results have indicated.         "
"47","In prior work based on Comparative Manifestos Project data (Warwick 2003), two methods of deriving policy horizons from coalition behavior yielded estimates that reveal a powerful constraining force on government formation in coalition situations, even when other relevant factors are taken into account. But the key question is, can expert judgments yield estimates of horizon bounds that would show a comparable effect? In other words, can the influence of horizons on government formation be detected when the horizons of parties are estimated without resort to their government membership records?         "
"48","It is tempting, but incorrect, to answer this challenge by arguing that the willingness of almost all expert respondents to estimate reasonably narrow horizons is proof in itself that horizons play a role in government formation.29 One problem with such an inference is that we cannot be certain that there is a consensus of expert opinion on this matter: some who received questionnaires may have decided not to participate because they rejected the very concept of policy horizons. In addition, even if there is a consensus among country experts that coalition behavior is constrained by horizons, we cannot be sure that the horizon effect they perceive is not simply a reflection of the tendency for compact governing coalitions to form. What is needed is evidence that the horizons they identify have an influence on the choice of government independent of any effect emanating from policy distance.         "
"49","Demonstrating a net horizon effect with survey estimates of horizon positions is thus an important step in establishing the overall validity of the policy horizon hypothesis, but there are plenty of reasons—apart from the possibility that the hypothesis itself is false—why it might not succeed. The expert respondents were asked for a type of information that is unprecedented in surveys of this type and, indeed, may never have occurred to them. Moreover, the survey instrument seeks these estimates for several policy dimensions, not just the familiar left‐right one. Finally, it is necessary to assume the experts' estimates of both positions and horizons are accurate for the whole period of observation, which, in some cases, extends back more than half a century."
"50","The initial results using the mean expert estimates of party horizons gave some credence to these fears: they imply that the estimates were too inaccurate to reveal the role of horizons in structuring government formation behavior, or else that there is no such role. Further analysis, however, allayed these concerns. Simply replacing the horizon intersection dichotomy with an estimate of the probability that an intersection exists, a change which mainly implicates the small minority of cases where uncertainty is high (the near‐hits and near‐misses), was sufficient to reveal a significant horizon effect. In addition to a general level of measurement error that expressed itself most noticeably in these cases, the evidence also indicated that the horizon effect was depressed by horizon estimates for a handful of Christian Democratic and Agrarian/Center parties—or their coalition partners—that are highly inconsistent with their coalition behavior. Exempting these cases from the analysis produced a substantial strengthening of the horizon effect. This effect, moreover, holds up when the nine variables identified as significant influences on government formation in Martin and Stevenson's (2001) recent investigation are entered into the analysis.30 The results thus appear to be robust with respect to other relevant influences on the choice of a government.         "
"51","Why these anomalies should have appeared is uncertain at this point. Our expert respondents, as well as those surveyed by Laver and Hunt (1992), clearly regard the parties as policy‐driven, which suggests that they are unlikely to be free to violate policy commitments at will. But the two sets of experts disagree strongly over how important clerical or agrarian issues are to their coalition partners; unlike our respondents, Laver and Hunt's respondents see these issues as a lot less important for the partners than they are for the six Christian Democratic/Center parties in question. This suggests that that our respondents may have overestimated the degree of constraint affecting the coalition partners, generating spurious nonintersections that greatly diminish the overall horizon effect. But why they did so—if indeed they did—remains an open question.         "
"52","Regardless of the cause of the disjuncture between the estimated policy constraints and actual coalition behavior in these cases, it is clear that they are the exceptions rather than the rule. In general, the evidence of the expert surveys suggests that coalition behavior is structured not just by a distaste for policy compromise but a definite limit on the amount of policy compromise that can be tolerated. If this is the case, what implications does it hold for our understanding of, and future research on, parliamentary government?"
"53","One obvious implication is that it impels a rethinking of the nature of party utility in parliamentary systems. The standard formulation, embodied in most formal models, characterizes parties as seeking the best possible combination of portfolios and policy proximity. The policy horizon hypothesis alters this in a fundamental way by suggesting that there are limits on parties' ability to associate themselves with policy compromise, regardless of the portfolios on offer. Unless horizons are very broad, this immediately forecloses a lot of coalition options. In the present data set, just 23.4% of protocoalitions have intersecting horizons; excluding the protocoalitions with suspicious nonintersections causes that proportion to rise only modestly to 31.4%.31 If the survey estimates of horizons are approximately accurate, the majority of possible governments are ruled out by the horizon hypothesis.         "
"54","The closing off of a substantial proportion of coalition options is bound to simplify the process of bargaining over governments. It may also facilitate matters by enhancing the credibility of commitments made to coalition partners. Strategic incentives, however, must also be considered. Tsebelis (1990, 174) points out in his analysis of Belgian consociationalism that party leaders may have an interest in exaggerating the salience that their followers place on an issue dimension (in our parlance, exaggerating the narrowness of the party's horizon) in order to force potential coalition partners to offer a better deal. Too much exaggeration, of course, might discourage or alienate would‐be coalition partners, which means that a complex game of bluff and counterbluff involving the location of horizons may underlie coalition negotiations under a policy‐horizon framework.         "
"55","There is another sense in which the operation of horizons may involve strategic considerations. The policy horizon hypothesis implies that party leaders do not simply seek the best possible deal in the parliamentary arena; they must do so within the constraint of the expectations of party supporters. That constraint lies outside the parliamentary arena, but it need not be totally exogenous in a causal sense since party leaders may attempt, through manipulation or persuasion, to alter party horizons so as to influence either coalition or electoral outcomes. The world of party politics that the hypothesis conjures up is thus a nested game in which leaders must respect internal party constraints, but may also manage, manipulate, or misrepresent those constraints to achieve their goals."
"56","Developing a theoretical road map for such a world would clearly be a formidable undertaking. The policy horizon hypothesis not only proposes a new type of data to be added to the standard ingredients of coalition theories (party sizes and positions); it recasts the field of play to encompass much more than just the parliamentary arena. The hypothesis thus suggests a very different understanding of government formation and maintenance in parliamentary regimes. On the evidence presented here, it is one that should be taken seriously."
