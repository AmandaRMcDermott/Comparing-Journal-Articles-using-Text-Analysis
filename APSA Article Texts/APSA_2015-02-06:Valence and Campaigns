"1","Of course, the empirical and theoretical literatures on electoral campaigns are each broad and deep. In order to motivate our model, we first summarize and contrast the ideological convergence literature with respect to a handful of regularities regarding which our model offers predictions. Then we turn to a concept largely neglected in the theoretical literature on electoral campaigns, candidate entry, and how it relates to our model. In doing so, we do not intend to offer (nor do we in fact provide) anything resembling a comprehensive literature review. Our model is deliberately stylized, and we accordingly think it appropriate to speak only to broad regularities."
"2","Contrary to the classical predictions of the Downsian model of two‐party electoral competition (Downs 1957), empirical work finds that electoral candidates more often than not diverge on the ideological spectrum.2 As Stone and Simas summarize the situation in a recent article, “there is little evidence in congressional studies that the Downsian convergence hypothesis holds” (2010, 372). To account for this phenomenon, scholars have sought to bridge these findings by including other factors that could potentially moderate convergence and divergence.            "
"3","For example, in a vein very similar to that taken in this article, some models take valence/popularity into consideration by modeling competition between candidates with different inherent appeal to voters, or “valences.”3 These models find that on the whole, advantaged candidates adopt more moderate positions than do disadvantaged candidates, resulting in policy divergence in equilibrium.4 However, as the two candidates' advantages become equal, the candidates are more likely to converge, a point made in a variety of models. The two most closely related to the one presented in this article are Groseclose (2001) and Aragones and Palfrey (2002).5 In both of those models of two‐party electoral competition, however, the candidates are required to announce their positions simultaneously. In the model presented in this article, the candidates announce positions sequentially; this structure allows us to offer predictions about the effect of campaign timing.6 In addition, in our model, each candidate always has the option to not campaign, which generates predictions about what we term “noncompetitive” elections in which one or both candidates choose to run on voters' preconceived notions (prior beliefs) about the candidate's or candidates' platforms. In our theory, such noncompetitive elections can and do arise endogenously.            "
"4","In a very closely related empirical study, Stone and Simas (2010) examine the effect of both the relative strengths of the two campaigns and the valences of the candidates on the platform positions adopted in two‐candidate elections to the U.S. House. Their results are intriguing in a number of ways and encompass several issues that we do not address in this article.7 They find that (1) candidate valence–advantaged candidates locate closer to the (district‐specific) median voter and (2) but that candidates' “campaign valences” had little effect on either candidate's platform choice. However, these effects are conditional on there being two major party candidates in the campaign.            "
"5","We emphasize the conditional nature of the results reported by Stone and Simas (2010) not because we believe it is inappropriate. Rather, it highlights an important factor in our model. Namely, while existing empirical studies make it clear that valence and/or competitiveness considerations play an important role in determining the platform locations adopted in two‐candidate elections, a nontrivial proportion of elections are uncontested and, further, some nominally contested races are so clearly uncompetitive that neither candidate exerts any meaningful effort in campaigning. Our theory indicates that the endogeneity of uncontested/uncompetitive elections is key to drawing inferences about the true effect of both candidate and campaign valences on representation. Of course, the question of campaigning/candidate entry has attracted significant attention. We now turn to this topic.            "
"6","Our model endogenizes the candidates' choices to campaign or not. This is obviously closely related to the question of whether to enter the race or not. We attempt to keep our language precise and speak about our choice as that of campaigning because we do not endogenize the number of candidates that the voters ultimately choose between. That is, both candidates are always “on the ballot.” If either candidate decides to not make an announcement in our model, this represents the choice to “not campaign” in the sense that he or she does not exert any effort in an attempt to change voters' minds about what his or her platform is.8 Thus, we speak about uncompetitive elections, rather than uncontested races, in our discussion.            "
"7","Our primary reason for adopting this approach is empirical. There are many races in which there are two candidates on the ballot, but one or both do little in terms of active campaigning. From our perspective, this represents the candidate choosing to accept the public's preconception of his or her platform.9 While the question of whether it is important to distinguish formal entry and inclusion on the ballot from active and costly campaigning for election is a potentially important question of measurement, we think our approach has independent merit. In particular, while many situations in which one candidate chooses to not campaign are motivated by a particularly bleak electoral landscape—for example, the valence‐disadvantaged candidate may not be able to secure enough votes to warrant active campaigning—there are also situations in which an advantaged candidate will choose not to campaign because campaigning would not secure enough net votes for him or her. Such behavior would, of course, not be observed in a model in which the choice to enter was necessary to be included on the ballot at all. With that noted, we now turn to consider the literature on candidate entry.            "
"8","An extensive body of literature examines who runs for office and the characteristics of these candidates. In particular, what kind of candidate runs against an incumbent? Under what conditions does an incumbent retire? These questions are examined through candidate entry, political ambition, and the incumbency advantage. In this section, we examine the factors related to candidate entry. In particular, we will describe how these factors determine who runs and how this motivates our model."
"9","It is well known that congressional incumbents who seek reelection are overwhelmingly successful.10 This high level of success is principally due to the combination of the resources incumbents hold and strategic decision making—incumbents are more likely to seek reelection when their prospects are good. In addition, most incumbents have already run a campaign and won an election. In the process, most incumbents are relatively privileged in terms of campaign‐specific resources, such as leftover campaign funds, lists of potential contributors, access to the media, and name recognition within their district. Quite intuitively, such factors are known to deter potential challengers (Epstein and Zemsky 1995).            "
"10","Most importantly for our purposes in this article, much previous research shows that the campaign environment is strategic.11 In particular, the candidate emergence literature has examined the question “Should I run?” from the perspective of a potential challenger. The literature largely confirms that this decision is strategic, such that the “choices made by challengers and incumbents are strongly related” (Carson 2005, 23; see also Jacobson and Kernell 1983). In fact, the candidate entry literature identifies strategic factors as the most influential determinant of candidate entry. For example, Banks and Kiewiet (1989) find candidates with prior experience are more likely to run when an incumbent retires, is involved in a scandal, or won a previous election by a small margin. This regularity is further supported by Maisel and Stone (1997), who surveyed potential candidates by asking a range of questions to determine their likelihood of running for office. They found the most influential determinant was their perception of success. Potential candidates identified their willingness to run increased when their district lacked a strong incumbent or contained an open seat. This was further supported by 76% of their subjects noting that their chance to run for office decreased when a popular incumbent was likely to run.12 Thus, potential challengers weigh the long‐term costs and benefits with fixed features and short‐term opportunities, like national tides, to assess whether or not to run (e.g., Maestas et al. 2006).            "
"11","Stone, Maisel, and Maestas (2004) find a strong direct effect for the perceived quality or valence of the incumbent when potential challengers choose whether to challenge him or her. This finding is above and beyond the indirect effect of the incumbent's quality or valence on the likelihood that the challenger will defeat the incumbent. In addition, Stone, Maisel, and Maestas (2004) find that, in determining whether to run against an incumbent, there is a strong interaction between the perceived quality or valence of the incumbent and the potential challenger's perception of his or her own electoral prospects against that incumbent. This correlation emerges in our model as well and is in fact exacerbated by equilibrium behavior, as an opponent's strength may lead a candidate to adopt a more extreme ideological position precisely to remove the opponent's incentive to actively campaign in pursuit of a larger victory.            "
"12","Finally, scholars have considered factors related to the cost and benefits from revising one's platform, a feature that plays an important role in our model. For example, Ensley, Tofias, and De Marchi (2009) consider the complexity of the electoral landscape (i.e., the distribution of a district's constituents' preferences) and show that incumbents benefit from representing districts in which discovering the optimal policy platform is more complicated. Relevant for our purposes is their finding of a significant deterrence effect: Quality challengers were less likely to enter the race when the district's electoral landscape was “complex.” Relatedly, Carson et al. (2011) find that incumbent state legislators are more likely to run for a House seat if their state legislative district's constituents represent a larger share of the federal House district's constituents. We now turn to summarizing our theory's predictions, after which we present the model in some detail.            "
"13","As the discussion above indicates, we stand on the shoulders of giants: There is a large theoretical literature considering the effects of valence on electoral competition. In this section, we preview the predictions generated by our theory, which is presented in detail in the next section. The first overall prediction of the model is that, for both candidates, neither the choice to campaign nor the choice of platform to announce is a function of the median of the voters' ideal points.13 Rather, as discussed and illustrated in more detail in the Advantaged Second Mover subsection, the introduction of a valence advantage implies the following overall prediction, which represents a subtle, but important point about measurement.            "
"14","Prediction 1.When making choices about whether to campaign as well as about what platforms to campaign on, vote‐seeking candidates will condition on the entire distribution of voters' ideal points. That is, these decisions need not be a function of the location of the median voter's ideal point.               "
"15","Similarly, our theory indicates that campaigning (i.e., making an announcement) is not necessarily a monotonic function of either candidate valence or campaign factors. That is, there are situations in which increasing the advantaged candidate's level of candidate valence, or either dimension of campaign valence (i.e., decreasing either candidate's cost of campaigning or increasing the second candidate's probability of having an opportunity to make an announcement), will cause the valence‐advantaged candidate to no longer make an announcement, but there are also situations in which that same change will cause that same candidate to choose to actively campaign. The same is true for the disadvantaged candidate: There are situations in which increasing any of the components of candidate or campaign valence of the advantaged candidate will cause the disadvantaged candidate to no longer actively campaign, and other situations in which the same change will cause that candidate to choose to make an announcement. In both cases, the ambiguous relationship between the dimensions of candidate and campaign valence and the choices to campaign is entirely due to the sensitivity of each candidate's incentives on the actual realized distribution of voters' ideal points.            "
"16","Prediction 2.The impact of candidate and campaign valence on the candidates' individual decisions to campaign is ambiguous and depends on the distribution of voter preferences.               "
"17","While Predictions 1 and 2 are not “classic” comparative statics results, they are nonetheless informative about empirical phenomena. The model presented here indicates potential complexities inherent in disentangling the relationships between the various exogenous electoral factors and the candidates' incentives with respect to both campaigning and the platforms they adopt when they choose to campaign. In other words, even in a relatively stripped‐down model of two‐candidate electoral competition, there need not be a parsimonious relationship between the electoral setting and the candidates' behaviors. In relation to Stone and Simas (2010) and other research examining how candidate and district characteristics affect observed campaign and platform choices, the theory indicates that, in general, there need not exist any relationship between summary statistics such as the median of constituents' preferences and the behaviors of strategic candidates. Similarly, the theory illustrates how the relationship between constituent preferences and candidates' behaviors is potentially strongly mediated by the candidates' own idiosyncratic characteristics, including both candidate and campaign valences. In addition to suggesting a need for more detailed empirical analysis of elections, the theory's implications jointly illustrate the sensitivity of previous theories of electoral competition with a valence‐advantaged candidate to specific modeling choices, such as the simultaneity of campaign platform announcements and the presumption that campaigning is costless for both candidates.         "
"18","We now turn to a formal presentation of the model."
"19","We model an election campaign as a sequential‐move game between two candidates, the set of which is denoted by . We presume (without loss of generality) that candidate A chooses his or her announcement first. When choosing his or her announcement, candidate A may choose to either announce a platform position in a unidimensional policy space, , or stay silent (denoted by ). If candidate A chooses to announce a position, , he or she incurs an exogenous, positive, and commonly known announcement cost, . The announcement cost is intended to reflect the direct and opportunity costs incurred in communicating the position to the electorate (e.g., the time spent campaigning, raising money, purchasing advertising), and we revisit this concept in the next main section. After this choice is made and revealed, the election campaign continues with probability . If the election campaign continues, then candidate B is recognized and may choose to announce a position or stay silent, with an announcement  costing candidate B a positive and commonly known cost of .14 Then this action is revealed and the election occurs.15"
"20","The set of voters is denoted by V and is assumed to contain a finite, positive, odd number of voters, denoted by n. Each voter  has single‐peaked policy preferences over X characterized by an ideal point, , where without loss of generality,  and  denotes the median ideal point. Specifically, each candidate  is evaluated on Election Day by each voter v according to the following function:            "
"21","We assume throughout that voters use weakly undominated voting strategies and break ties in favor of the second‐moving candidate, B. Each candidate is presumed to seek to maximize the number of votes he or she receives.16"
"22","We model the candidates' platform choices as a sequential‐move game, in which candidate A is given a single opportunity to commit to his or her platform prior to candidate B (possibly) getting a chance to respond with his or her platform choice after observing the platform chosen by A.17 This assumption is crucial to our model and, we believe, more realistic than the relatively common assumption that both candidates announce their platforms in a simultaneous, once‐and‐for‐all fashion. While our setting is clearly restrictive insofar as (for example) candidate A is precluded from responding to candidate B's choice, two notes are in order. First, the assumption that candidates cannot change their position is no different than in simultaneous‐announcement models, and, more broadly, this article can be described as focusing on the role of (candidate) asymmetries in electoral competition. Even more specifically, note that the possibility that candidate B will not get a chance to respond at all (i.e., with probability , the election occurs prior to candidate B having a chance to announce his or her platform) implies that the opportunity to see your opponent's platform prior to announcing your own is a double‐edged sword: If you get to make an announcement, it is always better in our setting to move second—but the opportunity to move second carries the risk of not being allowed to move at all.               "
"23","It is clear to us that there is no single and universally true model of electoral campaigns. Nonetheless, we do believe that even a moment's consideration of real‐world campaigning suggests that candidates are provided with both the opportunity to respond and demur as they pursue office. Put another way, while Aragones and Palfrey describe sequential models as “problematic since results typically depend on order of moves” (2002, 134), we think a sequential model of elections is arguably more realistic precisely because the results depend on which candidate moves first.               "
"24","We now proceed to characterize and describe the equilibrium behaviors of the candidates. There are two cases to consider, depending on whether the second mover has a valence advantage () or not (), which we analyze in turn.               "
"25","When candidate B has a net valence advantage, B will receive all n votes if he or she chooses the same platform chosen by A (or, if A did not campaign, if B chooses , A's perceived location). Accordingly, this announcement yields B the highest payoff of all possible announcements (i.e., except for possibly making no announcement). However, if  is sufficiently large, then B might prefer to make no announcement at all. This is not as trivial as might appear at first glance, since B might receive a positive number (indeed, possibly a majority) of votes in the absence of an announcement: Announcing  is a best response for B in the second period if and only if the number of net votes that B would secure by announcing  and winning all n votes exceeds candidate B's cost of making an announcement, . Accordingly, there are situations in which candidate A can announce (i.e., commit to) a policy in the first period that provides insufficient electoral incentive for B to announce a policy in the second, even if given the chance.18"
"26","A full statement of the equilibrium in this case is provided in the supporting information (Proposition 3). As discussed above (Predictions 1 and 2), a general conclusion from this model is that succinct descriptions of comparative statics are not available without additional specifications. Accordingly, we discuss equilibrium electoral competition in this case by considering some simple and illustrative examples. The examples demonstrate some of the model's comparative statics. We focus first on the choice to campaign and then on platform choice.            "
"27","Figure 1 contains three examples to illustrate two features of the distribution of voters' preferences that affect the campaigning decision by a valence‐disadvantaged candidate. In each of the three examples, candidate B is located at the median voter's ideal point and possesses a positive candidate valence advantage, , displayed visually at the top of the figure.               "
"28","The first of the three examples (at the top of Figure 1) represents a lost cause for candidate A: Candidate B's ex ante location is closer than ν (candidate B's net candidate valence) to almost all of the voters, implying that A cannot secure many votes by campaigning. Presuming that campaigning is even moderately costly for candidate A, then, his or her best response is to demur.               "
"29","The second example (middle of Figure 1) illustrates the importance of the entirety of the distribution of voters' ideal points in determining whether a candidate should campaign. Candidate B is again located at the median voter's ideal point, but the distribution of voters' ideal points is skewed such that a relatively large mass of these ideal points is located at a distance greater than ν away from the median. Accordingly, there is a range of positive campaign costs for A that would deter entry in the top example but not in this case. For sufficiently small δ or sufficiently large , the optimal platform choice for candidate A is the policy  as pictured in the figure. This is the policy that is located exactly ν units away from the advantaged candidate B's position on the same side as the “skew” of the distribution of the ideal points. This is an example of entry being induced, in a sense, by a substantial fraction of voters whose policy interests are not completely outweighed by candidate B's (candidate) valence advantage.               "
"30","Finally, the third example (bottom of Figure 1) illustrates the importance of the variance of the voters' ideal points. This example mirrors the first example except that the distribution has a larger variance, implying that more voters are farther than ν from candidate B's platform. Accordingly, there is a range of announcement/campaigning costs for candidate A such that entry will be optimal in this case but not in the first example. Flipping this comparison around, the first and third examples provide purchase on the potential for incumbents who are perceived to be centrally positioned in homogenous districts to deter challengers.               "
"31","We now consider the comparative statics of platform choice, focusing first on the effects of candidate B's campaign valence, as measured by δ and . After that, we illustrate the effects of candidate B's candidate valence, .               "
"32","Assuming that the second mover's candidate valence is positive implies that the two dimensions of valence—candidate valence (ν) and campaign valence (δ)—are aligned: Higher values of each are unambiguously associated with the second mover being an “electorally stronger” candidate. High values of δ imply that the valence‐advantaged candidate will more than likely have an opportunity to present his or her message (i.e., make an announcement) to the voters. The comparative statics of (valence‐disadvantaged) candidate A's optimal first‐period choice as a function of the probability candidate B gets to make an announcement, δ, , are illustrated in Figure 2.                  "
"33","Figure 2 illustrates two families of situations, one for low announcement costs for candidate B (the top graph) and the other for high (but not prohibitive) announcement costs (the bottom graph). Holding candidate B's cost of campaigning fixed at a low level, as in the top graph in Figure 2, increasing the campaign valence of candidate B (as represented by δ) induces the first mover, candidate A, to adopt more extreme platforms. For sufficiently small values of δ—when there is a significant probability that candidate B will not have a chance to change his or her position from  ( in Figure 2)—candidate A will campaign aggressively and announce a platform that is ν units away from candidate B's perceived location.                  "
"34","For moderate values of δ (i.e.,  in Figure 2), candidate A does not campaign in this example because it is more likely that candidate B will have a chance to respond by mimicking candidate A, but this probability is not large enough to warrant paying a positive cost to ensure that B would not respond. Rather, candidate A adopts a middle approach, saving the campaign costs and running on his or her ex ante perceived platform. If candidate B gets a chance to respond, he or she will do so and adopt candidate A's ex ante perceived platform as his or her own. Finally, for sufficiently large values of δ ( in Figure 2), candidate B's high campaign valence induces A to deter B's entry by adopting , a position that makes response by candidate B unprofitable for candidate B. Such a position requires, of course, that B face positive costs of campaigning ().                  "
"35","Now comparing the bottom graph in Figure 2 with the top graph, the effect of candidate B's announcement costs on the behavior of the disadvantaged first mover can be seen. As candidate B's cost of campaigning increases, candidate A can secure a larger number of votes and deter campaigning by candidate B. This is illustrated in the two graphs by the fact that  is closer to  in the bottom graph than in the top graph. Furthermore, the graphs illustrate that, as the campaigning costs for candidate B, , increase, candidate A will generally have a greater incentive to actively campaign. This is because  has an impact on candidate A's equilibrium expected payoff only when candidate A adopts a platform intended to deter entry by candidate B. Thus, because increasing  enlarges the set of policies that will deter candidate B from entry, candidate A's maximum expected payoff from that set of policies is necessarily (weakly) increasing, making it more likely that such a policy justifies A incurring his or her campaign costs, .                  "
"36","Considering the effect of candidate B's candidate valence, , Figure 3 displays candidate A's platform choice, and Figure 4 illustrates the observed divergence between the candidates' platforms, conditional on the second‐moving candidate, candidate B, having an opportunity to announce a platform (e.g., δ close to or equal to 1).19"
"37","Figures 3 and 4 each identify six key thresholds for candidate B's candidate valence advantage, ν. For small values of the advantage ( in the figures), the disadvantaged candidate will announce a position between the median voter's ideal point and the ex ante perceived position of the advantaged candidate, .20 As ν gets larger, candidate A's platform, , diverges farther from . In an intermediate range of the valence advantage (), candidate A's announced position is invariant to ν and equals the position that deters entry by candidate B, .21 For moderately large valences (), candidate A is actively campaigning on a platform intended to deter campaigning by candidate B. For larger valences (), the cost of campaigning outweighs the additional votes that  would garner relative to , so that candidate A simply does not campaign. For even larger valence advantages (, where ), candidate A must campaign on a more extreme platform than his or her ex ante perceived location in order to receive any votes. Finally, for sufficiently extreme valence advantages (), candidate A faces a lost cause, as the maximum votes available to him or her are less than his or her campaign costs. Accordingly, he or she does not make an announcement.                  "
"38","Turning to the question of observed divergence between the candidates, note first that Figure 3 represents the distance between the platforms if candidate B does have a chance to announce a platform. Referring then to Figure 4, note that the observed divergence in equilibrium is zero only if candidate B has a chance to campaign and the valence advantage ν is not too large (i.e.,  in Figures 3 and 4).                  "
"39","We now consider the case in which candidate A has a net candidate valence advantage (). We begin by considering the equilibrium platform choices of the candidates, setting aside the question of campaign costs, and then turn to the comparative statics of equilibrium behavior.            "
"40","In terms of the platform adopted by candidate A when he or she has a net candidate valence advantage (), the optimal platform choice is either to mimic B's ex ante location (conditional on campaigning, this is always optimal for sufficiently small values of δ) or a position between B's ex ante location and the min‐max platform that minimizes the maximum number of votes that B can secure in response to that platform. Prior to considering the comparative statics of candidate A's equilibrium behavior, it is useful to consider this min‐max platform for a moment.               "
"41","The min‐max platform,22 denoted by  for any candidate valence ν, is implicitly defined by the following equality:                  "
"42","The top graph in Figure 5 illustrates that, for small valence advantages,  is near the median voter's ideal point, . As the candidate valence grows to a moderate value in this example (middle graph in Figure 5), the min‐max platform moves to the left, below the median ideal point, because (somewhat counterintuitively) there are more voters slightly above the median than below it. For larger values of the valence advantage (top graph in Figure 5), the min‐max platform eventually crosses over and moves above the median. The central point in determining the min‐max platform position (and, accordingly, the optimal policy announcement for candidate A when  and candidate B will definitely make a subsequent announcement) is that “the tails” of the distribution of voters' ideal points matter. That is, a vote‐seeking first announcer with a candidate valence advantage will seek to equate the votes that can be secured by the second announcer (candidate B) if he or she announces a position to the left of the first announcer's platform with the number of votes that can be procured by announcing a position to the right of the first announcer's platform. Thus, in line with Prediction 1, the equilibrium platform choices in these situations are essentially independent of the location of the median voter's ideal point. When candidates have differential valences, the strategic incentives are driven by a consideration of the distribution of all the voters' policy preferences.               "
"43","If candidate B has a net candidate valence disadvantage (), then his or her best response, conditional on making an announcement at all, is to choose either  or , depending on the distribution of ideal points, τ. Whether it is in B's interest to make an announcement depends on , ν, and τ. If either ν or  is sufficiently large (relative to the distribution of voters' ideal points, τ), candidate B will not actively campaign following an optimal choice by candidate, A and, for extremely large values of either of these parameters, candidate B will not campaign even if candidate A chooses not to campaign.               "
"44","Turning to the possible comparative statics of equilibrium behavior when candidate A has a net valence advantage, we now demonstrate that pithy summaries of the effects of the parameters are elusive and frequently nonmonotonic. Specifically, Figures 6 and 7 demonstrate this using two examples. Figure 6 considers a situation in which candidate A's ex ante location, , is located quite far from the median voter, whereas Figure 7 pictures a setting in which  is very close to the median voter.24"
"45","In Figure 6, increasing candidate A's candidate valence advantage (i.e., decreasing ν) leads to more campaigning by candidate A. Furthermore, in each situation, increasing the probability that candidate B will have an opportunity to respond (δ) weakly decreases the likelihood that candidate A will campaign. On the other hand, in Figure 7, each of these conclusions is reversed: As candidate A's candidate valence advantage increases, campaigning by candidate A becomes less likely, and increasing δ increases the likelihood that candidate A will campaign. In line with Prediction 2, the examples demonstrate the elusiveness of succinct summaries of the effects of the various parameters on the choice of whether to campaign.               "
"46","The figures also illustrate a regularity with respect to δ. Namely, if the min‐max platform  is optimal, then it is optimal for higher values of δ than mimicking (), which is always the optimal platform25 for sufficiently small values of δ. However, comparing the top graph in Figure 6 with the middle graph in Figure 7 demonstrates that this conclusion cannot be strengthened: Not campaigning can be the optimal strategy for (strictly) intermediate values of δ.               "
"47","Having worked through some of the possibilities regarding the comparative statics of the equilibrium behaviors with respect to the various parameters of the model, we now turn to briefly consider how these parameters may be interpreted in terms of the real‐world features of campaigns."
"48","In an electoral context, valence is a broad term that is intended to capture the idea of features of a candidate, party, or campaign that are (1) relatively fixed and (2) broadly valued by all voters.26 Classic examples of valence characteristics are competence (e.g., punctuality, basic education, organizational skills) and character (e.g., military service, religious affiliation). Regardless of what one is considering, valence characteristics are generally associated with higher levels of public support, ceteris paribus.            "
"49","Stone and Simas (2010) discuss the important distinction between what they term “candidate valence” and “campaign valence.” In their own words, candidate valence is “the bundle of qualities and skills that relate to character and job performance,” and campaign valence is “the skills and resources instrumental to waging an effective campaign” (Stone and Simas 2010,  373). In our model, candidate B's net candidate valence is represented by ν: higher values of ν imply that each voter receives a higher payoff upon election of candidate B, holding the candidate's platforms fixed.27"
"50","The notion of candidate valence is also arguably indirectly related to , the voter's a priori belief about the platform of candidate c in the absence of a platform announcement (i.e., with no active campaigning) by candidate c. Specifically, a candidate's a priori appeal to a voter v is decreasing in the distance between this platform and the voter's ideal point, . What makes  a valence characteristic is that it is immutable. Even though candidate c can render  irrelevant to the voter by announcing a platform, the candidate may voluntarily choose not to make an announcement or, if moving second, may not have an opportunity to do so. Accordingly, when we analyze the effect of  on equilibrium campaign behaviors, this is equivalent to analyzing the effect of (one facet of) valence on campaigns and electoral outcomes. We associate this facet of valence with candidate valence because, as portrayed in the model,  directly affects any voter v's (perceived) payoff from an electoral victory by candidate c, as opposed to simply affecting the probability that candidate c wins the election.28"
"51","The notion of campaign valence described by Stone and Simas (2010) is also captured in our model by two parameters that directly affect the payoff only of the candidate in question. Perhaps most obvious of the two parameters that proxy for campaign valence is the cost of making an announcement, . From a substantive standpoint, the interpretation is, of course, clear: Candidate c's valence is decreasing in  because a higher cost of making an announcement is a proxy for greater impediments to getting a campaign “going.” From a strategic point of view, candidate c's campaign valence is decreasing in  because, ceteris paribus, increases in  shrink the set of profiles of voter ideal points, τ, that would induce the candidate to make an announcement.29"
"52","The second parameter that represents differential campaign valences is δ. When , the second mover (candidate B) has a lower campaign valence than candidate A due to the fact that, regardless of what candidate A does, there is a fixed and exogenous probability  that candidate B will not have an opportunity to choose his or her optimal platform in response to the choice made by candidate A. The best substantive interpretation of δ is as reflecting the sustenance of media attention (or, perhaps, availability of air time for advertising) to the campaign: Higher values of δ indicate a high probability that candidate B will have an opportunity to put forward his or her platform for the voters' consideration.            "
"53","From candidate B's overall standpoint, lower values of  and higher values of δ are broadly complementary in terms of their overall effect on B's (campaign) valence.30 In equilibrium, these two parameters have a primary effect on equilibrium behavior of candidate A through their joint determination of the probability that candidate B will ultimately make an announcement as a result of candidate A's various possible actions, including the possibility of abstaining and making no announcement.            "
"54","As mentioned earlier, we are presuming that both candidates are “on the ballot,” so that both may receive votes without exerting any additional effort. Thus, a candidate's “cost of campaigning,” or announcement cost, represents the effort, time, money, and other resources required to get voters to associate the candidate with a platform different from the voter's initial impressions of the candidate. For example, if a candidate wants to distinguish his or her personal platform from that of his party, this requires the candidate to somehow get the attention of voters.31"
"55","Of course, real‐world voters have other things to worry about than the platforms of candidates, and the instrumental value (not to mention possibly the direct consumption value) of learning anything about any given candidate is typically quite small; a candidate—just like a firm attempting to garner attention for a new or improved product—will typically need to exert effort to either subsidize the voters' individual (time) costs of learning the information or increase the perceived value of the information. In a nutshell, and “on balance,” voters will often have an incentive to remain ignorant in modern democracies (e.g., Downs 1957; Hardin 2006). Thus, while some campaign/announcement activities are relatively low cost—candidates can and do set up Web sites, Facebook pages, and Twitter accounts32—it seems reasonable that many of these activities are sufficient to “make an announcement,” but at best only necessary for “making an announcement that is heard by the voters.”            "
"56","Within our theory, the announcement cost for either candidate , , is the net cost of getting voters to learn the candidate's new platform. In other words,  is the individual cost borne by candidate c to get the voters' attention. Since this cost is net, if candidate c were to be given/loaned logistical and financial resources that he or she could use only in the campaign, the parameter  would be commensurately reduced. Accordingly, while space and focus require us to treat the parameters  and  as exogenous, our model provides a useful starting point to consider the incentives for third parties to contribute/precommit resources to either candidate  as a function of how the candidate is perceived to be in or out of step with the electorate (), whether he or she will be the first announcer, the net candidate valence (ν), and the likelihood that the second mover will be offered a chance to make an announcement (δ).33"
"57","With a rough analogy between the parameters of the model and their empirical referents sketched, it is now appropriate to turn to considering once again how the predictions of this model compare with the existing theoretical treatments of electoral competition between candidates with differential valences. Because, at least in our estimation, Groseclose (2001) presents the most widely discussed model of such competition, we now proceed to explicitly compare the predictions of Groseclose's model with those of our own.            "
"58","The model developed by Groseclose (2001) is a useful reference point, as it both represents the state of the art in this literature and contains an admirably clear presentation of its main predictions. The main testable predictions following from Groseclose's model are as follows:34                        "
"59","We now discuss each of these in turn, first considering the case of a valence‐disadvantaged first‐moving candidate. Throughout this section, when we refer to “valence,” we are referring to candidate valence, ν.35 Referring back to Figure 3, note that, if candidate B has a chance to make an announcement, he or she will do so in equilibrium if and only if  (as marked on the horizontal axis of the figure). In those cases, candidate B will mimic the choice of candidate A. Accordingly, as displayed in Figure 4, increasing candidate B's valence from 0 to ν1has no effect on the observed divergence of the two candidates if candidate B has an opportunity to make an announcement. This prediction differs from Prediction 1 of Groseclose's model.         "
"60","On the other hand, if candidate B does not have an opportunity to make an announcement, then our model's prediction is the same as Groseclose's: As candidate B's valence advantage increases between 0 and ν1, the valence‐disadvantaged candidate diverges from the advantaged candidate's ex ante perceived position. However, while this prediction is similar to Prediction 1 of Groseclose's model, it is derived from a different causal mechanism; the divergence in this region is caused only by the inability of candidate B to announce a position.         "
"61","Our model also yields Groseclose's Prediction 2. In particular, referring again to Figure 3, for all valence advantages , increasing the valence advantage induces candidate B to announce a position closer to the median, , if candidate B is provided with an opportunity to make an announcement.         "
"62","Our model predicts behavior that is partially consistent with Prediction 3 of Groseclose (2001). On one hand, as the valence advantage grows between ν0 and ν1, both candidates are naming increasingly “extreme” policies in the sense that  and  are both diverging from the median voter's ideal point, . On the other hand, aside from a discontinuity at ν1—the valence advantage at which candidate A begins adopting the best position, , that induces B not to campaign—increasing candidate B's valence advantage does not lead B to choose positions that he or she would have chosen for smaller valence advantages, as does the valence‐advantaged candidate in Groseclose (2001).         "
"63","In Figure 3, note first that, for small positive values of candidate B's valence advantage, the position adopted by the valence‐disadvantaged candidate, , is always at least as close to the median voter's ideal point, and with probability , it is strictly closer. Furthermore, for , larger values of B's valence advantage induce the disadvantaged candidate, A, to adopt positions that are increasingly closer to the median voter's ideal point, . This prediction is the opposite of Groseclose's Predictions 4 and 5.         "
"64","Finally, our model predicts that the valence‐advantaged candidate, when he or she is able to, and chooses to, campaign, can always choose a position no more extreme (relative to the median voter's ideal point) than the position adopted by the disadvantaged candidate. This is partially consistent with Prediction 6 of Groseclose (2001). It is only partially consistent because , the position that induces B to not campaign, can be closer to  than . (This is an implication of Predictions 1 and 2.) Thus, referring to Figure 3, for values of the valence advantage larger than ν1, it is possible (but not guaranteed) that the valence‐disadvantaged candidate's observed equilibrium position will, with certainty, be closer to the median voter's ideal point than the position “adopted/accepted” by the valence‐advantaged candidate.         "
"65","Elections are complicated, messy affairs. Candidates differ on a variety of dimensions, even in relatively simple policy settings. Voters have preconceptions about candidates in terms of both their individual competencies/characters and their ideological leanings. These two factors are important components of what we have referred to as candidate valences. In addition, candidates differ in terms of their ability to bear the costs of proffering a message to the voters, updating the voters' beliefs about what the candidate in question will do once in office. These characteristics are referred to here, as in Stone and Simas (2010), as campaign valences.         "
"66","In this article, we have provided a basic theory of how these factors, combined with the strategic decision to enter a race (i.e., to actively seek to change voters' beliefs about the candidate's platform), interact to produce phenomena such as uncompetitive elections and divergent platforms, each of which is an empirical phenomenon that is roundly incompatible with the standard Downsian model of two‐candidate electoral competition in unidimensional policy spaces over which voters have single‐peaked preferences."
"67","Substantively, the model provides several potential causes for divergence and uncompetitive elections. In a nutshell, while the notion of “the disadvantaged candidate” is potentially ambiguous (e.g., a candidate with high candidate valence may have low campaign valence), the reality is that costly campaigning may not only exert a first‐order deterrent effect on the decision to actively campaign—it may also induce a second‐order effect of divergence by the first‐moving candidate in pursuit of (strategic) noncampaigning by a second‐moving, valence‐advantaged candidate. In such cases, a winning candidate may (somewhat counterintuitively) be the only one to not make an announcement.         "
"68","The results of Stone and Simas (2010) extend and clarify earlier research into the correlation between candidate characteristics and platform choice. They provide strong evidence that there is a positive correlation between the (district‐specific) moderation/centrality of a candidate's platform and his or her (candidate) valence characteristics. Thus, “better” candidates tend to run on “more centrist” platforms. This finding is arguably at odds with some of our model's predictions. In particular, as described in the previous section, our model in some cases predicts that the valence‐disadvantaged candidate will adopt the more centrist platform.            "
"69","This seeming contradiction is illustrative—the valence‐disadvantaged candidate's platform will be closer to the median voter than that of the advantaged candidate only if the advantaged candidate does not campaign.36 Thus, the findings of Stone and Simas (2010), which are understandably restricted to contested elections, are actually not at odds with this prediction of the model. The model instead points to the potential value of considering the locations and valences of candidates in uncontested elections prior to arriving at any firm conclusions about the true effects of these factors on the behavior of office‐seeking candidates.            "
"70","As acknowledged earlier in the article, the sequential nature of campaign announcements looms large in the model's predictions. As we have stated, we think this is a strength of the model—the model “predicts” that timing matters in campaigns, and this conclusion seems both reasonable and important. Specifically, the model allows us to consider the candidates' preferences over their position in the game. While we do not consider a model in which the timing is truly endogenous, the incentives identified by the exogenous timing model would necessarily propagate to such a model."
"71","These incentives are succinctly described as follows. Let candidate  denote the valence‐advantaged candidate. When  and ,37 candidate  strictly prefers being the second announcer, as in this case, he or she will be given an opportunity to make an announcement and will do so when given the chance, mimicking the other candidate's position and securing all of the votes. As a result, in such cases, the other candidate will not make an announcement unless it is costless.            "
"72","On the other hand, candidate  will strictly prefer to be the first announcer if  and his or her ex ante perceived location is suboptimal, where optimality is measured relative to the electorate's preferences, τ, and the candidate in question's announcement cost, . While space precludes a full treatment of the strategic timing of campaigning/announcements by candidates, the contours of this model both serve as a starting point and illustrate some of the interesting trade‐offs embodied in such a model.
