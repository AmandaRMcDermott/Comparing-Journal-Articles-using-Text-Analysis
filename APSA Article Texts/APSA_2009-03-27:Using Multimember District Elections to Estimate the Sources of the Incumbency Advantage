"1","Decomposing the incumbency advantage is particularly challenging because we are not able to observe factors such as candidate quality and district preferences. A number of previous studies use proxies to measure these components with variables such as previous office‐holding experience (e.g., Cox and Katz 1996) and/or vote shares for other offices such as the presidency (e.g., Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart 2000). One concern with this approach is the proxies include measurement error which biases the estimates. Much of the debate in this branch of the literature concerns the appropriateness of the various proxies.         "
"2","An alternative approach is to take advantage of multiple observations within the same election and/or across elections (Ansolabehere and Snyder 2002; Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart 2000; Levitt and Wolfram 1997). This is the approach we employ.         "
"3","The study that most closely resembles our motivation and research design is Levitt and Wolfram (1997), which decomposes the sources of the incumbency advantage into its three components by taking advantage of repeat challengers in U.S. House elections. One concern with the Levitt and Wolfram study is that repeat challengers are so rare in House races that they may be capturing something specific to these types of races. This sample selection issue is much less of a concern with our study given the large number of races in multimember districts with repeat challengers.7 Since winning candidates are more likely to compete in subsequent elections, the same candidates are likely to face each other multiple times in districts which elect several representatives. When we restrict attention to districts which elect only one candidate, we only observe repeat challengers in the rare situation where losing candidates choose to compete against an incumbent.         "
"4","We focus on multimember districts in state legislative elections. In these races multiple candidates from the same party compete in the same district, and voters are given n votes for n seats. This feature allows us to estimate the incumbency advantage by simply comparing the vote received by incumbents versus open‐seat candidates from the same party in the same race. Since we are comparing the relative vote shares of candidates from the same party, we are less concerned about factors which affect both candidates that change over time—e.g., national partisan swings or shocks to district characteristics.         "
"5","Before presenting the equations for the models we estimate, we provide the intuition behind our identification strategy. Our claim is that assuming that candidate votes depend upon their quality, access to direct office‐holding benefits, and district characteristics, then the magnitudes of both the incumbent quality advantage and direct office‐holder benefits can be estimated by differencing the votes of copartisans competing in multimember districts."
"6","Consider a two‐seat district with two candidates, 1 and 2, and two parties, D and R. The votes received by candidate i from party p in race j can be denoted as . The vote share of this candidate, V, is equal to . We use the average Democratic and Republican vote totals in the denominator to account for the fact that voters can cast up to two votes.8"
"7","Now consider the two candidates from the same party. To simplify notation we drop the party subscript, p. Assume the vote shares received by two candidates from party p are               "
"8","Our first quantity of interest is the magnitude of the combined incumbent quality advantage and direct office‐holder benefit. To recover this quantity we ask a simple question: By how much does the vote of a nonincumbent differ from the vote of an incumbent when the two candidates are from the same party? Since voters are given two votes and the candidates share the same party label, we attribute any systematic gap in the number of votes received by incumbent and nonincumbent candidates to the difference in their incumbency status.9 The fact that voters can cast two votes suggests that the candidates are not competing against one another for their party's “normal vote,” which should be the same for both candidates. Thus, by averaging over many multimember district races with an incumbent and a nonincumbent from the same party, the difference in these candidates' votes provides an unbiased estimate of the combined incumbent quality advantage and direct office‐holder benefits.10"
"9","Using the above notation, we can easily observe how the incumbent quality advantage and direct office‐holder benefits can be recovered by simply differencing equations (1) and (2).                "
"10","To isolate the direct office‐holder benefit, β, we can exploit the fact that in multimember districts pairs of candidates often face each other more than once. In particular we focus on races where candidate 1's incumbency status changes while the other candidate from the same party, candidate 2, is an incumbent in both races. We ask a simple question: By how much does candidate 1's vote change, relative to incumbent candidate 2's vote, when candidate 1 switches from being a nonincumbent to being an incumbent? We attribute the degree to which candidate 1 is able to “catch up” with candidate 2 to the direct office‐holder benefits candidate 1 acquires by being an incumbent."
"11","Using the above notation we can illustrate this point by differencing the differences in the votes for candidates 1 and 2. First, denote a subsequent meeting between the candidates from race j as race k. Then               "
"12"," Equations (3) and (5) also provide enough information to isolate the average quality differential between incumbent and nonincumbent candidates. The β from equation (5) can be subtracted out of (α2−α1+β) from equation (3) to recover (α2−α1). If both candidates 1 and 2 eventually win office, then we might expect (α2−α1) to be small. However, if all candidates, irrespective of whether they win office or not, are included in equation (3), then we can recover an unbiased estimate of the incumbent quality advantage over the average nonincumbent.            "
"13","The above discussion describes how features of multimember districts can be used to identify both the incumbent quality and the direct office‐holder advantages. Although we demonstrate the intuition for our identification strategy by differencing the vote shares of pairs of candidates, the models we estimate include candidate‐ and race‐specific fixed effects rather than simply compare differences in vote shares. The fixed effects have the same effect as differencing candidates' vote shares as was done in equations (3) and (5).            "
"14","To identify the combined incumbent quality and direct office‐holder advantage, we regress Vij on a race‐specific fixed effect and an incumbency indicator variable.13"
"15","In equation (5) we illustrate how the direct office‐holding benefits, β, can be identified for repeat pairs of candidates by differencing the differences in equations (3) and (4) when candidate 1 moves from being a nonincumbent to an incumbent. Again, this quantity of interest can be estimated directly, following the same logic as in equation (5), by regressing Vij on a candidate‐specific fixed effect, αi, a race‐specific fixed effect, θj, and an incumbency indicator variable, Iij. Thus, we estimate β using the following specification:               "
"16","In order to keep the cases as comparable as possible, we only examine races that are fully contested—i.e., in an M‐member district there are M candidates from each party.14 This avoids issues related to how voters reallocated their M votes when the number of choices from any particular party changes. At various points we discuss how results differ if we were to include the entire sample.15 The main substantive conclusions are unaffected.16"
"17","Furthermore, we restrict attention to races that help identify parameters of interest. Thus, we include races with at least one incumbent candidate and exclude races with incumbents from both political parties.17 One implication of these restrictions is that, for any given race, we can focus on the candidates from one party.            "
"18","Our estimate of β may understate the magnitude of the direct office‐holder benefits for at least two reasons: (1) the direct office‐holder benefits may in fact be growing over an incumbent's tenure in office; (2) nonincumbents who win office may receive a larger shock than the average nonincumbent."
"19","If incumbents become better at using the benefits from holding office during their tenure, or if the benefits from holding office increase with tenure (e.g., better committee assignments, or party or committee leadership positions), then our estimate of β in equation (7), which is for the incumbent's sophomore year, would be smaller than the actual office‐holder benefit. While theoretically possible, prior empirical research finds that the growth is small (e.g., Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart 2000; Hibbing 1991).            "
"20","In any case, we can easily allow β to vary with the incumbents' terms in office. For t = 1 , … , T, let Itij = 1 for candidates i serving their 1st to tth terms and zero otherwise.18 Then the equation we estimate is:               "
"21","Another reason our estimates of β may be biased downward is selection bias. Let  be the maximum‐vote share among the candidates from the other party. Then the bias may arise because  is likely to be positive when candidate 2 is an incumbent and candidate 1 is not. The logic is straightforward: assuming the incumbency advantage is positive, candidate 1 would on average require larger positive shock than candidate 2 in order to win office (i.e., ).19 Note that  when candidates are both incumbents.            "
"22","One way to address this potential bias is to assume that ε1j and ε2j are normally distributed and independent. Then  estimated using equation (7) would have the following bias:               "
"23","We should also note that the estimates of the combined office‐holder benefits and incumbent quality advantage in equation (6) are not biased when we include all of the observations, including those which are not repeat pairs, in the estimation of these equations. In this case we are not conditioning on the event  or .            "
"24","The three variables needed to estimate any of the above equations include state legislative candidates' vote shares, their incumbency status, and whether they are facing the same opponent(s).21 The data to measure these variables come from ICPSR Study No. 21480.22"
"25","Another variable of interest is the degree of district competitiveness. We are only interested in a crude categorization—classifying districts as “competitive,”“safely Democratic,” or “safely Republican.” To do this we first estimate the normal vote for the incumbent candidate's party. We do this for two periods, 1982–90 and 1992–2000.23 For the period 1982 to 1990 we use data for presidential, U.S. Senate, U.S. House, gubernatorial, and all available down‐ballot office elections from the Record of American Democracy. We estimate the normal vote by averaging across all of these offices for which there were elections during the period. For the period 1992 to 2000 we use data for all presidential, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House elections in 2000 from the Federal Elections Project. Both of these data sources provide precinct‐level electoral returns which we aggregated to state legislative districts.         "
"26","One potential limitation with our study is the degree to which we can generalize from our findings. In particular, it is possible that the size of the incumbency advantage, and its sources, may differ significantly between multimember and single‐member districts. A common claim is that the incumbency advantage is lower in multimember districts (e.g., Carey, Niemi, and Powell 2000; Cox and Morgenstern 1995).24 In fact, this claim is not well founded.         "
"27"," Table 1 compares the sophomore surge in state legislative elections in states with and without multimember districts over the period 1972 to 2001. (Note that we also control for the number of seats in multimember districts—dropping this control does not affect the results.) The sophomore surge in both the single‐member and multimember districts is significantly lower in states with multimember districts as compared to states with only single‐member districts. However, there is little difference in the sophomore surge in single‐member and multimember districts in the states that have both types of districts—in fact, the sophomore surge is larger in two‐member districts than in single‐member districts in these states.25 Thus, there is no evidence that the average difference between multimember and single‐member districts is due to district magnitude. Rather, the evidence in Table 1 indicates that the relatively low incumbency advantage observed in multimember districts reflects features of the states that have multimember districts, rather than features of the multimember districts themselves.26"
"28","This raises the question of why the sophomore surge is smaller in states with multimember districts. Although addressing this concern is beyond the scope of this article, in Table A2 we compare several characteristics of states with and without multimember districts.27 On average the states with multimember districts appear similar to the states with only single‐member districts, with a few exceptions. The states that used multimember districts tended to have a slightly higher population density and slightly stronger party organizations. Although multimember and single‐member district states do appear to differ in terms of populations and size of legislative budgets—multimember district states have smaller legislative budgets and smaller populations than single‐member district states—in per‐capita terms the legislative budgets are similar in the two types of states. Overall, in comparing these state characteristics we find little that would account for differences in the sophomore surge in multimember and single‐member district states. Explaining this difference remains an open question for future research.         "
"29","In the analyses below we focus on two‐member districts, which is the most common district magnitude.28 In the appendix we include a table of results for districts with more than two members (Table A5).         "
"30","This section focuses on estimating two components of the incumbency advantage—direct office‐holder benefits and incumbent quality advantages in two‐member districts. We address the third component, “scare‐off,” in the sixth section."
"31","The top panel of Table 2 presents estimates of the combined direct office‐holder benefits and incumbent quality advantage in fully contested two‐member districts.29 These are estimates of δ in equation (6). Again, since this estimate includes all candidates and not just repeat pairs, it is an unbiased estimate of the overall incumbency advantage. These two components together give incumbents about a 5.2 percentage point electoral advantage.30 We observe some growth in these two components over the three decades for which we have data—less than 5 percentage points in the 1970s and around 5‐ and‐a‐half percentage points in the 1980s and close to 6 percentage points in the 1990s. Our estimates are similar to the estimates of the state legislative incumbency advantage in Cox and Morgenstern (1993) for the period 1972 to 1986. This provides further confirmation that the incumbency advantage exists in state legislative elections and that it has grown between the 1970s and the 1990s.         "
"32","The middle of Table 2 presents estimates of the combined direct office‐holder benefits and incumbent quality advantage, δ, for repeat pairs—candidates from the same party who face each other in more than one election. We might expect the quality difference between an incumbent and a future incumbent to be smaller than between an incumbent and the average open‐seat candidate. On average the nonincumbents who later appear as incumbents are likely to be of higher quality than the average open‐seat candidate who does not. The results show that the overall incumbency advantage is smaller for repeat pair candidates as compared to the full sample of challengers.         "
"33","The bottom of Table 2 presents estimates of the direct office‐holder benefits, β, in equation (7). On average, incumbents receive a 2.4 percentage point advantage from holding office.1 The office‐holding benefits are less than half the size of our estimate of the combined incumbent quality advantage and direct office‐holding benefit. This is smaller than the estimate in Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart (2000), who find that approximately half of the overall incumbency advantage in Congress can be attributed to direct office‐holder benefits.33"
"34","As discussed earlier, the difference between the incumbency effect in the bottom versus the top panels of Table 2 is an estimate of the average incumbent quality advantage over nonincumbent candidates from the same party. The incumbent quality advantage is approximately 2.8 percentage points relative to the average open‐seat candidate. This quality advantage contributes as much to the overall incumbency advantage as the direct office‐holder benefits. This is much larger than the estimate in Levitt and Wolfram (1997) who find essentially no incumbent quality advantage.         "
"35","The potential selection bias discussed in the second section does not appear to have a substantial affect on our estimates of the direct office‐holder benefits using reasonable values of α1 and σε.34 When all races are included, the bias‐corrected office‐holder benefits still accounts for about half of the overall incumbency advantage.35"
"36"," Table 3 presents estimates of the incumbency advantage allowing the direct office‐holder benefits to increase with tenure—i.e., βt from equation (8). The estimates show that there is no noticeable change in direct office‐holder benefits over an incumbent's terms in office. There is some evidence that the overall incumbency advantage is higher for the incumbents in their third or higher term. This is consistent with the electoral selection argument since long tenure in office is likely to be an indication of the candidate's high quality.36"
"37","Accounting for district partisanship in our analysis is useful in at least two respects. First, we can potentially address the concerns with bias discussed in the second section. Second, we can investigate one potential source of heterogeneity in the incumbency advantage, which is sometimes noted in the literature. We can also examine whether this heterogeneity reflects a difference in electoral incentives or in the type of incumbent selected."
"38","We expect the bias in the estimate of the direct office‐holder benefit to be smaller in safe districts. As mentioned above, when candidate 2 is an incumbent and candidate 1 is a nonincumbent who eventually wins office, a potential bias arises because  is likely to be positive since the nonincumbent does not have the office‐holding benefits and thus would require a larger positive shock to win office. However, in safe seats the nonincumbent would not need a substantially larger positive shock than the incumbent to win office. Thus we might expect the estimated direct office‐holder benefit to be larger in safe districts than competitive districts because of this difference in the expected magnitudes of the biases.         "
"39","In Table 4 we divide the districts according to whether they are competitive or safe. Districts where the Democratic (Republican) normal vote is less than 60% are considered competitive districts for Democratic (Republican) candidates. Districts where the Democratic (Republican) normal vote is greater than 60% and less than 85% are considered safe for Democrats (Republicans).37"
"40","The top of Table 4 presents our estimate of δ from equation (6) by district competitiveness. On average the incumbents have a larger electoral advantage in competitive versus safe districts—6.0 versus 2.7 percentage points. Since the bias should be towards finding a larger incumbency advantage in safe districts, this indicates a strong negative relationship between district safety and the incumbency advantage.         "
"41","The results on the bottom of Table 4 show that a large part of the difference between competitive and safe districts can be attributed to the difference in direct office‐holder benefits—i.e., β from equation (7). The direct office‐holder benefits are larger in competitive districts—3.1 as compared to 0.7 percentage points. The estimate of the direct office‐holder benefits in safe districts is not statistically significant. This finding is consistent with the idea that incumbents exert more effort to use their office‐holder benefits when they are in competitive districts. There is some evidence that incumbents are of noticeably higher quality in competitive versus safe districts, as predicted by Ashworth and Bueno de Mesquita (2007). However, in both competitive and safe districts there is a substantial incumbent quality advantage over open‐seat candidates.         "
"42"," Table 5 explores two other possible sources of heterogeneity. First, states with a “party lever” on the ballot could reduce the magnitude of the incumbency advantage if this option induces more straight‐ticket voting. Thus, we include an interaction term between party lever and our incumbency indicator variable. The results in Table 5 suggest that the party lever did not reduce the magnitude of the overall incumbency advantage or the direct office‐holder benefits.         "
"43","Second, some previous studies have found a positive correlation between the size of the legislative budget and the magnitude of the incumbency advantage across states (e.g., Cox and Morgenstern 1993; King 1991). Unlike previous studies we can estimate whether this is due to incumbents utilizing the government resources or due to high‐quality candidates being attracted to office by the lure of influencing a large legislative budget. We therefore interacted our incumbency indicator variable with the size of the state legislative budget per capita.38 The state legislative budget data come from the Compendium of State Government Finances. We categorized the average state legislative budget for each state as being small, medium, or large.39 The results in Table 5 provide some evidence that legislative “resources” matter in the predicted manner. The relationship between direct office‐holder benefits and the relative size of the state legislative budgets per capita is positive (bottom panel).40 The magnitude of the coefficient on the interaction between incumbency and large state legislative budget per capita is of similar magnitude in the top and bottom panels, which suggests that the larger incumbency advantage in states with large legislative budgets is likely to be due to the difference in direct office‐holder benefits in these states.41"
"44","The multimember districts also allow us to estimate the “scare‐off” effect in a novel way. Most previous studies of scare‐off have used some proxy for candidate quality, such as past office‐holding experience. In contrast we take advantage of the large number of races with the same incumbent running in two different years in two situations. In situation 1, she is the only incumbent in the election from her party. Since one seat in the district is “open,” we expect high‐quality challengers from both parties. In situation 2, there are two incumbents from her party and no “open” seats. If there is a large scare‐off effect we would expect the challengers in situation 2 to be “weaker” than in situation 1. This would result in a higher vote share for the continuing incumbent relative to the challengers. Equivalently, the new challengers' vote shares relative to the continuing incumbent will fall. Note that this purposely ignores the change in votes for the new incumbent. This design only involves the votes for the continuing incumbent and the challengers."
"45","Consider a two‐seat district j (we suppress this subscript to simplify notation). Suppose in the election at time t of district j, there are two candidates from party D and two candidates from party R. Candidate 1 from party D is an incumbent and the rest of the candidates are nonincumbents. Further suppose that candidate 2 from party D wins the election at t so she appears as an incumbent in the following election at time t+ 1. In the election at time t+ 1 party D renominates candidates 1 and 2 but party R nominates two different candidates.42 The “scare‐off” from the change in the D candidate's incumbency status should lead to a drop in the R candidates' vote shares relative to candidate 1 from party D between the t and t+ 1 elections.         "
"46","We can define the average vote share of the two challengers from party R relative to candidate 1 from party D who is an incumbent at both time t+ 1 and t. At time t the vote share of the challengers is  where  is the vote for candidate 1 from party D.  is defined analogously. We are excluding the vote share of candidate 2 from party D. Since we are observing the same district with the same candidates from party D we simply difference out the effects of characteristics of party D's candidates and of district j. Thus subtracting  from  yields            "
"47","Since the vote share of candidate 2 from party D is not directly included in the calculation of , the change in incumbency status of candidate 2 from party D is assumed to affect  only through . Thus, as above we could also estimate the “scare‐off” effect with the following specification:            "
"48","We also estimate whether incumbency is related to the number of opposition candidates. Consider the same situation as above with two elections and two Democratic candidates who face each other in both elections. Again Democratic candidate 2 is not an incumbent in the first election and then becomes an incumbent in the second election. Let ORt be the number of Republican nonincumbents in the two elections. We can estimate “scare‐off” of opposition candidates with the following specification:            "
"49","We estimate equation (11) for both Democrats and Republicans. The results at the top of Table 6 provide little evidence that having an additional incumbent in a race will “scare off” high‐quality challengers. The “scare‐off” effect, , is close to being statistically significant at the 5% level in “safe” districts but not in “close” districts.43 However, with so few “safe” districts in our data set, further research should check the robustness of these results.         "
"50","Our estimates of equation (12) are presented at the bottom of Table 6. These results provide some evidence that the number of opposition party challengers is related to incumbency. This is consistent with some previous findings in the literature. However, even this finding is rather tenuous. When we examine only those districts where we have data on the normal vote, the magnitude of the coefficient declines and it is no longer statistically significant. We only have data on the normal vote for the period from 1982 onward.         "
"51","We should note that in some respects it is not surprising that the incumbent “scare‐off” effect is less evident than in existing studies of single‐member district elections. First, the “scare‐off” we are estimating is the marginal impact of adding an additional incumbent when there is at least one continuing incumbent. Thus we may not expect to observe as large a “scare‐off” effect as in the single‐member district case.44 Furthermore since we are focusing on repeat pair cases it is possible that quality candidates from party R may be already scared off in period t− 1 due to the high quality of the repeat candidates from party D. As discussed above, when candidates from party D are a repeat pair, they both tend to be high‐quality candidates. Finally, our estimates of office‐holder benefits in state legislative elections are smaller than those found for Congress. Thus, the “scare‐off” effect from incumbency would likely be smaller as well.         "
"52","We find a sizeable incumbency advantage in multimember district elections for state legislatures. This confirms findings from previous studies. Our research design allows us to go further than most existing studies, however, and decompose the advantage. Doing this we find a substantial direct office‐holder benefit, as well as a large incumbent quality advantage. We attribute at least half of the overall incumbency advantage to the higher quality of incumbent candidates over the average open‐seat candidate from the same party."
"53","Intrastate heterogeneity is evident in our findings. First, incumbents in more competitive districts have larger direct office‐holder benefits. This pattern is consistent with the idea that incumbents use their office resources to respond to electoral threats. Second, we find some evidence that the incumbent quality advantage may be higher in competitive districts, which is consistent with the predictions in Ashworth and Bueno de Mesquita (2007). Further research is needed to confirm the robustness of this second result.         "
"54","We also find interstate heterogeneity. In particular, the size of the state legislative budget appears to be positively correlated with the magnitude of the direct office‐holder benefits. This is more direct confirmation of the literature, which claims that incumbents exploit their access to government resources to provide themselves with an electoral advantage. These findings again highlight the importance of incorporating interstate heterogeneity into analyses of the incumbency advantage."
"55","Two potential areas in which our research into the components of the incumbency advantage could be extended include (1) estimating the relative importance of different types of office‐holding benefits (e.g., campaign contributions); and (2) examining the interaction between office‐holder benefits and candidate quality.45 We hope to pursue these topics in future research.         "
