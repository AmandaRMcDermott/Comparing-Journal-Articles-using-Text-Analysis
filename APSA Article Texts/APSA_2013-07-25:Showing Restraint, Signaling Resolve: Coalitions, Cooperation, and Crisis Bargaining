"1","The majority of work on signaling focuses on dyadic interactions (see, e.g., Fearon 1997; Schultz 1998; Slantchev 2005), and while most interstate disputes are bilateral, they often occur in the shadow of third‐party involvement (Smith 1998; Werner 2000). Further, coalitions have played a prominent role in a number of recent high‐profile conflicts, including two wars against Iraq in 1991 and 2003, the 1999 Kosovo War, and NATO's 2011 intervention in Libya. In fact, since 1946, roughly 25% of all interstate crises have involved multiple states on at least one side before the crisis escalated to war (Wilkenfeld and Brecher 2010), whereas 40% of interstate wars are multilateral (Sarkees and Wayman 2010). Building coalitions can increase military capabilities or reduce the costs of war, both of which improve military prospects against target states, but as the cases of Berlin and Kosovo suggest, coalition partners often disagree over what threats to make, what signals to send, and generally how to bargain with their adversaries.         "
"2","Snyder argues that bargaining between coalition members and between a coalition and its adversary “are virtually opposite sides of a coin, and they interact closely” (1997, 192). Strategies in one venue are likely to affect strategies in the other, yet the extant literature offers few clues about the consequences of this interdependence for crisis signaling. Some analysts suggest that the challenges of signaling resolve are magnified when states must consider the divergent interests of their partners (e.g., Christensen 2011; Lake 2010/2011), yet the literature on deterrent alliances suggests that the presence of multiple actors can make for more credible threats of war (Leeds 2003; Morrow 1994, 2000). How are we to reconcile the claim that more actors exacerbate information problems with the more sanguine picture painted by alliance scholarship? Might both be true, depending on features of the crisis and intracoalitional politics?         "
"3","To answer these questions, I focus on a specific form of international cooperation: the military coalition. I define a coalition as a group of states that makes a joint threat of military action in a specific crisis. Members may contribute combat forces, as well as staging or transit rights, each of which can improve the coalition's military prospects. Coalitions may emerge informally, from cooperation on the basis of common short‐term interests, or formally via the invocation of prior alliance commitments. However, while some coalitions do form to honor alliance commitments, many involve nonallied states or allies cooperating outside the terms of their treaties, such as the American‐led wars against Iraq and NATO's 2011 intervention in Libya. Thus, while alliance commitments constitute promises to act as coalitions, they are neither necessary nor sufficient for the observation of a coalition in a given crisis. Put differently, the process of alliance formation involves the design of an incomplete contract over future coalition formation, but coalition formation entails joining a crisis once general deterrence has broken down, whether or not states are obligated by treaty to do so.         "
"4","Their origins notwithstanding, all coalitions must make crisis‐specific decisions about threats, bargaining postures, aims, and military cooperation, and it is these choices with which the present theory is concerned. Thus, a coalition's critical features—those that distinguish it from a state acting alone—are that its members must (1) coordinate over their threats and bargaining strategies, particularly mobilization levels, and (2) cooperate militarily in carrying out their threats, both of which should have some impact on the process of crisis bargaining between a coalition and its target."
"5","What are the consequences of leaving coalition partners out of signaling models? In models with private information, peaceful outcomes often rest on a resolute type's ability to distinguish itself from an irresolute type with a costly signal, given an irresolute type's incentive to bluff (see Jervis 1970). Resolute types may tie their hands or sink costs (Fearon 1997), as well as make military moves that do both (Slantchev 2005), but regardless of the policy instrument, the logic of signaling remains the same: a resolute type must pay some price that an irresolute type is unwilling to pay, influencing its opponent's estimate of its resolve such that the opponent offers acceptable terms. Otherwise, the opponent may run a risk of war, offering harsh terms if it is optimistic enough that the state in question truly is irresolute.         "
"6","However, signals sent in crises can be relevant not only to one's opponent but also to third parties, particularly coalition partners. For example, Fearon conjectures that the failure of some signals to convey resolve is less important “than the effect achieved on various other audiences” (1997, 84), whereas Russett argues more explicitly that “pressures from the ‘attacker's' own allies” (1963, 102 fn. 8) affected escalatory behavior in Cold War–era crises over the Bay of Pigs and the Suez Canal.1 American decision makers faced just such a dilemma during the Berlin Crisis of 1961–62, when they debated the merits of a strategy that would send ground forces across the inter‐German border as a signal of resolve (Freedman 2000, 62–63, 66–67) and an alternative built around both (1) a smaller, delayed mobilization and (2) public signals of a willingness to negotiate (Aono 2010, 326, 334). Concerned with the reaction of allies nervous about the costs of a potential war over the status of Germany, the United States opted for the latter strategy, despite the risk that it might fail to demonstrate resolve.2"
"7","Coalition partners may have divergent preferences over mobilization levels because a variety of factors, from geography to resource constraints to domestic politics, cause the perceived costs of war to fall unevenly across its participants. For example, in the early phases of NATO's attempt to stop Serb ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, the Americans and British favored strong escalatory steps in the form of legally binding mobilization and the forward deployment of aircraft, yet they faced objections from other member states worried over selling a costly ground war to their constituents, externalities from proximity to the war zone, or both (see Clark 2001, chap. 6–7). In fact, of the states that contributed most to Operation Allied Force, public opposition to the possibility of a NATO‐led war was greatest in the two countries nearest the Balkans: Germany and Italy (Auerswald 2004, 640–41). As such, escalatory steps and public threats were dialed back, because American decision makers viewed these disagreements as potentially threatening to military cooperation in the event of war, as well as the future of the alliance (Auerswald 2004; Clark 2001). More generally, coalition partners may differ in their preferred levels of mobilization due to domestic constraints, exposure to the physical costs of war, or even their relative valuation of the issues at stake. As a result, they are likely to disagree over signaling and mobilization strategies, creating for coalition leaders a trade‐off between substantial mobilizations and the cooperation of their most cost‐sensitive potential partners.         "
"8","These examples suggest that two factors should be important for a theory of coalitional signaling: (1) divergent preferences over mobilization strategies and (2) a partner's ability to refuse military cooperation in the event of war. This creates an interaction between intracoalitional politics and the choice of signal, which may also affect the emergence of coalitions in the first place, since their formation depends on the choices of both leader and partner. When partners cannot commit to wars they find too costly, and when targets cannot commit not to risk war when their uncertainty remains unresolved, coalition leaders face a trade‐off in which solving one problem may exacerbate the other. Nonetheless, while heterogeneity within coalitions and the challenges of military cooperation play prominent roles in theories of extended deterrence and alliance formation (e.g., Morrow 1994, 2000; Smith 1995), they remain absent from most models of signaling. I specify a model below designed to bridge these literatures.         "
"9","Suppose that two states, a leader (L) and target (T), are engaged in a dispute, in which L may act with a partner (P) to bolster its military prospects.3 However, P may differ from L in its assessment of the costs of war or the stakes of the crisis. For its part, the target begins the game unsure of the leader's valuation of the stakes, or resolve, rendering it uncertain over just how little it can concede and still avoid war. The leader has the opportunity to make a military threat, such as mobilization, that is costly but also improves its military prospects. Should bargaining break down in war, L's potential partner then chooses whether or not to participate in the conflict, creating for L a possible trade‐off: mobilization may demonstrate resolve, but if it also threatens to make cooperation unattractive for P, solving the target's information problem may come with the added cost of creating a commitment problem for the partner. Thus, the leader's mobilization decision has implications for both signaling and coalition building.            "
"10","As shown in Figure 1, the game begins as Nature chooses L's valuation of the issue under dispute, , such that it is resolute () with probability ϕ and irresolute () with probability , where . Nature reveals L's type only to L and P, though T knows the distribution from which it is drawn; thus, T's prior belief that the leader is resolute is ϕ. P's and T's common knowledge valuations are  and , respectively. Note that P shares L's most preferred outcome, i.e., full concessions from the target, but P may care either less () or weakly more () about the stakes of the dispute. P also receives a payoff for the final distribution of the benefits regardless of whether it participates in a war. Thus, P has preferences over the issue, such as ethnic cleansing in Kosovo in the prior example, which a number of European states wished to see end regardless of whether they contributed to the military effort to compel the withdrawal of Serbian forces.            "
"11","Next, L chooses a costly level of military mobilization, . In the restricted version of the model analyzed here, only two mobilization options exist, high () and low () where . These levels correspond to each type's optimal mobilization,  for  and  for , given the military endowments and strategies of the other players. I do this to simplify the analysis, trading a set of richer mobilization options for a more detailed treatment of bargaining dynamics.4 Mobilization affects the leader's payoffs in two ways. First, it sinks costs up front, such that L pays  directly. Second, it contributes to the leader's probability of military victory by increasing its share of the total level of armaments. In bilateral and coalitional wars, respectively, L wins with probability               "
"12","Therefore, the leader's expected utility for the game if it ends in a coalitional war is               "
"13","After observing L's mobilization level, or the size of its threat, the target then proposes a share of the stakes, , to yield, and  to keep for itself.5 If L accepts, then the game ends with T keeping , L receiving  (the terms of settlement less mobilization costs), and P receiving .6 Should L reject T's proposal, a war ensues in which P chooses whether or not to participate. If P cooperates, it fights alongside L, and if it defects, L fights the target alone in a bilateral war. This can be thought of as a coalition either forming or failing to form, ensuring that equilibrium coalitions are in the interest of both leader and partner to build; since strategies are commonly known, whether a coalition forms or not will be known by all players as soon as L chooses a mobilization level, allowing us to view L's mobilization choice as both a military threat and a decision over whether to form a coalition.            "
"14","If P cooperates to produce a coalitional war, the leader's payoffs are as defined in equation 1, while the target and partner receive               "
"15","If P defects, leaving L to fight T in a bilateral war, the belligerents' payoffs are as given above but for the absence of  in the total level of armaments. For its part, P gets               "
"16","Finally, note that other signaling models involving multiple players generally identify conditions under which third parties discourage bluffing. In Smith's (1998) model, leaders wish to signal competence to both international enemies and their domestic constituencies, with the result that only “low” types, or incompetent leaders, make empty threats during crises. Similarly, Schultz (1998) shows that a domestic opposition can also discourage bluffing and enhance the credibility of threats. However, in neither case can the leader's second audience affect its military prospects, nor does the audience have preferences over the material content of the signal, as P does here. I show in the following section that, while P can indeed discourage irresolute or “low” types from bluffing, the material consequences of military threats as signals can also encourage resolute types to mask their resolve despite bilateral incentives to reveal it.            "
"17","How does the threat of losing military cooperation affect signaling behavior in crises? I begin this section with a brief characterization of equilibria in a version of the game without P to show that the underlying model produces typical signaling dynamics: (1) peaceful separating equilibria and (2) potentially violent semiseparating equilibria in which irresolute types probabilistically bluff by choosing high levels of mobilization. This establishes a baseline case against which to compare equilibria involving the potential partner.8"
"18","Next, I analyze the full three‐player model by drawing a contrast between two sets of conditions. First, I discuss equilibria with a committed partner, or one that cooperates in a war regardless of L's mobilization decision. Then, I consider the case in which P cooperates only if L chooses low mobilization—that is, P is skittish—which means that L must forfeit a coalition if it mobilizes enough to reveal its type to the target. While a committed partner produces equilibria isomorphic to the two‐player case, two differences emerge in the model with a skittish partner. First, separating and semiseparating equilibria both exist, though separating equilibria are more common when the target is strong. Second, when the target is weaker, there exists a pooling equilibrium unique to the skittish case in which both types of L choose low mobilization, preserving both cooperation and the target's uncertainty, which entails a risk of war.         "
"19","I assume throughout that the target's prior beliefs over L's resolve are sufficiently optimistic that, in the absence of any information revelation, it is willing to risk war. This serves two purposes. First, if war is to occur or be averted, the target must be willing ex ante to risk it; if its priors do not support risking war in the first place, then all equilibria are peaceful by default. Second, any peaceful equilibria that do exist will derive from L's ability to credibly signal its type, rather than some characteristic of the target unrelated to intracoalitional politics.         "
"20","The two‐player version of the game has two equilibria. First, in the separating equilibrium, player‐types choose unique mobilization levels, high if resolute and low if irresolute, that reveal their types and facilitate peaceful settlement. Second, in the semiseparating equilibrium, the resolute type chooses high mobilization, but the irresolute type probabilistically bluffs with high mobilization, hoping to convince the target to offer better terms. As a result, T only partially updates its beliefs, which tempts it to probabilistically risk war in response.               "
"21","Proposition 1. ([ (Two Players)])In the two‐player game, the following sets of strategies are each part of a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium:                     "
"22","See appendix for proof."
"23","In the separating equilibrium, each type of L chooses a unique mobilization level that balances its upfront costs against improved military prospects. Since resolute and irresolute types value the outcome differently, they choose unique levels of mobilization from which neither type would wish to deviate, given T's anticipated response. As a result, T believes L to be resolute only if it mobilizes at the resolute type's optimum,  (high), and irresolute at the irresolute type's optimum,  (low). After observing L's mobilization, which perfectly separates types, T proposes terms that reflect its beliefs, and the game ends peacefully. In other words, L uses mobilization to solve the target's information problem, revealing its private information and ensuring that T can make an acceptable proposal.            "
"24","Proposition 1 states that the separating equilibrium exists when the target is sufficiently powerful, or , while the semiseparating equilibrium exists when T is weaker. When T is strong (), L must mobilize so much to offset the target's strength that the irresolute type finds the costs of bluffing—i.e., high mobilization—too expensive.9 Rather than pay the costs of high mobilization to receive a better deal, the irresolute type is content to reveal itself as such through low mobilization, which is less expensive. However, when the target is weaker, the difference between low and high mobilization levels is smaller, and the irresolute L finds the cost of bluffing more tolerable.            "
"25","In the semiseparating equilibrium that exists when the target is weaker (), bluffing is not prohibitively expensive, encouraging the irresolute L to misrepresent its type. While the resolute type chooses high mobilization, the irresolute type randomizes between low and high mobilization, occasionally bluffing in order to persuade T to offer better terms. This prevents T from updating its beliefs fully over L's type if it observes high mobilization, and its own mixing strategy dictates that it respond by occasionally making a proposal that will be rejected. Specifically, it sometimes makes a proposal that the irresolute type accepts but that the resolute type rejects, leading to war. Thus, in the semiseparating equilibrium, the irresolute type's incentive to misrepresent its resolve generates a risk of war, because it cannot be deterred from mimicking the resolute type, as it is in the separating equilibrium.            "
"26","The two‐player model reproduces the standard story of signaling and crisis bargaining: when a resolute type can take an action too costly for an irresolute type to mimic, peace is possible through costly signaling. When bluffing is less expensive, an irresolute type may bluff, behaving in such a way as to preserve the target's uncertainty and generate a risk of war. However, the Berlin and Kosovo cases described above involve not irresolute types trying to appear resolute, but potentially resolute states taking steps that would not demonstrate resolve, limiting mobilization because of what appears to be divergent preferences within a coalition.            "
"27","I show in this section that introducing a potential partner into the game can either increase or decrease the probability of war, depending on the partner's preferences and the target's military strength. I frame the discussion around P's choice over cooperating or defecting should the crisis break down in war, particularly the conditions under which it either cooperates regardless of L's mobilization decision (committed) or cooperates only if the leader chooses low mobilization (skittish). Giving P this commitment problem and letting L anticipate it ensures that only those coalitions that both players find attractive form in equilibrium. Thus, comparisons across two‐ and three‐player games are not made based on coalitions that neither player would have an interest in forming, meaning that L's mobilization decision can also be understood as an endogenous choice over coalition‐building or unilateral action.            "
"28","Faced with the choice of fighting alongside L or defecting in the final move, P plays one of three strategies: (1) cooperating regardless of L's mobilization choice, (2) cooperating only in the event of low mobilization, or (3) defecting regardless of mobilization levels. Since coalitions never form in the last case, I focus on the first two, where coalitions can—but may not—form in equilibrium. In the case of a committed partner, described in Proposition 2, P's costs for war are sufficiently low, or , that it cooperates regardless of L's mobilization decision.               "
"29","Proposition 2. ([ (Three Players, Committed Partner)])When P is committed, or , the following sets of strategies are each part of a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium:                     "
"30","See appendix for proof."
"31","When P is committed, it cannot credibly threaten to defect in the event of war even if L chooses high mobilization. Therefore, even though it prefers low mobilization to high, all else equal, P imposes no constraints on L's incentives to bluff or to reveal its type through high mobilization. As a result, the same two equilibria—separating and semiseparating—exist in the case of a committed partner as they do in the two‐player case. In fact, since L can economize on mobilization costs thanks to P's unconditional support, its mobilization levels take its improved military prospects into account, with the result that the same cutpoint, , divides separating from semiseparating equilibria in this case. Thus, coalitions built around unconditional promises of cooperation should be just as prone to probabilistic bluffing and war as states that do not take on coalition partners, because P lacks a credible threat of defection.            "
"32","On the other hand, when P is skittish, it conditions its cooperation on L's mobilization choice, cooperating if  (low mobilization) and defecting if  (high mobilization). In this case, the partner can credibly promise to fight alongside the leader only if L chooses low mobilization, because high mobilization imposes intolerably high political or material costs. P follows this strategy when , or when it is neither too sensitive nor too insensitive to the costs of war. Put differently, high mobilization entails costs too large for P to justify cooperation; instead, it defects and saves the costs of war. On the other hand, low mobilization is less costly, rendering cooperation in a coalitional war tolerable.10 Thus, in contrast to the case of a committed partner, a skittish P may be able to use its threat of defection to moderate L's bargaining position—a possible hedge against problems of moral hazard (Snyder 1997)—but as I show next, restraining L in this fashion can have unexpected consequences for the probability of war.            "
"33","When P conditions its cooperation on mobilization levels, L faces a stark trade‐off. In the absence of a skittish partner, high mobilization carries only the direct costs of mobilizing, but a skittish partner introduces an indirect cost: a shift in the military balance resulting from P's refusal to cooperate. Thus, high mobilization may demonstrate resolve, but it also fractures the coalition if bargaining breaks down in war, such that L can credibly threaten only to fight alone. High mobilization, then, amounts to an explicit choice to act unilaterally. Low mobilization, on the other hand, ensures P's cooperation as part of a potential coalitional war but fails to convince the target of L's resolve, tempting T to risk war with its proposal. How does L manage this tension? As it does in the first two cases, the answer turns on the strength of the target and what that means for the costs of credible signaling.               "
"34","Proposition 3. ([ (Three Players, Skittish Partner)])When P is skittish, or , the following sets of strategies are each part of a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium:                     "
"35","See appendix for proof."
"36","While both separating and semiseparating equilibria exist, as they do in the two‐player and committed‐partner cases, a new equilibrium is unique to the skittish partner case: a pooling equilibrium in which both types of L choose low mobilization. In other words, the resolute type mimics the irresolute type. Low mobilization ensures the skittish P's cooperation in the event of war, but the weak threat required to build the coalition also prevents the resolute L from revealing its type, and the target's information problem remains unsolved. L's threat does not alter the target's beliefs, and when T is sufficiently optimistic that L is irresolute, it balances the risk of war against a miserly proposal that only the irresolute type will accept. Thus, the desire to preserve military cooperation leads the resolute L to engage in behavior that generates a risk of war—that is, refusing to reveal its private information.            "
"37","How do these equilibria compare to those of the two‐player and committed‐partner cases? Figure 2 plots the equilibrium spaces, on identical scales, for each case as a function of the leader's costs for war, , and the target's military strength, . For the two‐player and committed‐partner cases, in the left panel, a single threshold value, , divides separating and semiseparating equilibria, and the risk of war is indicated by the shaded area under the curve. For the three‐player game with a skittish partner, in the right panel, a similar threshold, , divides separating from semiseparating equilibria. However, it falls far to the right, and the separating equilibrium exists over a wider range of the parameter space than it does at left—but only as long as the target is sufficiently powerful, or . Thus, the presence of a skittish partner with a strategy of conditional cooperation can reduce the probability of war by discouraging the irresolute type from bluffing—that is, by restricting the conditions under which risky semiseparating equilibria exist. In the separating equilibrium, the threat of losing P's military support outweighs the benefits of bluffing, and the irresolute type is happy to reveal itself as such when P cooperates in return.            "
"38","Judging the true level of American resolve in the Berlin Crisis of 1961 is difficult, but given the strength of its adversary—the Soviet Union—and its desire to keep NATO intact, the separating equilibrium appears consistent with the decision to limit mobilization. After considering a strategy that might have risked war through a potential high‐mobilization bluff, the United States seems to have settled on honestly revealing a lower level of resolve. Dean Acheson, for example, advocated sending a battalion‐level contingent of ground forces across the intra‐German border as a show of resolve (Freedman 2000, 62–63, 66–67). However, fears of fracturing the alliance by threatening a war deemed too costly by other members led to a more modest “double‐barreled” strategy combining limited mobilization with signals of a willingness to negotiate (Aono 2010, 326, 334). Notably, while skittish partners moderated its threats, more committed partners could have tempted an irresolute United States to choose high mobilization as part of a bluffing strategy that would have generated a risk of war.            "
"39","While the need to ensure a skittish partner's cooperation can discourage risky bluffing, it also enables resolute leaders to use unilateral action to credibly signal their type. In the two‐player game, or in the presence of a committed partner, the resolute type is unable to separate itself when ; however, semiseparating equilibria in which the irresolute type bluffs occupy a much smaller part of the parameter space when P is skittish—i.e., where . This is unsurprising, as bluffing is doubly costly when L must include P in its calculations; not only must the irresolute type mobilize more than it wishes, but it must also forego the added capabilities of a coalition partner. For its part, the resolute leader is happy to forego coalition building in order to mobilize at its optimal level, reveal its type, and receive a favorable bargain at no risk of war. Thus, for resolute types to form coalitions with skittish partners, they must be willing to tolerate low mobilizations, which is easiest when low‐ and high‐mobilization levels are not too different—that is, when the target is relatively weak.            "
"40","As shown in Figure 2, the increased prevalence of separating, and therefore peaceful, equilibria occurs only against relatively strong targets. When the target is relatively weak, on the other hand, or , both types pool on low mobilization, preserving the target's uncertainty and generating a risk of war that would not otherwise exist were types to separate. Specifically, the resolute type economizes on mobilization against a weak target, preserving cooperation and bringing P's capabilities to bear against the target, even when doing so tempts T to make a risky proposal that the resolute type is sure to reject.11 Thus, the resolute type opts for a coalitional war rather than high mobilization and a unilateral threat. Notably, the possibility of war emerges from P's sincere desire to restrain L's bargaining position, perhaps hoping to protect itself against problems of moral hazard that emerge for committed partners, but the consequence of moderating L's bargaining posture can have the tragic effect of raising the chances of war. Finally, the requirement that the partner not be too powerful, or , shows that a potential partner's effect on the probability of war is conditional not only on its own preferences but also on the military strength of the target.            "
"41","The logic supporting the pooling equilibrium is consistent with the notion that coalition partners can dilute or weaken a coalition's threats; in fact, coalitions only form with skittish partners around the less serious threats implied by low mobilization. It may also provide a plausible account of the limited scope of NATO's threats leading up to the 1999 Kosovo War. In particular, NATO opted not to deploy ground forces near Kosovo in the early stages of its attempts to coerce the Serbian government, instead dispatching naval and air forces to the area and threatening an air campaign rather than what would almost certainly be a costlier—and far less popular—ground invasion. Serbia's relative military weakness probably also made the decision to pool on lower escalation more palatable, as predicted by Proposition 3, lending some plausibility to the notion that the effect of skittish partners is conditional on characteristics of the target as well as coalition members themselves. Papayoanou (1997) also notes that moderation can explain NATO's Bosnia policy from 1991 to 1995, and the present model generalizes this insight by showing that the weakness of the target can facilitate both coalition formation and, by discouraging resolute states from revealing their type through high mobilization, the escalation of crises to war.            "
"42","If pooling equilibria exist when targets are relatively weak, then the relationship between skittish potential partners and the probability of war is a conditional one.               "
"43","Result 1.When the target is strong, skittish partners discourage war, but when the target is weaker, skittish partners encourage war.                  "
"44","Notably, extant accounts of the effect of coalition partners on the chances of successful coercion do not account for target characteristics (e.g., Bellamy 2000; Byman and Waxman 2002; Christensen 2011; Lake 2010/2011), focusing almost solely on divergent interests within coalitions. For example, Lake asserts that “multiple actors appear to magnify problems of asymmetric information and costly signaling” (2010/2011, 9), but Figure 2 shows that this need not be the case. In fact, the presence of a skittish partner that can threaten to withdraw military support if it will find the war too costly can mitigate signaling problems by discouraging bluffing, which would otherwise generate a risk of war. Thus, P's threat to withdraw cooperation can force a moderation of L's bargaining position, and when it makes bluffing unattractive, it facilitates peace.            "
"45","On the other hand, when the target is not too powerful, or , the presence of a partner does increase the chances of war, precisely because of P's credible threat to defect. P's desire to limit L's mobilization is successful, but it has the perverse effect of rendering this less costly war more likely to happen. Without a skittish partner, war does not occur against a weak target when , and it occurs probabilistically when . With a skittish partner and a weak target, however, war occurs where it otherwise would not above  (left of the left panel's curve), and T is sure to risk war below  (right of the left panel's curve). This suggests the following relationship between member preferences in coalitions that do form, target strength, and the probability of war.               "
"46","Result 2.Coalitions involving skittish partners are more likely to go to war against weaker targets than against strong targets.                  "
"47","Put differently, the moderating effects of skittish partners make war likelier against weaker targets than it is against stronger targets. Crises involving coalitions may thus escalate to war at more skewed distributions of power than bilateral crises, not because increasing relative power drives up their demands but because it encourages otherwise resolute types to economize on mobilization and mask their resolve. On the other hand, committed partners—those who cannot threaten to defect—should have little effect on the relationship between power and war, at least compared to states acting alone, because they are unable to play the same role in the signaling process as skittish partners."
"48","The model also sheds light on the conditions under which a skittish partner exercises the most downward pressure on mobilization. Both types of L choose low mobilization when , where               "
"49","Result 3.The more powerful a skittish partner, the more willing is the leader to send a weak signal that entails a risk of war.                  "
"50","While increasingly powerful skittish partners make resolute types more willing to mask their resolve, they also lower the threshold below which irresolute types probabilistically bluff, , as part of the semiseparating equilibrium. Thus, while increasing partner strength makes one particular path to war—pooling on low mobilization—more likely, its total effect on the probability of war is ambiguous.            "
"51","Skittish coalition partners pose a unique challenge to states trying to use mobilization to solve a target's information problem, because they create a commitment problem within the coalition. Against powerful targets, irresolute types prioritize maintaining cooperation, avoiding bluffing and minimizing the risk of war. However, against weaker targets, resolute states mask their resolve, mobilizing too little to send a credible signal, ensuring a partner's cooperation at the cost of creating a risk of war. Thus, the effect of weak threats around which some coalitions form depends on why threats are weak—because they derive from discouraged bluffing or because a resolute leader ensures military cooperation by masking its type.            "
"52","As discussed above, my definition of coalition includes both informal (ad hoc) and formal (allied) manifestations. While the preceding analysis focuses on their common features, alliances and ad hoc coalitions also exhibit notable differences. In particular, the costs of defection, of P refusing to fight alongside L, may be higher when coalitions are mandated to form by standing alliance commitments (Morrow 1994, 2000). How might increased costs of defection change the above results, and how might formal coalitions differ from informal coalitions?         "
"53","If alliances are more costly to violate than informal, ad hoc commitments, then they should reduce the incidence of skittishness among potential partners, rendering them less likely to defect in the face of undesirably high mobilization. Suppose, for example, that P's payoff for defection once the crisis escalates to war includes an additional cost of violating the alliance, , which may come in the form of damage to its ability to form future alliances (see, e.g., Gibler 2008). For some generic level of mobilization , P cooperates when            "
"54","While alliances succeed at general deterrence by enhancing the credibility of their members' threats to fight together (Leeds 2003), problems of moral hazard and entrapment may be worse when commitments to form coalitions are formalized (Snyder 1997). However, there is no direct relationship between the formality commitments and peaceful or violent outcomes; whether P's ability to restrain L raises or lowers the probability of war, relative to a case in which defection is not credible, depends again on the strength of the target. Nonetheless, alliances vary widely in their terms, and it is possible that other provisions, apart from the costs of defection, can more successfully induce restraint. Therefore, while the general relationship between divergent member preferences and the strength of the target is likely to emerge in both formal and informal coalitions, the conditions under which alliance commitments can mitigate or exacerbate them are an important avenue for future research.         "
"55","Coalitions are ubiquitous in international relations, and multilateral processes of signaling, bargaining, and crisis management have played a prominent role in several recent conflicts, from the 1991 Gulf War to the Kosovo War in 1999 to the Iraq War of 2003. Other disputes that may yet escalate to war—from Iranian nuclear ambitions to tensions on the Korean peninsula—also involve multiple states attempting to coerce a common target. The model above illuminates the strategic linkages between intracoalitional politics, particularly the maintenance of military cooperation, and the choice of threats in crisis bargaining. It shows that divergent evaluations of the costs of war inside coalitions can play a surprising role in the course of interstate crises, especially compared to theories of military cooperation that focus chiefly on capability aggregation. When a potential partner can threaten to deny military cooperation over the leader's mobilization decisions, the leader must choose between signaling resolve and ensuring military cooperation, and how it solves this trade‐off depends on the military strength of the target. In equilibrium, skittish partners can restrain a coalition leader's bargaining posture by threatening to withdraw cooperation, but the result can be either peace, if it deters bluffing, or war, if it discourages otherwise resolute states from signaling their resolve."
"56","The analysis began by identifying two salient elements of intracoalitional politics: (1) divergent sensitivities to the costs of war within the coalition and (2) the possibility that partners might refuse military cooperation. Building these features into a model of coalitional threats, signaling, and crisis bargaining accounts for behavior in such crises, generates additional implications over the occurrence of war, and identifies the conditions under which skittish partners have the greatest effect. It shows that scholars should be careful when studying coalitional coercion not to assume that all “weak” threats are created equal, nor should they limit their focus too strictly to intracoalitional politics. In particular, the effect of a skittish coalition partner on the probability of war depends not only on the multilateral distribution of war costs but also on the military strength of the target, a critical factor omitted from most extant work on the topic of coalitions and war. Indeed, an assessment of how divergent interests within the coalition affect the occurrence of war that does not consider the role of the target may suffer from omitted variable bias, as would dyadic accounts of signaling that fail to consider the role of potential coalition partners. Thus, modeling the role of partners in crisis bargaining does more than just explain more of the variance; it alters our expectations about how intracoalitional dynamics, interacting with the distribution of military power, affect the escalation of crises to war.         "
"57","Finally, the model provides a substantive example of the crucial and often overlooked second element of one of Fearon's (1995) rationalist explanations for war: (1) private information with (2) incentives to misrepresent it. Absent a reason to dissemble, bargains are easy to reach as long as players are patient (Leventoğlu and Tarar 2008), and explaining observed conflicts in terms of this mechanism requires an account of why belligerents are unwilling or unable to share the private information that might avert war. Notably, other incentives to misrepresent, be they secrecy about military strength (Meirowitz and Sartori 2008), demonstrating competence (Smith 1998), or bolstering a reputation for resolve (Sechser 2010; Wolford 2007), manifest as irresolute types mimicking resolute types. However, the story presented here involves a resolute state choosing not to reveal itself as such, even when the dyadic characteristics of the crisis—the typical focus of theoretical and empirical research—are conducive to credible signaling. This both indicates the potential of coalition‐specific avenues for understanding the causes of war and suggests challenging policy questions over the trade‐off between building foreign policy coalitions and managing threats and signals in crises with one's adversaries.
