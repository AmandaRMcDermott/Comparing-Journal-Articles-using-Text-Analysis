"1","Political scientists have long been interested in the backgrounds and qualifications of political appointees (see, e.g., Cohen, 1988; Fisher 1987; Krause and O'Connell 2012b; Mann 1964; McMahon and Millet 1939; National Academy of Public Administration 1985; Stanly, Mann, and Doig 1967). Foundational works have described the different factors that presidents consider when making personnel decisions, such as ideology, loyalty to the president, competence, political connections, congressional acceptability, and work for the party, among other factors (Cohen 1988; Fenno 1959; Heclo 1977; Mackenzie 1981; Mann 1964). More recent scholarship emphasizes the importance of loyalty to the president and competence in personnel selection (Edwards 2001; Moe 1985; Weko 1995). Additionally, agencies vary in their views about policy and their willingness to follow presidential direction (Aberbach et al. 1981; Aberbach and Rockman 1976, 1995, 2000; Bertelli and Grose 2009; Clinton and Lewis 2008; Clinton et al. 2012; Maranto 1993). Where an agency's main policy goals need to be changed because they are at odds with the president's goals, presidents select appointees with a similar ideology, or loyalty, and substantial political and managerial skills, particularly those that are key to implementing policies on the president's agenda (Bertelli and Feldmann 2007; Krause and O'Connell 2012a; Lewis 2008; Parsneau 2013).4"
"2","Presidents also distribute federal jobs in exchange for electoral or political support (see, e.g., Fish 1902; Friedrich 1937; Kaufman 1965; Van Riper 1958; White 1948, 1954; Wilson 1887). Appointments are an important political resource that presidents use in working with parties, interest groups, and Congress (Heclo 1977; Mackenzie 1981; Tolchin and Tolchin 1971, 2010; Weko 1995). For a president short on formal constitutional power, the ability to give and withhold jobs is an important source of leverage in the political system. Federal patronage can help unite party factions and induce political support from key groups (Bearfield 2009; Key 1964). Members of Congress also ask for, and receive, appointments for their staff and constituents (Mackenzie 1981; Rottinghaus and Bergan 2011). Presidents who use appointments wisely find it easier to build legislative support for themselves and their programs.         "
"3","While scholars have made significant progress describing the backgrounds of federal executives and the different factors that presidents take into account in the personnel selection process, we know less about how presidents make decisions about where to place appointees with different background characteristics. Presidents would prefer that all appointees be loyal, be competent, and satisfy key political considerations, but the pool of available appointees rarely satisfies all three considerations; thus, they may be forced to make trade‐offs (Hollibaugh (forthcoming); Parsneau 2013). However, the question of which types of agencies receive appointees selected for particular qualities is unsettled within the literature. For example, Lewis (2008, 2009) and Lewis and Waterman (2013) argue informally that presidents are more likely to place appointees selected for electoral or political reasons in agencies that share the president's policy views, are low on the president's agenda, and to positions that have little influence on policy outputs. Conversely, Parsneau (2013) argues that high‐priority departments and agencies receive more appointees selected for loyalty and other political reasons—and fewer selected for demonstrated agency experience—due to presidential desires for responsiveness and distrust of experienced bureaucrats. Given the uncertainty over which types of appointees are placed in different types of agencies, and the different explanations of the interplay between loyalty, competence, and patronage considerations that this implies, an important next step is to provide a theory explaining which agencies and positions get appointees selected for political considerations and which agencies get appointees selected for loyalty or expertise. In the next section, we do just this.         "
"4","Modern presidents share a common outlook based upon their constitutional and political position. Starting from this assumption, we present a theory of the appointments process based on a model that formalizes the trade‐offs presidents make in personnel selection.5 Here, because of space constraints, we present only a stylized version of the model and its intuition; those interested in a more formal treatment of the model and its solutions should consult the appendix.         "
"5","The executive appointment model consists of two players—the Executive and the Agency. Both players are assumed to have quadratic preferences over policy outcomes on a single dimension. We assume that decisions are delegated to agencies because of agencies’ superior information and expertise regarding policy decisions and consequences. Formally, the outcome of agency decision making is , where  is the policy chosen by the agency and —where —represents factors unobserved when statutes are written and agency staffers are chosen, but observed by the agency before policy implementation. Similar to the model of Huber and McCarty (2004), Ω corresponds to the benefits of agency expertise in a particular policy area. However, in contrast to previous models, and to account for the possibility that different types of appointees may have differing levels of expertise, we relax the assumption that agencies can discern the true value of ω without error. Rather, an arbitrary agency observes ω with positive probability.         "
"6","Next, in order to analyze the conditions that might prompt an executive to prioritize non‐policy factors in personnel selection, we assume executives face the choice of which type of appointment to make; in particular, executives can choose to make a professional or patronage appointment, or no appointment at all. Professional appointees and patronage appointees have distinct backgrounds; these background characteristics determine the structure of the executive's utility functions.6"
"7","We assume professional appointees are highly skilled and make the simplifying assumption that they are always able to observe the state of the world without error. However, for any given agency, the pool of patronage appointees who are competent is assumed to be less deep and more heterogeneous than the pool of professional appointees. Lower competence among patronage appointees can result from many sources, including the fact that patronage appointees tend to have less experience in the agencies to which they are appointed, less subject area experience, and less public management experience in general (Cohen 1998; Heclo 1975, 1977; Lewis 2007). Thus, we assume patronage appointees are no more competent than professional appointees, with the exact levels of competence determined by Nature prior to any appointment. Importantly, this assumption does not presume the incompetence of any particular patronage appointee. Rather, it simply captures the increased variation and higher potential for incompetence within the pool of potential appointees who are considered for appointments because of electoral or political work or connections (i.e., they provide non‐policy benefits equal to or greater than professional appointees).         "
"8","Next, we account for the fact that certain agencies may be higher or lower priorities on the executive's agenda. When agencies and their policies are low on the executive's agenda, agency policy is unlikely to exert much influence in the executive's decision‐making process. To account for these variations in executive priorities, we weigh the executive's utility function by a positive salience term that captures the relative weight the executive places on a particular policy area. For example, the president may care substantially more about policy outcomes in the Department of Defense than in the Federal Maritime Commission because policy outcomes in the former will have greater potential national and electoral consequences than the latter."
"9","We further assume the agency's post‐appointment ideal point is a convex combination of the status quo and the ideal point of the new appointee, as individual positions differ in their abilities to influence overall agency outputs. This assumption recognizes that some appointed positions, such as cabinet secretaries, have more influence over agency policy outputs than others, such as assistant secretaries for management, or Schedule C positions."
"10","Finally, to reflect the fact that presidents name some appointees for electoral or political reasons, we allow for non‐policy patronage benefits.7 Thus, if a patronage appointment is made, we assume the executive derives some additional non‐policy benefit from doing so.         "
"11","As the informed player moves last, we employ the sequential equilibrium solution concept and solve the game via backwards induction (Kreps and Wilson 1982). After Nature draws ω, the executive can choose which type of appointment to make, if one is to be made at all.8 Appointees induce an ex post agency ideal point and an ex post level of agency competence, both of which are described above. If no appointment is made, then the status quo agency stays in effect. Following executive action (or inaction), the agency observes ω with positive probability and sets a policy p, which it chooses to maximize its utility. Payoffs are then allocated to both players.         "
"12","One of the virtues of the model described above is that it simplifies a choice executives must make between ideology, competence, and the non‐policy political benefits that are connected to appointments. The model produces a number of testable hypotheses, many of which—such as those concerning the role of appointee ideology—are outside the scope of this article.9 Instead, we focus here on those predictions concerning different archetypes of appointees—professional types and patronage types—and for which non‐policy benefits are most likely to be key factors in appointments. By patronage appointees, we mean persons selected primarily because of the non‐policy (e.g., political) benefits their appointments provide. For simplicity, in the model and predictions we define these patronage appointees as having no fewer non‐policy benefits and no more expertise than professional appointees. In other words, persons selected primarily for the political benefits their appointment provides will be less competent on average than appointees selected primarily on the basis of their competence. We do this because it comports with reality (see below) and because it emphasizes the trade‐offs presidents make when choosing appointees with different configurations of characteristics (i.e., ideology, expertise, non‐policy benefits). In the empirical section to follow, however, we make no assumptions about whether persons selected for non‐policy benefits have lower or higher levels of expertise. Additionally, given our focus on a particular type of executive—presidents—we couch our predictions in terms of presidents and federal agencies.         "
"13","One result suggests that patronage appointments should be less likely in agencies where expertise requirements are high (or, conversely, patronage appointments should be more common in agencies where expertise requirements are low), which motivates our first hypothesis, derived from Proposition 1 and Corollary 1 in the appendix:            "
"14","Additionally, the model suggests that if professional appointees are minimally loyal (i.e., they will pursue a policy sufficiently close to the president's ideal, though not necessarily completely in line with the president's objectives), then professional appointees should be more likely (and patronage appointees less likely) to be placed in agencies that are sufficiently high priorities to the president. If presidents care about policy outcomes, they need appointees who can effectively deliver them with minimal error; competent appointees are better able to achieve this goal. Thus, another implication of the model—derived from Proposition 2 in the appendix—is the following:            "
"15","The model also suggests that if patronage appointees are sufficiently incompetent, they will be relegated to positions where they will have minimal effects on agency outcomes. Presidents often confront situations where appointees must be placed for political reasons, yet they have few skills to recommend them for the types of positions they merit. In such cases, executives try to place appointees in positions where they can have the least influence on agency outputs.10 This is formally stated as Proposition 4 in the appendix and is presented here as Hypothesis 3.            "
"16","A final result of the model—derived from Propositions 1, 3, and 4 in the appendix—is that executives are more likely to place patronage appointees in agencies whose existing policies are close to the president's ideal.11 If an agency's preferences are quite far from those of the executive, the executive is more likely to prefer a professional appointee in order to rein it in as much as possible.            "
"17","In total, our theory produces four clear predictions about the way that President Obama should staff his administration. The president will clearly have an interest in staffing his administration to ensure that agencies of the executive branch share his views on policy (although we do not evaluate here the model's predictions about the placement of appointees based upon their loyalty or ideology). The president will also select persons at least partly for non‐policy benefits. These “patronage” appointees may be equally competent to what we call “professional” appointees, but less certainly so. The question this theory answers is where such patronage appointees are most likely to be placed. The president should place patronage appointees in agencies where expertise requirements are low, in agencies off the agenda, in agencies where appointee actions are not reasonably connected to agency outputs, and in agencies that share his policy views."
"18","To evaluate the predictions above, we collected detailed background data on all political appointees named by President Obama during the first six months of his administration. The data include information about appointees’ education, work history, and policy expertise as well as campaign work or political experience.12 We collected data on 1,307 Obama administration appointees as of July 22, 2009, six months into the new administration. There were 370 Senate‐confirmed appointees (PAS), 380 non‐career assignments in the Senior Executive Service (NA), and 557 Schedule C appointees (SC). The bulk of the biographical information came from Federal Leadership Directories Online, the electronic version of the Federal Yellow Book.         "
"19","To measure variation in appointee competence, we coded background information for each appointee in the following areas: previous experience in the agency to which he or she was appointed, previous federal government experience, whether the appointee was an appointee in the Clinton or Bush administrations, subject area expertise deriving from work outside the agency to which he or she was appointed, and whether or not he or she possesses a PhD. To measure political factors in an appointee's background that are related to patronage, we coded each appointee on the following characteristics: work on the campaign and whether the appointee's most recent previous job was in politics as compared to work in another sector (Table 1 includes summary statistics). After collecting the individual‐level data, we aggregated the results by agency, keeping the agency‐level means as our dependent variables of interest.            "
"20","Our first expectation was that agencies with easier tasks and fewer specific expertise requirements would receive more patronage appointees (i.e., those chosen for their non‐policy benefits). To identify agencies with these characteristics, we operate under the assumption that the proportion of professional employees is an indicator of high agency task complexity and that the proportion of clerical and blue‐collar employees is an indicator of low complexity.28"
"21","We then define Professionalism as ln(1 + Proportion of Professional Employees in Agency) – ln(1 + Proportion of Clerical and Blue‐Collar Employees in Agency). Our expectation was that agencies with higher degrees of professionalism will house higher proportions of staff chosen for expertise purposes and lower proportions selected for political or electoral considerations.            "
"22","The second key expectation was that presidents would be more likely to place patronage appointees in agencies off the president's agenda. To measure which agencies are important to achieving President Obama's policy goals, we rely on the president's February 24, 2009, address before a joint session of Congress (Fishel 1985). We coded all agencies mentioned as responsible for a policy or an issue raised in the speech with a 1 and all other agencies with a 0 (Obama 2009). Our expectation was that agencies on the president's agenda are more likely to get appointees with high demonstrated expertise and lower levels of non‐policy benefits.            "
"23","Our third expectation was that patronage appointees would be more likely to be placed in agencies where their appointment would have the least visible influence on agency outputs. We argue that in agencies with large staffs, the average employee will be less influential than the average employee in smaller agencies. Thus, we simply include the logged size of the agency workforce. Our expectation was that agencies with larger workforces will include higher proportions of employees chosen for political purposes and lower proportions with demonstrated expertise."
"24","The final expectation was that presidents will be more likely to place patronage appointees in agencies that share the president's policy views. Since this analysis covers the first six months of the Obama administration, this implies that liberal agencies are more likely to house appointees selected for political or campaign experience and connections. To measure agency ideology, we estimate models using agency ideal points from Clinton and Lewis (2008).13 They fielded an expert survey to get data on agency liberalism‐conservatism and used an item‐response model to generate estimates in a way that accounted for rater heterogeneity. Lower values indicate more liberal agencies and higher values the opposite. Here, we expect that President Obama placed appointees with fewer demonstrated credentials and more political experience in liberal agencies and those with more demonstrated credentials in conservative agencies.14"
"25","Because our theory suggests that the same independent variables are likely to affect all the outcome variables, correlation across error terms is likely. Thus, in order to properly test our hypotheses, we use the seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) framework instead of seven separate equations (Zellner 1962, 1963). Since our outcome variables are all percentages, and thus lie between 0 and 1, we estimate a seemingly unrelated Tobit regression (SUTR) system of seven equations.15 In addition, because our dependent variables are aggregated from varying amounts of individual‐level data, we weight our agency‐level data by the number of appointments to that agency in our data set.16 Full details of model estimation are included in Supplementary Appendix 2.17"
"26","To which agencies has President Obama appointed more and less qualified appointees? Model estimates in Table 2 provide some insights. Notably, agencies off the president's agenda and agencies that share the president's policy views are the most likely to get appointees with lower levels of competence and more political connections. Additionally, there is some evidence that larger agencies with fewer expertise requirements are also more likely to get appointees with less demonstrated competence and greater political connections, but the evidence here is less robust.18"
"27","Table 2 provides some evidence that presidents appoint more competent appointees to agencies with the highest degrees of professionalism. In two of the five equations with an expertise‐related dependent variable, the coefficient on Professionalism is positive and significant, and in no equation is it negative and significant, indicating that the higher the degree of professionalism, the greater the probability that an appointee has one of the background features listed. Substantively, they indicate that an agency with a workforce with the mean level of professionalism will have a proportion of employees with previous agency experience that is eight percentage points lower (higher) than an agency with a level of professionalism one standard deviation higher (lower) than average. Similarly, it will have a proportion of employees with PhDs two percentage points lower (higher) than an agency with a level of professionalism one standard deviation higher (lower) than average. This provides some evidence that appointees with higher skill levels are necessary to manage agencies with complex tasks. Whether an appointee is well qualified arguably can have a much greater visible impact on performance in agencies such as these. Additionally, while the coefficient estimates suggest that fewer persons with political backgrounds are selected for more professional agencies, we could not reject the null that the professional nature of such agencies had no influence on this aspect of their appointees’ backgrounds.            "
"28","Model estimates in Table 2 indicate that agencies responsible for policies on the president's agenda are more likely to be staffed with appointees with background characteristics we reasonably associate with competence. Substantively, an agency's placement on the agenda is estimated to increase the average proportion of an agency's staff with a given competence‐related characteristic by between four and eight points (see Figure 1). Of course, we cannot disentangle whether appointees with these background characteristics are truly more competent or simply credentialed, but it is noteworthy that appointees with more background experience and education are generally more likely to work in agencies on the president's agenda. These results add credence to the argument that presidents need appointees who not only support their initiatives but also have the skills to push for and execute new policies.            "
"29","However, the qualification of appointees is only one side of the story. Appointees with less competence are selected for another reason, namely, campaign experience or connections. Agencies on the president's agenda are statistically significantly less likely to have high proportions of employees whose last job was in politics or who worked on the campaign. Ceteris paribus, agencies on the president's agenda will have rates of appointees selected for campaign experience or connections between four and six percentage points lower than those agencies on the president's agenda."
"30","Model estimates also suggest that larger agencies are more likely to have higher proportions of appointees with campaign experience or previous political experience, perhaps because individual appointees in these agencies will be less influential on overall agency policy and outcomes than appointees in smaller agencies. While the estimates do not reveal any relationship between workforce size and characteristics we associate with expertise, they do reveal a positive relationship between workforce size and a background in politics. All else equal, a one standard deviation increase in Workforce Size is associated with a three‐to‐five percentage point increase in the average proportion of an agency's staff with campaign experience or previous political experience. Persons from the campaign or with a political claim on the administration may be easier to place in larger agencies, where their influence is smaller and their presence is easier to accommodate.            "
"31","A notable feature that influences the qualifications of appointees is the ideological character of the agency and its work. As expected, during the Obama administration, liberal agencies are estimated to be significantly less likely to have appointees with the background characteristics associated with competence. In three of the five equations where an expertise‐related characteristic is the dependent variable, more conservative agencies are associated with background characteristics we associate with competence at a statistically significant level. Indeed, a one standard deviation increase in Agency Conservatism is associated with a two‐to‐seven percentage point increase in the average proportion of an agency's staff with a given competence‐related characteristic (see Figure 2).19"
"32","Similarly, liberal‐leaning agencies will, on average, have higher proportions of appointees with characteristics reflecting campaign experience or political connections. In both equations with patronage‐related dependent variables, higher levels of Agency Conservatism are associated with lower rates of appointees with campaign experience or previous political experience at conventional levels of statistical significance. A one standard deviation increase in Agency Conservatism is associated with a three‐to‐five percentage point decrease in the average proportion of an agency's staff with campaign experience or previous political experience.            "
"33","These findings seem to confirm that when presidents confront an agency that has policy views different from their own, they need appointees competent enough to bring change. In agencies that share the president's views on policy, such as liberal‐leaning agencies in the Obama administration, career professionals are less likely to resist the direction of the White House. The president's management task is easier, and the competence of appointee management is less crucial to the accomplishment of the president's policy goals."
"34","These results, when combined with the results about appointee experience, expertise, and education above, indicate that agencies on the president's agenda, conservative agencies, more professional agencies, and smaller agencies tend to have staffs with more qualifications and fewer connections to the campaign or politics. Conversely, agencies that are not central to the president's agenda, larger agencies with few expertise requirements, and agencies that already share the president's views on policy are estimated to be the most likely to receive patronage‐type appointments. Additionally, while the substantive effects may seem small on their face (standard deviation shifts in the independent variables result in two‐to‐eight percentage point shifts in the dependent variables), they should be considered in the context of the dependent variables, the values of which range from approximately 6% (the average agency‐level percentage of appointees with campaign experience) to approximately 45% (the average agency‐level percentage of appointees with government experience). In this context, the effects of agency characteristics on appointee characteristics are striking."
"35","The preceding analysis, while generally supportive of all of our hypotheses, is imperfect in one major respect. In particular, all seven dependent variables chosen to test our hypotheses are merely proxies for the underlying rates of expertise and patronage‐type appointments. We thus perform three principal components analyses (PCAs) on the dependent variables—one on just the set of expertise‐linked variables, one on the set of patronage‐linked variables, and one on the entire set. The resulting estimates comport reasonably well the underlying notions of expertise and patronage.20 They indicate that all of the variables used in the expertise and patronage PCAs correlate with the first principal component. Perhaps more interesting is that they suggest that expertise and patronage may be at odds with one another; all of the expertise‐related variables correlate positively with the first principal component, and all of the patronage‐ related variables exhibit negative correlations.            "
"36","Using the first dimensions from these analyses, we replicate the results presented in Table 2; the separate patronage and expertise dimensions are jointly examined within a SUR framework, whereas the combined patronage‐expertise dimension is examined within an OLS framework (see Table 3).21"
"37","The results from the latent dimension analyses generally comport with those presented in the aggregate agency characteristic analysis. All three models suggest that agencies high on President Obama's agenda were staffed with appointees displaying high levels of latent expertise and low levels on the patronage dimension. Conversely, more liberal agencies were staffed with appointees displaying lower levels of latent expertise and higher values on the latent patronage dimension. Larger agencies displayed higher rates of appointees selected for patronage reasons, though as in Table 2, we cannot say anything about the relationship between workforce size and expertise. Finally, the coefficients on Professionalism are all in the hypothesized direction, though not significant at conventional levels in any model (p ≈ 0.16, p ≈ 0.44, and p ≈ 0.19 in model order; one‐tailed tests). Nonetheless, all of these results complement those presented in Table 2 and support our hypotheses to varying extents. Moreover, they are substantively significant as well. For example, an agency on the president's agenda will, in expectation, have a workforce that scores approximately half of one standard deviation higher (lower) on the latent expertise (patronage) dimension. Similarly, moving from one standard deviation below the mean value of Agency Ideology to one standard deviation above the mean increases an agency's expected value on the latent expertise dimension by half of one standard deviation and decreases its expected value on the latent patronage dimension by a comparable amount. Similar effects are found when the combined expertise‐patronage dimension is examined.            "
"38","Notably, the results from the SUR estimation indicate that the errors are negatively correlated across equations (, suggesting that the same unobservables that make agencies more attractive for those with political connections make them less attractive to those with expertise, a fact not picked up by simple tests of significance on the regression coefficients. Moreover, a Breusch‐Pagan (1979) test of independence rejects the null hypothesis that the residuals from the two equations are independent , suggesting that when competence (patronage) is highly valued in a particular agency, the result is an undervaluing of patronage (competence). This provides further evidence that expertise and political goals may be at odds with each other when presidents are tasked with staffing their administrations.            "
"39","Alexander Hamilton's hope was that the new Constitution would provide for effective administration through the selection of persons based upon “intrinsic merit.” The evidence provided in this article suggests that Hamilton's vision has been fulfilled in some presidential choices more than others. President Obama placed appointees with fewer demonstrated credentials and more political connections into agencies off his agenda and liberal agencies (agencies that shared his policy views). There is also some evidence that the president placed appointees with greater background experience and lesser political experience or connections in smaller agencies, conservative agencies, and those with higher expertise requirements."
"40","These findings have important implications for our understanding of political appointments and presidential leadership. Presidency scholars most commonly view presidential appointments through the lens of political control. The president is viewed as the principal and selects personnel who will increase the chances that agencies produce the policy outputs he or she prefers. While this characterization of the personnel process is true for part of the process, presidents are also constrained by the need to repay campaign debts and induce more work for the president and party. The president is not at liberty to select all personnel on the basis of loyalty and competence. The increase in the depth and penetration of appointees into the administrative state does not necessarily enhance presidential control, since the additional appointees imperfectly share the president's views and may hinder efforts at control because they lack management acumen (Gallo and Lewis 2012; Huber and McCarty 2004; Lewis 2008).         "
"41","Because of these limitations, presidents are forced to be selective in choosing the types of agencies they target for increased political control. Our analysis here suggests that President Obama, when making appointments to those agencies high on his agenda and potentially resistant to his policy preferences, tended to focus on expertise and prior experience in addition to ideology. Interestingly, these same agencies—high priority and conservative—received fewer appointees with demonstrated political credentials. Together, these findings suggest that appointing those with demonstrated or presumed competence—and not necessarily political experience—may be the method by which presidents seek to gain control over agencies and induce them to produce the policy outputs they prefer. Of course, future research is needed, particularly research that differentiates among appointees with regard to loyalty and ideology."
"42","President Obama, like President Bush and other presidents, campaigned partly on his ability to govern effectively, to deliver to the American public what he promised during the campaign. The president's success or failure depends in large part on the actions of the thousands of people managing day‐to‐day operations in the Department of Defense or managing the economy in the Department of the Treasury. If the personnel process, influenced by patronage pressures, diminishes the loyalty or competence of this team, this can have dramatic consequences for a presidency. Many of those selected primarily for campaign or political experience serve faithfully and well in obscurity, but others end up causing significant damage to the country and the administration that appointed them. The results are potentially catastrophic for the president and the nation and, ultimately, undercut Hamilton's justification for the constitutional mode of presidential appointment."
