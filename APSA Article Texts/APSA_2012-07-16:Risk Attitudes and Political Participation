"1","A psychophysical risk‐return model (e.g., Weber, Blais, and Betz 2002) can provide a theoretical template for considering the relationship between risk attitudes and political participation. Under a psychophysical risk‐return model, an individual's willingness to engage in some behavior is a function of three factors: (1) the perceived returns (or benefits) of the behavior; (2) the perceived risks (or costs) of the behavior; and (3) the individual's willingness to trade off between those costs and benefits.3"
"2","Political participation may not be risky in the same way that reckless driving and skydiving are risky. In industrialized, developed countries, participation does not typically pose a risk to mortality. But, risk more broadly is viewed as the “possibility of loss” (Yates and Stone 1992, 4). As such, political participation does pose some financial, temporal, and psychological risk. The results from participating are uncertain: an individual's financial, temporal, or psychological investment in politics may not come to fruition in the end, either because a policy outcome might not be realized, or because the political act might not render the expected gratifications. Hence, we can apply a psychophysical risk‐return model to political participation by thinking about (1) the subjective benefits of participation; (2) the subjective costs of participation; and (3) the trade‐off between the returns of participating and the costs of participating.         "
"3","Participation scholars have identified several returns (or benefits) that individuals garner from participation. Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995) categorize these benefits into four broad groupings: selective material benefits, selective social gratifications, selective civic gratifications, and collective policy outcomes. They find that while political activists are rarely motivated by selective material benefits (e.g., the chance to improve one's job prospects), selective social and civic gratifications are powerful inducements to political activity. Excitement and chances to meet, work, and socialize with other individuals fall under the category of selective social gratifications. The desire to do one's duty falls into the selective civic gratifications. And, collective outcomes such as the desire to make a difference to public policy also motivate participation.         "
"4","Not everyone agrees that these are potential benefits to participating. Some individuals may see politics as uninteresting, pointless, boring, or irritating, yielding no positive or even negative returns (that is, costs)."
"5","Costs, of course, offset any presumed benefits from participating. Participating takes time, money, and psychological investment. Some individuals may be deterred from participating because they do not have sufficient resources, such as time or money, to participate: hence, the costs may simply be prohibitive. Finally, individuals may consider the relative weight to place on benefits versus costs, on returns versus risks."
"6","I combine this risk‐return theoretical framework with the literature on individual differences in sensation seeking to understand how risk attitudes might affect participation. Sensation seeking is “a trait defined by the seeking of varied, novel, complex, and intense sensations and experiences, and the willingness to take physical, social, legal, and financial risks for the sake of such experience” (Zuckerman 1994, 27). Sensation seeking predicts behavior across a wide range of activities, from occupational choices to social attitudes, to risky behaviors, such as gambling, drug use, high‐risk sports, risky sexual activity, and reckless driving (Zuckerman 1979, 2007), providing empirical evidence to suggest that a generalized orientation towards risky behavior may exist.         "
"7","According to this work, sensation seekers are predisposed to seek novelty, excitement, and complexity. They receive positive returns from activities with these features. Recall that one of the selective gratifications identified by Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995) relates exactly to this notion that political life is exciting. Thus, one of the reasons people who are risk accepting should participate is because political participation offers a selective benefit that resonates specifically with these types of individuals: excitement. Additionally, the halo effect suggests that “greater expected benefits were associated with smaller perceived risks” (Weber, Blais, and Betz 2002, 278). That is, people who perceive acts to provide greater returns also underestimate the potential costs of engaging in those acts. Thus, those who perceive large benefits from participating may attribute lower risks to participating. Hence, we might expect risk‐accepting individuals to both perceive high benefits to participating and to assess lower costs to participating.4"
"8","To estimate the relationship between risk attitudes and political participation, I rely upon two datasets. The first dataset is the 2008–2009 American National Election Study panel (ANES). The second dataset is an Internet study conducted from May 27 to June 3, 2011. Approximately 1,700 respondents were recruited via Survey Sampling International's (SSI) opt‐in Internet panel to participate in a study on “Personality and Decision‐Making.” This diverse set of individuals provides an opportunity to probe further the relationship between risk attitudes and participation. Appendix Table A1 compares respondents from the SSI with those from the ANES 2008–2009 panel. There, we see that the two samples are very similar along several demographics: age, sex, partisanship, ideology, education, household income, and race/ethnicity."
"9","Both surveys included a battery of questions designed to tap risk attitudes.5 The measure of Risk Acceptance is an additive index comprised of responses to a seven‐question battery of items that were culled from existing research in political science, sociology, and psychology. Table 1 presents the question text and item descriptives.         "
"10","The first question asks respondents to place themselves on a 7‐point scale, anchored at the value of 1 with the statement “You should be cautious about making major changes in life” and at the value of 7 with the statement “You will never achieve much in life unless you act boldly.” This question was based on one that appears on the 1990 and 1995 installments of the World Values Survey (analyzed by Miller 2000 and Freese 2004; a variant of the question appeared on a 1997 Mexican national survey and was analyzed by Morgenstern and Zechmeister 2001). The next question was drawn from the 1972 National Election Study; it asks respondents about whether they would keep betting on horses (or take their winnings) if they had just won a race. This item is analyzed by Berinsky and Lewis (2007). The next items are drawn from the Brief Sensation‐Seeking Scale (Hoyle et al. 2002), a battery that asks respondents about their views on new experiences. The last question asks respondents, “In general, how easy or difficult is it for you to accept taking risks?” This item is analyzed by Nadeau, Martin, and Blais (1999). Ehrlich and Maestas (2010) and Tomz and Van Houweling (2009) also analyze a variant of it.         "
"11","The questions, as they appeared on the questionnaire, varied in direction in order to avoid acquiescence response bias. The measure is compact enough to be administered in a survey context, thus avoiding some of the difficulties with the long and administratively cumbersome measures in psychology, economics, and behavioral decision theory. The seven items were each rescaled to range from 0 (risk averse) to 1 (risk acceptant), summed together, and then rescaled into a Risk Acceptance Index, ranging from 0 (risk averse) to 1 (risk acceptant).6 As shown in Table 1, the distribution of each of the Risk Acceptance items was almost identical across the two samples, and the mean of the overall scale is nearly identical as well.         "
"12","Criterion validity of the scale can be established by examining whether the scale correlates with characteristics with which it ought to correlate.7 To do so, I estimate partial correlation coefficients that relate Risk Acceptance with a series of covariates (primarily drawn from the risk literature) that have political relevance. All of the correlations below thus control for the other covariates. These partial correlation coefficients appear in Table 2a.         "
"13","Existing literature (Byrnes, Miller, and Schafer 1999; Weber, Blais, and Betz 2002; see Fischoff 1992 for a discussion) has found that older individuals are more risk averse; this pattern also appears in the ANES analyses (partial r=−0.17, p < 0.01) and in the SSI data (partial r=−0.19, p < 0.01). The existing literature has also established that females are less risk accepting than males (e.g., Byrnes, Miller, and Schafer 1999; Fagley and Miller 1990; Smith et al. 2004; Weber, Blais, and Betz 2002); the ANES and SSI datasets also reflect this general pattern (partial r=−0.21 and partial r=−0.19, p < 0.01 for both).         "
"14","We might also be interested in the relationship between Risk Acceptance and politically relevant predispositions. Risk Acceptance correlates significantly with Ideological Identification, such that liberals are more risk accepting than conservatives, in both the ANES and the SSI datasets. This finding is consistent with that of Kam and Simas (2010). The high level of consistency between the existing literature and what correlates with it in the present samples supports the criterion validity of the measure. Moreover, the results are highly comparable across the ANES and the SSI datasets.         "
"15","We can also examine the convergent validity of the scale by correlating it with measures to which it theoretically should relate. The Risk Acceptance scale also correlates well with existing measures of risk attitudes. A laboratory study of 287 undergraduates shows that the Risk Acceptance scale correlates positively and significantly with Kogan and Wallach's (1964) 12‐vignette Choice Dilemmas Questionnaire (CDQ) (r= 0.34), a lengthy scale that has been used by one set of political scientists studying risk attitudes (Kowert and Hermann 1997). The SSI study shows that Risk Acceptance correlates positively and significantly with Blais and Weber's (2006) 30‐item Domain‐Specific Risk Taking scale (DOSPERT). The 30‐item measure comprises five subscales that tap domain‐specific risk attitudes regarding social risk, recreational risk, financial risk, health/safety risk, and ethical risk. The overall 30‐item DOSPERT scale correlates well with the 7‐item Risk Acceptance scale, at r= 0.58.8 The Risk Acceptance scale also correlates positively and strongly with some aspects of the Five‐Factor Personality Model, as measured with Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann's (2003) Ten‐Item Personality Inventory (TIPI), as shown in Table 2b.9 The Risk Acceptance scale correlates most strongly with the Openness dimension of the Five‐Factor Model in the ANES and SSI datasets, but it also correlates substantially with the Extraversion dimension as well. It is less correlated with the dimensions of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability. As with Table 2a, the results across the two surveys are quite similar.         "
"16","Finally, scale responses are stable: a test‐retest correlation, run on a nationally representative sample drawn from Knowledge Networks across the span of two weeks, yielded Pearson r= 0.81.10 Altogether, the analyses suggest that Risk Acceptance is a reliable and valid measure of heterogeneity in risk attitudes.         "
"17","I begin with an analysis of the 2008–2009 ANES panel. The ANES panel contains several items that enable me to examine the extent to which risk attitudes predict political action and engagement. Within Wave 6 of the ANES, a randomly selected half of the respondents were asked to look to the future and assess their likelihood of participating in a series of acts: rallies/marches/demonstrations; attending a local government or school board meeting; signing an e‐petition; signing a paper petition; donating money to a religious organization; donating money to a political/social organization; attending a meeting on political/social issues; inviting someone else to attend such a meeting; and distributing flyers to support a political/ social organization.11"
"18","There is good variation in citizens’ expectations about whether they will participate in these acts. The most popular act on the list is actually not a political one: 32% of respondents thought it was “extremely likely” that they would make a religious donation. The most popular political act was signing a paper petition: 11% of respondents thought they would be “extremely likely” to do so. The least popular acts are joining a protest (with only less than 2% of respondents thinking they would be “extremely likely” to engage in it) and distributing information or ads for a political/social group (only 2% thinking they would be “extremely likely” to do so)."
"19","To what extent do risk attitudes predict intended participation in politics? To assess the relationship between risk attitudes and participation, I estimate a series of ordered probit models that include standard controls for participation: sex, age, strength of partisanship, ideology, education, household income, race, and ethnicity.12 The regression estimates in Table 3 show that for nearly every political act, the effect of Risk Acceptance is positive, statistically significant, and large in magnitude: the risk accepting are significantly more likely to participate in politics.13"
"20","One clear exception to this relationship between Risk Acceptance and action is the one nonpolitical item in the battery: religious donation. Here, the direction of the effect flips: the risk averse are significantly more likely to donate, a finding that is consistent with sociological literature identifying the tie between risk aversion and religiosity (Freese and Montgomery 2007; Miller 2000; Miller and Hoffman 1995). This clear exception provides an important check on an alternative explanation: that the risk accepting are simply more likely to engage in any action. Overall, the results clearly suggest that the risk accepting are willing to participate in politics—either to shoulder the present costs of participation to gamble on the future or to encounter the novelty inherent in participating in political life.         "
"21","The graphs in the left‐hand column of Figure 1 illustrate the magnitude of some of these effects.14 We see that as the level of Risk Acceptance rises, the likelihood of future participation increases. For example, the probability of reporting that one is “moderately likely,”“very likely,” or “extremely likely” to participate in a rally, march, or demonstration increases over fourfold, from a mere 5% to 27% across the range of Risk Acceptance. The likelihood of signing a paper petition in the future increases from 33% for the most risk averse to 65% for the most risk accepting. And, the likelihood of being willing to distribute information and advertisements for a political or social group also increases more than fourfold, from 5% to 21% across the range of Risk Acceptance.         "

"23","Predicted probabilities with 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Tables 3 and 4. For future acts, predicted probability is the cumulative probability of the act being “Moderately likely” to “Extremely likely.”                     "
"24","The other half‐sample was asked to look to the past and report on whether or not they had ever engaged in the same list of acts. In response to this battery of questions, the most popular act is still religious donations, with 83% of respondents reporting that they have done it. And, as with the prospective battery, the most popular political act is signing a paper petition (70% reporting having done so), and the least popular acts are joining a protest or inviting someone to attend a meeting about political or social concerns (with only 22% having done these acts).15 Does Risk Acceptance predict responses to past participation? Generally, yes, although the results are a bit weaker than they were for future participation. The results in Table 4 show that Risk Acceptance positively predicts participation in nearly all of the political acts, with statistically significant results in three of the models. As in Table 3, religious donation takes on a completely different pattern, with risk‐averse respondents being significantly more likely to have donated to a religious organization.         "
"25","The graphs in the right‐hand column of Figure 1 illustrate some of these effects. Again, we see dramatic increases in the likelihood of participating across the range of Risk Acceptance. For example, the probability of having attended a local government meeting rises from 0.47 to about 0.86 along the range of Risk Acceptance. The probability of having attended a meeting on a political/social issue increases from 0.27 for the most risk averse to 0.66 for the most risk accepting. And, the probability of having recruited someone else to attend such a meeting quadruples, from 0.09 to 0.36 along the range of Risk Acceptance.         "
"26","The battery on past participation was readministered in Wave 11 (November 2008) of the study. The results, if anything, are a bit stronger in that set of responses, as shown in Appendix Table A3. There, risk acceptance positively and significantly predicts having participated in four acts (a local governmental meeting, signing an e‐petition, signing a paper petition, and attending a political meeting). As before, the effect of risk attitudes on having made a religious donation is negative and highly significant."
"27","The results from prospective and retrospective participation differ slightly from one another, with the effect of Risk Acceptance being more consistent across acts and of greater magnitude when respondents are asked to ponder whether they would be willing to engage in prospective acts rather than report whether they have engaged in such acts in the past. Probably the most important distinction between the prospective and retrospective participation is the fact that actual participation arises not just from internal motivations but also external opportunities (e.g., Leighley 1995; Rosenstone and Hansen [1993] 2003). The risk accepting may be quite ready and willing to participate in politics, but whether they actually have done so is both a function of that willingness to act as well as having the opportunity to do so.         "
"28","Finally, respondents on the ANES 2008–2009 panel also reported turnout in the primary and general elections. Turnout is a quite different phenomenon compared with other forms of participation. It is governed by the electoral calendar, each citizen can only vote once per election, and it is an outlier in terms of high degree of reported participation. Voting is also a different type of act: it is typically performed alone (in the voting booth or by mail), it is governed by bureaucratic rules, and it is, in American life, far more ritualistic in nature than, say, attending a campaign meeting or working on a local issue. And, we find that the relationship between risk attitudes and participation is also different. In contrast to what we have found above, risk attitudes are not a significant predictor of turnout—in either the primary or general elections. The coefficient on Risk Acceptance is insignificant for both types of turnout (b = 0.07, s.e. = 0.41 for primary turnout; b =−0.47, s.e. = 0.55 for general turnout). Below, in the discussion about mechanisms for participation, I will return to explaining why turnout is different from other acts.         "
"29","In sum, the results from the ANES panel suggest that there is a general relationship between risk attitudes and political participation. Those who are more risk accepting are more likely to participate across a variety of acts. But, there are some contextual contingencies to note as well. The results are stronger when individuals are asked about what they will do in the future, as opposed to what they have done in the past. While risk attitudes predict individuals’ motivations to participate, the translation of motivation into action may depend upon other factors such as resources and opportunities. The relationship between Risk Acceptance and participation is strong and positive when it comes to general political participation but strong and negative when it comes to religious donation: the risk accepting are not simply more active in all aspects of life, but rather, are more active when it comes to general political acts. Finally, turnout is the exception to the rule. There is no significant relationship between turnout and risk attitudes—a pattern that I will probe further, below.         "
"30","The overall positive and significant relationship between risk attitudes and political participation replicates handily in a separate, independent sample: the SSI Internet survey. I have already established that the SSI Internet sample is similar to the ANES in demographics (Appendix Table A1) and in the distribution of Risk Acceptance (Table 1). I have also shown that the structural and personality correlates of Risk Acceptance are similar across the datasets (Tables 2a, 2b). Does the relationship between risk attitudes and participation hold as well?         "
"31","In the SSI survey, respondents were asked questions about both prospective and retrospective participation.16 The questions about prospective participation were identical to those used in the ANES, but the questions about retrospective participation were modified to refer to a fixed time frame (the past few election cycles or the past 12 months) rather than to refer to the respondent's entire life, in order to improve the reliability of these retrospective self‐reports (e.g., Groves et al. 2004). Additionally, the SSI instrument asked respondents to report on retrospective campaign participation, an aspect of participation that was missing from the ANES panel instrumentation but is standard fare in ANES time series.         "
"32","When I estimate the same model specification on this modified set of dependent variables, the key results replicate in full. Figure 2 depicts the ordered probit coefficients for Risk Acceptance from analyses of each of the 20 dependent variables, along with 95% confidence intervals. As Figure 2 demonstrates, all of the coefficients relating Risk Acceptance to political participation are positive and significant, the two coefficients relating Risk Acceptance to religious participation are negative and significant, and the one coefficient relating Risk Acceptance to turnout is insignificant. The results hold for both past and future participation, and, as with the ANES analyses, the results are stronger for hypothetical future participation than past participation.         "

"34","Ordered probit coefficient with 95% confidence interval. Source: SSI Study                     "
"35","The SSI study also allows for a series of robustness checks for the relationship between risk attitudes and participation. First, I examine the relationship when we use an alternative measure of risk attitudes. As discussed above, the SSI study also included Blais and Weber's (2006) 30‐item Domain‐Specific Risk Taking scale (DOSPERT). The 30‐item measure comprises five subscales that tap domain‐specific risk attitudes regarding social risk, recreational risk, financial risk, health/safety risk, and ethical risk. A composite risk‐attitudes scale can be created from the 30‐item measure. As shown in Figure 3, the relationship between risk attitudes and participation is nearly entirely replicated using this alternative (but far lengthier) measure of risk attitudes. The only slippage appears to occur with one of the two religious items; for the political acts, we still see a positive and significant relationship between risk attitudes and participation and an insignificant relationship between Risk Acceptance and turnout. Thus, the relationship between risk attitudes and participation generalizes to this longer alternative measure of risk attitudes.         "

"37","Ordered probit coefficient with 95% confidence interval. Source: SSI Study                     "
"38","The SSI study also provides opportunities to test against alternative explanations. I included a measure of civic skills based on Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995), who note that skills acquired in nonpolitical arenas can have consequential effects on the likelihood of participation. SSI respondents were asked if, in the course of their job, involvement in organizations, or as part of their church activities, they had written a letter, gone to a meeting where they participated in decision making, given a presentation, or planned or chaired a meeting. I created an additive scale of responses (α= 0.87) and included it in the standard participation model. As expected, civic skills are a significant predictor of participation in every single model. But, importantly for our purposes, Risk Acceptance remains a significant predictor for nearly all general political acts, as shown in Figure 4. The exceptions once again are the religious‐donation items, where Risk Acceptance again has a negative and significant effect, and turnout, where there is a statistically insignificant relationship.         "

"40","Ordered probit coefficient with 95% confidence interval. Source: SSI Study                     "
"41","The relationship between risk attitudes and participation is also robust to inclusion of personality measures. Recent work (Gerber et al. 2010; Mondak and Halperin 2008; Mondak et al. 2010) has demonstrated that certain personality traits predict participation: particularly, Openness, which relates generally to political participation in the United States (Mondak 2010; Mondak et al. 2010), and Extraversion, which relates to political acts that have a social aspect to them (Gerber et al. 2010; Gerber et al. 2011). Do risk attitudes contribute independently of personality? The SSI survey included the Ten‐Item Personality Inventory (Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann 2003), which measures the “Big‐Five” personality factors. As shown in Table 2b, Risk Acceptance correlates significantly and positively with Extroversion and Openness. As Figure 5 shows, the effects of Risk Acceptance are largely immune to the introduction of personality measures. Risk Acceptance positively and significantly predicts political participation, it negatively and significantly predicts religious donation, and it has no significant effect on turnout. Although risk attitudes are related to personality traits in the Five‐Factor Model, they are not subsumed by them. Risk attitudes make an independent contribution to predicting political participation, above and beyond personality measures.         "

"43","Ordered probit coefficient with 95% confidence interval. Source: SSI Study                     "
"44","The SSI study also allows for probing into the mechanism by which risk attitudes predict participation. Immediately following the prospective participation questions, respondents were asked to indicate how important various reasons were for their decisions to participate in politics. The battery of items included a variety of plausible reasons that individuals have reported participating in politics, following research by Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995), and respondents were asked to indicate how important each reason was for their own participation in politics.17 Two of these reasons were identified, ex ante, as most theoretically likely to resonate with the risk accepting: participating because “It's exciting to participate” and “I like to do new things.” Both tap aspects of novelty or sensation seeking. Others were expected to be less related to risk attitudes, because they are more oriented towards fulfillment of civic duty (“I have a duty as a citizen”) or because they tap conscientiousness/obligation (“I am the type of person who does my share”). How well do risk attitudes predict the reasons people give for participating in politics?         "
"45","To answer this question, I model each reason for participating as a function of Risk Acceptance, personality, and the standard control variables included in previous models. The ordered probit coefficients suggest that risk attitudes are positively related to espousal of all of the reasons for participating—which is not surprising, given we have shown that risk attitudes generally predict participation. What is more interesting is whether risk attitudes are more related to some reasons than others. Figure 6 depicts the ordered probit coefficients on Risk Acceptance along with their 95% confidence intervals, sorted by the size of the ordered probit coefficient. We see that risk attitudes are most strongly related to novelty (“I like doing new things”) and excitement (“It's exciting to participate”). The effect of Risk Acceptance on novelty is statistically distinguishable from its effect on espousal of the remaining reasons, as shown by the lack of overlap in the 95% confidence intervals. Notice that risk attitudes are least related to participation based on a sense of duty. This analysis provides us with one glimpse at the potential mechanism underlying participation, at least for those who are risk accepting: they like doing new and exciting things, and participating in politics provides an outlet to satisfy those motivations.         "

"47","Ordered probit coefficient with 95% confidence interval. Source: SSI Study                     "
"48","Furthermore, these analyses help us understand why there is little relationship between voting and Risk Acceptance. As mentioned above, voting is a quite different act from, say, attending a local meeting or working on a campaign. It is ritualistic, defined by bureaucratic rules, and often performed alone. Indeed, when we correlate turnout and opinion about these various reasons for participating, the reason that best correlates with turnout is the one about civic duty (r= 0.13). Moreover, the correlation between novelty and turnout is insignificant (r= 0.003). Given that voting is most characterized as fulfillment of duty, and given that duty least motivates risk seekers, we can see why, in the relationship between risk attitudes and political participation, the act of voting is the exception, not the rule.         "
"49","Citizens vary in their risk attitudes. And, as the results in this article suggest, this variation in risk attitudes matters for political participation. I argue that this relationship can be understood within a psychophysical risk‐return framework that specifies that individuals are motivated by the benefits of participating in a risky act, the costs of participating, and the trade‐offs between benefits and costs. I find that risk attitudes predict the extent to which citizens have participated in political life and the extent to which citizens believe they will participate in the future. The risk accepting are more likely to engage in a host of politically relevant acts, from attending a rally to signing a petition, from recruiting others to attend a local meeting to distributing flyers. These general findings replicate in an independent dataset. They hold up when we include an alternative (but significantly longer) measure of risk attitudes. They withstand inclusion of controls for civic skills. And, they are not altered by inclusion of personality measures."
"50","The general relationship is accompanied by some interesting contextual contingencies. Risk attitudes do a better job predicting future participation than past participation. This finding supports the notion that wanting to participate matters, but motivation alone is not sufficient to bring about actual participation. In order to participate, people need resources and opportunities to participate as well. And, the act of voting is an exception to the rule. Both the ANES panel and the SSI analyses show that while risk attitudes predict general political participation in campaigns and in governmental acts, risk attitudes do not significantly predict turnout. The analyses of the mechanisms of participating suggest that risk‐accepting individuals are strongly motivated by novelty and excitement—and such motivations are not well tied to the act of voting. The act of voting is tied most closely to a sense of duty, the motivation that correlates least well with risk acceptance."
"51","The article also uncovered an interesting contrast between political participation and religious donation. In both the ANES panel data and the SSI survey, risk‐accepting respondents are significantly less likely to make religious donations than risk‐averse respondents. The dramatic reversal in the direction of effects is consistent with work identifying the unique determinants of religious giving from nonreligious giving (e.g., Hrung 2004; Iannaccone 1998). The contrast between the types of dependent variables may suggest that there is something inherently stimulating or interesting about political life that appeals to the risk accepting and sensation seeking. Another possible interpretation is that the risk averse donate to religious organizations in order to maximize their afterlife utility (Azzi and Ehrenberg 1975), or, within the approach‐avoidance framework raised here, in order to avoid the biggest of all possible harms (eternal damnation).18 Not donating to a religious organization is a “gamble” (because it invites the possibility of divine retribution)—a gamble that the risk accepting are willing to take but the risk averse are not.         "
"52","Risk attitudes are also relevant to other aspects of political life. For example, Kam and Simas (2010) have found that Risk Acceptance predicts susceptibility to whether policies are framed in probabilistic or certain terms. The risk accepting prefer policies that are framed in probabilistic terms, while the risk averse prefer policies that are framed in certain terms. Moreover, they find that Risk Acceptance undercuts susceptibility to multiple framing scenarios, such that initial responses to a frame (which are anchored in part by Risk Acceptance) shape future responses to alternatively framed policies. In addition, risk attitudes should play a role in public opinion across a broad range of policies. Ehrlich and Maestas (2010) have demonstrated that risk attitudes predict policies on free trade, and Maestas and Pollock (2010) show that risk attitudes interact with economic evaluations to predict views on Social Security privatization. Eckles and Schaffner (2011) show that risk attitudes can be primed in foreign policy opinions. Further, risk attitudes are consequential for electoral choices as well (Kam and Simas 2012; Tomz and van Houweling 2009).         "
"53","If risk attitudes shape both public opinion and participation in political life, this raises the possibility of bias in democratic representation. To the extent that public policies reflect the voice of the people, the risk accepting are likely overrepresented in political acts outside the act of voting, compared with the risk averse. Such a pattern could be normatively troubling when we compare the act of voting with other participatory acts. The act of voting is a singularly blunt instrument for communicating preferences, can only be exercised once, and is constrained by the electoral calendar. Other acts offer more direct messages, can be exercised multiple times, by individuals en masse, at any time of the year. Even though risk‐accepting people are primarily motivated to participate in politics by novelty and excitement, their overrepresentation among the participatory public makes it all the more likely that their policy preferences will be overrepresented as well.
