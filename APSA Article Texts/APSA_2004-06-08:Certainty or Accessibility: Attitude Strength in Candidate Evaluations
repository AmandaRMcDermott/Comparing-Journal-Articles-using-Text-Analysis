"1","Although psychologists expend a great deal of time and resources examining attitude strength (Petty and Krosnick 1995), the phrase had been more of a vague metaphor than a well‐defined social scientific construct. Krosnick and Petty (1995) provide what is probably the first definition of attitude strength. They define it as an attitude's persistence, resistance, and impact on information processing and behavior. Essentially, an attitude's influence on psychological processes depends on both its content and strength. If we think of an attitude as the evaluation of some object stored in memory (when presented with a candidate, how positive or negative is the reaction), the strength of the attitude is the power of the connection between the object and the evaluation. The impact of the evaluation (what we normally mean by attitude), then, is moderated by the strength of its link with the object.         "
"2","The absence of a clear definition of the term is only one problem with the attitude strength concept. The very nature of attitude strength is a contested topic. Krosnick et al. (1993) argue that the different concepts used as operationalizations of attitude strength do not tap a single or even a small number of underlying dimensions, but are distinct concepts. Visser and colleagues (Visser 1998; Visser and Krosnick 2000; Visser, Bizer, and Krosnick 2003; Visser, Krosnick, and Simmons 2003) deal with this more directly. They test the common factor view that all measures of attitude strength tap the same underlying concept. As they demonstrate, the different dimensions of attitude strength have unique origins, exert independent effects on thoughts and behaviors, change in different ways over time, and operate through distinct causal mechanisms. These are truly different concepts, and it is a mistake to either treat them as interchangeable or simply focus on one type of strength without exploring the implications this choice has for our understanding of politics (see also Miller and Peterson 2004).         "
"3","In the study of issue voting in particular, two types of attitude strength are commonly used as moderators of issue voting: certainty and accessibility. Yet, no work directly compares the use of accessibility and certainty in candidate evaluations. Alvarez (1998) and Page (1978) suggest that the link between issues and voter choice is moderated by the voter's degree of certainty. In contrast, Iyengar and Kinder (1987), in their work on priming, suggest that accessibility influences how voters evaluate candidates.1 Zaller's work (1992) on Congressional candidates suggests that the asymmetry of information between incumbents and challengers alters the accessibility of information about both candidates and the way voters choose. Fazio and Williams (1986) find that accessibility moderates the link between evaluations of the candidate and assessment of performance and the citizen's vote. Based on these works, some type of attitude strength moderates the use of issues in voting. Which type of strength matters remains unasked and unanswered.         "
"4","It is also an important question for our understanding of how citizens respond to their information environment and form their attitudes. Accessibility and certainty differ in their causes, especially how the information environment influences them. Certainty is a result of the amount, clarity or ambiguity, and consistency of the information available, the amount of thought the person gives the subject, and the personal sense of self‐confidence (Gross, Holtz, and Miller 1995). Accessibility is shaped by the chronicity and recency of an attitude's use—how often and how recently the attitude has been accessed from memory and used (Higgins 1996).2"
"5","Which type of strength matters for candidate evaluations, then, provides direction as to how the media and campaigns influence citizens. If accessibility matters, the most recently used attitude (whatever happens to be activated by the campaign last) will be more likely to be used than those that have not been activated recently. Campaigns, then, have a tremendous influence over what voters rely on when choosing between the candidates. If certainty moderates the connections between attitudes, the recent stimulus from the campaign will only matter as it changes the voters' certainty. Campaigns, in this depiction, work mostly by informing and educating the voters about where the candidates stand. Given the sheer amount of information available during a campaign, the impact of a single piece of information should be relatively small."
"6","The difference between accessibility and certainty is the crux of the separation between different models of campaign effects. Johnston et al. (1992) theorize that the effect of the campaign in the 1988 Canadian elections was to prime the citizens and change the accessibility of various issues. The campaign, in this depiction, has a sizable influence over citizens. If their theory is correct, if accessibility moderates the link between issues and candidate evaluations, campaigns have a significant influence on changing what the voters think and how they choose for whom to vote.         "
"7"," Gelman and King (1993) and Alvarez (1998) provide complementary models of campaigns, models that differ markedly from the one posited by Johnston et al. Gelman and King and Alvarez both suggest that the major influence of campaigns is to educate or “enlighten” the voters about where the candidates stand. Alvarez in particular suggests that the major campaign effects stem from changes in the underlying certainty voters have about the candidates. Campaigns matter for election outcomes, but it is the totality of the campaign rather than single events or pieces of information that influences the public. Thus, the sizable substantive differences between the models stem from a single question—what is the psychological mechanism behind the observed campaign effects on candidate evaluations: certainty or accessibility? Again, no work in the extant literature provides any answer to this question.         "
"8","In addition to explaining how voters change in response to the campaign, the question of which type of strength shapes the link between issues and candidate evaluations can explain the cross‐sectional differences in how voters use issues. What determines the strength of the link between issues and overall evaluations is a central question in the study of political behavior. That issues matter for vote choice is no longer a contested question (for probably the most consistent evidence of this see Alvarez 1998). The relevant question now is why do some voters rely on issues more than others do; what explains the heterogeneity in how voters use issues when voting? While the question has a long history (at least since Campbell. et al. 1960), no clear answer exists. For instance, Miller, Wattenberg, and Malanchuk (1986) and McGraw and Steenbergen (1995) find that informed and sophisticated voters rely on issues less than uninformed and unsophisticated voters do. Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock (1990) find that informed voters use policy information more heavily and Rahn et al. (1990) find no differences across levels of sophistication.3"
"9","The standard approach to determining why voters differ in their decision making is to look for differences across levels of political sophistication, usually measured by political knowledge. While sophistication influences strength (see Alvarez [1998] and Zaller [1992] for discussions of the link between sophistication and, respectively, certainty and accessibility), attitude strength is theoretically and empirically distinct from sophistication. The traditional measures of sophistication, such as factual political knowledge, implicitly assume that voters will not change in their level of sophistication across a campaign and a voter who is more “sophisticated” about one candidate will be more “sophisticated” in his or her thinking g about all other candidates. Measures of strength, however, can vary across both candidates and a campaign. Moreover, because the strength measures tap the strength of the specific issue attitudes while the sophistication measures assess one's general attention to and understanding of politics the strength measures may be more meaningful for the use of a specific attitude because they are more focused and direct. Thus, shifting from measures of political sophistication to measures of attitude strength may provide a solution to these contradictory findings about voter heterogeneity.4"
"10","To compare the influence of accessibility and certainty in candidate evaluations, I turn to an original study with fictitious candidates. The study undertaken for this project surveyed 133 respondents at the University of Minnesota. The respondents were first asked a survey about their demographics, political behavior, and attitudes. Then they read a brief description of the candidates and several policy statements from the candidates. Finally, the respondents were asked their opinions of the candidates. The study was computer moderated, and the software timed the response to every question in the study. The appendix describes the nature of the study in more detail, and the exact text is available from the author."
"11","The dependent variable is the respondent's overall evaluation of the candidates, measured as a 10‐point scale ranging from strong dislike to strong like. The mean responses for the candidates are 4.2 and 6.2 with a relatively standard distribution of values. The difference in means of the evaluation stems largely from the skewed partisanship of the respondents (see the appendix for details).         "
"12","The coding of the independent variables follows convention. The policy attitude is measured as the squared difference between the respondent's self‐placement and the candidate's location, averaged across seven issue areas (social security, environmental regulation, civil rights, government provided jobs, spending on social services, education, and health care).5 The average placement of the candidate on the issue scale determined the mean perception of the candidate's position. The measure of certainty used is the average certainty of the respondent's placement of the candidate on the seven‐issue scales. The accessibility measure is based on how quickly the respondent answered the questions. The logic is simple: the more accessible the attitude, the quicker he or she can recall it and answer the question. The measure is how long it took the respondent to answer the question, measured in milliseconds.6"
"13","For both measures of attitude strength, an interaction term models the moderating influence of the policy attitude. The term is constructed the same as in Miller and Krosnick (2000). For each issue and candidate, the first step was to create the squared difference between the candidate and the respondent. This term was then multiplied by the measure of attitude strength for that particular issue and candidate. These issue specific interactions were then averaged across all seven‐issue scales to create a summary measure. The direct effect of policy disagreement is expected to be negative (greater disagreement, lower evaluations of the candidate). The moderating influence for the certainty measure, therefore, should also be negative. The response latency measure, however, taps how inaccessible the attitude is—higher values indicate lower levels of accessibility. The expectation is that if the interaction term is significant, it will be oppositely signed, or positive.         "
"14","The analyses control for the respondent's perceptions of the candidate's character traits and party identification. The trait measure is an additive scale based on the respondent's responses to NES‐based trait questions asking how well moral, intelligent, decent, and knowledgeable describe the candidates. High scores represent positive impressions. The party identification measure is the standard seven‐point scale."
"15","The final issue is the appropriate statistical technique to analyze these data. One approach would be to analyze the evaluations of the candidates separately. Unfortunately, the power from such a set up is low—biasing in favor of the null hypothesis of no effect. With the small sample size of 130,7 the power (0.53 for one candidate, 0.58 for the other) is well below acceptable levels. I conducted a more efficient and powerful test by combining the evaluations of both candidates into a single statistical model in an effort to boost the power of the test. Of course, pooling induces problems with the data that violate the standard assumptions of OLS. To correct for these problems I do two things. I add a dummy variable indicating which candidate the respondent is asked about as well as an indicator of which condition the respondent is in and an interaction term between the candidate and the condition (see the appendix). Second, because there are two observations per respondent, it is likely that the error variances of these pairs of observations are related. To account for this I cluster the data and report the robust standard errors. This pooling boosted the power of the test to above 0.94, an acceptable level.         "
"16","This technique also necessitates changing the coding of partisanship. It is coded as a seven‐point scale where the highest value is strong identifier of the same party as the candidate and the lowest value is strong identifier of the other party. All of the other measures are candidate specific and do not need this transformation."
"17","To reiterate, the question is which type of attitude strength, certainty, or accessibility, moderates the use of issue attitudes. Before we turn to these tests, however, it is worth noting that these measures tap distinct concepts. There are several ways to do this. First, the average correlation between 14 different candidate‐issue certainty and accessible items (two candidates measured on seven‐issue scales) is low, though negative as expected: −0.18. While seemingly small, this is similar to other reported results (Bassili [1993] found a correlation between the certainty and accessibility of the intention to vote of 0.20). The data were then divided into quartiles based on the respondent's overall level of certainty about the candidate. A comparison of means with the Bonferroni correction indicated that there are no significant differences in the level of accessibility across levels of certainty—in fact, the mean levels of accessibility were within 0.10 of a second of each other across the certainty quartiles.         "
"18","Given that certainty and accessibility are distinct, we now turn to the analyses of their moderating role in candidate evaluations. There are four models presented in Table 1. The first set of results presents the effect of policy disagreement, perceptions of character traits, and party identification. The next three sets of results include, respectively, the direct and moderating influence of certainty, the direct and moderating influence of accessibility, and, finally, both types of attitude strength. In each of these models, the tables present the coefficients and corrected standard errors for the substantive variables.         "
"19","The first column in Table 1 presents the results without the attitude strength measures. The results here are as expected. Partisanship, perceptions of character traits, and policy disagreement are all significant predictors of the overall evaluation and in the expected direction. Respondents of the same party as the candidate viewed him more favorably, as did those who perceived his character traits more positively, and disagreed with his policy positions less.         "
"20","The second column adds both the direct effect of certainty and its moderating influence over issue disagreement. The interaction term is negative, as expected, and statistically significant. The direct effect of certainty on the evaluations is not discernible from zero. The direct effect of the policy disagreement term indicates the impact of policy disagreement on those who are completely uncertain of where the candidate stands (where the certainty measure is zero). For these respondents, the connection between the policy attitude and their evaluation is not discernible from zero. Partisanship and the trait measure are positive and significant."
"21","The third column of Table 1 produces the results for the accessibility only model. These results are different from the certainty model. Accessibility does not moderate the use of policy attitudes—the interaction term is insignificant and incorrectly signed. Additionally, the added collinearity from the interaction terms has inflated the standard error of the policy term, rendering it insignificant. Partisanship and trait perceptions are positive and remain significant.         "
"22","The final column of Table 1 reports the key test; the model that compares the moderating influence of both certainty and accessibility. The evidence is clear. The certainty interaction is statistically significant while the accessibility interaction is insignificant and incorrectly signed. Certainty moderates the use of policy disagreement and accessibility does not. Even when we control for the levels of accessibility and any potential moderating influence of accessibility on policy attitudes, respondents still rely on the degree of certainty they have about the candidates when they connect issues to evaluations. Based on the direct effect issue coefficient, policy attitudes do not seem to matter for those who are most uncertain about the policy positions of the candidates. Finally, the trait perceptions and partisanship are positively and significantly related to candidate evaluations.         "
"23","A second way to examine the impact of the moderators is by developing roughly comparable metrics of the two. The basic approach is to determine if we change the policy term by one standard deviation (4.7 units), how big of a change in the candidate evaluation do we see as we change the levels of certainty and accessibility. The differences are striking. At the most uncertain level (certainty equal zero), the expectation for a one‐standard‐deviation change in the issue disagreement measure is about 0.10, or one‐twentieth of a standard deviation of the 10‐point evaluation scale. At the mid point (certainty equal to one, which is also the mode), this same standard deviation change in the issue measure results in a 0.60 point change in evaluations, a change of about a quarter of a standard deviation. For the most certain (certainty equal to two), the overall effect of is almost a 1.10 change in the evaluation, around half of a standard deviation on this scale."
"24","Accessibility has a much smaller moderating influence. Ignoring for the moment the statistical insignificance of these changes, the substantive effects are small. This same standard deviation change in the issue measure produces between a 0.10‐ and 0.49‐point shift in the evaluation of the candidate over the range of observed accessibility scores (1.00–5.38 seconds). In other words, the range of the influence of issues on evaluations over levels of accessibility, the best indicator of how strong the moderating influence is, is less than one‐half the range of certainty. Thus, accessibility's impact as a moderator is substantially smaller."
"25","Accessibility's influence appears even smaller when examining its statistical significance in more detail. The nature of the multiplicative terms makes the statistical significance of these results difficult to interpret. Perhaps the best way is to ask how certain or accessible does a person's policy attitude need to be for issues to influence their candidate evaluation.8 For certainty, which is a scale ranging from zero to two, the effect of issues is distinguishable from zero if the respondent's certainty is above 0.85. In other words, if the person's average certainty was somewhat or completely certain, issues matter. Given the results presented in the table, the impact of issue disagreement is indistinguishable from zero for all levels of accessibility. Thus, its effect is both substantively small and statistically insignificant.         "
"26","The results presented indicate that certainty moderates the relation between policy disagreement and candidate evaluations and accessibility does not. This is suggestive about the role of campaigns. As argued above, if certainty moderates the ways in which voters learn and for attitudes about the candidates, then voters are likely to use more information than if they simply rely on what happens to be accessible in memory. Campaign events and single news items may matter to the attitudes of voters but only to the extent that they are new and noteworthy."
"27","These results are suggestive of the source of campaign effects. While most scholars agree that campaigns matter, they differ on why. Most notably, Johnston et al. (1992) argue that campaigns work by changing the accessibility voters have about specific issues; a picture of tremendous campaign effects. Gelman and King (1993), in contrast, present a more muted model of campaign effects. They argue that campaigns work by “enlightening” voters about the candidates, presumably reducing voters' uncertainty (as the model presented by Alvarez specifically posits). Campaigns, to them, serve a largely informative role, helping voters connect their preferences with the choices the parties offer. Thus, the differing types of attitude strength directly tie to specific models of campaign effects with drastically different implications about the role of campaigns and voters. The results here support the Gelman and King “Enlightenment” model. The individual level mechanism in these results is certainty, suggesting that if campaigns matter, they matter because they inform voters about the candidates.         "
"28","These results suggest the importance and validity of this approach to attitude strength. The overreliance on accessibility as the measure of attitude strength used by researchers may lead to inaccurate conclusions about the psychological processes of interest. This is a conclusion reached elsewhere (Miller and Krosnick 2000; Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997) but is a point worth making again. Because of the ease of use, these accessibility measures are becoming widely used as a measure of attitude strength in political science (Bassili 2000). It may very well be that these measures are becoming too easy. Instead of attempting to develop a theory as to why accessibility is the appropriate type of attitude strength, researchers may simply be using it because of its availability. These measures may be easy to develop and include in a study, but they may not be an accurate depiction of the underlying psychological process in all of the instances where they are used.         "
"29","The results also speak to the question of heterogeneity in voter decision making. As noted above, there is tremendous inconsistency in the extant literature about which voters used issues when voting. Part of the inconsistency in the research may stem from a poor choice of moderators. The added flexibility that measures of attitude strength provide may help document more clearly the differences across voters. Based on these results, voters who are more certain about the candidates use issues more than those who are uncertain. This largely confirms the conclusion found elsewhere (Alvarez 1998). This study, however, is the first to demonstrate that certainty is the appropriate moderator, even when one controls for other possible influences.         "
