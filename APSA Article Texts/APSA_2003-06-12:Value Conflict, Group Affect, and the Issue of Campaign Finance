"1","We begin by examining the use of framing in the campaign finance debate. Framing has been described as a “process by which a communication source … defines and constructs a political issue or public controversy” (Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997, 567). Elite discourse has structured the campaign finance debate along two alternative, often conflicting, frames. Each of these frames constructs the issue in a different way and each recommends a different course of policy action. Elite frames are politically consequential because “frames in communication”—the words, images, or presentation style used by a speaker—are believed to shape “frames in thought”—an individual's cognitive understanding of a particular situation (Druckman 2002). Frames influence public opinion by making certain considerations more accessible (Iyengar 1991; Kinder and Sanders 1996; Price and Tewksbury 1997; Zaller 1992) or by making these considerations seem more important in judgment situations (Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997; Nelson and Oxley 1999; Nelson, Oxley, and Clawson 1997).         "
"2","Opponents of reform have argued that campaign contributions and expenditures, are, at root, forms of political speech (McConnell 2001; Smith 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001). As forms of political speech, they submit, such actions are entitled to constitutional protection under the free speech clause of the First Amendment. They argue that laws restricting the use of money in campaigns should be subject to strict scrutiny; that is, they should be presumed to be unconstitutional and should be sustained only through the demonstration of a compelling government interest. Under this “political speech” frame, campaign finance regulations are implied to be unconstitutional impingements upon freedom of expression.            "
"3","The notion of money as speech in American jurisprudence can be traced back to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Buckley v. Valeo (1976). At principal issue in Buckley was the constitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign Act's restrictions on campaign contributions and expenditures (Sorauf 1992). In striking down the FECA's expenditure limits, the Court asserted:            "
"4","                              "
"5","A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money … The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive models of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech (Buckley v. Valeo 1976, emphasis added).                  "
"6","While the Court did not say that money is speech, it essentially ruled that money might be necessary to engage in certain forms of speech. By linking money to speech, the Court extended considerable constitutional protection to candidate expenditures.            "
"7","The Court, however, has frequently ruled that freedom of speech is legitimately suppressed when a compelling government interest is at stake. With respect to the contribution limits imposed by the FECA, the Court found that such an interest was at stake. The Court agreed that legislators had a compelling interest in preventing the reality and appearance of corruption and concluded that these “weighty interests” justified the limited effect upon First Amendment freedoms imposed by contribution ceilings. In both its decision to overturn expenditure limits and its decision to uphold contribution limits, the Court's language lent support to the notion of money as political speech. The fundamental difference in these decisions was whether government interests justified restrictions on speech; the Court said no in the former case and yes in the latter."
"8","While some legal scholars contend that neither campaign expenditures nor contributions deserve protection as political speech (Wright 1976, 1982), others insist that both actions are entitled to such protection (Smith 2001). Indeed, the ACLU recently referred to the McCain‐Feingold bill, the leading piece of reform legislation, as “a recipe for political repression because it egregiously violates the longstanding free speech rights in several ways: It stifles issue advocacy in violation of the First Amendment; it criminalizes any constitutionally‐protected contact that groups and individuals may have with candidates” (Murphy and Gora 2001). In sum, the argument that money constitutes political speech remains the leading source of opposition to campaign finance reform among political elites.            "
"9","A second approach, often embraced by proponents of reform, is to frame the issue as a question of political equality and influence. Apologists of reform suggest that economic inequalities pose a serious threat to political equality, as monied interests and wealthy individuals are believed to exert a disproportionate share of influence in the political process (Fiss 1996; Foley 1994; Hasen 1996, 1999; Neuborne 1999a, 1999b; Raskin and Bonifaz 1993; Sunstein 1994; Wertheimer and Manes 1994). While legislators are unlikely to engage in quid pro quo arrangements, contributors do have more access to legislators and thus an unequal voice in lawmaking.1 Indeed, it is this disparity in access that is most troubling to those concerned about political equality:            "
"10","                              "
"11","The main issue remains the availability of the extra opportunities to persuade. Such opportunities resulting from campaign contributions corrupt the central relationships of mass, democratic representative government by permitting some citizens to acquire a preferred representational avenue, to be listened to more promptly or more intently or more often. (Sorauf 2002)                  "
"12","Such inequities in the ability to exercise political voice are troubling for democratic theory since political contributors are known to be highly unrepresentative of the American electorate (Sorauf 1992; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). A recent empirical study argues that, under the current campaign finance regime, the political system is biased in favor of economic interests (Gais 1998). To overcome such bias, reformers argue, we require a system that views political equality as a weighty government interest and takes active steps to achieve it.            "
"13","Equality‐based arguments in support of stricter campaign finance regulations date back to the pre‐Buckley era (Adamany and Agree 1975; Nicholson 1974). Rejecting this line of argument in no uncertain terms, the Court declared, “the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the voices of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment” (Buckley v. Valeo 1976). The Court did, however, recognize a legitimate legislative interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption; it was on this basis alone that the Court upheld the FECA's contribution limits. Through its decision, the Buckley Court signaled that concern for corruption, but not for equality, was a sufficient ground for government restriction of speech.            "
"14","Despite Buckley, many legal scholars continue to advocate the use of equality‐based arguments as justification for stricter campaign finance regulations. As one such scholar concedes, though, “[m]uch of the effort to restrict the size and source of campaign contributions is equality‐driven; in order to survive Buckley, however, this effort must masquerade as an effort to prevent corruption” (Neuborne 1999b, 1055–6). As observed by Smith (2001), equality‐based arguments for reform have generally proceeded along two tracks. One argument invokes the First Amendment and claims that all citizens deserve an equal chance to be heard in the political process (Fiss 1996; Neuborne 1999a, 1999b; Sunstein 1994). The other argues that political equality is guaranteed under the equal protection clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (Foley 1994; Hasen 1996, 1999; Raskin and Bonifaz 1993). Such arguments recently made their way to the floor of the U.S. Congress during the debate over campaign finance reform: “[T]he heart of [the U.S.] political system is equality … the economic system has inequality, but in the political system people are supposed to have equality. That is also the answer to those who say that somehow this violates freedom of expression in the first amendment” (Frank, D‐MA, 2002). In short, equality‐based arguments are at the forefront of elite discourse on campaign finance.            "
"15","Political psychologists have long noted that the public, while extremely supportive of democratic principles in the abstract, is less willing to endorse such principles in concrete political situations (Chong 1993; Kuklinski et al. 1991; Marcus et al. 1995; Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus 1982). This gap between principle and practice exists, in large part, because politics does not take place in a vacuum; “[c]lashes over rights take place not in the abstract but in the crucible of policy choices” (Sniderman et al. 1996, 26). Since policy choices often carry positive or negative consequences for particular social and political groups, citizens' support for democratic principles in such situations is often shaped by their affect toward the groups involved. Chong (1993) reports that citizens, when rendering judgments involving democratic values, are influenced not only by considerations of the rights at stake, but also by considerations of the group whose rights are at stake. Marcus et al. (1995) find that tolerance judgments are influenced by “standing decisions”—individuals' attitudes toward the rights in question—and by “contemporary information”—the nature of the group whose rights are in question. Similarly, Kuklinski et al. (1991) suggest that attitudes concerning the application of democratic principles are based on cognitive judgments of the rights in question and on affective judgments toward the group in question. Moreover, they find, affective reactions toward the group in question exert a greater share of influence on individuals' tolerance judgments.         "
"16","Reference groups are important elements of political discourse because they help individuals to organize their political thinking on complex policy issues (Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991). As one team of scholars has put it, “[p]ublic opinion on matters of government policy is group‐centric: shaped in powerful ways by the attitudes citizens posses toward the social groups they see as the principal beneficiaries (or victims) of the policy” (Nelson and Kinder 1996, 1055–6). In essence, individuals' attitudes toward particular policies are shaped by the perceived impact of those policies on political friends and foes. Citizens tend to support policies perceived to benefit groups they like and oppose policies perceived to benefit groups they dislike.         "
"17","The group‐centric nature of public opinion has been observed in a variety of settings. Individuals' willingness to support a group's constitutional rights is conditioned by their feelings toward the group in question (Kuklinski et al. 1991; Marcus et al. 1995; Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus 1982). Considerations of group interest shape individuals' attitudes toward the protection of language rights, resulting in the application of a “double standard” toward different linguistic groups (Sniderman et al. 1989b). Group‐centric effects have surfaced in people's attitudes toward government aid to the poor (Feldman 1983; Kluegel and Smith 1986). Group‐based judgments have also been shown to influence the relationship between economic perceptions and presidential evaluations (Mutz and Mondak 1997).         "
"18","Although the effects of group centrism in public opinion are pervasive, these effects are not equally powerful in all cases; “[t]he importance of group sentiment in public opinion depends on how issues are framed in elite debate” (Nelson and Kinder 1996, 1058). In particular, Nelson and Kinder argue that group‐centric effects are more likely to occur when issue frames highlight the connection between government policy and a particular group.         "
"19","The effects of group centrism should be particularly pronounced in public attitudes toward matters of campaign finance, we believe, because of the central role than groups play in the campaign finance system. If politics is the game of who gets what and how much, then interest groups are among the most active and experienced players. According to the Federal Election Commission (2001), PACs and other interest groups contributed $245.5 million dollars to congressional candidates during the 1999–2000 election cycle and accounted for 32% of all monies raised by House candidates during the 2000 campaign. These numbers reflect a 19% increase from the amount given in the previous cycle and do not include the millions of additional dollars spent by interest groups in the form of independent expenditures and issue advocacy ads. Clearly, interest groups play a prominent role in our campaign finance system."
"20","As noted above, the issue of campaign finance creates a potential conflict between the democratic values of expression and equality. We contend that citizens' endorsement of these values in the context of campaign finance will be heavily influenced by contextual information such as the nature of the group whose rights and influence are perceived to be at stake. Specifically, we hypothesize that individuals will voice greater support for the speech rights of interest groups that they like than for those of groups that they dislike. In addition, we hypothesize that individuals will express greater concern about the influence exerted by interest groups that they dislike than about the influence of groups that they like."
"21","Though we expect to find evidence of group centrism across all individuals, we anticipate that the effects of group centrism will be moderated by issue frame. The language of rights, by definition, conveys a certain sense of universal entitlement. Issue frames that employ such language may inspire greater attitudinal consistency by encouraging citizens to engage in “principled” rather than “situational” reasoning (Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991). Terms like equality and influence, on the other hand, invariably invite comparisons between particular groups. Since frames that underscore the connections between government policies and particular groups enhance group‐centric effects (Nelson and Kinder 1996), we expect that the effects of group centrism will be more pronounced when campaign finance is framed as an issue of political equality and influence than when it is framed in terms of political speech and rights.         "
"22","When judging the merits of campaign finance reform, citizens must weigh and balance the values of expression and equality; “[w]hat we have is two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You can't have both” (Gephardt 1997). Would campaign finance reform unfairly restrict groups' right to freedom of expression, or would it promote a healthier democracy by promoting political equality? How do citizens make the required tradeoff between these two values? A group‐centric theory of campaign finance attitudes predicts that individuals' decisional calculus will be influenced by their affect toward the group in question. When the group referent is a liked group, we anticipate that support for groups' rights will be weighted more heavily in citizens' judgments about campaign finance than concern for groups' influence. Conversely, when the referent is a disliked group, we expect that concern for groups' influence will be weighted more heavily than support for groups' rights.         "
"23","Informed by innovations in the political tolerance literature (e.g., Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus 1982), we employ a two‐stage experimental procedure that enables us to create and analyze “content‐controlled” measures of individuals' campaign finance attitudes. In the self‐anchoring stage, we randomly assigned survey respondents to one of three conditions: a least‐liked group condition, a most‐liked group condition, and a general or nonspecific group condition. This self‐anchoring process enabled us to measure and record citizens' affect toward particular interest groups. In the evaluative stage of the experiment, we exploited this information by manipulating interest group referents in a series of attitudinal questions about groups' rights and influence in the campaign finance system. Our experiment enables us (1) to examine how group affect structures citizens' attitudes toward groups' rights and influence and (2) to observe how group affect regulates the effects of such attitudes on citizens' support for campaign finance reform.            "
"24","The data used in this study are taken from the 2000 American Politics Study (APS), a large computer‐assisted‐telephone‐interview (CATI) survey of the American adult population. This survey was conducted for the authors by the Center for Survey Research at The Ohio State University in the weeks following the 2000 elections.1 Sampling relied on a random‐digit dialing process that made it possible to contact any household in the 48 contiguous states and Washington D.C. The APS consists of a large random sample of voting‐age adults and, for purposes unrelated to this article, a small oversample of respondents from six states in the Great Lakes region (IL, IN, MI, MN, OH, and WI).1 The sample includes data from 1,229 respondents.            "
"25","Content‐controlled measures are designed to avoid contaminating attitudinal measures with the contents of individuals' political beliefs (Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus 1982). Like political tolerance, campaign finance attitudes are subject to contamination by individuals' affect toward particular groups. For example, if we simply asked respondents whether they supported the speech rights of a particular interest group, our measure might tap both their general support for the speech rights of interest groups and their feelings toward the group referent. While such contamination cannot be completely eliminated, it can be controlled. By asking people whether they support the speech rights of their least‐liked interest group, we can effectively control for respondents' affect toward the group referent. We may, Sullivan and colleagues argue, “view the groups selected by different respondents as having an equivalent meaning for all of them, even though they may select different groups” (Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus 1982, 63).            "
"26","While at one level we wish to control for the attitudinal contamination produced by group affect, at another level we wish to induce and exploit such contamination for analytical advantage. To this end, we performed a between‐subjects experiment in which we measured respondents' attitudes toward their least‐ or their most‐liked group. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: a least‐liked group condition, a most‐liked group condition, and a general (nonspecific group) condition. Each of the three conditions had approximately 400 respondents (N = 410, 414, and 405, respectively).1 Importantly, our between‐subjects design addresses a leading criticism of the least‐liked group measurement strategy; “[i]n order to tell if dislike is a necessary condition of tolerance it is necessary to take account of people's reactions not only to groups they dislike but also to groups they are indifferent to or possibly even like” (Sniderman et al. 1989a, 41). By inquiring about the rights and influence of both liked and disliked interest groups, our study enables us to isolate the effects of group affect on the public's campaign finance attitudes.            "
"27","Respondents in the least‐liked condition were asked to identify their least‐liked group from a predetermined and randomly ordered list of ten interest groups.1 Respondents in the most‐liked group condition were read the same list of ten groups but were asked to identify the interest group that they liked the most. The group selected by each respondent was recorded for later use. Respondents in the third (general) condition were not asked to identify a liked or disliked group.            "
"28"," Table 1 reports the percentage of respondents that named each of the ten groups as their most‐ or least‐liked interest group. Column three reports each group's “likeability,” which was obtained by subtracting column two from column one. A value above zero, for example, indicates that a higher percentage of the public named a particular group as their most‐liked group than as their least‐liked group. Of the groups considered, environmentalists and pro‐life groups emerge as the most‐liked interest groups. The percentage of Americans naming these two groups as their most‐liked interest group exceeds the percentage naming them as their least‐liked group by at least a factor of five. With likeability measures well below zero, trial lawyers, the tobacco lobby, and gay rights groups are the three least popular interest groups on the list. Public affect toward the NRA is particularly intriguing. Approximately 14% of the public named the NRA as their most‐liked group (fourth‐highest score). However, approximately 15% of the public named the NRA as their least‐liked group (third‐highest score). This mixture of support and disdain is reflected by a likeability measure very near zero (−0.8). It should again be noted that the identity of individuals' most‐ or least‐liked group is, for analytical purposes, largely irrelevant. Least‐ and most‐liked groups are assumed to be functionally equivalent across respondents.            "
"29","After the self‐anchoring stage of the experiment was completed, respondents in all three experimental conditions were asked how strongly they agreed or disagreed with a series of ten randomly ordered arguments concerning interest groups and campaign finance. As shown in Table 2, five of these arguments framed campaign finance in terms of interest group rights and five framed it in terms of interest group influence. Individuals in the least‐liked group condition had their least‐liked interest group inserted as the group referent. Respondents in the most‐liked group condition had their most‐liked interest group inserted. For respondents in the general condition, the term “interest groups” was used in lieu of any particular interest group.            "
"30","The first five arguments listed in Table 2 were designed to frame campaign finance as an issue of group rights. As can be seen, the language used in these arguments encouraged respondents to think of campaign finance in terms of expression and rights. Respondents were asked whether contributions from a group are a “legitimate form of political expression,” whether a group “should be allowed to contribute,” and whether a group “has the right” to oppose elected officials by contributing to their challengers. Respondents were also queried about their attitudes toward possible infringements upon free expression, such as whether a group's contributions “should be banned” and whether a group “should be restricted from spending lots of money” in its pursuit of electoral advantage.            "
"31","The remaining five arguments in Table 2 were designed to frame campaign finance as an issue of group influence. Here the language invited respondents to think of campaign finance in terms of equality and influence. Respondents were asked whether a group's contributions give it “too much political influence” or “more influence than the average citizen.” Respondents were also asked whether a group's contributions “corrupt the political process” or “help to improve public policy.” Finally, we asked respondents whether legal steps were needed to “reduce the political influence” of a group. By comparing responses across experimental conditions, we can observe the extent of group centrism in the public's campaign finance attitudes. We can also observe whether the magnitude of such group‐centric effects is conditioned by issue frame.1"
"32"," Table 3 reports the mean responses to the ten campaign finance arguments by experimental condition. Table entries in the top five rows are the mean agreement score with the arguments framing campaign finance as an issue of group influence. Table entries in the bottom five rows are the mean agreement score with the arguments framing campaign finance as an issue of group rights. All mean scores have been rescaled to have a range from zero to one. Bracketed words have been added to signal that the polarity of certain arguments has been reversed. Higher mean scores indicate greater agreement with the row statements; higher values indicate (1) greater support for group rights or (2) greater concern for group influence.         "
"33","A group‐centric theory of campaign finance attitudes predicts that concern for interest groups' influence will be higher when the referent is a group that one dislikes than when it is a group that one likes. To test this hypothesis, we performed difference in means tests across experimental conditions for the five arguments concerning group influence. By comparing the first and second data columns of Table 3, we observe that the mean agreement score is higher in the least‐liked condition for all five arguments concerning group influence. The magnitude of these differences ranges from 0.07 to 0.29, with an average difference of 0.18. These results, all of which are statistically significant, demonstrate that concern for interest groups' influence in the campaign finance system is heightened when one harbors negative affect toward the group in question.         "
"34","A group‐centric theory also anticipates that support for groups' rights will be higher when the referent is a liked group than when it is a disliked group. Differences in means tests again provide empirical support for our theoretical expectations. As shown in Table 3, the mean response in the most‐liked condition is higher than that in the least‐liked condition for all five arguments. The magnitude of these differences ranges from 0.10 to 0.14, with an average difference of 0.12. These five differences, all of which are statistically significant, confirm that support for interest groups' rights is conditioned by group affect. In short, individuals are more likely to support the political speech of groups that they like than they are to support the speech of groups that they dislike.         "
"35","The above findings underscore the group‐centric nature of public opinion on matters of campaign finance. But is the magnitude of these effects uniform across issue frames? To test whether the magnitude of the group‐centric effects is conditioned by issue frame, we created an index of support for groups' rights and an index of concern for groups' influence and compared them across experimental conditions.1 As can be seen in Table 3, the difference between the most‐ and least‐liked conditions on the Rights Index is 0.12 (p < .01) while the difference between these two conditions on the Influence Index is 0.18 (p < .01). By comparing the magnitude of these group‐centric effects across issue frames, we observe that effects of group centrism are, as hypothesized, stronger when campaign finance is framed as an issue of equality and influence than when it is framed in terms of expression and rights (0.06, p < .05).         "
"36","The moderating influence of issue frames can also be seen by observing the proximity of citizens' responses to the neutral position on the attitudinal scales (i.e., 0.50). When campaign finance is framed as an issue of group influence, the mean responses for the most‐ and least‐liked conditions are on opposite sides of the neutral point in four out of five instances. When campaign finance is framed as an issue of group rights, however, the mean responses for the most‐ and least‐liked conditions are on opposite sides of the neutral point in only one out of five cases. Moreover, the mean scores for Rights Index are above the neutral point in both the most‐ and the least‐liked condition. These results suggest that, as expected, attitudinal consistency is greater when campaign finance is framed as an issue of rights than when it is framed in terms of influence."
"37","For purposes of comparison, Table 3 also reports the mean responses for those in a general condition. As can be seen, the public reacts more negatively in the general condition than in the most‐liked condition for all ten of the campaign finance arguments. That is, the public is more supportive of groups' rights and less concerned about groups' influence when the referent is a most‐liked group than when the referent is simply “interest groups.” Surprisingly, though, the public appears to react as negatively in the general condition as in the least‐liked condition. On both the Rights Index and the Influence Index, respondents in the least‐liked condition and the general condition are statistically indistinguishable from each other. These results suggest that the term “interest groups” is not content‐neutral in the public mind.         "
"38","To assess the magnitude of group affect's effects relative to those of other potentially influential factors,Table 4 presents our experimental results as regression equations. As shown in the first data column, concern for interest groups' influence is greater among Democrats, Independents, the well educated, and those with greater knowledge of the campaign finance system.1 Individuals who feel that government is responsive, namely those with higher levels of political efficacy, are less likely to be concerned about groups' influence. Respondents in the least‐liked group and general conditions scored approximately 19% higher on the Influence Index than those in the most‐liked group condition. As can be seen, the effects of group affect exceed those of all other variables in the model.         "
"39","The second data column in Table 4 reports the determinants of support for groups' rights. In general, support for interest groups' speech rights is higher among Republicans, the politically efficacious, and the politically tolerant. As described in Appendix B, our measure of political tolerance asked respondents whether society should have to “put up with” those whose political ideas were extremely different from the majority and is intended to provide some indication of respondents' “standing decision” toward the value of free speech (Marcus et al. 1995). Respondents in the least‐liked group and general conditions scored about 13% and 15% lower on the Rights Index than those in the most‐liked group condition. The size of these effects is greater than those associated with partisanship, campaign finance knowledge, education, and other demographic factors.1 The effects of group affect on support for groups' speech rights are roughly equivalent in magnitude to those of political efficacy and political tolerance. Importantly, the inconsistencies produced by group affect are negated by political tolerance when campaign finance is framed as an issue of rights.         "
"40","The issue of campaign finance reform poses a potential conflict between the values of expression and equality. How do citizens resolve this conflict? We have argued that group affect will not only influence the formation of citizens' attitudes toward interest groups' rights and influence, but will also condition the effects of such attitudes on citizens' support for campaign finance reform. Specifically, we hypothesized that support for groups' rights would be weighted more heavily in citizens' judgments than concern for groups' influence when the referent is a liked group and the reverse when the referent is a disliked group. To test these hypotheses, we estimated an ordered probit model of support for reform for each of the three experimental conditions.1 The results of that model are reported in Table 5. At principal issue in this analysis is the stability of the coefficients representing support for groups' rights and concern for groups' influence across experimental conditions. The model also controlled for a number of potentially relevant factors, including partisanship, campaign finance knowledge, political efficacy, and demographic traits.         "
"41","The arguments underlying both sides of the campaign finance reform debate are premised upon two fundamental assumptions. First, reformers assume that by increasing public concern over political inequality and interest groups' influence, they will increase support for reform. Second, opponents of reform assume that by increasing support for freedom of expression and interest groups' rights, they will decrease support for reform. The results in the first data column of Table 5 provide empirical support for both assumptions. When the identity of the group referent is unknown (i.e., interest groups), support for groups' rights is inversely related to support for reform. Conversely, concern for groups' influence is positively related to support for reform. When the identity of the group referent is unknown, citizens are naturally unable to use group affect as a means of resolving value conflict. The result, as Table 5 makes clear, is that both values are incorporated into citizens' judgments about campaign finance reform.         "
"42","Do both values always enter into citizens' decisional calculus? The second data column reports the results of the model for those in the least‐liked group condition. As concern over the influence of disliked groups rises, so too does support for campaign finance reform. Strikingly, however, the coefficient representing support for groups' rights is no longer statistically significant and is incorrectly signed. Put another way, support for the rights of disliked groups does not diminish support for reform. As shown in the third data column, a similar but reversed pattern occurs for those in the most‐liked group condition. Support for the rights of liked groups decreases support for reform while concern over the influence of liked groups has no effect.1"
"43","To illustrate the magnitude of these effects, Table 6 reports the changes in the predicted probabilities of support for reform given particular combinations of the explanatory variables.1 These “first differences” represent the effect of the Influence Index and the Rights Index under each of the three experimental conditions while all other variables are held constant. The asymmetric effects produced by group affect are again quite evident. In the most‐liked group condition, for example, a positive change in the Rights Index decreases the likelihood that respondents want the campaign finance system either changed or replaced by 0.19. For those in the least‐liked condition, an identical change in the Rights Index actually increases this likelihood by 0.03. In contrast, the effects of the Influence Index on support for reform are considerably more pronounced in the least‐liked group condition than in the most‐liked group condition.         "
"44","The above results suggest that the effects of citizens' attitudes concerning interest groups' rights and influence on support for campaign finance reform are structured by group affect. When considering a disliked group, concerns over political inequality are weighted more heavily than the protection of political expression.1 When considering a liked group, however, the protection of groups' rights matters more than concerns about groups' inequality. Only in the general condition, whose unknown referent of interest groups does not encourage group‐centric bias by inviting respondents to think about a liked or disliked group, do both factors influence citizens' judgments about campaign finance reform.         "
"45","Finally, while partisanship appears to have little direct effect on citizens' attitudes toward campaign finance reform, it does have an indirect effect via individuals' attitudes toward groups' rights and influence. As demonstrated earlier in Table 4, Democrats and Independents are more concerned about groups' influence and less supportive of groups' speech rights than are Republicans. Attitudes toward groups' rights and influence, in turn, are strongly, though sometimes selectively, related to one's support for campaign finance reform.         "
"46","The question of citizens' commitment to democratic values is of fundamental concern to democratic theory. Of equal importance is the question of how citizens resolve conflicts between competing democratic values. The issue of campaign finance reform provides an opportunity to consider these questions in the context of a controversial and contemporaneous policy debate. This study reports the results of a national survey specifically designed to exploit this opportunity."
"47","Combining the analytical advantages of experimental analysis with the representativeness of a national survey, this study has investigated the role that group affect plays in structuring public opinion on the issue of campaign finance. This article makes three important contributions. First, we demonstrate that citizens' commitment to the values of expression and equality in the campaign finance system is shaped by their feelings toward those whose rights and influence are perceived to be at stake. Citizens were more willing to support the political speech of interest groups that they liked than to support the speech of groups that they disliked. Conversely, citizens were more deeply concerned about the inequalities generated by groups that they disliked than about those triggered by groups that they liked. From the standpoint of democratic theory, these findings are somewhat discouraging because they suggest that citizens' commitment to democratic values is sensitive to contextual information."
"48","Second, our analysis shows that the effects of group affect on citizens' commitment to democratic values are conditioned by issue frame. Specifically, we found that the effects of group affect were smaller when campaign finance was framed as an issue of expression and rights than when it was framed in terms of equality and influence. The implications of this finding for democratic theory are much more encouraging. The situations in which citizens were asked to think of an issue in terms of rights—a term that implies universal entitlement—are precisely the situations in which they were least likely to engage in group‐centric thinking. Moreover, the mean score on the Rights Index was at or above the neutral point in all three experimental conditions. This suggests that by framing issues in the language of rights, elites can increase the likelihood that citizens will engage in principled rather than situational reasoning. Equally encouraging is our finding that, under the group rights frame, the positive effects of political tolerance effectively counter the negative effects of group‐centric bias. This finding suggests that commitment to the abstract principle of political tolerance counterbalances the attitudinal inconsistencies produced by group affect during the actual application of speech rights."
"49","Finally, this study provides new insight into the question of how citizens resolve conflicts between competing democratic values when forming their policy attitudes. After evaluating the rights and influence of a liked group, considerations of speech rights were weighted more heavily in citizens' decisional calculus than concerns about groups' undue influence. After evaluating a disliked group, however, beliefs about groups' rights were sacrificed in favor of concerns about groups' influence. Consistent with the work of Nelson and colleagues (Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley 1997; Nelson and Oxley 1999; Nelson, Oxley, and Clawson 1997), these group‐based effects suggest that framing influences public opinion by making certain considerations seem more important than others in judgment situations. More importantly, these findings suggest that affect plays a decisive role in helping citizens to resolve conflicts between democratic values. In this respect, affect functions as “information” that can be used to inform citizens' political judgments (Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen 2000; Rahn 2000).         "
"50","That affect can be used to inform citizens' decisional calculus does not, of course, imply that the resulting judgments are consistent with the expectations of democratic citizenship. Indeed, perhaps the most disturbing finding of this study is the biased manner in which citizens use affective information to balance competing values. Not only do the results suggest that citizens are motivated by group affect to protect the rights of liked groups and restrict the influence of disliked groups, but also they suggest that citizens apply different sets of principles in their evaluations of campaign finance reform based on whether their affect toward the group in question is positive or negative. By influencing which set of principles is brought to bear, group affect ends up shaping citizens' attitudes toward reform itself."
"51","The implications of this finding extend to the political tolerance literature. Students of political tolerance have noted that not only does threat shape citizens' political judgments, it also affects the judgment process itself by making people more attentive to contemporary information at the expense of their standing commitment to democratic principles (Marcus et al. 1995). The results of this study suggest that group affect can similarly influence citizens' judgment process by making people more attentive to one set of democratic principles at the expense of another. What makes this biased reasoning particularly troubling is that it operates on an issue like campaign finance reform. The occurrence of affectively induced bias in political judgments is apparently not confined to narrow and emotion‐laden issues such as whether white supremacist groups should be allowed to hold a public rally. Such bias surfaces even in decisions about more mainstream and less emotionally charged issues like whether to reform the campaign finance system.         "
