"1","The argument begins by returning to matter covered in the first three chapters of Volume I of Democracy in America and revising what now seems to be an incomplete treatment. When first examining the earliest settlements in New England, Tocqueville described the emergence of important pre‐constitutional laws or norms. For example, “the law of laws” in the United States, popular sovereignty (DA 59), derived from customs, beliefs, and habits brought by the earliest British settlers to their new local communities. The emphasis in Tocqueville's study of these pre‐constitutional factors was explaining the comparatively easy transition toward a strong form of democracy in the early colonies. But there is a certain manifest incompleteness in the analysis of these foundations, as the return to the problem in I.2.9 reveals. What are the implications for democracy of the unprecedented invigoration of commerce in the early settlements?         "
"2","Tocqueville noted that the original settlers, despite their religious fervor, accepted the legitimacy of the pursuit of “self‐interest” (DA 79, 82). The point was not pressed to the ultimate negation of their religious beliefs, but, as practitioners of the so‐called protestant ethic in a manner anticipating Weber's thesis, the settlers devoted themselves to advancing their interests while at the same time adhering to a comparatively strict rule of life. They pressed “with almost equal eagerness” toward “either material wealth or moral delights, either heaven in the next world or prosperity and freedom in this” (DA 47). The original settlers attend to both morality and wealth, but a difficult choice looms if it comes to a conflict, and the difficulty is all the greater the more plausible the hope for material satisfaction. The extent of the temptation is intensified as the country expands south and west. The democratic and commercial ethos penetrates rapidly into nearly every sphere of civil society as settlers from the coasts moved inland, leaving the practices of colonial New England behind and creating societies of “speculators and adventurers” (DA 200; cf. 225, 302–03)."
"3","The beneficial components of the “Accidental or Providential Causes Helping to Maintain a Democratic Republic in the United States” are the absence of close neighbors, the lack of major wars, the minimal need for a military establishment, and finally a “general prosperity.” Inexpensive land can always be found “somewhere to the west” (DA 281). The broad prosperity is helpful: “General prosperity favors stability in all governments, but particularly a democratic one.” Such “material prosperity” is “one of the great reasons for the success of their laws” (DA 281). Yet general prosperity under these particular conditions also reaches further, molding opinions and passions. “One must go to America to understand the power of material prosperity over political behavior, and even over opinions too, though these should be subject to reason alone” (DA 285)."
"4","In characterizing the influence of this prosperity, Tocqueville appears to be of two minds. On the positive side, he thinks that among the people he observed, new “wants” are easily satisfied and so should not be feared; even “excessive passions” are easily fed. One might conclude that there can as a result hardly ever be “too much freedom” (DA 285). What might be regarded elsewhere as questionable forms of character—a “restless spirit, immoderate desire for wealth, and an extreme love of independence”—may contribute to “a long and peaceful future for the American republics” (DA 284). Nevertheless, in entertaining the possibility, illustrated in this commercial sphere, that “man's vices are almost as useful to society as his virtues” (DA 284), Tocqueville is compelled to take into account a famous argument of Montesquieu. Montesquieu contended that “virtue” had been essential to the perpetuation of popular republics (1989, III 3). In a note not included in the published version of DA, but illuminating an important line of thought that undergirds his entire discussion of maintaining democratic republics, Tocqueville observed that “The Americans are not a virtuous people yet certainly they are free.” But this fact, Tocqueville argues, ought not be taken to refute Montesquieu's contention about the importance of virtue, that “power which each individual exercises over himself which prevents him from violating the right of others,” provided we do not understand Montesquieu in a “narrow” sense. If we look at the matter with “the eyes of a moralist,” as Montesquieu perhaps did, then the motive is as important as the result, and the only salvation for a republic lies in the cultivation of genuine “virtue.” Considered in a less “narrow” perspective, the important issue is the effect achieved. Similar public results can possibly be achieved either through virtue or through the calculations of self‐interest or even simply by the absence of temptations. The moral quality of the action would then surely differ in the three cases, but the useful effects might follow as well from one source as from the other.2"
"5","But Tocqueville hints at reservations. The language used to characterize the passions regarded as acceptable in the United States is strong: “restless,”“immoderate,” and “extreme.” Moreover, he makes a larger point in telling the story of meeting a “rich planter,” French in origin, in a remote section of Pennsylvania. The planter, formerly a “leveler” and a “demagogue,” now is an ardent defender of “property rights,” having allowed his ideas to follow his economic condition (DA 285–86). The case illustrates the effect of “fortune” and “lucky circumstances” in shaping opinion. Moreover, the planter now has an idea of his own. He favors “regularity of mores” and even the value of “religious ideas” (DA 285–86). These notions bolster hierarchy, obedience to law, and regular habits. They discipline the citizens in preparation for the kind of work that supports successful enterprise.3 The planter sees the usefulness of virtue, but looks outside of business for the source of virtue. Religious conviction is no longer the origin of the ambition for worldly success, but rather the result, and it now appears in the guise of a means rather than an end. Self‐interest leads to a grasp of the need for virtue rather than to virtue itself.         "
"6","While contributing to the “success of the laws” (DA 281) and therefore to maintaining democracy, the hunger for greater prosperity encourages social and moral transformations. It inspires the movement of population from the settled and stable society to the unsettled. Moreover, the economic conditions breed a “restless burning passion which increases with satisfaction.” This “passion stronger than love of life” (DA 283) generates a distinctive moral viewpoint. Qualities once considered to be “vices” are now seen as “praiseworthy” (DA 284, 285). Furthermore the commercial passions supercede political concerns: “The passions that stir the Americans most deeply are commercial and not political ones, or rather they carry a trader's habits over into the business of politics” (DA 285). The combination of unusual geographical and economic conditions, with an open democratic political order, has furnished remarkable opportunities for a side of human nature, the hunger for well‐being, to flourish to an unusual degree.4 Under normal conditions, prosperity aids political stability. But does this particular combination of prosperity, commercial passions, and the mores supporting business activity furnish the truth about what is required to sustain a modern democracy?         "
"7","In the earliest era of settlement on the eastern coast, Tocqueville distinguished the New Englanders from the settlers in Virginia on the basis of their adherence to an “idea” (DA 36). That idea was composed of two elements, the “spirit of religion” and the “spirit of freedom” (DA 47), combined without great reliance on logic in a practical mode of life that supported the rudiments of democracy. The first settlers in Virginia, on the other hand, were “gold‐seekers,” and for that very reason hardly interested in or capable of political innovation (DA 34–35). His examination of the influence of economic conditions hints at the possible gradual distortion of the original idea under the pressure of a passion for well‐being emerging in conditions so extremely favorable to those gifted at pursuing it. Prosperity favors stability in all governments, and particularly in a democracy (DA 279–80). But when the pursuit of prosperity becomes the ruling passion, it could blend liberty and religion into a different synthesis that requires no exclusive loyalty to democracy. Might such an effect dismantle the “idea” that originated the democracy? Like the French planter, but for a different reason, Tocqueville sees that commercialism depends on something beyond itself if it is not to become destructive, and so he turns to the influence of “the laws” and “mores” (DA 287)."
"8","Tocqueville's argument contributes something new to a debate about the social, political, and moral effects of commerce and commercialism. Montesquieu had thought it “an almost general rule that everywhere there are gentle mores, there is commerce and that everywhere there is commerce, there are gentle mores,” but he added that while commerce improves “barbarous mores,” it also “corrupts pure mores” (1989, XX 1). He and others had believed the acquisitive passions activated in commercial republics might potentially be useful in controlling more violent and harsh passions, such as those for dominance and glory.5 The argument attracted those seeking a means to counterbalance the remnants of the feudal aristocracy and its supporters. Tocqueville accepts one of its principles at a general level insofar as he entertains the idea of commercial passions that can produce somewhat effective substitutes for strict political virtue. Yet his observations in DA are more decisively shaped by the specific circumstances he observed in America than by the conflicts between classes in Europe. In the present context, the main issue is not the competition between an aristocratic and a merchant class but the effects of mass prosperity and adventurous entrepreneurship in a setting where traditional social constraints are very weak. The opportunities for enrichment, when combined with the legitimization of the pursuit of self‐interest that was already noticeable in the outlook of the earliest settlers, breed passions which in an aristocratic past would have been treated with opprobrium but which in this case are neither disdained nor even feared. Tocqueville notes both the political utility of prosperity as well as the potential for extreme behavior in such conditions. Yet he also observed that some of those who succeed economically recognize, however vaguely, the value of certain mores as supports for commerce. Their view suggested to him a possible path from the ethic of commercial entrepreneurship to acknowledgment of a need for mores not just in support of business but in support of democracy itself. He seems in this way to grasp that democracy requires not just a “softening” of barbarous mores by means of commerce but also a means to constrain or limit the commercial passions themselves.         "
"9","Tocqueville passes over the question of “the laws” with little more than a word. At first he says that the “main object” of his book has been to “make American laws known” (DA 286). Yet it shortly becomes clear that, while he thinks American laws are reasonably successful, he has “reasons for thinking that mores are even more important” in explaining the political results so far achieved (DA 307).6 He revises the statement on the main purpose of his work: “If … I have not succeeded in making the reader feel the importance I attach to the practical experience of the Americans, to their habits, opinions, and, in a word, their mores, in maintaining their laws, I have failed in the main object of my work” (DA 308; cf. Richter 1970, 90). Between these two statements of his objective lies an attempt to account for the “moeurs,” or mores, of the democratic republic and to demonstrate not only that political democracy emerges from certain preexisting mores but that it continues to be dependent on them.            "
"10","The term “mores” is one, Tocqueville says, that he uses “in its original Latin meaning” (DA 287). In truth he broadens the term considerably. In its original meaning, apparently best known from a remark by Cicero, “mores” refers to unwritten yet authoritative customs of the ancestors.7 But Tocqueville says that he means it to refer not only to mores in the usual sense, i.e., “habits of the heart,” but also to “the different notions possessed by men, the various opinions current among them, and the sum of ideas that shape mental habits.” That is, in short, the “whole moral and intellectual state of a people” (DA 287).8 In Tocqueville's usage, no emphasis is placed on the inheritance of mores from ancient customs and ancestors, the antiquity of mores; and he includes in mores such a range of “mental” habits that what he means seems more akin to habits of practical reason and ethics rather than custom.            "
"11","Tocqueville's study of mores draws more from Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws than from any classical source and is in part an extended reflection on and development of his views.9 The idea that a “people” might have a coherent “moral and intellectual state,” or a set of opinions and ideas that could be summed, accepts the view that there can be or should be a coherent “spirit” behind the laws. Montesquieu shows that “mores and manners, the institutions of the nation in general” (1989, XIX 14), can exercise great influence over citizens or subjects. The influence of mores can be so extensive that coercive laws are hardly needed to back them up (as in the example of Sparta). Among the Romans, the “maxims of government and the ancient mores” prevail to set the tone. In general, “mores and manners are usages that laws have not established.”“The difference between laws and mores is that, while laws regulate the actions of the citizen, mores regulate the actions of the man. The difference between mores and manners is that the first are more concerned with internal, and the latter external, conduct” (1989, XIX 16).10 However, it seems that the relation between mores and laws can also work in the other direction, for Montesquieu shows that the laws of a “free people” can “contribute to forming the mores, manners, and characters of a nation.” His example is the government of England. In two discussions of that government, he first examines the constitution of that country (XI 6), while in the second he shows “the effects that had to follow, the character that was formed from it, and the manners that result from it” (XIX 27). The laws or the constitution in this case precede the manners. Exploring the mores of this first example of a modern commercial republic, Montesquieu observed a society which is diverse, passionate, anxious about preserving liberties, inclined toward commerce, filled with small conflicting interest groups, and so forth. “All the passions are free there, hatred, envy, jealousy, and the ardor for enriching and distinguishing oneself would appear to their full extent.”“With regard to religion,” he thought it possible that most “would be very indifferent to all sorts of religion of whatever kind, in which case everyone would tend to embrace the dominant religion, or that one would be zealous for religion in general, in which case sects would multiply” (1989, XIX 27, pp. 325, 330).11"
"12","Tocqueville's study of mores in DA I.2.9 is an account of “general causes” that lend some strength to the democratic political order (DA 287; OC I.1.330). Where Tocqueville differs from Montesquieu is in his more cautious evaluation of the ultimate influence of commerce and in his understanding of the role of religion as a political institution. The commerce ethic he described, albeit under the highly unusual conditions prevailing in the era of western expansion, was no longer quite the antifeudal softening influence Montesquieu observed in seventeenth‐century Europe. When it encourages passions stronger than self‐preservation, and more appealing than any political passion, it has the potential to alter the character of the democratic project significantly. Still more striking in terms of a comparison with Montesquieu is the great prominence Tocqueville's inquiry gives to the question of “religion” as one of the causes that contribute to maintaining the democratic republic. A certain kind of interest in religion emerges in the mind of successful money makers, as he has shown. Following up on that observation, three out of the five subchapters on mores and their contribution to the success of the democratic republic examine the influence of religion. These three subchapters describe a possible useful rapprochement between modern democracy and religion, contrary to certain expectations entertained in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. On the other hand, it is important to caution that the three subchapters on religion are only three out of five on mores; they are followed by a chapter on “enlightenment” and a chapter developing a thesis about the general significance of mores. One explanation for the shift in emphasis and result between Tocqueville and Montesquieu is, of course, that Tocqueville works from new evidence, reasoning from an example not available to Montesquieu. It is in the spirit of Montesquieu to learn from history, and in this case Tocqueville seems quite justified in arguing that the democratic era emerging in the nineteenth century requires a “new political science” (DA 12) capable of assessing not only the democratization of government but the democratization of mores and the mores of democratization."
"13","The issue in the three subchapters devoted to religion is religion as a “political institution,” and particularly whether it might be in the “interests” of democrats to consider it useful. In the background is the charge that he heard “every day” in France while preparing his book, namely, the thesis of French “republicans” to the effect that American freedom could not be complete until the doctrines of “Spinoza” and “Cabanis” were adopted there (DA 294).12 His response to these advocates, among whom Montesquieu belongs in some respects,13 is to reexamine the relationship between Christianity and democracy in the light of the question of maintenance, to identify a component of Christianity which might commend it to republicans, and to propose an account of the “natural” basis of religion and its political implications.         "
"14","The first thing to recognize about religion and politics is that there has not been and cannot be an impermeable wall between them, for each religion nurtures some kind of political opinion by the “affinity” (DA 287) between its beliefs and the way society lives. But this “affinity” can be expressed in a variety of forms. The original Protestant settlers of the earliest colonies came from the midst of “the old feudal society” but held views partly originating in their religion which enabled them to construct a “democracy more perfect than any of which ancient society had dared to dream” (DA 39). The contribution of the Protestant religion appears to have been its commitment to certain political liberties, openness to education, and encouragement of strict morals (DA 33, 36, 43–44, 47). Tocqueville thought the mores of the Puritan era excessively strict, but the discipline provided a comparatively secure basis for experimentation with an unusual degree of political liberty. Yet in the current section, Tocqueville, in agreement with an opinion of Montesquieu, identifies the longer‐term consequence of Protestantism as “independence” more than equality (DA 288).14 The spirit of “independence” associated with Protestantism can readily be linked to democratic equality, to be sure. However, it also bears a likeness to the entrepreneurial orientation that leaves some so ready to abandon existing relationships in order to strike out on their own; and it is also not far from that spirit of “individualism” that he later describes as threatening to modern democratic citizenship (DA 506–507). Further, beneath Protestant “independence” lies an antiauthority disposition in matters of belief (the original settlers, “having shaken off the pope's authority, acknowledged no other religious supremacy”[DA 288]) that seems well suited to serve as an enabling premise for worldly individualism and commercialism.         "
"15","Tocqueville finds in Catholicism a rather different “affinity” between religion and democracy. He describes what he took to be a fairly easy assimilation of Irish Catholic immigrants and priests into a democratic outlook once they settled in America.15 The accommodation is possible because there is said to be a sort of egalitarianism implicit in Catholic thought: “Catholicism is like an absolute monarchy. The prince apart, conditions are more equal there than in republics” (DA 288).16 The monarchic tendency recedes into the background in American public life, because the priests acknowledge democratic freedom as a principle and accept the separation of church and state (DA 289, 295–96). When placed within a strongly democratic context, and rigorously separated from political power or influence, the Church can content itself with claiming only spiritual, not temporal, authority. Catholic equality is then somewhat compatible with democracy in political matters, so long as the Church requires the believer to submit only to the moral law rather than to obey a political authority. In this way the monarchic aspect of the Church's organization can be deprived of political effect, while it can be sustained in matters of faith and morals. In this understanding, Christianity is compatible with democracy (but not identical to it) in either a Protestant or a Catholic mode. For the American Protestants, that compatibility was expressed in their original principle, for the Catholics it becomes possible only through an adaptation to an existing democratic order. The latter case illustrates the transformative effects of politics on religion rather than the reverse. Perhaps the main point emerging from the argument is that there is no unbridgeable chasm between Christianity and democracy and therefore the democrats of Europe and America need not fear it.17 But the argument also draws attention to modern democracy's capacity to influence the faith in order to discourage certain nondemocratic elements in it.         "
"16","The preceding mainly defends Christianity against the charge of being intrinsically undemocratic, thus opening the possibility that one might reexamine its effects not as an antidemocratic opposition but as a component within the democratic framework. The next subchapter claims to describe such a positive influence. The influence is expressed in an “indirect” way, yet is so important that it is said to be “the first of their political institutions” through its effects (DA 292). The main effect is to encourage important self‐limitations in the use of private liberties."
"17","The indirect effects noticed by Tocqueville become visible in three forms, all elements of “mores” rather than of “laws or political opinions” (DA 291). First there are comparatively severe habits of sexual restraint. Although religion fails in restraining the eagerness of “men”[hommes]“to enrich themselves” (DA 291), it still disciplines erotic life by affecting women and their attitudes toward marriage and “conjugal happiness.” There are effects on men as a secondary result: a comparative absence of “disorder, restlessness of spirit, and instability of desires” within the household or family (DA 291), unlike in the economic realm. If the home front is orderly, the same qualities may be valued in public affairs more generally and thus affect men in politics, building a “habit of regulating opinions as well as tastes” through a “love of order” which can carry over into “affairs of state” (DA 291, 292).18"
"18","Second, religious opinions widely shared or widely professed, sincerely or insincerely, establish a climate of opinion in which it is disadvantageous to seem not to agree. Some believe; others are afraid to seem not to believe. The result is an atmosphere that confines both reason and the imagination, creating a conviction that there are “certain and fixed” boundaries in “the moral field” (DA 292: “le monde morale”[OC I.1. 305]) and in “political society” (DA 292) that ought not be violated. This is to confine the spirit, but perhaps also to encourage observance of useful constraints on action. An open political order benefits from the influence of a force balancing its otherwise liberating consequences.19 The premise of the claim is that the validity of moral boundaries is far from self‐evident to democrats absent some form of authority. Tocqueville alludes to and deplores the “revolutionaries” who profess that “everything is allowed in the interests of society,” a maxim inviting the violation of moral boundaries for political objectives (DA 292, cf. also 72). Nothing in what Tocqueville observed in America suggested the likelihood of such extremist or nihilistic attitudes. But exactly why are they absent? He attributes the limited range of opinion to a preexisting consensus, rooted in habits and customs rather than in clear awareness of principle. The consensus is valuable because of the incapacity of reason by itself to discern the “natural limits” or “boundaries” in matters of politics and morals. Religion is “the clearest line dividing good from ill” (DA 312), though what seems to be meant is that it is primarily a useful line, not necessarily a line that Tocqueville is prepared to defend in the terms a believer would prefer.20"
"19","Finally, driving home in a more political way the case for observing constraints, Tocqueville attacks the motives latent in some forms of modern republicanism. There were and still are in Europe ambitious adventurers who use the advance of “republican institutions” as a mode of personal aggrandizement, standing toward “liberty much as the medieval condottieri stood toward the kings,” making war “on their own account”—an allusion to Napoleon Bonaparte and those dreaming of imitating him, perhaps.21 In response, Tocqueville draws a lesson for those who advocate a “permanent and tranquil” republicanism and who yet at the same time oppose the influence of religion on public life. These republicans have believed that the political advance they desire requires an extirpation of the influence of the Church and possibly of religion altogether. This view is a mistaken interpretation of their interests. A nonreligious republicanism may promise political liberties without any restrictive mores, but it will likely turn out to be the fragile and impermanent republicanism of the adventurers and the gold‐seekers (DA 294). On the whole, Tocqueville finds in religion a capacity to inculcate the moral boundaries that, with Montesquieu, he holds to be useful in republics.22 It is not a direct source of true “republican virtue” in the sense of selfless dedication to the public good, but it is an indirect source of a precondition for a decent republic, namely some limitation or control of the extremes of conduct possible in the commercial, erotic, and political life of the democratic age. The republicanism advocated by the ambitious is more likely to succeed in those societies where virtue, honor, mores, custom, and right have all weakened so that the powerful, if informal, constraints on power are lost.23 The result is likely despotism. Religion “teaches the Americans the art of being free” but it does so only in the odd sense of teaching this art “when it is not speaking of freedom at all” (DA 290). It is a useful measure against anomic forms of republican liberty.         "
"20","The third subchapter, the last on the topic of “religion,” is titled “The Main Causes That Make Religion Powerful in America.” It describes, however, not only religion in America but religion itself as an instance of something more generally human."
"21","Taking issue with the “eighteenth‐century philosophers,” Tocqueville argues they were wrong in holding that religious belief would wane with the spread of “enlightenment and freedom” (DA 295).24 Or rather, they were correct mainly for cases where the Church had functioned as a major political power. When intertwined with state authority, the Church became hated when the state was hated (cf. OR I.2–3). From his observations in America, by contrast, Tocqueville concluded that where there is an advance in freedom, there will likely be a renewal of religious belief. He found the evidence sufficient to draw a more universally applicable lesson, deploying a term to explain the matter—“nature”—that held great authority for the philosophers of the Enlightenment but that Tocqueville chooses to employ against them on this point.25"
"22","Religion, he argues here, is to be considered natural because it is a response to two rather discordant impulses belonging naturally to man alone “among all created beings”: a natural disgust for existence coupled with an “immense longing to exist,” a mistrust of life and a “fear of nothingness”[“le néant”] (DA 296). Without “imagination” these impulses would not exist, but because they do, there is an inclination to seek for or to contemplate “another world,” and religion speaks of that other world. Religion is at bottom only a form of “hope,” but the attempt to eradicate it does “moral violence to human nature” (DA 297). The natural impulse is at first neither moral nor theological in character; it neither legislates conduct nor articulates doctrine. But the original impulse is nevertheless practical, emerging from care for one's own existence. This care is the source from which “all religions” draw. Religion understood in this way begins from the raising of a question that seems humanly unavoidable. Implicitly rejecting Rousseau's view that human beings are naturally untroubled by the fear of death, Tocqueville is closer to the Pascalian opposite: anxiety about mortality is inherent in human nature.26 This is a view espoused in independence from explicit Christian doctrines, which Tocqueville notably does not consult in this whole discussion (Lawler 1993, 87). It is, of course, likely if not inevitable that the initial questioning inquiry will be given some more concrete expression in specific practices and doctrines. The transition in this direction must be the result of another fact about human beings, the need to have some fixed beliefs by which to live. Tocqueville later formulated this point in DA II very strongly: “It can never happen that there are no dogmatic beliefs, that is to say, opinions which men take on trust without discussion” (DA 433). Dogmatic beliefs are by no means limited to religious matters. They emerge in politics, morals, and social relations, and they can improve as well as restrict tastes and opinions (Gannett 2003, 2). They reflect the general inability of the majority of human beings to proceed through the experience of “universal doubt and distrust” to the “deliberate and self‐justified type of conviction born of knowledge” which is the province only of a few (DA 187). Dogmas are a likely byproduct of religion, but they are not the essence of the matter as Tocqueville puts it here, because the original source of religion can be distinguished from the expression it is given in a specific place and time.            "
"23","Seen in this light, the close alliance of religion and secular authority in France no longer appears as a typical outcome but rather as a distorting error, even if one to which both religion and politics are quite prone. Tocqueville observes that the “spirit of man” will “seek to harmonize earth with heaven” (DA 287, Tocqueville's emphasis), turning the affinity of belief and society into something more doctrinaire. In France, the convictions of the past called for a linkage between church and state; this view moved toward harmonization in a rather literal sense. In America, the Protestants sought the separation of the church from the state. Harmonization from this point of view was a rather more obscure objective and was perhaps reflected in a supposition that an apparent dichotomy—“either material wealth or moral delights, either heaven in the next world or prosperity and freedom in this” (DA 47)—could somehow be elided or bridged. The French case was an example of an attempt to Christianize politics. The American case sought the autonomy of politics and was based on a doctrine of Protestantism to which Catholics are now adapting. In both examples, however, there is an effect of religion on politics, configured either in a Catholic or a Protestant manner. Tocqueville, however, seems not merely to describe but to prefer the Protestant position, albeit for non‐Protestant reasons. Linking the Church to the state, as in France, was an error because human belief about another world should aim at “universality,” not at supporting the transitory interests of a particular time and place, such as governments, laws, or even “political theories” (DA 297–98).27 Attempts to harmonize the two worlds are both doomed to failure and an error damaging to each side. Tocqueville proposes the separation of religion from politics not simply as a means of protecting government from churchly influence or securing civil peace but also as a means to allow appropriate expression to an ineradicable aspect of human character. His argument exposes the transitory character of the theologico‐political conflict in France, while finding in the democratic mode of distinguishing religion and politics something both true and useful for modern republicans.28"
"24","Tocqueville's comment on the “natural” aspect in religion illustrates well some aspects of his reasoning in the use of this term. On the basis of his empirical observations, he might have limited himself to the thesis that the democratization of religion leads to a proliferation of sects and to residual, indirect influences of religion on public opinion. But he examines the evidence in the light of the philosophers' argument that religion was essentially authority and that only the dismantling of authority would allow human beings to be entirely at home in the mundane world. When the issue is posed in that way, the observed result requires a stronger correction of the Enlightenment hypothesis."
"25","The evidence suggests there must be another explanation for the reawakening of the influence of religion than social or governmental pressure. The Enlightenment critics might have argued that the “indirect” influence of religion still amounts to a form of informal authority, so that the American example is no true test of what is natural but only illustrates the durability of social and moral habits. If informal authority and indirect influence is still authority and influence, does freedom require a program not merely of separating church and state but of separating peoples from their mores? Is cultural revolution a necessary component of the democratic revolution? Tocqueville's argument shows a means to loosen the connection between religion and politics without attempting to eliminate religion's influence altogether. The key point is illustrated by his implicit rejection of the identification of religion, particularly Catholicism, with orthodox theology or with natural law doctrine, coupled with his psychological, almost proto‐existentialist, reading of the source of religion. He sees in the nature of human beings both the need and the faculties to reflect on existence and on the possibility of another world. Such a need may be developed into something more definite in a manner adapted to the prevailing conditions. It does not necessarily eventuate in the establishment of an orthodoxy nor a demand for religious authority over secular life, although it has taken that direction in the European past. To the contrary, the need appears to be expressed in a mode adapted to some degree to the social and political situation. Although there is an “affinity” between every religion and a political opinion, that affinity can be expressed weakly or strongly. The very adaptability of religion to conditions might be seen as a positive and useful quality."
"26","Conditions of political freedom are favored by Tocqueville for several reasons but also in part because they permit a renewed, less constrained expression of the natural components of the human character.29 Political freedom is a mode of society with fewer constraints and less of arbitrary power than unfree societies. It gives an outlet for the question at the root of religion. That question will be addressed in diverse ways—it is no accident that there is “an innumerable multitude of sects in the United States” (DA 290)—and will have effects on private life and on the climate of opinion. The diversity will not likely be infinite, because religious opinions so deeply rooted in the past and so intimately linked with the founding of the democracies will not easily be discarded, absent the extreme methods employed in the French Revolution.30 Tocqueville expects that the general framework will remain broadly Christian, and so “the great problem of our time is the organization and establishment of democracy in Christian lands” (DA 311, cf. 291).            "
"27","A specific American result described by Tocqueville is manifest in the effort to proselytize those who hasten “somewhere toward the west” in order to seek their fortune (DA 281, 293–94). Here is a modest remnant of the old Puritan fervor, demonstrated in a quest to reach those who leave their birthplace in order to grab the chance for wealth. In portraying the motives of both parties, he had noticed that the wealth‐seekers are driven by a restless, burning passion but find it useful to support good mores and even religion. The proselytizers want not so much to remind the settlers of eternal things as to ensure that their mores and beliefs remain compatible with the republican liberties of the East (Mitchell 1995, 164, note 11). In both cases, there is some mixing of worldly and religious concerns, but this should not be surprising: there is no purely “natural” or “apolitical” expression of religion (Manent 1998, 108), only a natural basis from which the questions arise to which religions attempt to furnish a response within the context they inhabit.            "
"28","Finally, however, Tocqueville draws a lesson from this argument about how the French should regard the problem of religion and politics. In a passage that reveals something of the range of opinions he must have observed before his travels in America, he reports on the growing “indifference” to religion, originating from the undermining of “religious belief … by doctrines which I shall call negative because they assert the falseness of one religion but do not establish the truth of any other” (DA 299). Tocqueville does not challenge and is perhaps unwilling or unable to challenge these doctrines by direct argument; there is no attempt on his part to “establish the truth” about any religion. Instead he comments on the excessively polemical response of those who are still believers: they dread their “contemporaries” and their “age and country.”“Imagining unbelief to be something new, they comprise all that is new in one indiscriminate animosity. They are at war with their age and country and see each opinion professed as a necessary enemy of faith” (DA 300). This opinion “should not now[de nos jours] be the natural state of men with regard to religion” (DA 300, emphasis added; OC I.1.314).            "
"29","The natural state “now” would be for the believer to recognize two facts. First, the vehemence against religion so visible in the French Revolution is due not to the intrinsic oppressiveness of religion as such but to the close alliance of the Church with the decaying French “ancien régime.” It is a secondary phenomenon. Second, the root from which religion springs may be expected to remain alive, especially if there is political freedom for it to do so. These are two truths which form a basis for a less hostile politics on the part of the believers. Their goal should be the establishment of democratic freedom rather than restoration of orthodoxy. This is the “natural” state “now” for his countrymen because it is the prudent and yet principled adjustment to the conditions of the democratic era.31"
"30","Tocqueville concludes this treatment of the mores that support democracy with a study of what we might call an alternative enlightenment, an enlightenment not as advocated by the “eighteenth‐century philosophers” but as practiced in the first modern democracy."
"31","The third component of mores is emphatically rooted in democracy and conduces directly to its support. It is discussed by Tocqueville in a subchapter whose title poses the question: “What is to be understood by the enlightenment of the American people?” (DA 301) The title perhaps alludes to the earlier mention of the eighteenth‐century philosophers, but the objective of the chapter is to distinguish and even to defend a kind of enlightenment visible in the new democracy, an enlightenment distinct from what was intended in the intellectual project of the preceding century. After some remarks about the low level of literary and scholarly activity in North America, Tocqueville proposes a framework other than condescension for understanding a kind of enlightenment based on democratic practice. The Americans, he claimed, were “averse to general ideas” and did not seek “theoretical discoveries,” they have very few who are genuinely “learned,” and yet as he traveled he found very few who were truly “uneducated” (DA 301–02). He learned from these facts that there might be “two different angles” for thinking about enlightenment as a public project. From the European standpoint, molded by examples from Greek and Roman antiquity and the French eighteenth century, enlightenment is to be seen in the peak achievements of learning, literature, and thought. From the American standpoint, enlightenment is a matter of the vast spread of public education, achieving a situation where “the whole population falls between these two extremes” of the highest learning and the complete lack of education typical of the “peasant”—a term of depreciation unknown in the United States, Tocqueville observes (DA 303).32"
"32","This middling ground at first appears to reflect a defect—the choice for mediocrity in preference to excellence in the name of supporting equality.33 But while in effect conceding some validity to the criticism, Tocqueville proposes an alternative understanding: “True enlightenment is in the main born of experience” (DA 304). He maintains that the particular strength of this democratic enlightenment is the wide acquisition of an informed grasp of public affairs rooted in actual first‐hand practice.            "
"33","                              "
"34","It is by taking a share in legislation that the American learns to know the law; it is by governing that he becomes educated about the formalities of government. The great work of society is daily performed before his eyes, and so to say, under his hands. In the United States, education as a whole is directed toward political life; in Europe its main object is preparation for private life, as the citizens' participation in public affairs is too rare an event to be provided for in advance. (DA 304–05)"
"35","The case for an education of this kind is that it “contributes to support the democratic republic” because “the instruction which teaches the mind is not separated from the education which is responsible for mores” (DA 304). This phrase seems to mean that education for a democratic and practical enlightenment comprises two elements. First is cultivation of experiential familiarity with the operations of democratic society and government, their formalities and procedures. The second, equally necessary, is absorption of democratic mores through the experience of collaboration with others in public activities. The mind and the mores are formed together, for in both cases what is to be learned is how society deliberates, decides, and acts. To proceed with nondemocratic methods or foreign mores is to invite failure. Note the implicit premise that the very purpose of education is knowledge about and support for democracy. An enlightenment or education of this kind requires depreciating the value of abstract theory, the pursuit of extreme refinements of understanding and taste, or deep interest in nondemocratic societies. In discouraging general ideas, it may also tend to discourage even the full exploration of what we do and do not know about that “other world” of which religion speaks; both philosophy and theology may atrophy. Democratic education aims to inculcate a practical, experienced grasp of democratic society itself, the mastery of those procedures, mores, and tastes necessary for acting effectively within and on the society, accompanied by the implicit elevation of democracy and political life in general to a level of importance superceding any theoretical issue. This is an education which is less bookish and more experiential than the old elite education of Europe, attempting to use “participation in free institutions” as a substitute for “sound theoretical knowledge” (Richter 1970, 101).34 It presupposes that the concerns of public life are more substantial than those of the private life, the opposite of the old education's priorities (DA 304–05). At the same time, it forms a set of habits and a horizon of expectations that constitute what is the most effective support for freedom still available (cf. DA 243).            "
"36","Less directly emphasized is that this “practical enlightenment” establishes a context within which both commercialism and piety might be pacified to the extent that they can be; it is as much a remedy for the defects of the two other components of mores as a complement to them. Both the commercial ethic and the expression of religious belief contained within themselves something potentially unlimited and extreme. In both there is a grasping for something beyond life itself: the hunger for well‐being could become a “passion stronger than love of life” (DA 283), while religion incubates from a “disgust for existence and an immense longing to exist” (DA 296). Neither seems necessarily oriented toward democracy, though under the right conditions both have advantages compatible with democracy, as Tocqueville has shown. Prosperity supports democracy, but the gold‐seeker is quite capable of treating mores as a mere means to support commercial development. The believer acknowledges and may act on moral restraints, but is capable of zealous proselytizing and may try to impose the rules of faith on political affairs. The absorption of education so fully into the democratic project may gradually solidify boundaries that confine both commercial and religious enthusiasm and do so more deeply than is possible through explicit legal means."
"37","By the end of this exploration of how to preserve a democratic republic, the question of the “maintenance” of the American democratic republic seems not to have received as conclusive an answer as one might wish. The maintenance of a democratic republic appears to depend on the influence of sound mores. Indeed, Tocqueville's claim is less to have established a clear prognosis for American democracy than to have established a proposition of political science, namely that mores are more significant in shaping the fate of a society than the physical conditions or even the laws. The value of this proposition is exploited in two different ways."
"38","First, Tocqueville draws attention to the different results achieved in distinct parts of the Americas to support his claim about mores. Comparing North and South America, he finds that “there are no nations on earth more miserable than those of South America,” despite “inexhaustible riches.” The difference is due to the influence of laws and mores. But another case suggests that the primary cause is mores more than laws, as Tocqueville concludes after observing that laws similar to those of the United States were adopted in Mexico but Mexico “cannot get used to democratic government.” Moreover, the same case for the importance of mores can be made internally within the United States by comparing the East and the West. In the East, customs, opinions, and forms of behavior are penetrated by democracy, so that this influence shows in every detail of social life. Literacy and practical education are widespread, and religion and freedom are closely linked. The sum of these habits, opinions, usages, and beliefs is the mores that make republican government “strong and orderly,” while in the West, “the powers of society seem to proceed at random” (DA 307–08; cf. 200, 225, 372). The laws and the governing institutions of democracy remain the same in both the East and the West, but the quality of society is in Tocqueville's eyes very different. The effect must be due to mores (DA 306–07). If the argument is correct, then the prospects for the American democratic republic depend very strongly on preserving and enhancing the structure of the mores that differentiate its better from its weaker forms."
"39","One might well accept the validity of this point, but it is notable that Tocqueville reports no method for generating political and legal means to sustain the mores he takes to be so useful. The argument implies that the maintenance of the American democratic republic is a rather uncertain thing. The republic in effect draws from inherited capital, an infrastructure of habits, beliefs, and practices, or in other words mores, that produced significant benefits but that were evidently neither the product of conscious design nor even likely to be readily transferable to another society. The useful mores are the pre‐constitutional product of an old heritage reinvigorated on a new territory. Tocqueville names no individuals in the account of American mores, and describes no acts of statesmanship or legislation that account for what has proved to be so valuable or work to sustain it.35 The actual democratic governing practices resulted from conscious political choice at the founding, but it seems doubtful that he believes this beneficial governing structure will be preserved without the contribution from American mores.         "
"40","Secondly, however, when he turns to the politics of Europe, Tocqueville proposes a more distinct path of action. He has shown his French readers a mode of liberty unrecognized in European thought. The Europeans have tended to understand liberty as a by‐product of wilderness life, or as an opening for the zealous pursuit of wealth, or as the emancipation that results from demolishing the Church's influence on thought and morals. But there is a liberty of another kind and one that even represents a form of “enlightenment” in its way. It is not theoretically driven, but represents an ethos of democratic life, where the procedures of democracy permeate daily affairs. Establishing the possibility of this coherence of democratic laws and a democratic ethos through the American example enables him to offer at least a hint that a similar path for France might be conceivable."
"41","Addressing the French readers more directly, Tocqueville shifts to more active terms, shedding the somewhat fatalistic implications of the preceding sociological‐historical analysis. Americans, he now remarks, have “made great and successful endeavors” to combat the weaknesses of democracy, the “American lawgivers” strove to add the “stability of religious morality to the constant changes in the world of politics,” they have “applied remedies … to the ills common to all democratic peoples” (DA 311). This active mode of speech reinterprets a set of useful social characteristics, the mores of the democracy he has portrayed, as a product of the foresight of anonymous statesmen."
"42","The value of the example lies in its contrast with an emerging normlessness that he thinks now threatens Europe and that he compares to the climate of opinion and belief found in the “terrible centuries of Roman tyranny, when mores had been corrupted … customs destroyed … when nothing protected the citizens and when the citizens no longer protected themselves…” (DA 314). Authorities capable of resisting centralized power have faded, as have the mores of freedom; religion has weakened dramatically; there is no longer any clarity about “the natural limits of despotism and the bounds of license” (DA 312). For all the advance of democracy discussed in this book, Tocqueville professes to fear the possibility of something like the Caesarism that capped the demise of Roman republicanism."
"43","Tocqueville guided his investigations in this analysis toward a quest to understand the “causes” that strengthen and preserve a democracy, and the reader seems entitled to expect that the objective was to lay bare the “causes” that might be intentionally deployed in order to maintain and stabilize a democratic republic. The actual result, however, has been to clarify the “causes” but to leave open the specific formulation of a means to apply this knowledge. No simple political strategy is proposed to respond to the threat. It is difficult to discern what specific steps the “American legislators” have taken or other legislators might take to preserve a republic. Perhaps Tocqueville's best advice for the French would be to act with moderation in trying to renovate the inherited institutions of the past and to preserve as much opportunity as possible for the encouragement of democratic practices."
"44","The most distinct result of this argument is to establish the need for a political science of mores.36 Tocqueville has observed that “most Europeans” are aware of the influence of “circumstances” on the development of society, and regard these circumstances as determinative. But the materialism of such views, perhaps particularly targeted against the influence of the Church, overlooks the phenomenon of “mores.” Mores are practices linked to beliefs; they express an ethos that shapes and directs behavior more influentially than laws. Mores are not directly dependent on the physical circumstances, and so they suggest an element of the human make‐up that cannot be explained in purely material terms. Nor are they entirely a reflection of the “laws,” and so they are not exactly in the control of those in a position to promulgate the laws. It is to mores that one must turn in order to strengthen the necessary distinction between the two forms of democratic equality, the equality of free consent or the equality resulting from subordination to a single master. The best course for serious republicans is not the revolutionary eradication of the old mores but their careful democratization and liberalization.         "
