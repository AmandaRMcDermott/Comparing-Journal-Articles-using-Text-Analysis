"1","Scholars of the politics of constitutional review have devoted considerable attention to the influence of interbranch politics on judicial decision making (e.g., Epstein and Knight 1998; Helmke 2002). The key insight of this literature, that institutions matter for the effective exercise of judicial authority, has spurred researchers to examine the separations of powers between the judiciary, legislature, and executive. Integrating this perspective with the judicial legitimacy literature (e.g., Caldeira and Gibson 1992), Staton (2006, 2010) identifies courts' public relations efforts as an institutional tool capable of enhancing a court's ability to overcome constraints created by interbranch politics. Staton argues that media relations allow courts to publicize decisions, creating a more attentive public capable of punishing noncompliance.         "
"2","A generalization of Staton's (2006, 2010) argument is that we should observe courts strategically utilizing institutional tools to increase public awareness and overcome threats of noncompliance. One of the most prominent tools available to many judiciaries is the public oral hearing. Hearings provide litigants an opportunity to state their arguments directly to the court and answer justices' questions. Moreover, the public nature of hearings allows the media to observe the court's proceedings and inform the public of the cases and legal issues facing the court. A typical hearing at the Austrian Constitutional Court, for example, allows for video and audio recordings of the case's introduction and overview presented by the Court's permanent reporter.         "
"3","Hearings raise public awareness by allowing media coverage of otherwise typically closed judicial processes. To this end, the access provided to the media figures prominently in many courts' rules of procedures regarding hearings. This access takes a wide range of forms, from the live broadcasting of entire proceedings at the UK Supreme Court to the presence of television cameras only for the formal opening of cases at the German Constitutional Court.1 As greater media coverage is likely to raise the public profile of a case (Staton 2006), hearings should, by Vanberg's (2001, 2005) account, increase a court's capacity to effectively constrain the other branches of government.         "
"4","In contemporary liberal democracies, constitutional courts typically have discretion over which cases are granted a public oral hearing.2 While courts are often required to hold hearings for certain types of cases, such as political party prohibitions, the decision to hold a hearing is otherwise typically left to the court for more common proceedings. As a result, many courts can rule with or without public oral hearings. This discretion allows these courts to use hearings to manipulate public awareness without limiting their capacity to adjudicate cases. If courts are using hearings to affect public awareness as a means to countering potential noncompliance, then public oral hearings should be systematically related to a court's expectations of government noncompliance with an adverse ruling, the potential for increasing public awareness, and ultimately a court's willingness to challenge the government.         "
"5","Below, I develop a formal argument of how a court can use public oral hearings to promote compliance. The formalization is valuable because it distinguishes my argument from competing theoretical and empirical claims about the relationships between oral hearings, the likelihood of government noncompliance, and case disposition. For one, courts may hold hearings in the pursuit of normative or functional goals, such as increasing transparency of publicly salient cases that are also more likely to involve government actions where compliance is at issue. For another, hearings may affect a court's likelihood of ruling against the government. In particular, empirical research on the U.S. Supreme Court shows that oral arguments advantage the government's position because the government typically has superior representation in the form of the Solicitor General (Johnson, Wahlbeck, and Spriggs 2006). The formal model will help to clarify the strategic argument advanced here and identify empirical implications that distinguish my argument from extant ones like those described above.         "
"6","Following the example of Vanberg (2001, 2005) and Staton (2006, 2010), I use a single‐period game of incomplete information. The game has two players: a government,3 G, and a court, C. I assume the government prefers its policy upheld and the court prefers to strike down the challenged law as unconstitutional. I further assume that the court enjoys a high level of public support such that the government is always punished when the public observes noncompliance. Upon receiving a case, the court chooses whether to hold a public oral hearing  or forego doing so . The court then issues its decision and either upholds (S = 0) or strikes down the challenged law (S = 1). If the court upholds, the game ends. If the court strikes down the statute, the government responds by either evading  or complying  with the ruling. The game then ends and payoffs are realized.         "
"7","Both players have a common prior belief, π, about the probability of the public becoming aware of noncompliance by the government when the court does not hold a hearing. The model's innovation is the addition of a second belief, ϕ, of the public becoming aware in cases granted a hearing. I assume the likelihood of public awareness is strictly greater for cases granted a hearing (ϕ>π). As with the baseline probability π, both the government and court share the same belief about ϕ. The timing of the game is summarized as follows:            "
"8","I now turn to the utility functions of the players. I specify three components for the court's utility function. First, a policy component captures the court's preference over the policy at issue in the case.4 This component is captured by the parameter A, where . Since I assume the court has preferences divergent from the government, the court only receives A when it strikes down the law and the government complies. The second component represents the institutional costs of noncompliance. Successful noncompliance can undermine public confidence in the court's ability to effectively constrain other institutions. Noncompliance can also harm how the court is perceived by other political institutions, which can encourage further noncompliance. This cost is captured in the model by the parameter I, where . The court only incurs this cost when the government successfully evades. The third component of the court's utility function is the cost of holding a hearing. Judges have limited time, especially in courts with mandatory dockets. Frequently faced with heavy caseloads, dedicating substantial time to a hearing for a single case comes at considerable cost. The model captures this opportunity cost with the parameter κ, where . To summarize, the utility function of the court is            "
"9","The government's utility has two components. The value the government places on the challenged policy is represented by α, where . This assumes that every policy has some value to the government. The government gains α if either the court upholds or the government successfully evades a court decision to strike down the statute. The second component of the government's utility function is the potential electoral backlash from the public for noncompliance. The intuition is that a publicly observed failure to implement a court decision will result in the public electorally punishing the government. The magnitude of this punishment is captured by the parameter β, where . To summarize, the utility function of the government is            "
"10","The solution concept for the game is subgame perfection. I limit the analysis to pure strategies. To aid the analysis, I state three definitions that structure the equilibria conditions. The first definition delineates the threshold by which the government determines whether or not to comply with the court's decision. If π, or ϕ when the court holds a hearing, is less than this value, then the government chooses to evade the ruling. I refer to this threshold as the Government Compliance Threshold.               "
"11","Definition 1.1.Define the Government Compliance Threshold as                                          "
"12","The second definition concerns the court's decision of whether or not to strike the challenged government action. The court strikes the legislation only if π, or ϕ when the court holds a hearing, is greater than the threshold value. I call this the Judicial Strike Threshold.               "
"13","Definition 1.2.Define the Judicial Strike Threshold as                                          "
"14","The third threshold defines the court's decision to hold a public hearing. The court will only hold a public oral hearing if this condition is met. The parameter values necessary for this condition to obtain, however, vary with the values taken by π and ϕ. I will address these equilibria conditions below, along with discussions of their substantive significance. I define the following as the Judicial Public Hearing Threshold.               "
"15","Definition 1.3.Define the Judicial Public Hearing Threshold as                                          "
"16","In total, there are eight subgame perfect equilibria (SPE) in the game.5 In discussing these equilibria, I group them into categories. The following propositions summarize the equilibria. The proofs of the equilibria are in the supporting information.               "
"17","Proposition 1. ([Confrontational Hearings])For , , and , the following strategy profile constitutes an SPE:                     "
"18","Proposition 1 characterizes instances where the court's belief about the likelihood of public mobilization without a hearing (π) is sufficiently high such that it will strike even in the absence of a hearing. However, as Proposition 1 (Confrontational Hearings) indicates, the court will nonetheless pay the cost of a hearing when the benefit of improving the likelihood of public mobilization outweighs the cost. In this instance, the court continues to face a defiant government. As the procedure does not alter the government's anticipated behavior, the court's decision to hold a hearing in this scenario is contingent on the impact of the hearing on the likelihood of public awareness. If either the case or the broader political environment is not conducive for a hearing to be effective (i.e.,  is not sufficiently large), the court will still strike down the law but will do so without holding a hearing.               "
"19","Proposition 1a. ([Mobilizing Hearing])For , , and , the following strategy profile constitutes an SPE:                     "
"20","Proposition 1a characterizes an equilibrium in which the holding of a hearing alters the government's behavior from evasion to compliance. This equilibrium obtains if the court's strike and hearing thresholds are met and the government's threshold for compliance is met only when the court holds a hearing. In this setting, the government will only comply when a hearing is held; otherwise, it will evade the decision. The court will hold a hearing when the cost of doing so justifies the increase in the likelihood of public awareness. As with Proposition 1, the court's strike threshold is met without a hearing, and thus the court will strike down the statute regardless of whether it holds a hearing.               "
"21","Proposition 2. ([Judicial Emboldening Hearing])For , , and , the following strategy profile constitutes an SPE:                     "
"22","               "
"23","Proposition 2a. ([Limited Judicial Emboldening Hearing])For , , and , the following strategy profile constitutes an SPE:                     "
"24","Propositions 2 and 2a characterize equilibria in which a hearing alters the court's behavior. These equilibria obtain when the court's strike threshold lies between the probability of awareness without a hearing and the probability of awareness after the court holds a hearing. In these equilibria, the increased level of public awareness emboldens the court to strike down the challenged statute when it otherwise would uphold. In the equilibrium characterized by Proposition 2, hearings have the additional effect of making the government switch its strategy from evasion to compliance. Once again, these equilibria are bounded by the costs associated with holding a hearing; if the costs of doing so become too high, the court will forego the procedure. In addition to the direct cost of the hearing (κ), these thresholds are a function of the policy component of the court's utility function. The more the court values the specific policy at stake, the greater the cost it is willing to bear to hold a hearing.               "
"25","Proposition 3. ([Fully Deferential Government])If  and , the following strategy profile constitutes an SPE:                     "
"26","               "
"27","Proposition 3a. ([Fully Deferential Court])For , the following strategy profile constitutes an SPE:                     "
"28","The equilibria presented in Propositions 3 and 3a characterize when the court will not hold a hearing because the increase in public attention does not offset the cost of the hearing. Consider Proposition 3, which characterizes a Fully Deferential Government equilibrium. In this setting, the government will comply with a judicial decision to strike down the statute regardless of whether a hearing is held. This equilibrium obtains when the baseline likelihood of public mobilization, π, is greater than the government's compliance threshold. In this situation, the court will never hold a hearing because the government will always comply. Second, consider the equilibrium characterized by Proposition 3a, the Fully Deferential Court equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the court never strikes down the challenged statute because there will not be sufficient public awareness of a the decision even if the court holds a hearing. Since a hearing will not sufficiently raise the likelihood of public awareness to incentivize the court to strike down the challenged statute, the court opts to uphold without holding a hearing.               "
"29","Proposition 4. ([Excessively Costly Hearings])For any time  is not met, the following strategy profiles constitute SPE:                     "
"30","Finally, Proposition 4 characterizes the equilibria that obtain when the court's hearing threshold  is not met. In this situation, the court chooses not to hold a hearing because the cost of doing so is prohibitively high. While the parameter values necessary for this to hold vary across these four situations, the basic insight is the same. The cost of hearings in these settings is so high that it is not to the court's benefit to hold one. As a result, the court and government rely on their prior belief about the likelihood of public awareness, π, to construct their strategies.            "
"31","Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of the equilibria when the level of public awareness after a hearing surpasses the court's strike threshold (). Figure 1 depicts the equilibria that can obtain when , Propositions 1 and 1a, 3, and 4.6 Analysis of the results, as depicted in Figure 1, produces several implications for the interactions between constitutional courts and governments. I organize the discussion around three observations.               "
"32","Observation 1.The court is more likely to hold hearings for cases that pose a sufficient risk of noncompliance.                  "
"33","Government Briefs and the Decision to Hold a Public Oral Hearing"
"34","Note: The black point is the predicted probability of a hearing when the government files a brief. The gray point is the predicted probability of a hearing when the government does not file a brief. Lines represent 95% confidence intervals. Estimates are based on Model 1.                        "
"35","When the threat of noncompliance is low or nonexistent, the court does not have an incentive to incur the cost of holding a hearing. The government's compliance threshold is partially driven by how much it values the policy being reviewed. If the government does not care about the policy, evasion is unlikely. However, the risk of noncompliance increases with the importance of the policy to the government, making public oral hearings more attractive option to the court in cases involving policies valued by the government. If judges view public hearings as a means of addressing potential noncompliance, then the decision to hold hearings should be directly linked to the credibility of noncompliance threats.               "
"36","Observation 2.Given a sufficient risk of noncompliance, the court is more likely to hold hearings when they will be most effective at increasing public awareness.                  "
"37","As  increases, the range of values that satisfy  increases, making it more likely that the court will hold a hearing. This dynamic is illustrated in Figure 1. The court will hold a hearing even when doing so does not change the government's strategy only if the increase in the likelihood of public awareness is sufficiently large. The share of the parameter space in which the court will hold a hearing increases with the distance between π and ϕ. Specifically, as the distance between these values grows, so does the range of possible values the model's other parameters can take and satisfy the conditions necessary for the use of hearings to be an equilibrium strategy. This relationship, however, only holds when the government's compliance threshold is greater than π. When this is not the case, the Fully Deferential Government equilibrium obtains regardless of a hearing's effectiveness. As a result, the model predicts no connection between the court's decision to hold a hearing and the impact of that hearing on public awareness when noncompliance is not at issue.               "
"38","Observation 3.Given a sufficient risk of noncompliance, the court is more likely to rule against the government in cases granted a hearing.                  "
"39","This observation follows from the theory's central argument that hearings improve the level of public awareness and ultimately increase the likelihood of compliance. As ϕ increases, the range of values captured by the Judicial Emboldening equilibria (Propositions 1a and 2a) increases. In this environment, holding a hearing switches the court's strategy from uphold (S = 1) to strike (S = 1). Substantively, this means that when the court is faced with a risk of noncompliance, it is confident enough in the ability of a hearing to engender compliance that it strikes down the legislation when it otherwise would have upheld. This result highlights how the court's willingness to challenge the government can be a function of the court's own procedural decisions.            "
"40","These observations lead to the following three hypotheses:               "
"41","Recall that one goal of the modeling exercise was to identify empirically testable hypotheses that distinguish my argument from two prominent alternative accounts. One alternative is that courts may hold hearings to achieve the normative goal of increasing the transparency of salient cases. If true, courts should hold hearings for the most salient cases. Such an account does not, however, lead one to expect the relationship between hearings and case disposition predicted by the model. The second alternative account is that hearings benefit the government. An implication of this account is that courts should be more likely to rule in favor of the government in cases granted a hearing, the opposite of the prediction derived from the model. In the remainder of the article, I take the model's predictions and these alternative hypotheses to data from the German Constitutional Court to determine whether or not the predicted behavior conforms to the observed behavior of one of the most influential judicial institutions."
"42","To test these hypotheses, I examine the German Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). The FCC is an appropriate case because the Court's influential role in the German political system and its institutional structure satisfy key assumptions of the theoretical model.7 The FCC is a prominent institution in German politics, repeatedly finding itself at the center of controversial political conflicts (Kommers and Miller 2012; Vanberg 2000). This prominence has made the Court one of the most recognized and influential institutions in the German political system, as well as one of the most popular. Indeed, public support for the Court consistently exceeds that of the other major German political institutions (Vanberg 2005).8"
"43","The support of the German public has not, however, fully insulated the Court from the possibility of noncompliance. Although elected officials rarely engage in outright defiance of the Court's decisions, less publicized means of noncompliance pose credible threats to the Court's authority and can influence the Court's decision making.9 For example, A government can fail to pass the legislation necessary to implement a Court decision, as the federal government did in response to a 1980 ruling on civil servant pensions. Ordered to revise the tax code, the government failed to pass the legislation, citing the complex nature of the issue at hand as justification for the legislative delay.10 Alternatively, a government can pass legislation creating a policy that on its face conforms to the Court's decision but when implemented is substantively identical to the policy struck down by the Court. The federal government adopted this strategy when faced with an adverse ruling in 1992 regarding political party finance laws. The government did so by passing a revised law that made the changes requested by the Court but added a new clause that created a substantively equivalent policy to the one ruled unconstitutional.11"
"44","Importantly, the FCC's rules regarding hearings correspond to the parameters and assumptions of the model. Article 25 of the Federal Constitutional Court Act stipulates that “the Federal Constitutional Court shall decide on the basis of oral proceedings.” The FCC developed its own interpretation of the law's provisions for oral hearings determining that only certain types of cases, such as abstract review and political party prohibitions, are entitled to guaranteed oral hearings while constitutional complaints and concrete review cases, which compose the bulk of the Court's caseload, can be adjudicated with or without a hearing. As a result, public oral hearings have become the exception rather than the norm (Kommers and Miller 2012).         "
"45","A key assumption of the model is that hearings increase the likelihood of public awareness. To determine whether the German case meets this assumption, I constructed an original data set on newspaper and news agency coverage of all FCC decisions in my data set from 2000 to 2013. Using Lexis Nexis' Foreign Language News Search, I count the number of unique articles covering a case at two points: prior to the point when a hearing is announced (if one is held) and after the court issues a decision.12 An analysis of this coverage reveals the magnitude of hearings' influence on media coverage. While prehearing coverage is similar across all cases13 postdecision coverage is markedly different for cases granted a hearing: the expected number of articles covering an FCC decision is 90% greater for cases granted a hearing.14"
"46","I use data collected on published FCC decisions made between 1995 and 2014 reviewing the constitutionality of federal and state laws, which I then extend using Vanberg's (2005) data set of such cases from 1983 to 1995. The data set of 613 cases for which the Court had discretion over holding a hearing includes constitutional complaints, concrete review, public law disputes, election disputes involving the constitutionality of an electoral law, constitutional disputes between the national and state governments, and constitutional disputes within a state. It excludes cases in which the Court does not have discretion over hearings, such as abstract review cases and disputes between federal institutions.            "
"47","The outcome variable for the first and second hypotheses is the Court's decision to hold a hearing. The variable Hearing is coded 1 if the Court held a hearing and 0 otherwise. The outcome variable for the third hypothesis, Strike, is the Court' decision. The variable is coded 1 if the Court rules the statute unconstitutional and 0 if it upholds the statute.            "
"48","For the first hypothesis, which predicts the likelihood of a hearing to be greater for cases involving potential noncompliance, I measure the risk of noncompliance by examining whether or not the government whose statute is being challenged filed an amicus brief defending the constitutionality of the statute. Filing a brief requires a government to invest resources, which can indicate the level of importance politicians place on the law. Furthermore, filing a brief requires a government to take a public stance and risk its reputation on the issue. While such briefs are rarely direct threats of noncompliance, they signal to the court that the government has invested in the challenged policy and, as a result, may be willing to engage in noncompliance to continue its implementation. This variable, No Government Brief, is coded 0 when the challenged government files a brief defending the constitutionality of the statute under review and 1 otherwise.15"
"49","For the second hypothesis, I measure the expected impact of the hearing on public awareness with two variables. First, the complexity of a case can influence how much a hearing increases public awareness. As the complexity of a case increases, so does the difficulty citizens may have in understanding the case. The average citizen is, in general, more likely to observe and comprehend simpler cases than more complex ones. As a result, hearings should be more effective at increasing public awareness in simple cases than in complex cases. To measure complexity, I use Vanberg's (2005) dichotomous coding scheme to construct the variable Case Complexity. Cases involving taxation, budgets, economic regulation, social insurance, civil servant compensation, and party finance are coded as “complex” with a value of 0, whereas those involving institutional disputes, family law, judicial process, individual rights, asylum rights, and military conscription are coded as “simple” with a value of 1.            "
"50","The second measure is the type of proceeding. Constitutional complaints allow citizens to take claims against the government for unconstitutional actions directly to the constitutional court. This procedure critically provides citizens the opportunity to directly challenge the legality of legislation.16 Constitutional complaints are more easily relatable for the public, as the cases involve instances of individual harm rather than the more technical questions of constitutional jurisprudence raised by lower courts in concrete review cases. As a result, news coverage of a citizen's complaint against the government should be more effective at increasing public awareness. Thus, I expect the FCC to be more likely to hold a hearing for constitutional complaints than other proceedings. The variable Constitutional Complaint is coded 1 for constitutional complaints and 0 for all other proceedings.17"
"51","Since the third hypothesis predicts the Court to be more likely to rule against the government in cases granted a hearing, the independent variable for this hypothesis is whether or not the Court held a public oral hearing. This variable, Hearing, is the same as the outcome variable for the first and second hypotheses.            "
"52","The theoretical model identifies the conditions under which the decision to hold a hearing coincides with the risk of noncompliance, the expected effectiveness of hearings at increasing public awareness, and case disposition. Fisher's exact test provides a straightforward method for determining the relationship between two dichotomous variables such as those used here. Based on the first hypothesis, I expect an odds ratio of less than 1 for the relationship between Hearing and No Government Brief. For the second hypothesis, I expect the odds ratio between Hearing and each of the effectiveness measures, Case Complexity and Constitutional Compliant, to be greater than 1 when No Government Brief equals 0. Similarly, for the third hypothesis, I expect an odds ratio greater than 1 for Hearing and Strike when No Government Brief equals 0. The results of this preliminary analysis, presented in Table 1, conform to the theoretical model's predictions.18"
"53","Although this preliminary analysis supports the theoretical account, the conclusions we can draw from the results are limited in two critical ways. First, it is difficult to discern the substantive significance of the relationships from these results. Second, these results do not take potential confounding factors into account. To address these issues, I estimate logistic regressions. This approach provides estimates of both the statistical and substantive significance of the hypothesized relationships while controlling for potential confounders."
"54","The Noncompliance Risk Hypothesis (H1) predicts a negative relationship between No Government Brief and Hearing. For the Effectiveness Hypothesis (H2) and Strategic Case Disposition Hypothesis (H3), I follow Kam and Franzese's (2007) recommendation to estimate a model including an interaction term between the independent variables and the conditioning variable, in this case No Government Brief.19 The coefficients of the interaction's constituent terms estimate the relationship between the outcome of interest and the independent variables when there is a risk of noncompliance (No Government Brief = 0), while the coefficient of the interaction estimates this relationship when noncompliance is not at issue (No Government Brief = 1). For the Effectiveness Hypothesis, I estimate models interacting each measures of effectiveness (Case Complexity and Constitutional Complaint) with No Government Brief. I expect the variables Case Complexity and Constitutional Complaint to be positive and statistically significant, whereas the interaction between those variables and No Government Brief should not be statistically significant. For the Strategic Case Disposition Hypothesis, I estimate a model interacting Hearing with No Government Brief.20 The coefficient of Hearing should be positive and statistically significant, whereas the interaction term between Hearing and No Government Brief should not be statistically significant.            "
"55","I include a series of control variables to address potential omitted variable bias. First, The court's decision to hold a hearing may be a function of existing salience rather than the risk of noncompliance. As salience may correlate with the government's decision to file a brief, failing to control for existing public awareness of a case could lead to biased results. The variable Total Briefs measures existing salienec using the number of amicus briefs filed for a case, as greater interest group participation can be indicative of a case's salience (Spriggs and Wahlbeck 1997; Vanberg 2005). A second measure of existing salience considers whether the challenged statute was passed by the federal government or a state government. Federal laws are likely to have a broader societal impact than subnational laws, which may lead the public to be more aware of a case if it involves a national rather than subnational law.21 Federal Law takes a value of 1 for cases involving a federal statute and 0 for subnational statutes.            "
"56","I further control for two potential alternative goals judges may pursue through the use of hearings. Scholars have argued that the U.S. Supreme Court uses oral arguments as an information‐gathering tool to improve the quality of decisions (e.g., Johnson 2001). If this is the case at the FCC, then we should expect to observe the Court holding hearings more often in cases for which it lacks information. I control for this alternative explanation by considering whether or not another court has provided the FCC with a brief analyzing the case. I focus on the other courts in the German judiciary because they are more likely to provide reliable information than interest groups or other interested third parties. The variable Court Brief is coded 1 if any lower court files a brief and 0 otherwise. Second, the FCC may use hearings to legitimate decisions by providing plaintiffs with their day in court. If the Court is concerned about highlighting the legitimacy of the process, we should observe the likelihood of the FCC holding a hearing increase when the complainant is supported by third parties. Therefore, I include the variable Complainant Support, which is coded 1 if a brief was filed supporting the plaintiff's position and 0 otherwise.            "
"57","Additionally, I control for the institutional structure of the FCC. Decisions and public oral hearings are carried out by one of two senates consisting of eight judges (Kommers and Miller 2012). Differences in the senates' personnel and jurisdiction may lead to different strategies both by litigants and the Court that result in systematic variation in the use of hearings. I address this possibility with the variable Second Senate. Cases adjudicated by the Second Senate are assigned a value of 1 and those adjudicated by the First Senate coded as 0.            "
"58","Similarly, I control for potential confounding factors in testing the third hypothesis. First, I control for the legal merits of each case. I follow the example of Vanberg (2005) and examine the opinion of lower courts to control for the legal merits. The lower courts of the German judiciary are staffed with judges who have the necessary legal expertise and familiarity with the FCC's jurisprudence to provide the Court with a clear portrayal of a case's legal merits. Furthermore, while the information provided by interest groups is likely biased, the FCC can have greater confidence in the objectivity of the legal reasoning presented in lower court briefs. The variable Lower Court Unconstitutional Brief is coded 1 if any lower court filed a brief supporting the plaintiff and 0 otherwise. In addition, I include a variable considering only briefs filed by the high courts of the national and state judiciaries, as these courts may provide higher‐quality arguments than lower courts. This variable, High Court Unconstitutionality Brief, is coded 1 if a high court in the German federal or state judiciaries files a brief in support of declaring the statute unconstitutional. A third control for legal merits, Amicus Brief Balance, is calculated by subtracting the number of pro‐plaintiff briefs from the number of pro‐government briefs. Thus, a negative number indicates more support for the plaintiff than the government, whereas more support for the government is indicated by a positive value.            "
"59","I additionally include the variable Second Senate to account for the possibility hearings vary systematically across the two senates in a manner that correlates with case disposition. Case Complexity is also included, as Vanberg (2005) finds it is a significant predictor of FCC decisions. Finally, I control for the governing party. To account for possible partisan bias on the Court, the variable CDU captures the partisan identity of the defendant government. This variable is intended to ensure that my results are not driven by a predisposition of the Court to rule for or against a specific political party. This variable takes a value of 1 when the head of the defendant government is a member of the Christian Democratic Union (or Christian Social Union in Bavaria) and 0 otherwise.            "
"60","Table 2 displays the results of the logistic regressions for the Noncompliance Risk (H1) and Effectiveness Hypotheses (H2). Model 1 analyzes the Noncompliance Risk Hypothesis. As predicted by the theoretical model, the FCC is more likely to hold a hearing when the government files a brief defending the challenged statute's constitutionality. Importantly, this relationship remains statistically significant after controlling for potential confounding factors.22 Figure 2 presents the substantive significance of this relationship by plotting the predicted probability of the FCC holding a hearing based on the presence or absence of a government brief.23 The predicted probability of the FCC holding a hearing when the government files a brief is 17%, whereas the probability of a hearing when the government does not file a brief is 6%.24"
"61","Models 2 and 3 analyze the Effectiveness Hypothesis, with the former model using Case Complexity as the key explanatory variable and the latter model using Constitutional Complaint. The Effectiveness Hypothesis predicts that, when faced with a risk of noncompliance, the FCC is more likely to hold a hearing when doing so will have the largest effect on public awareness. The empirical results support this prediction. Based on the results of Model 2, the FCC is more likely to hold a hearing for cases involving “simple” issue areas, but only when there is a risk of noncompliance. The substantive significance of this relationship is presented in Figure 3. In cases including a brief filed by the government, the probability of a hearing increases from 12% for “complex” cases to 25% for “simple” cases. However, when the government does not file a brief defending the law, case complexity does not have a statistically significant relationship with the Court's decision to hold a hearing.            "

"64","Model 3 yields a similar relationship between proceeding type and hearings. The FCC is more likely to hold a hearing for constitutional complaints than other proceeding types, including concrete review cases. The probability of a hearing for a constitutional complaint is 24% compared to 11% for other proceeding types (see Figure 4). This relationship holds, however, only when the government files a brief defending the constitutionality of the statute. When no such brief is filed, proceeding type does not have a statistically significant relationship with the Court's decision to hold a hearing.            "

"67","Table 3 presents the analysis of the Case Disposition Hypothesis (H3). This hypothesis states that, given a risk of noncompliance, the likelihood the FCC striking down the challenged statute should be greater for cases granted a hearing. The results of Models 4 and 5 support for this hypothesis.25 German federal and state governments tend to lose cases more often when the Court holds a public oral hearing. This tendency, however, only holds in those cases for which the government filed a brief stating its preference that the law be upheld. When this is not the case and the risk of noncompliance is low, there is no statistically significant relationship between hearings and the Court's willingness to rule against the government.            "
"68","To substantively interpret these relationships, Figure 5 provides predicted probabilities of the Court ruling the challenged statute unconstitutional according to whether a hearing was held and whether the government filed a brief defending the statute's constitutionality. First, consider when the government does file such a brief. For these cases, the probability of the Court striking down the law after holding a public oral hearing is 58%. When the Court does not hold a hearing in such cases, however, the probability of an unconstitutionality ruling is 35%.26 This relationship between hearings and case disposition fails to reach statistical significance, however, in cases that do not include a brief from the government defending the statute's constitutionality.

"71","This article developed a theory of how judicial institutions enable courts to manage potential noncompliance by elected officials. I have shown how a court can use one of the most prominent judicial procedures, public oral hearings, to expand its capacity to effectively exercise constitutional review. By enhancing the public's ability to observe and evaluate instances of potentially unconstitutional behavior, hearings serve as a valuable institutional for courts tasked with holding governments accountable for breaches of their constitutional obligations. The theory and empirical results presented here have several implications for the study of constitutional courts and the politics of constitutional review."
"72","This article has implications for the study of the German Federal Constitutional Court. The conventional wisdom has been that a case's saliency is the primary determinant for whether the Court holds a hearing (Vanberg 2001, 355; 2005, 103; Kommers and Miller 2012, 27). While my analysis shows empirical support for the previously untested claim of salience's effect, it also provides compelling evidence for the article's novel claim that the threat of noncompliance motivates the FCC's use of hearings. Moreover, the results reveal the substantively significant influence of noncompliance, most notably in comparison to the influence of salience. Together with Vanberg's empirical evidence, these results provide further evidence that the risk of noncompliance influences the FCC's behavior.         "
"73","The results of this study are also interesting when considered in light of recent evidence of the ideological basis of decision making by European constitutional courts (e.g., Hanretty 2012; Hönnige 2011). This line of research has demonstrated that courts strike government actions more often when the court consists of judges with conflicting ideological preferences to that of the government (Hönnige 2009). Interestingly, such ideological considerations cannot account for the results presented here. By typical measures of ideology, the FCC had no variation in ideological divergence from the government during the period of this study (Hönnige 2009). By incorporating the judicial process into an explanation for judicial behavior, the patterns presented here of FCC decision making, and their systematic connection to procedural choice, complement these past studies and provide a richer depiction of adjudication in these courts. This study further suggests that previous evidence of ideological voting on constitutional courts likely understates the actual prevalence of ideological considerations in judges' sincere preferences over rulings. Based on the model and findings presented here, noncompliance concerns should cause judges, at least some of the time, to vote strategically and uphold government actions that they ideologically oppose. This finding directs the attention of future research on Europe's constitutional courts toward incorporating the procedures and processes that shape the judicial process, such as the constitutional complaint, into theories of judicial behavior and empirical studies of ideological voting on constitutional courts.         "
"74","The study additionally offers insights into the role and influence of public oral hearings on judicial review. The most developed empirical literature on hearings addresses the U.S. Supreme Court's oral arguments. In these works, hearings affect judicial review by serving as an information‐gathering tool for judges (Johnson 2001) and an opportunity for the federal government to convert the Solicitor General's superior resources and expertise into a higher likelihood of winning (Johnson, Wahlbeck, and Spriggs 2006). While addressing important questions, this line of research is limited to considering behavior after the Court has decided to hold oral arguments. In contrast, this article poses the question of why courts opt to hold hearings when they do. A more complete appreciation of hearings might consider how the answers to these two distinct questions complement or contradict each other.         "
"75","The results further highlight the influence of institutional rules on the quality of liberal democratic governance. Liberal democratic governance requires elected officials to adhere to constitutional obligations and constitutional courts to hold officials to account when they breach those obligations. To effectively do so, constitutional courts must be willing to rule against the wishes of the government and then maximize the chance such rulings will be accompanied by electoral or other pressures on the government to comply. The theoretical account presented here suggests that courts use procedures such as public oral hearings to increase public attention to cases of unconstitutional behavior and thereby bring such pressures upon officials. The discretion available to courts allows them to use hearings both when they are most needed to confront threats of noncompliance and when they will be most effective at garnering public attention. Ultimately, as evidenced by the empirical results from the German Constitutional Court, hearings provide courts with a route through which they can more readily exercise their authority and hold government officials accountable for breaches of their constitutional obligations."
"76","Finally, my findings have implications for the study of compliance. Scholars of the politics of judicial review are increasingly considering how threats of noncompliance constrain constitutional courts (e.g., Carrubba and Gabel 2015; Carrubba, Gabel, and Hankla 2008; Carrubba and Zorn 2010; Staton 2006, 2010; Vanberg 2001, 2005). This article provides further theoretical and empirical support for this literature's key conclusion that noncompliance shapes judicial behavior and substantiates the conclusion of previous studies (Staton 2006, 2010) that courts use the institutional tools at their disposal to address potential noncompliance. Moreover, the article extends Staton's conclusions regarding media relations by demonstrating that the list of institutional tools includes key features of the judicial process. A key implication of this finding is that similar strategic judicial behavior may extend to a multitude of facets of the judicial process; courts have a list of potential tools that go far beyond public oral hearings and press releases. For example, many courts, including the FCC, can reduce the ambiguity of rulings by specifying the date upon which the government must implement new legislation. The theoretical account presented here suggests that the relationship between public awareness and noncompliance may be one possible explanation for the use of such features.27 Insofar as such tools can be manipulated to effectively influence public awareness, this article directs the attention of future research to the broader influence of potential noncompliance on the judicial process.
