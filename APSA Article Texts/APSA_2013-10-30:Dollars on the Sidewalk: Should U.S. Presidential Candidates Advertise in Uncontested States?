"1","Since 2000, over $1.13 billion has been raised through individual donations for presidential candidates in general elections (FEC 2010). The year 2008 marked the first year that a presidential candidate rejected federal matching funds and continued to raise money from individual contributions throughout the general election campaign. In doing so, Senator Obama raised nearly $656 million in individual contributions, which comprised 88% of all funds raised from June through November (OpenSecrets.org 2010). Even though Senator McCain accepted federal matching funds, 54% of his contributions still came from individual donations, amounting to $199 million (OpenSecrets.org 2010). These dollar amounts and percentages indicate the importance of individual‐level contributions and demonstrate that they are an integral part of presidential general election campaigns. While other articles (Ansolabehere, de Figueiredo, and Snyder 2003; Snyder 1990) focus on contributions from Political Action Committees (PACs) and corporations, the literature involving individual‐level contributions is sparse.         "
"2","Consistent with Ansolabehere, de Figueiredo, and Snyder (2003), we assume that donating to a campaign directly enters a giver's utility function. We posit that ads provide an informative mechanism, teaching viewers something about the politician.8 Without having to seek additional information, someone watching television can quickly learn something about the candidates running for office and perceive himself to be more informed about the election. The idea that short political videos are informative for viewers is not new to this study. Benjamin and Shapiro (2009) find suggestive evidence in an experimental context that individuals previously unaware of political candidates can predict 20% of the variance in electoral outcomes by simply watching 10‐second silent clips of the candidates' debates. They posit that a large factor in individuals' abilities to predict the winners lies in observing characteristics such as likeability and attractiveness. Thus, we suggest that the information individuals receive from advertisements is very broad and not necessarily directly related to the policy preferences of the candidate. Instead, information simply serves as a resource, and individuals with more information are more likely to participate in elections (Brady, Verba, and Schlozman 1995). We also argue that information reduces uncertainty, and according to Alvarez (1998), people tend not to participate in politics if they are uncertain about the candidates running. Thus, we expect that by reducing the fixed cost of obtaining information about candidates, ads increase an individual's probability of contributing to a political campaign.         "
"3","Unlike the relationship between advertising and voter turnout, the relationship between seeing an advertisement and contributing to a campaign can be immediate. After an ad airs, an individual may be enthusiastic about a candidate and prepared to vote for him. Unfortunately, the voter still must wait until November to actually cast his vote. By then, some of this enthusiasm may dwindle. Contributing, however, can be thought of as a consumption good, where an individual can donate as soon as she experiences excitement for a candidate."
"4","To estimate the effects of advertisements on contributions, we employ a unique identification strategy, focusing our analysis on states that were not competitive throughout the presidential general election. The analysis exploits the fact that politicians do not outwardly advertise in nonbattleground states. Figure 1 shows where U.S. presidential candidates and political parties advertised during the 2008 general election campaign. States that were competitive throughout the general election campaign, like Florida and Ohio, were inundated with ads. In states that were not competitive, like New York and Texas, only very small portions of the state received advertising; this is because of the incongruence of media‐market and state boundaries. Since borders of media markets do not directly align with borders of states, some areas of noncompetitive states receive spillover advertisements from competitive states. For example, areas of northeastern New York receive spillover ads from Vermont and New Hampshire, while areas of northern and western Texas receive spillover ads from New Mexico. These “accidental” advertisements in noncompetitive states provide us with the ability to isolate and estimate the effect of campaign advertising on campaign contributions.         "
"5","While we expect that a similar relationship between television advertising and campaign contributions also exists in battleground states, we limit our empirical work to noncompetitive states. In battleground states, we face a problem with omitted variable bias, as we cannot control for critical campaign activity, such as locations of speeches made by the candidates, extensive get‐out‐the‐vote campaigns, rallies, and other unobserved activity that could also encourage contributions. This makes it difficult to isolate the effects of advertising in determining an individual's level of contributions. By limiting our analyses to noncompetitive states, we are able to isolate the effect of television advertising from that of other campaign activities.9"
"6","Figure 2 further highlights the identification strategy used throughout this article, focusing on Illinois. The gray areas on the map indicate places that received at least some television advertising during the 2008 presidential general election campaign. Illinois was never considered a battleground state. As it was Senator Obama's home state, the Democratic candidate was predicted to win (and ultimately did carry) the state by a large margin. While neither presidential candidate intentionally advertised in Illinois media markets, several of the surrounding states—Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri—were competitive and received television advertising from both candidates throughout the election. Again, since media‐market borders do not align with state borders, individuals living in parts of Illinois still saw a significant level of advertising. People living in southwestern Illinois saw ads aired in the St. Louis media market, people living in southeastern Illinois saw ads aired in the Terre Haute media market, and individuals living in northwest Illinois saw ads aired in the Davenport media market. Voters in Chicago saw television advertisements because the Chicago media market also covers northwest Indiana. However, individuals living in media markets completely contained in Illinois, such as Champaign, Peoria, and Rockford, saw zero advertisements. This is consistent with the incentives of candidates, as all three markets fully contained in Illinois received zero ads, while all markets that overlapped with competitive states saw television advertisements.         "
"7","For contributions data, we rely on the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) individual contributions file. This file includes all contributions greater than $200 that were raised during the entire two‐year election cycle (e.g., 2007–2008 for the 2008 presidential election).10 As the FEC does not require the reporting of campaign contributions less than $200, one limitation of this study is that we are unable to account for all the money raised by the candidates and parties.         "
"8","From the FEC database, we examined only the national‐party committee contributions and the contributions assigned to each of the two major‐party candidates in the 2004 and 2008 presidential election years.11 We include all contributions aimed at the general election campaign; for 2008, that was any contributions reported from June 1 to Election Day. For the 2004 campaign, we extended the time period and examined contributions reported between March 1 and Election Day because both the Republican and Democratic presidential nominating campaigns wrapped up quickly in 2004.         "
"9","Because the individual‐level FEC data do not enable us to control for important covariates such as income and ethnicity, we aggregate contribution data to the zip‐code level. At this unit of analysis, we obtain demographic variables from the 2000 Census, such as population, population density, age, race, education, and income.12 We also obtain information on all populated zip codes in the United States in order to determine who did not give. Using zip codes as the unit of analysis is a significant improvement over previous work (studying advertisements and turnout) that uses county or higher levels of aggregation. Zip codes within the same county can be expected to differ greatly in their campaign contributions. For example, within Los Angeles County, there are zip codes with extremely high per capita incomes (Beverly Hills) and zip codes with much lower per capita incomes (Compton). Since we do not have information on individuals who did not give, the zip code is the smallest unit of analysis at which we can observationally study campaign contributions. In addition, because the Census provides us with a comprehensive list of all populated zip codes in the United States, when merged with the FEC data, we are able to determine in which zip codes no one contributed money to the candidates or national‐party committees. This way, when we perform our analysis, we are not restricted to models that look only at zip codes that contain “givers.”         "
"10","For campaign activities, we utilized the Wisconsin Advertising Project's (WiscAds) tracking of televised campaign advertisements. We limit the time frame to the same period covered by the FEC data, focusing specifically on the relationship between contributions and advertising during the general election cycle. Throughout the article, we measure the number of advertisements aired by the presidential candidates and political parties.13 WiscAds tracked the largest 100 media markets in 2004 (or 85% of the U.S. population), but all 210 U.S. media markets in 2008. We focus our analysis on 2008, using 2004 data to verify that 2008 was not an anomaly, and include one specification that contains 2004 and 2008 data, using only the largest 100 media markets.         "
"11","To determine whether or not a state was competitive over the course of the general election, we use both polling data and prediction markets. We first examine Intrade Prediction Market data: a state is considered competitive if the predicted probability of the Democratic candidate winning was within 10 percentage points of the predicted probability of the Republican candidate winning at any point during the general election campaign.14 Prediction markets provide an average estimate of the probability that an event occurs, and these predicted probabilities are based on beliefs (Wolfers and Zitzewitz 2004, 2006). These give us a reliable measure of the competitiveness of a given state for each month of the election, giving a consistent measure for each state and each month of the probability that each candidate will win the electoral votes in a state.15"
"12","As a reliability check, we also look at polling data obtained from Pollster.com to determine whether the Democratic and Republican candidates were ever within 10 percentage points of one another in each state. Using polling data to label a state as competitive or not is logical because it mirrors the way that politicians determine whether or not they are competitive in a particular state. The measure from Pollster.com labels more states as competitive than the Intrade prediction markets do and is somewhat more volatile. One cautionary note about the polling data is that the number of polls varies dramatically by state. For example, in 2008, there were over 100 polls conducted in Pennsylvania, approximately 75 of which were taken after the Pennsylvania primary was over. In contrast, there were just 11 statewide surveys conducted in Utah, all of which were following the Utah primaries. The measures of competitiveness, however, are comparable, so for our purposes, we used the Intrade measure. Unless specified otherwise, our results are robust to a competitiveness measure based on polling data.16 A list of all states that are considered noncompetitive is included in Appendix A of the online supporting information.         "
"13","Table 1 displays summary statistics of candidate, party, and total contributions for 2008 in both competitive and noncompetitive states. Although the caps on contributions to the national parties are less restrictive than the caps on contributions to individual candidates, dollars contributed to candidates greatly exceed contributions to parties. It is important to point out that in cases where candidates accepted federal funding, such as Senator McCain in 2008, contributions could still be made to the Republican National Committee (RNC) in support of his campaign expenses, so these two “goods”—contributing to a candidate and contributing to a party—can be thought of as substitutes.17"
"14","Table 2 shows the distribution of contributions in both competitive and noncompetitive states by zip code. In all locations, the median contribution is significantly less than the mean, which means that many zip codes contain no contributors. Even the 75th percentile of contributions is significantly lower than the mean contribution, so it is clear that the majority of dollars contributed are coming from zip codes that are in the top 95% of the contributions distribution. In the analysis that follows, we examine both zip codes with average contributing patterns as well as zip codes with large amounts of individual giving.         "
"15","Several concerns exist when estimating the effects of spillover advertisements on campaign contributions. Fundamentally, we want to ensure that the zip codes we compare are similar, based on demographic characteristics like population density, per capita income, and race. For example, looking at Figure 2, we do not want to compare zip codes in Chicago to zip codes in Champaign, unless we have some reason to believe those zip codes are similar. Instead, we want our counterfactual to capture the level of campaign contributions from zip codes in the Chicago media market had those zip codes not been exposed to any televised advertisements.18 Given this objective, we employ propensity‐score matching to pair like zip codes based on observable characteristics and estimate the effect of being “treated” with ads. Our treatment level is 1,000 ads, a low level of ads that are aired in competitive states.1920"
"16","Within the matching framework, we use both kernel and local linear regression (llr) specifications to pair treated and untreated zip codes based on density, median household income, percent of African Americans, percent of Hispanics, and percent of college graduates.21, 31 We calculate the propensity score based on the logit specification with state fixed effects shown in Equation 1.23 We compute our standard errors using bootstrapping.24 Our empirical specification is in Equation 1.            "
"17","For the kernel specification, we take a weighted average from the distribution of propensity scores, using the Epanechnikov kernel,25 which gives a weight approaching zero to zip codes that are not very similar in observables to the “treated” zip code.26 We use a similar approach with the llr estimation. Matching within state compares zip codes in Davenport, IL, to zip codes in Champaign, IL, allowing rural areas with lower population densities to be compared to other rural areas and dropping the treated zip codes that have no matches in observable variables. This enables us to pair each zip code receiving spillover ads with its most similar “controls” in the state in order to conclude how much people in a given zip code would have contributed had they received no televised advertisements.27"
"18","Appendix B in the online supporting information provides least squares results with state fixed effects. These results are replicated for the full sample, as well as a sample containing each treated zip code's nearest in‐state match. We cluster our standard errors by media zone. In both cases, the estimated effect is larger than that of the propensity‐score matching approach. We expect that this is because the matching procedure uses a nonlinear approximation to weight the relative similarity of each potential control zip code to the treated ones. Further, Diamond and Sekhon (2005) point out shortcomings of propensity‐score matching in favor of a genetic matching algorithm. Appendix B shows that results remain robust if we instead use this matching procedure.28"
"19","The most fundamental limitation to this empirical specification is that matching assumes the assignment of treatment is “strongly ignorable” given the observables from Equation 1.29 This means that people are randomly assigned into treatment and control groups conditional on observables and that the treatment and control groups differ only on the observable variables we included in the model; unobservable differencess are unaccounted for. For example, we assume Hispanics who select to live in urban areas close to the border are equivalent to those who choose to live in urban areas deep within the state. In addition, we assume that local radio and local news coverage of the national election is similar across treatment and control groups. In general, we think this assumption is valid since news on broadcast networks is more likely to cover local events, whereas cable news covers the national election, and coverage is consistent across markets. However, the assumption will be violated if a presidential candidate visits the competitive state, local news covers the event in a spillover market, people in the uncontested spillover area see this on a television program, and they choose to contribute based on this coverage.30"
"20","While matching zip codes on a measure that proxies for the distance to a border state is feasible, this matching forces similar zip codes to be closer in proximity, which we think is not the most important variable to match on ex ante.31 To combat this issue, we provide additional specifications where we drop zip codes with more than 5% of residents commuting to another state to work, a good proxy for distance to the border.3233 These results are presented in tandem with the average treatment effect on the treated for the full sample.         "
"21","Columns (1) and (3) in Table 3 show that the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of receiving ads for people in zip codes in uncontested states, relative to not receiving ads in observationally similar zip codes in the same state, is between $6,100 and $7,200 for the 2008 general election cycle. When we compare this to the mean contributions level in zip codes in noncompetitive states, $21,816, this is approximately one‐third of mean contributions in both specifications. In other words, zip codes in noncompetitive states that received accidental spillover advertisements contributed, on average, $6,100 more than did zip codes in noncompetitive states that did not receive any television advertisements. When we reduce the sample to exclude zip codes with more than 5% who are out‐of‐state commuters in Columns (2) and (4), the effect remains robust though slightly decreases the effect to 24% of mean contributions.         "
"22","A significant benefit of aggregating the data to the zip‐code level is our ability to include all zip codes that did not give. However, this makes it important to look not only at the average effect, but also at the distribution of effects. The bottom half of Table 3 displays propensity‐score matching results, only it focuses on the top 10 and 25% of the effects distribution. We see that the median effect is disproportionately smaller than the average effect, as expected, since we include zip codes that do not give. While the 75th percentile is slightly smaller than the mean effect, the 90th percentile is significantly larger than the mean, even when we drop commuting zip codes. Thus, we are interested in determining what factors distinguish the zip codes with the largest effect sizes. Table 4 characterizes the observable differences between treated zip codes with large effects (above the 90th percentile) and treated zip codes with smaller effects (below the 90th percentile). Even though we matched on observables for our counterfactual, we still find that when comparing zip codes similar in income and population density, the dense markets with high median household incomes have the strongest effect sizes probably because they have the largest pool of “givers” who are responsive to political ads.34 In Appendix B, we show that this table looks substantively similar if we drop zip codes with over 5% of residents commuting.         "
"23","Since we previously focused on the effects of advertising on dollars contributed during the 2008 presidential general election, we want to ensure that these results are not unique to 2008. Specifically, one might be concerned that results are driven by Obama's record‐setting fundraising efforts."
"24","This specification addresses the difference in aggregate zip‐code giving in a year the zip code received ads, when compared to one when it did not. Including data from both the 2004 and 2008 presidential general elections, this specification allows us to identify the effect of being “treated” on a single zip code, as is shown in Equation 2. The identification of β1 comes from zip codes that received spillover ads in one election cycle but not the other. For example, states like Indiana and Virginia were competitive in 2008 but not in 2004, which results in zip codes in Illinois and Maryland (noncompetitive states in both 2004 and 2008) receiving spillover ads in one election cycle, but not the other. Arkansas and Washington were competitive in 2004 and not in 2008, resulting in spillover ads in Idaho and Tennessee in 2004, but not in 2008.35 This parameter is identified via 2,096 zip codes (4,192 observations) that flip from “treated” to “untreated” or vice versa over the two election cycles. We also cluster our standard errors at the media zone level, as errors may be correlated geographically. The specific empirical model is Equation 2. A full list of media markets and a map of zip codes included in this specification are included in Appendix A.               "
"25","Column (1) of Table 5 shows when “treated” with ads, in either 2004 or 2008, aggregate zip‐code contributions were, on average, $9,369 more than when they were not “treated.” Further, Column (2) drops zip codes with more than 5% commuters and finds a similar result, though this is marginally insignificant. These results appear larger in magnitude than our matching results; however, the dollar amount corresponds to 27% of mean contributions, which is consistent with the previous results. Thus, even when using two years of data, we still find that being exposed to ads increases aggregate contributions.            "
"26","The results presented in Columns (1) and (2) of Table 5 also indicate that individuals contributed about $14,000 more in each zip code in 2008 as compared to 2004. While contributions, on average, were higher in 2008 than in 2004, we next seek to test whether or not the treatment effect differed by year, estimating Equation 3. This will identify the treatment effect for all noncompetitive zip codes in both election cycles, regardless of whether or not they switched their treatment status, providing a better sample with which to estimate the baseline 2008 contributions.               "
"27","Columns (3) and (4) of Table 5 show that there is no differential treatment effect across the two years. This confirms that the effect not only persists in 2004, but it also does not substantively differ across years. When including the interaction, the coefficient on the treatment dummy increases. This could be due to the increased sample that allows zip codes to be treated in both election cycles.            "
"28","While we argue that the demographics we employ are reasonable observables on which to match, we validate this with an additional specification designed to overcome the potential problem of “hidden bias” in assignment to the treatment or control group. For instance, we may be concerned that zip codes receiving spillover ads may differ in terms of past political participation, on which we have limited information at the zip‐code level. To ensure that such unobservables are not driving our results, we propose an additional model including monthly variation in ads and contributions, which includes zip‐code‐level fixed effects to control for any time‐invariant unobservables at the zip‐code level."
"29","In addition, this specification has the benefit of allowing us to examine the timing of advertisements and contributions. When testing the effects of advertising on variables like voter turnout and vote choice, the decision to vote necessarily comes after the advertising occurs. In contrast, individuals might see television ads and immediately decide to contribute to the campaign. Using a panel of zip codes throughout the 2008 general election, we exploit the timing of ads and contributions, focusing on monthly variation in both variables."
"30","We want to show that cumulative ads from time t0 through time t1 (or contemporaneous ads at time t1 alone) explain contributions at time t1 alone. To do this, we break the election into monthly periods from June through October.36 Since border states change in competitiveness over the course of an election, each zip code receiving spillover ads will receive a different number of ads each month. Thus, we expect monthly contributions to vary based on spikes in advertisements, and for each observation (a zip code, month pair), we look at the contributions (and logged contributions) by month, as in Equation 4.37 This specification uses a continuous measure of ads to determine if an increase in advertisements increases contributions in a zip code. Our empirical model is shown in Equation 4.               "
"31","We alternate between two measures of our key independent variable, monthly advertisements and cumulative advertisements. We choose the number of ads and not spending on advertising as our independent variable. The level of ads is a measure of intensity, where 1,000 ads in Philadelphia should not be different from 1,000 ads in Chicago in terms of how they affect individuals’ campaign contributions. While the cost of airing an ad is a proxy for market size, it is not a good predictor of zip‐code size and income.38"
"32","First, we use monthly ads to capture the dynamic nature of the general election campaign. Candidates advertise based on their perceived competitiveness of the contests, and thus the number of advertisements aired can vary dramatically from month to month. For instance, Pennsylvania was very competitive in June 2008 and received many ads, which meant that southern New Jersey received the same large number of spillover advertisements. However, Pennsylvania became less competitive as the 2008 election progressed. Obama and McCain aired fewer ads there, and thus southern New Jersey received fewer spillover ads in September than June. The effect of monthly ads on monthly contributions measures the immediate effect of television ads on individual campaign contributions. Second, we may think that a higher dosage of total ads may increase the probability that any individual in a zipcode will see an ad. Since we are measuring contributions at the zip‐code level, we also examine the possibility that cumulative ads up to a certain month can explain contributions in that specific month alone. Thus, the effect of cumulative ads on monthly contributions measures the likelihood that an individual has seen ads over the course of the campaign. This specification also uses zip‐code months as the unit of analysis, which allows us to account for unobservables at the zip‐code level as well as consider more explicitly the causal relationship between ads and contributions."
"33","With the inclusion of monthly data and zip‐code‐level fixed effects, it is no longer feasible to include all zip codes that never gave in 2008, as we did in previous models. Instead, we are looking only at zip codes that contributed (and received ads) during at least one of the months of the general election campaign. Across all specifications, controlling for the volume of advertising, contributions in September and October are significantly higher than contributions in June (the excluded month), July, and August. Table 6 illustrates the results of the monthly panel specification. In Columns (1) and (3), we see that a 10% increase in monthly ads, i.e., 1,000 to 1,100 ads, yields approximately a 10.1 dollar or 0.4% increase in aggregate monthly zip‐code giving, respectively. Columns (5) and (7) show that increasing cumulative ads by 10% leads to a 4.32 dollar or 0.6% increase in aggregate zip‐code giving for that single month, respectively, though the former is indistinguishable from zero. The results remain consistent when we drop commuting zip codes in Columns (2), (4), (6), and (8).            "
"34","These specifications are also consistent with the matching results. In the matching specification, going from zero to 1,000 ads (the treatment level) resulted in a 31% increase in contributions over the course of the general election cycle. In the monthly panel, increasing from zero to 200 ads per month (the equivalent of 1,000 per election cycle) yielded a 25% increase in monthly contributions.39"
"35","Since the top of the distribution has a large influence on the mean propensity‐score matching results, it seems that a politician may be able to receive additional resources by intentionally advertising in nonbattleground states with high‐income individuals. For instance, though New York State has not been competitive in a number of years, running ads in the New York City media market could result in enough contributions to not only pay for those advertisements, but also to generate additional money to redistribute to other areas of the country that are more competitive."
"36","To explore this further, we write down the politician's objective function for each market fully contained in an uncontested state that did not receive spillover ads to determine the optimal level of ads in each market. We begin with the simple profit‐maximization problem shown in Equation 5, where “profit” is equal to the increase in dollars contributed in a media market due to advertising, , less the total cost of running a certain number of ads. Here total cost is equal to the marginal cost of an ad, , times the number of ads aired in a month, , assuming constant marginal cost.40 Additionally, we make the coarse assumption that candidates will split the profit evenly, as they both tend to advertise in the same markets at the same time.41 The 2008 governor, House, and Senate WiscAds data report estimated costs of ads in each market, so this allows us to identify the median cost in each market, or the price of an ad. The median ad cost for presidential ads should not be different from the median ad cost for these advertisements, as networks are not permitted to price discriminate when selling advertising slots, and politicians tend to advertise on similar programs and at similar times of day. A presidential candidate solves the following maximization problem in each market fully contained within an uncontested state.            "
"37","We first take five media markets that contain some of the top contributing zip codes in noncompetitive states, all of which do not receive ads: New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, San Francisco, and Houston. Table 7 illustrates the results of this hypothetical policy experiment, using the optimal ads calculation described above. The second column reports how many zip codes are in each of these five media markets, and the third displays the median cost, or price of one ad in each market. Next, in column 4, we report the calculated optimal level of monthly ads in each market. From this, we calculate the net gain by market as described above, which we report in the final column. In all five media markets listed, we assert that candidates could make money by simply airing ads in media markets in these noncompetitive states. From these five markets alone, presidential candidates could potentially raise approximately $891,000 in individual contributions if they advertised at each market's optimal level. We expect that this estimate actually understates the effects in these markets, since we learned from the propensity‐score matching that higher‐income zip codes are those in which the effect is largest, so we consider this to be a lower bound. This “extra” money could then be redistributed to spending on a battleground state in order to increase a candidate's probability of winning that state's electoral votes.         "
"38","Using this same methodology to predict expected gains, we find that if candidates were to air the “optimal level” of advertisements in each uncontested market, this would result in a $3.02 million gain in all markets in uncontested states, and only three markets would not generate a positive return.43, 53 Based on the positive relationship between television advertising and campaign contributions, we argue that presidential candidates are leaving money on the table that they could collect if they were to advertise in media markets contained solely within noncompetitive states.         "
"39","We understand that this policy recommendation makes out‐of‐sample predictions. However, we still assert from our zip‐code fixed‐effects analysis that individuals gave more when their area was treated with ads than they did in the absence of ads. Thus, if an area was ever exposed to ads, it may be beneficial to a politician to continue advertising there, even in years where there is no overlap with a competitive state. For instance, even if New Hampshire were not competitive, advertising in Boston may still leave a politician with net gains."
"40","In 2000, George W. Bush spent $5.5 million on campaign advertisements in California—a state he ultimately lost by 12 percentage points, and a state that has not been won by a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. The question of why Bush's campaign spent precious advertising money in California, when that money could possibly have been put to better use in more competitive states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and, of course, Florida puzzles many scholars. According to a top Bush advisor, the expenditures were intended to fulfill the campaign's promise to be a force in California. “There was a commitment that we made to California early on, and that commitment was time and money” (Marks 2000). Based on our examination of fundraising and advertising in the 2004 and 2008 campaigns, this strategy likely paid off. By running television advertisements in a noncompetitive state, the Bush campaign may have raised more money from Californians than it spent in airing the ads and more than it would have raised had it not aired the advertisements at all.         "
"41","However, in the three presidential elections since 2000, we have not seen any presidential candidates or political parties spend money to advertise in noncompetitive states.45 We argue that by not doing so, candidates and parties appear to be leaving “dollars on the sidewalk.” In other words, because advertisements in spillover markets lead to increased campaign contributions, by not advertising in media markets with high‐income zip codes, candidates may not be reaching their full fundraising potential. We ultimately conclude that targeting advertising in noncompetitive areas with a large concentration of high‐income individuals may prove to be profitable for politicians.         "
