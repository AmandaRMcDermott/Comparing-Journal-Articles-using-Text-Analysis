"1","The dynamics of ambivalence has been the subject of remarkably little research. Despite this inattention, important insights into the dynamics of ambivalence can be gleaned from work on the sources of ambivalence. This literature suggests a pair of alternative theoretical accounts to explain individuals’ levels of ambivalence. These two accounts are rooted in information and motivation. I believe that the twin themes of information and motivation offer untapped theoretical leverage in explaining actual changes in ambivalence.         "
"2","Although they propose different pathways of influence, a number of studies underscore the importance of information in shaping the formation of ambivalence. A central tenet of this informational perspective is that ambivalence is, at least in part, a function of the heterogeneity of information that individuals encounter. The informational thesis is premised on the belief that individuals are, to varying degrees, exposed to competing arguments concerning the merits of political issues or candidates. The core contention is that heightened exposure to competing arguments, particularly arguments that challenge one's initial position, has the potential to create internalized conflict in judgment situations. This internalized conflict is, in turn, thought to engender ambivalence toward a given set of political issues or figures."
"3","The proposition that exposure to heterogeneous information breeds ambivalence is supported by a diverse range of empirical evidence. One purported pathway through which information shapes ambivalence rests upon qualitative differences in information processing. Rudolph and Popp (2007) argue that systematic or effortful processing gives rise to ambivalence by leading people to canvass all relevant considerations in a careful and evenhanded manner. Effortful thought, they submit, “operates as a mechanism that heightens people's exposure to competing considerations” (566). Consistent with this theory, they find that partisan and candidate ambivalence are positively associated with several dispositional sources of systematic processing. Similarly, Barker and Hansen (2005) find that those who are induced to engage in systematic processing exhibit greater attitudinal complexity and inconsistency in their political judgments, two traits known to be emblematic of ambivalence. In the present context, I hypothesize that indicators of effortful processing will increase candidate ambivalence over time.         "
"4","A second possible pathway to ambivalence involves the informational composition of individuals’ social networks. Informed by early research on social communication (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1944), Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague (2004) argue that heterogeneous networks contribute to ambivalence by regularly subjecting people to political disagreement or “cross pressures.” These cross pressures are said to amplify ambivalence by increasing the intensity and discouraging the polarization of candidate evaluations. The proposed link between heterogeneous networks and ambivalence is supported by the finding that candidate ambivalence is positively associated with partisan diversity within discussion networks (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004; Keele and Wolak 2008; Mutz 2002). Under this view, the internalized conflict that begets ambivalence is triggered not by effortful processing, but by the diversity of messages in one's social network. Based upon these findings, I expect that exposure to heterogeneous discussion networks will increase ambivalence over the course of the campaign.         "
"5","A third potential route to ambivalence is tied to political competition and the balance of elite messages in one's political environment. As observed by Keele and Wolak (2008), state‐level differences in the distribution of partisanship ensure that some states are more competitive politically than others. Since competitive states are more likely to be targeted by both campaigns, they argue, competition fosters “a distinct two‐sided information environment that could promote the internalization of arguments from both sides” (Keele and Wolak 2008, 656). The argument that political competition facilitates the development of ambivalence is supported by the positive link between state‐level partisan diversity and ambivalence toward presidential candidates (Keele and Wolak 2008). It is also buttressed by the finding that campaign intensity increases the likelihood of open‐minded thinking, a precursor to ambivalence (Kam 2006). I anticipate that residency in states with greater partisan diversity will heighten candidate ambivalence over time.         "
"6","A common theme underlies each of these proposed pathways to ambivalence. Whether triggered by effortful processing, social network composition, or political competition, each of these theories predicts that exposure to heterogeneous information will heighten ambivalence. Previous work suggests that each of these factors is associated with higher levels of ambivalence. The true test of this informational thesis, however, is whether such stimuli actually produce the hypothesized changes in ambivalence. Here the extant literature is on softer footing. Given its reliance on cross‐sectional data, the literature has only limited ability to make causal inferences about whether heterogeneous information exposure truly heightens ambivalence.3 In the analyses to follow, the panel design will allow us to more directly know whether heterogeneous information exposure increases ambivalence, and whether it does so through one or more of the three proposed pathways of influence.         "
"7","A second theoretical approach to the study of ambivalence is grounded upon differences in individuals’ motivations. Informed by theories of motivated reasoning (Kunda 1990; Lodge and Taber 2000; Redlawsk 2002; Taber and Lodge 2006), this perspective is premised on the assumption that individuals are, to varying degrees, motivated by accuracy goals or directional goals when preparing to make political judgments. Individuals motivated primarily by accuracy goals are expected to “seek out and carefully consider relevant evidence so as to reach a correct or otherwise best conclusion” (Taber and Lodge 2006, 756). Partisan or defensive reasoners, by contrast, are expected to “apply their reasoning powers in defense of a prior, specific conclusion” (756). Partisan motivation has distinct implications for the acquisition and evaluation of evidence in a judgment situation. Recent work suggests that partisan reasoners are more likely to seek out and accept attitudinally congruent arguments than those that are attitudinally incongruent (Taber and Lodge 2006). Such tendencies are indicative of a biased reasoning process that contributes to attitude polarization.         "
"8","The occurrence of partisan reasoning has direct implications for ambivalence levels. Because partisan reasoners are predisposed to accept attitudinally congruent arguments and to discount attitudinally incongruent arguments, they are less likely to be conflicted in their feelings toward political issues or figures.4 This diminished capacity for internalized conflict should, scholars have argued, manifest itself through lower levels of attitudinal ambivalence. The empirical record is generally consistent with such a motivational account. Individuals with strong prior attitude commitments have been shown to exhibit lower levels of partisan and candidate ambivalence than those with weaker commitments (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004; Keele and Wolak 2008; Rudolph and Popp 2007).         "
"9","A central tenet of the motivational thesis is that the confirmation and disconfirmation biases associated with partisan reasoning will eventually lead to attitude polarization. Polarization has been defined as “the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes” (Taber and Lodge 2006, 755). From this perspective, polarization is, properly conceived, a dynamic process that is best analyzed over time. If partisan reasoning leads to attitude polarization, then it should strengthen individuals’ attitudes and, consequently, diminish their ambivalence across time. This not only implies that partisan reasoners should exhibit lower levels of ambivalence at the outset of a campaign, but also that they should experience greater declines in ambivalence as the campaign unfolds. This expectation is based upon the observation that partisan reasoners tend to privilege attitudinally congruent arguments and devalue attitudinally incongruent ones. The accumulation of these biases over the course of a campaign should reduce ambivalence over time. Simply put, I hypothesize that partisan reasoners will experience greater ambivalence decline than those without such strong prior attitude commitments. Working against this hypothesis is the fact that partisan reasoners typically have lower starting levels of ambivalence. Given this, it may, from an empirical standpoint, be difficult for them to experience greater rates of ambivalence decline than dispassionate reasoners.         "
"10","Recent work suggests that partisan reasoning may also exert an indirect influence on ambivalence by moderating the impact of effortful processing (Rudolph and Popp 2007). Among dispassionate individuals, effortful processing is, as outlined earlier, expected to increase ambivalence by exposing people to competing considerations. Among those with strong prior attitude commitments, however, effortful processing may lead to attitudinal polarization rather than attitudinal moderation if such people thoroughly canvass only a biased subset of considerations (Millar and Tesser 1986). This perspective suggests an alternative hypothesis in which effortful processing heightens ambivalence among dispassionate reasoners but lowers it among partisan reasoners. The proposition that partisan reasoning will moderate the effects of effortful processing on ambivalence is not without empirical support. Rudolph and Popp (2007) report an interaction between political knowledge and partisan strength such that political knowledge is associated with higher levels of candidate ambivalence among weak partisans and lowers levels of ambivalence among strong partisans. The analyses to follow will directly test whether partisan reasoning moderates the effects of effortful processing on ambivalence change.         "
"11","When analyzing the dynamics of ambivalence, an important question to consider is whether the sources of ambivalence change vary across stages of the campaign. In particular, do certain factors exert more or less influence during the general election than they do during the primaries? My expectations here are guided by the nature of political competition that occurs during each of these two periods. Primaries are characterized by intraparty competition while general elections are characterized by interparty competition. The latter is more likely to emphasize differences between candidates of opposing parties. I believe these different forms of competition may influence the relative weight assigned to particular considerations during candidate evaluations. Specifically, I expect that partisan factors (e.g., partisan strength, state partisan diversity) may exert greater influence during periods of interparty competition than during periods of intraparty competition. Nonpartisan considerations, by contrast, are not expected to have greater influence during periods of interparty competition."
"12","Each of the proposed theoretical accounts implies a dynamic process in which ambivalence change is the result of specified informational or motivational factors. To adequately test these theories, we require a research design that is capable of observing ambivalence change at the individual level. Such a design is furnished by the recently released 2008–2009 ANES Panel Study. The 2008–2009 ANES panel consists of 21 waves of monthly surveys administered between January 2008 and September 2009. Eight of the 21 waves featured political content and six of these took place during the 2008 presidential campaign. Of these six waves, five included the requisite items needed to construct measures of candidate ambivalence. The analyses to follow are based on data from these five waves: January 2008 (N = 1,623), February 2008 (N = 1,457), June 2008 (N = 1,420), September 2008 (N = 2,586), and October 2008 (N = 2,628)."
"13","Constructing a measure of candidate ambivalence requires information about how much each individual likes or dislikes the two presidential nominees. In each of the five relevant waves of the 2008–2009 ANES panel, respondents were asked whether they liked or disliked John McCain and Barack Obama. Respondents were asked, for example, “Do you like John McCain, dislike him, or neither like nor dislike him?” Respondents were then asked a follow‐up question: “Do you [like/dislike] him a great deal, a moderate amount, or a little?” Responses to these two questions are used to create a 7‐point scale of attitudes toward McCain (or Obama) ranging from 1 (dislike a great deal) to 7 (like a great deal)."
"14","Candidate ambivalence is calculated using the comparative candidate ambivalence formula proposed by Lavine and colleagues (Basinger and Lavine 2005; Lavine 2001). In the present context, comparative candidate ambivalence can be expressed as , where M and O represent attitudes toward McCain and Obama, respectively. From a theoretical standpoint, this formula, which is derived from Thompson, Zanna, and Griffin's (1995) general index of ambivalence, defines ambivalence as a function of attitude intensity corrected by attitude similarity.5 Given the possible values of M and O, this formula produces an index of candidate ambivalence with a numerical range of −2 to 7, where higher values denote greater ambivalence. The maximum value on the ambivalence scale (7) is obtained when a respondent expresses strong attraction to both opposing candidates (i.e., 7, 7). The minimum score (−2) occurs when a respondent strongly likes one candidate and strongly dislikes the other (i.e., 1, 7 or 7, 1). It should be noted that, under this modified Griffin index, simultaneous disliking and simultaneous liking are not treated as equivalent states of ambivalence (Rudolph 2005; Steenbergen and Brewer 2004). Separate measures of candidate ambivalence are calculated for each respondent in each of the panel waves. In the analyses to follow, ambivalence change is defined as the difference in candidate ambivalence between two specified waves.            "
"15","The informational thesis posits that ambivalence should, over time, increase among those who are exposed to heterogeneous information. Such exposure is represented in the analysis in three different ways. First, it is represented by two individual‐level traits that are recognized as key sources of systematic processing, political knowledge, and need for cognition.6 Political knowledge, which reflects the ability to engage in systematic processing, “crisply distinguishes between heuristic and systematic processing in the political world” (Kam 2005, 175). A political knowledge scale is created by averaging the number of correct responses to six questions about political matters.7 Need for cognition reflects the desire to engage in systematic processing. Need for cognition has been linked to a variety of outcomes that are indicative of effortful processing, including decreased reliance on peripheral cues (Haugtvedt, Petty, and Cacioppo 1992), the elucidation of reasons to support candidates (Ahlering 1987; Condra 1992), and thinking more about candidates (Cacioppo et al. 1986). A need for cognition scale is created by averaging responses to the ANES’ standard two‐item battery.            "
"16","Second, exposure to heterogeneous information is represented by individuals’ social network composition. In the 2008–2009 ANES panel, respondents were asked to identify the names of people with whom they talked about government or elections during the past six months. Respondents were then asked a series of detailed follow‐up questions about the first three names that they mentioned. Respondents were classified as belonging to one of three types of networks. Reinforcing networks are those in which all discussion partners share a common party identification that coincides with that of a given respondent. Cross‐cutting networks are those in which all discussion partners share a common party identification that conflicts with that of a respondent. Mixed networks are those in which the discussion partners are of mixed party identification or Independents.8 The prospects for heterogeneous information exposure should be greatest in cross‐cutting networks and weakest in reinforcing networks.            "
"17","Third, exposure to heterogeneous information is represented using a state‐level measure of political competition. Using tracking poll data from Gallup, I recorded the percentage of Republican and Democratic identifiers in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The distribution of state‐level party identification is based on telephone interviews with 355,334 national adults, aged 18 and older, conducted in 2008 as part of Gallup Poll daily tracking. Following Keele and Wolak (2008), and equipped with these state‐level shares of Republican and Democratic identifiers, I calculated a Herfindahl index for each state.9 Higher values on this scale indicate greater balance in partisan concentrations within a state and imply higher levels of partisan diversity and competition. Opportunities for exposure to heterogeneous information are expected to be greater in states with higher levels of partisan diversity.            "
"18","The motivational thesis anticipates that ambivalence should decline among those with strong prior attitude commitments because such individuals are most likely to engage in defensive reasoning. To test this hypothesis, the statistical model includes two indicators of directional goals. The first indicator is a 4‐point scale of partisan strength, with the low end anchored by Independents and the high end anchored by strong partisans. A second measure captures whether respondents care about the outcome of the presidential election. Ambivalence is expected to decline among stronger partisans and those who care about the election outcome. To test the hypothesis that partisan reasoning moderates the effects of effortful processing, an interaction is formed between partisan strength and political knowledge.10"
"19","I begin the analysis with a descriptive account of ambivalence change during the 2008 presidential campaign. Table 1 reports the distribution of ambivalence change from the beginning (January wave) to the end (October wave) of the campaign. As can be seen, most respondents did not display the same level of ambivalence near the end of the campaign as they did at its beginning. Less than one‐fifth of respondents (17.3%) experienced no ambivalence change over this period. Approximately one‐quarter of respondents (25.7%) became more ambivalent over time. A majority of respondents (57.1%), however, exhibited less candidate ambivalence in October than they did in January. These data strongly suggest that, for most citizens, ambivalence does indeed fluctuate over the course of a presidential campaign and that, when it moves, ambivalence tends to move downward.         "
"20","To paint a more complete picture of ambivalence change, Figure 1 displays the mean level of candidate ambivalence in each of the five available waves. Figure 1 reveals considerable downward movement in ambivalence throughout the campaign. The decline in ambivalence can be characterized as monotonic but uneven. The biggest decline occurs from the beginning to end of the primary season (January–June). The mean level of ambivalence falls during this period by 1.02 points, a figure that is roughly equivalent to 11% of the entire range in the ambivalence scale. From the beginning to end of the general election (June–October), by comparison, mean ambivalence falls by 0.16 points or roughly 2% of the scale. In short, these data suggest that the rate of ambivalence decay is steeper during the primary months than during the general election.         "

"23","Does ambivalence move uniformly across all individuals? As a preliminary pass at this question, I disaggregate candidate ambivalence by one of the explanatory variables and compare the dynamics of ambivalence for each subgroup. Across the five available waves, Figure 2 displays the mean levels of ambivalence for respondents with different levels of partisan strength: strong partisans, weak partisans, leaners, and Independents. Three observations are worthy of note. First, consistent with previous research, the results show that levels of ambivalence are inversely related to partisan strength. At each of the five time points, ambivalence is lowest among strong partisans, highest among Independents, and in the middle for leaners and weak partisans. Second, although all four groups finish the campaign with lower levels of ambivalence than they started with, the magnitude of these declines appears to vary by partisan strength. Among Independents and leaners, ambivalence declines by 0.42 and 0.69 points, respectively. Among weak partisans, the average amount of ambivalence decline is much larger in magnitude at 1.18 points. Consistent with expectations, strong partisans experience the greatest reduction in ambivalence at 1.70 points, more than twice that experienced by Independents and leaners. These results suggest that partisan strength influences not only individuals’ initial levels of ambivalence, but also the rate of ambivalence decay over time. Third, the results indicate that fluctuations in ambivalence vary by partisan strength, particularly during the general election. During the primary months (January–June), candidate ambivalence experiences a similar and steep decline across each of the four subgroups. During the months of the general election (June–October), this decline continues, albeit more modestly, among both strong and weak partisans. Among leaners and Independents, however, ambivalence undergoes a small but visible rebound. Collectively, these results provide descriptive evidence that ambivalence does not move uniformly across individuals over time.         "

"26","I now subject the informational and motivational theses to multivariate analysis. Table 2 reports the results of a hierarchical linear model in which ambivalence change is modeled as a function of the individual‐level and state‐level variables discussed above.11 In this model, the dependent variable is the simple difference between individuals’ ambivalence levels at two specified time points (Δ Ambivalenceit= Ambivalenceit–Ambivalenceit−1). Each column in Table 2 represents an identically specified estimation equation. The first data column reports the results of the model from the beginning to end of the campaign (January–October). The second data column presents the results from start to finish of the primary season (January–June), while the third data column shows the results from start to finish of the general election (June–October). Each equation shares a common set of explanatory variables, which are measured at the earliest wave available. Each equation also includes lagged ambivalence to control for regression to the mean effects.         "
"27","Consider first the determinants of ambivalence change from January to October, the two time points marking the beginning and end of the presidential campaign. As shown in the first data column of Table 2, the coefficient for partisan strength is, as expected, both negatively signed and statistically significant. Consistent with the motivational thesis, this result implies that stronger partisans become less conflicted in their views over time and, as a result, exhibit less candidate ambivalence.12 The coefficient representing those who care about the election outcome is also negative and significant. This result provides additional support for the contention that those who engage in defensive reasoning will become less ambivalent over time.         "
"28","Evidence for the informational thesis during this time period is somewhat mixed. The informational thesis posits three possible pathways through which exposure to heterogeneous information may reduce ambivalence. The first of these pathways involves effortful processing. Contrary to expectations, neither political knowledge nor need for cognition directly increases ambivalence over time. This result suggests that just because these indicators of effortful processing are associated with higher levels of ambivalence at the outset of a campaign (Keele and Wolak 2008; Rudolph and Popp 2007), they do not necessarily increase ambivalence as the campaign unfolds. As evidenced by the significant interaction between political knowledge and partisan strength, however, effortful processing does have a conditional impact.13 This interaction, which is depicted in the top panel of Figure 3, shows that political knowledge does heighten ambivalence, but only among dispassionate reasoners. Among partisan reasoners, by contrast, political knowledge has a polarizing effect and reduces ambivalence over time.         "
"29","                 Interaction between Partisan Reasoning and Effortful Processing                      "
"30","Empirical support for the second proposed pathway, social network composition, is quite strong. The coefficient representing those in mixed social networks is both positive and statistically significant.14 This indicates that individuals who discuss politics with at least some people outside their party become more ambivalent over time than those who only discuss politics with copartisans (i.e., reinforcing networks). The coefficient denoting participation in cross‐cutting networks is positive, significant, and even larger in magnitude. This suggests that, as expected, the greatest increases in ambivalence occurs among those whose discussion partners all identify with the opposing political party.15 The third pathway involves the degree of political competition in a campaign environment. Although positively signed as expected, the coefficient for state‐level partisan diversity fails to reach statistical significance.         "
"31","Do these informational and motivational factors matter in both stages of the campaign, and, if so, does the magnitude of their influence on ambivalence change vary? To explore this possibility, the model is reestimated separately for the periods covering the primary season and the general election.16 Comparing across columns in Table 2, it is evident that partisan strength reduces ambivalence across both stages of the campaign. The magnitude of this effect, however, is not constant across periods. As shown in Table 3, a one‐unit increase in partisan strength reduces ambivalence by 0.60 points during the general election and by only 0.48 points during primary season, a difficult feat since the vast majority of ambivalence decline takes place during the primaries (see Figure 1). This suggests that the greatest impact of partisan strength is not felt until after the two parties have settled on their respective nominees and interparty competition is in full swing. The opposite pattern occurs for those who care about the election outcome. Its effects, in contrast to those of partisan strength, are of greater magnitude during the primaries. Since this variable can be viewed as a nonpartisan indicator of defensive reasoning, its influence is understandably less dependent upon the selection of party nominees.         "
"32","As Table 2 makes clear, there is qualified support for the effortful processing pathway in both stages of the campaign. Contrary to expectations, political knowledge and need for cognition fail to trigger increases in candidate ambivalence. As before, though, there is a reliable interaction between political knowledge and partisan strength during both time periods. These interactions are displayed in the middle and bottom panels of Figure 3. Consider first the results during the primary season. Among the weakest partisans, political knowledge increases ambivalence by 0.52 points over time. Among the strongest partisans, however, political knowledge decreases ambivalence by 0.38 points, producing a polarization effect of 0.90 points. This polarization effect is twice as large during the general election. Among the weakest partisans, political knowledge heightens ambivalence by 1.0 points. Among the strongest partisans, though, political knowledge reduces ambivalence by 0.81 points, producing a polarization effect of 1.81 points.         "
"33","Consistent with the informational thesis, social network composition influences ambivalence change during both phases of the presidential campaign. During the primaries and the general election, those who are exposed to mixed or cross‐cutting networks become more ambivalent than those involved in a reinforcing network. The effects of cross‐cutting exposure are, as expected, somewhat larger than those of mixed exposure. Mixed exposure heightens ambivalence by 0.48 points during the primaries and by 0.40 points during the general election. Cross‐cutting exposure heightens ambivalence by 0.54 and 0.62 points, respectively. Although not anticipated, the gap between the effects of mixed and cross‐cutting networks is larger during the general election (0.22 points) than during the primaries (0.06 points). This suggests that, within social networks, the difference between exposure to some partisan opposition and exposure to exclusively partisan opposition is more pronounced during interparty competition."
"34","Finally, the results in Tables 2 and 3 provide mixed support for the pathway concerning political competition. During the primaries, state‐level partisan diversity has no reliable impact on ambivalence change. Consistent with expectations, however, state‐level partisan diversity increases ambivalence during the general election. During this period, a one‐unit increase in partisan diversity raises ambivalence by 1.28 points. Just as partisan strength mattered more during the general election than it did during the primaries, so too does a state's partisan diversity matter more once nominees are selected and interparty competition has begun.         "
"35","This study represents the first to attempt to analyze the dynamics of ambivalence over the course of a political campaign. Exploiting the analytical advantages of an individual‐level panel design, the study explores nature and sources of ambivalence change during the 2008 presidential campaign. The results offer several new insights to our understanding of ambivalence. First, the results reveal that candidate ambivalence is, for most citizens, a dynamic rather than a static experience. Fewer than one in five Americans exhibit the same degree of ambivalence at the end of a campaign as they did at its beginning. Moreover, the results indicate that ambivalence is more likely to decline than increase as the campaign unfolds. Second, the results show that the rate of ambivalence decay is not constant across time. Ambivalence declines at a steeper rater during the primaries than during the general election."
"36","The results of this study also demonstrate that ambivalence decay is not constant across individuals. From a theoretical standpoint, the results provide strong and consistent support for a motivational account of ambivalence change. Individuals who are motivated to engage in defensive reasoning, such as strong partisans and those who care about the election outcome, become progressively less ambivalent over time. This suggests that the information‐processing biases associated with defensive reasoning contribute to attitude polarization and ultimately lead people to reconcile any ambivalent feelings they may hold toward competing candidates."
"37","The findings provide strong but qualified support for an information‐based account of ambivalence change. Exposure to heterogeneous information was expected to increase ambivalence by working through one or more of three pathways. Although little evidence was found to support the existence of a direct or unconditional link between effortful processing and ambivalence change, the results did provide evidence of a conditional link. The negatively signed interaction between political knowledge and partisan strength, which was present during both phases of the campaign, suggests that effortful processing does heighten ambivalence, but only among dispassionate reasoners. Among partisan reasoners, effortful processing only serves to erode ambivalence by strengthening prior attitudes. Social network composition also proved to be an influential factor. During both the primaries and the general election, people who participated in mixed or cross‐cutting networks became more ambivalent over time than those in reinforcing networks. Only partial support was also found for the pathway involving political competition. State‐level partisan diversity led to heightened ambivalence during the general election phase but not during the primaries or across the entire election cycle as a whole."
"38","The results of this study carry important implications for our understanding of ambivalence and attitude change. First, the results revealed that partisan reasoning influences the magnitude of ambivalence decay and not just initial levels of ambivalence as previous studies have shown. This finding underscores the fact that motivation is an influential determinant not only of attitude formation, but also of attitude change. This implies that motivation matters both because it shapes initial attitudes and because it shapes subsequent information processing in such a way as to either facilitate or discourage attitude change."
"39","Additionally, the results suggest that the attitudinal polarization associated with partisan reasoning is potentially counterbalanced by exposure to heterogeneous information, particularly cross‐cutting information. Whether triggered by social network composition, state‐level partisan diversity, or effortful processing among dispassionate reasoners, exposure to heterogeneous information contributed to attitudinal moderation by increasing candidate ambivalence. This finding suggests that individuals are willing to moderate their attitudes toward candidates when exposed to alternative points of view. Simply put, it implies that individuals, although influenced by their prior attitude commitments, are not prisoners to them. The fact that heterogeneous information can loose people from their attitudinal moorings provides further evidence that campaigns do, in fact, matter. By providing opportunities for exposure to countervailing information, campaigns have the potential to facilitate persuasion by encouraging citizens to consider alternative viewpoints over the course of a campaign."
