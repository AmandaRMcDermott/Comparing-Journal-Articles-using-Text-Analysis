"1","John Rawls articulates a view he calls “justice as fairness.” He claims it provides the most appropriate vantage point from which to critically assess the institutional structure of advanced capitalist democracies. In making his argument, Rawls relies on a model called “the original position” to capture the interactions and deliberations among parties to a hypothetical social contract. This model, on his account, illuminates how and why those parties would select justice as fairness from among a set of plausible competitors."
"2","According to Rawls, individuals situated in the original position choose principles of justice from behind a “veil of ignorance.” This device precludes those individuals from knowing what position they, or those whom they represent, occupy in the set of contingent, hence morally arbitrary hierarchies and groupings that structure ongoing relations in any actual society. Hence, the veil precludes any particular occupant of the original position from anticipating how selection of any specific conception of justice would affect her or persons like her."
"3","Rawls argues that individuals choosing behind such a veil would agree to the two principles that constitute “justice as fairness.” He uses his model of the original position to argue that, regardless of contingent psychological characteristics, the different moral commitments and cultural attachments we endorse, or the relative bargaining power we might bring to bear on others, justice as fairness captures our basic reflective judgments about what justice requires."
"4","I am less concerned here with the particulars of Rawls's conception of justice than with how he makes his argument.4 Rawls (1993, 22–28, 43–46; 2001, 14–29, 80–94) calls the original position “a device of representation.” He claims this “model” allows him to reconstruct the conditions under which principles of justice would emerge from a hypothetical social contract among “free and equal moral persons” (Rawls 1993, 23).         "
"5","If we hope to see which among the various conceptions of justice on offer relevant agents would endorse absent the impact of morally arbitrary asymmetries of power and influence, we need to construct a “model” of interactions in which those agents are precluded from advancing particular sorts of arguments in support of the position they endorse (Rawls 1993, 23; 2001, 16). This, of course, is an exercise in simplification, of disregarding otherwise distracting aspects of the actual world and focusing on the specific matters that concern us. Hence, the parties occupying the original position, for instance, are not meant to represent actual persons in all their complexity, but are instead “merely the artificial creatures inhabiting our device of representation” (Rawls 1993, 28; 2001, 83). I return to these creatures and their characteristics below. Here it suffices to note that Rawls treats the original position instrumentally, as a tool of “public reflection and self‐clarification,” useful for working out “what we now think, once we are able to take a clear and uncluttered view of what justice requires” (Rawls 2001, 17; 1999, 402). In other words, he claims that his model affords conceptual clarity, thereby helping us to see more confidently and to communicate what we see to others with greater ease.         "
"6","For some indication that Rawls is not an idiosyncratic example who stands out from the broad tradition of political thought, consider Sheldon Wolin, who, despite being a vigorous critic of Rawls, shared certain of his preoccupations.5 In his influential history of political thought, Wolin claims that theorists offer us “pictures of political life in miniature, pictures in which what is extraneous to the theorist's purpose has been deleted” and that their work in that respect enhances our understanding of the political world, amplifying our capacity to see clearly extant political realities and to fruitfully imagine alternatives (Wolin 2004, 19). What is interesting here is that even as Wolin insists that the role of imagination in political thought “has involved far more than the construction of models,” it nevertheless still relies on just those processes of simplification involved in making models. Moreover, he mentions, if only in passing, “concepts like ‘the state of nature’ or ‘civil society’” and “cause” as among those theoretical notions that cannot be directly seen or observed and that therefore stand in need of representation (Wolin 2004, 13–14, 19).         "
"7","In justice as fairness, the original position plays a role analogous to that played by the state of nature in early social contract theories (Rawls 1993, 23; 2001, 16–17; 2007, 16–20). Rawls's approach, then, falls squarely within the tradition of political theory, at least as Wolin depicts it. He relies on the original position as a “device of representation” to depict an artificial world where the sorts of power that, in any actual world, derive from “contingencies and accidental influences from the past” are placed in abeyance so that we might examine and discuss the contours of just social and political arrangements. Any agreement the “artificial creatures” who inhabit his model enter into “must be entered into under the appropriate conditions.” Specifically, those conditions must treat parties as “free and equal” and must mitigate the possibility that “some persons [have] greater bargaining advantages than others” (Rawls 1993, 23). Hence, it is not enough for some agent to simply assert, based on the bargaining asymmetries she enjoys, that some outcome would benefit her (or those she represents) and expect, on that basis, others to accede to her proposal, let alone consider it justified.         "
"8","The apparent distance between Rawls and Wolin diminishes once we appreciate that they understand models and their uses somewhat differently. Then their underlying conceptions of how political theory operates are remarkably similar."
"9","Wolin aimed to defend political theory as a distinct “form” or “field of inquiry” within political science (1969; 2004, 4–7, 12–20). To that end, he sets it off from what he takes to be the important, albeit comparatively banal tasks of social scientific observation, description, generalization, and prediction. He tends to restrict the uses of models accordingly. In so doing, Wolin accedes to an intellectual gerrymander that was emerging when he first published Politics and Vision (1960) and that persists largely unquestioned through the present. This explains why Wolin is so eager to preempt the charge that political theorists are “attempting something similar to prediction,” albeit in a “less rigorous” way than other political scientists, insisting instead that political theory is an entirely distinct enterprise (Wolin 2004, 14). On his view, political theorists aim to help us “see” politics in a clearer manner not merely by depicting what actually is the case, but also by imagining what might possibly be the case. He insists, in other words, that political theorists operate as much in a subjunctive as an indicative mode, inhabiting the inevitable “gap between possibilities grasped through political imagination and the actualities of political existence” (Wolin 2004, 20). As a result, they are less concerned with offering “predictions” than with “posting warnings.” Moreover, political theorists often harness their analyses less to the pursuit of dispassionate knowledge than to exhortations aimed at identifying “the necessary or sufficient conditions for attaining ends which, for one reason or another, are deemed good or desirable” (Wolin 2004, 14).         "
"10","Rawls, writing from a different disciplinary vantage point, was largely uninterested in policing the boundaries between political theory and social science. If we set aside Wolin's narrowly disciplinary preoccupation, it is possible to see that his position converges closely to the view Rawls endorses. Wolin claims that political theorists endeavor “to compose a coherent network of concepts and abstractions in order to analyze what is going on in the contemporary world or in some selected part of the past” (Wolin 2004, 504).6 In that enterprise, they elaborate and use categories, concepts, and, despite Wolin's resistance, models in ways that hopefully promote coherent understanding.         "
"11","This is precisely how Rawls uses his model of the original position. He uses it as a device for probing and, ultimately, inducing coherence among the various components that compose his conception of justice (Rawls 2001, 24–26, 81; 1999, 306–8). By disregarding actual social, political, and economic contingencies as it does, Rawls claims that the original position affords a perspicuous perspective from which to understand how the agents who populate his model would approach the task of arriving at a conception of justice that might govern the basic institutional structure of society. By extension, his model allows us to imagine the possibility that, under appropriate conditions, we too would do the same.         "
"12","About that much Rawls seems quite clear: “The original position … enables us to establish greater coherence among all our judgments, and with this greater self‐understanding, we can attain wider agreement among one another” (1993, 26). This hardly amounts to a process of deriving predictions that might then be empirically tested. Instead, it is a modeling exercise in the service of various “roles” political theory might, on Rawls's view, play in our broader political culture. For present purposes, the most important of these consists in what he calls the “realistically utopian” task of “probing the limits of practical political possibility” (Rawls 2001, 1–4). And here, hopefully, you will discern an echo of Wolin's brief for political theory.         "
"13","With the original position, Rawls models a world from which the influences of power asymmetries have been eliminated. I return to his enterprise shortly. Here I explore the ways that Michel Foucault models a world in which power relations of an especially pernicious sort are ubiquitous and from which all traces of reciprocity have been eradicated. Whereas Rawls formulates the original position as a statement model, Foucault invokes the Panopticon as a model of the embodiment type.         "
"14","For Schelling, the thermostat central to home heating systems exemplifies an embodiment model. As he observes:            "
"15","The home thermostat . . . is the intelligence of the heating system. . . . The system, including the thermostat, is a model of many behavior systems . . . because it reproduces the essential features of those other behaviors in a transparent way…. What the system is a model of is various cyclical processes. These are processes that generate alternating ups and downs. They contain mechanisms that cause a rising variable to overshoot and then turn down and undershoot. What it overshoots and undershoots is some level that, in its own fashion, it is “seeking.” (Schelling 1978, 83, 84)               "
"16","Note several things. First, a thermostat‐controlled heating system is a physical object or set of objects rather than a set of sentences linked together in a theoretical argument. We treat it as a model insofar as it “embodies” a more general cyclical process. Second, as a model, the thermostat embodies a set of underlying mechanisms that account for how the cyclical patterns occur. This is a characteristic that embodiment and statement models share. Anticipating a return to Rawls, we will see that by bracketing power asymmetries, the model of the original position incorporates a particular mechanism to account for how the fictional parties who inhabit it might reason their ways to endorsing the principles of justice as fairness. We also will see how, in Foucault's analyses of power, the Panopticon serves as a model because it embodies and illuminates various disciplinary mechanisms that generate “docile bodies.” Finally, the thermostat model is useful because it helps us see. It renders cyclical processes, in Schelling's words, “transparent,” thereby allowing us to examine and discuss them and how they operate.         "
"17","An embodiment model such as the thermostat‐controlled heating system operates in much the same way as models of the statement variety. Both proceed by purposeful simplification, exaggerating certain features or aspects of interaction and disregarding others. Consider now how Schelling describes this process in the thermostat model: “Each of us in thinking about that system may have in mind some particular house, radiators and all; but the shape and location of the house, the room and window arrangements, the fuel in the furnace, and the climate in which the house is located don't really intrude” (1978, 87). Treating the thermostat as a model, in short, is an exercise in disregarding otherwise distracting aspects of the actual world so as to focus more clearly on the specific matters that concern us. If we are interested in cyclical behavior in general, we will remain unconcerned with whether, in any particular house, the thermostat is programmable; the furnace runs on gas, oil, electricity, or coal; heat is distributed from radiators or by “forced air”; and, in the former case, whether the radiators are steam or hot water. The model allows us to set aside the extraneous details of actually existing domiciles and envision how the mechanisms animating those cyclical processes of interest to us function."
"18","I am uninterested here in the details of Foucault's views on power. I instead focus as narrowly as is possible on showing how he uses the Panopticon as, in his own words, a “model.”"
"19","According to Foucault, disciplinary power is ubiquitous in the modern world. It operates in especially insidious ways, not by imposing external rules, constraints, sanctions, or punishments on individuals but, instead, through a variety of “mechanisms” that constitute individuals in the first place. Disciplinary practices and institutions are especially effective insofar as they create “docile bodies.” On his account: “A body is docile that may be subjected, used, transformed and improved” (Foucault 1979, 136).         "
"20","Foucault identifies and discusses at length four classes of mechanisms that operate to create such creatures. These mechanisms—spatial distribution, the coding of activities, temporal accumulation, and the composition of forces—largely function to disrupt and rearrange reciprocal, horizontal relations of communication and replace them with asymmetrical relations of classification, distribution, and surveillance.7"
"21","Having identified specific disciplinary mechanisms, Foucault does two things. He first depicts disciplinary power in abstract theoretical terms as “those systems of micro‐power that are essentially non egalitarian and asymmetrical,” explaining that they “have the precise role of introducing insuperable asymmetries and excluding reciprocities” (Foucault 1979, 222). Second, he turns to a model to illustrate those abstract claims in relatively concrete terms. He uses the Panopticon to model the precise ways asymmetrical, hierarchal, nonreciprocal disciplinary power operates. As embodied in the Panopticon, disciplinary mechanisms do not just render social relations less symmetrical and reciprocal but do so by disrupting the communicative relations that nourish social and political agency, replacing them with patterns of thoroughgoing objectification (Foucault 1979, 200). That abstract claim comes into focus largely because he represents it in relatively concrete terms in a model.         "
"22","At this point, it is clear why Foucault finds it useful to rely on a model, and on an embodiment type of model in particular. The range and number of practices and institutions that disciplinary mechanisms have infiltrated—not just prisons, but schools, the military, factories, hospitals, mental health clinics, etcetera—make it difficult to see how they operate to similar effect. Here Foucault invokes the Panopticon as a model that allows us to set particularities aside and appreciate how disciplinary mechanisms operate more generally. It represents “a generalizable model of functioning, a way of defining power relations in terms of the everyday life of men.” As such, it reveals “a mechanism of power reduced to its ideal form; its functioning, abstracted from any obstacle, resistance or friction” and “detached from any specific use” (Foucault 1979, 205). In other words, for Foucault, the Panopticon—a schematic, realized to varying degrees in actual architectural structures and spaces—serves as a model that enables us to recognize and speak about disciplinary relations “detached from any specific use” just as Schelling thinks that once we dispense with reference to any specific domicile, we can use the thermostat as a model for a large class of cyclical patterns.         "
"23","Like Rawls, Foucault approaches his model instrumentally. He treats the Panopticon as a tool, useful insofar as it allows us to discern the pervasive operation of disciplinary power in society. Specifically, he thinks this model illuminates the way particular insidious disciplinary mechanisms operate. Here the convergence with Schelling is remarkable. As Schelling notes, “Anything else we can find that is described by the model will behave as the model behaves.” He goes on to explain: “Whether or not that is any help depends, of course, on whether . . . the model gives us a head start in recognizing phenomena and the mechanisms that generate them and in knowing what to look for in the explanation of interesting phenomena” (Schelling 1978, 88–89). For both Schelling and Foucault, then, models are useful for conceptual purposes. They help us to identify and classify or categorize mechanisms and explore the way they operate across various settings (Schelling 1998).         "
"24","This can be illuminating. But it also is risky. Someone who grasps the logic of the Panopticon faces the temptation to understand contemporary society as a fully integrated “carceral system” or “disciplinary society.” A cursory reading might lead one to think Foucault encourages this inclination. This is a serious misinterpretation of his overall project."
"25","Foucault insisted that he had “never written anything but fictions” and that those fictions could contribute to generating “truth” (1980, 193). The fictional world Foucault models with the Panopticon roughly is the converse of the one Rawls represents in the original position. Rawls wants us to imagine a state of affairs in which social, political, and economic asymmetries are placed in abeyance; Foucault hopes to help us to envision a much darker scenario where disciplinary power operates to maximal effect. Unsurprisingly, he explicitly contrasts the ways disciplinary mechanisms permeate social and political institutions with the “contractual” relations that inform commonplace understandings of the rule of law (Foucault 1979, 222–23).         "
"26","Foucault uses the Panopticon to represent how, in various incarnations and contexts, and in different combinations, disciplinary mechanisms operate to induce docility via “observation” and “visibility.”8 But to what end does Foucault deploy his model? How does it fit into his larger theoretical enterprise? Insofar as his works are “fictions,” they surely are not a history in any standard sense. Indeed, they arguably are purposeful misrepresentations. While Foucault uses the Panopticon to depict a world that seems thoroughly permeated by disciplinary power, he knowingly presents that world as a counterfactual. From this perspective, in reading his analyses “we must seek not a meaning, but a precaution” (Foucault 1979, 139). He aims, in other words, less to establish that we now inhabit, or ever have, a fully functional disciplinary society, than to warn us to remain vigilant regarding the myriad ways disciplinary mechanisms infiltrate and redefine social and political relations.         "
"27","Foucault incorporates his model into a broader rhetorical strategy of exaggeration aimed at establishing a critical perspective from which to assess modern social and political arrangements, one that might provoke the sort of resistance that could, in practice, impede or perhaps actually foil intrusions of power. On this interpretation, his enterprise constitutes an attempt to pose problems in a manner “necessary to make the future formation of a ‘we’ possible” (Foucault 1984, 384–85). And in this respect, it underscores the crucial, practical task of fostering the sort of egalitarian, reciprocal relations of communication of which we remain capable and upon which we might draw to resist various encroachments of power."
"28","The Panopticon embodies in an especially compelling way the disciplinary mechanisms that, on Foucault's account, generate docile bodies.9 It allows us quite literally to see how partitioning, hierarchy, and asymmetry could operate to sustain particularly thoroughgoing practices of surveillance and observation. It leaves us better equipped to identify such mechanisms at work across diverse contexts.         "
"29","A predictable question arises at this juncture. How does Rawls's model of the original position operate to, in Schelling's words, “produce the phenomena in question”? A full answer to this question would require that I explicate much of Rawls's theory of justice. Here a brief sketch must suffice."
"30","Those who populate the original position are “artificial creatures.” Rawls depicts these individuals as “free and equal moral persons” (2001, 18–24). He also considers them to be both rational and reasonable (Rawls 2001, 6–7, 87–88). Each of these modifiers is important just because it allows him to ascribe to the persons inhabiting the original position characteristics and capacities relevant to the task they confront.         "
"31","The aim of such “artificial creatures,” when placed in the original position, is to agree on principles of justice that will govern the basic structure of their society. The problem is to convey (a) the enterprise in which the parties to the original position are engaged and (b) how Rawls models that enterprise. This is important because as a “device of representation,” Rawls intends the original position to enable us to see why his artificial creatures will agree to justice as fairness as the conception that should govern the basic structure of society (Rawls 1999, 308).         "
"32","Rawls is clear about both matters. The parties to the original position confront a “menu” of competing conceptions of justice (varieties of libertarianism or utilitarianism or egalitarian schemes, etc.) from which they select one to govern the basic structure of society. In this sense, the original position models a “selection device” that facilitates convergence on one among the various options on offer (Rawls 2001, 83). Of course, Rawls argues that parties to the original position would select his conception of justice as fairness from this menu. Here a particular feature of the model—the veil of ignorance—is crucial. It serves as a filter to constrain the sorts of argument that parties to the original position would advance or entertain. Behind the veil, parties know neither their own characteristics nor the position they occupy in society. Rawls claims this information deficit would induce them to adopt a more generalizing stance in considering principles of justice and, conversely, constrain them both from offering narrowly self‐serving reasons for the principles they prefer and from invoking resource asymmetries that might operate to their advantage.         "
"33","This, then, is how Rawls's model of the original position works. Agents characterized as free and equal moral persons, situated behind a veil of ignorance, will select justice as fairness as the conception of justice they agree should govern the basic institutional structure of society. We have artificial agents in artificial conditions, constrained by the workings of a particular mechanism generating a particular result. We have, in other words, a model. Rawls insists the aim of this model “is not to describe or explain how people behave in certain situations or how institutions actually work.” The original position is an imaginative exercise whose point is conceptual exploration. Rawls uses his model “as a natural and vivid way to convey the kind of reasoning the parties may engage in” as they select principles of justice to govern their ongoing interactions (Rawls 2001, 81).         "
"34","Rawls (2001, 86) concedes that while “the argument from the original position could be represented formally,” he does not adopt that approach.10 Indeed, given that his argument is not a deductive one, it is not quite clear what would be gained from formalizing it. It may nevertheless help to explore another example that illustrates why formalization can be useful.         "
"35","Consider Isaiah Berlin. Despite its title, what arguably is his most famous essay—“Two Concepts of Liberty”—is not in the first instance about liberty. Rather, it defends a pluralist position about values, commitments, or “ends.” As Berlin puts it, “not all good things are compatible,” at least without remainder (Berlin 1958, 167). He insists that “in ordinary experience . . . we are faced with choices between ends equally ultimate, and claims equally absolute, the realization of some of which must inevitably involve the sacrifice of others” (Berlin 1958, 168). And he defends what he calls “negative” liberty on the instrumental grounds that it is the best way to protect and promote pluralism. He therefore remains consistently pluralist insofar as he notes that liberty is not the only or even the most pressing goal or end that people pursue (Berlin 1958, 124–25).         "
"36","At the outset, Berlin differentiates properly “political” from merely “technical” questions. When they confront the former, relevant actors disagree not simply over the means of pursuing agreed‐upon ends, but upon the ends themselves. Berlin understands his enterprise as political insofar as he is concerned with our various basic “ends” and how they might best be protected. Hence, he warns us, rather unsubtly, that those who ignore the inevitable fact of pluralism are dangerous insofar as the chimera they seek is a “final solution” (Berlin 1958, 167). That said, two points are important. First, it is not at all clear that Berlin himself can sustain the stark distinction between “political” and “technical” questions. The latter impinge unavoidably in his elliptical but crucial discussion of the sorts of institutional protection (e.g., “rules” and even “rights, of participation”) upon which we must rely if we hope to effectively police the “frontiers of freedom” (Berlin 1958, 164–66). Second, Berlin's argument is political in the more pedestrian sense of taking aim at totalitarian regimes and their mid‐century apologists. It is not, however, especially easy to appreciate the force of his abstract argument. Here it is possible both to illustrate the value of formalization and underscore an important feature of using models more generally.11"
"37","At roughly the same time that Berlin advanced his case for pluralism, Kenneth Arrow formulated a defense of the institutions of “capitalist democracy” against the alternatives of traditional theocratic regimes or modern dictatorships (Arrow 1951, 1–2). In the process, Arrow offered an analysis of pluralism quite similar to Berlin's. But where the latter argues verbally for the crucial need to recognize “the fact that human goals are many . . . and in perpetual rivalry with one another” (Berlin 1958, 171), Arrow establishes in quite simple mathematical terms that no institutional procedure for aggregating individual values into social decisions can generate a consistent collective choice while simultaneously complying with several, quite minimal, normative conditions. Put otherwise, his “impossibility” result illustrates how any success at instantiating one small set of values requires that we sacrifice another equally important value.         "
"38","The affinity between Berlin and Arrow stands out once we recall that each of the “apparently reasonable conditions” Arrow (1951, 25, 30) insists we expect collective decision‐making procedures to meet is normative (Austen‐Smith and Banks 1999, 37; Myerson 2013; Riker 1982, 115–19). The standard presentation of his “impossibility theorem” establishes that any aggregation mechanism complies with the demand for “Collective Rationality,” “Pareto,” “Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives,” and “Universal Domain,” and violates “Non‐Dictatorship.”12 Arrow's proof, however, is not a purely analytical exercise. Arrow himself considers it a “great value” of abstract mathematical models that they are susceptible to “several different interpretations” (Arrow 1951, 87). One way we might interpret his proof, keeping its normative dimension in mind, is this: There is no aggregation mechanism that simultaneously generates consistent and stable outcomes via processes that are responsive, unbiased, and resistant to manipulation; that treats all views as equally admissible; and that also treats participants equally.         "
"39","Arrow places his mathematical apparatus in the service of a political argument and, thereby, occupies the terrain of political theory as Wolin maps it. First, he is concerned with fundamental institutions and he is exploring political possibilities. He thereby shifts focus from Berlin's preoccupation with the plurality of values that individuals hold, to the plurality of values built into and constitutive of our basic political economic institutions (Arrow 1951, 106). In the process, Arrow tacitly suggests that the task of political theorists is not so easily gerrymandered as either Wolin or Berlin claim. His proof illustrates how difficult it is to fully separate, as Wolin seeks to do, concern for the “meaning” of institutions and practices from an appreciation for how they “operate.” Likewise, he shows that we cannot differentiate what Berlin calls “political” questions from those he deems “technical” in any straightforward way. If we hope to safeguard our ultimate ends, we need to be attentive to the seemingly banal “technical” matter of how they might find institutional embodiment.         "
"40","Second, and tellingly, Arrow punctuates his original monograph with a warning. He observes that political agents often will treat the decision process itself as a value. Indeed, they might well prefer some institutional arrangement over available alternatives because they anticipate that, over time, it will work to their own distributional advantage. And he warns, in understated tones, that it would be quite naive for us to expect most political agents to set such preferences aside in the politics of institutional choice and design. On this interpretation, Arrow asks both that we follow his “proof” and grasp the danger against which he warns us (1951, 89–91)."
"41","Having said that, however, it is important not to lose sight of the point of this section. We started with Berlin's observation about “ordinary experience” with its plurality of values. The formal model that Arrow presents demonstrates in an especially forceful way the deep, persistent value conflict that Berlin locates at the center of his pluralist views. By taking a reasonably small set of normatively attractive commitments—basically consistency, responsiveness, equality, and transparency—and demonstrating how they cannot simultaneously be realized in any aggregation mechanism, Arrow establishes that not all good things go together in an effective way. More specifically, his proof establishes how various normative conditions (axioms) bind collective decision making. It thereby, quoting Schelling (once again), aims to capture the factors “producing the phenomena as an obvious consequence” where, in this case, the phenomena consist in ineliminable conflicts of basic values. His model helps us see that conflict in a forceful way and invites us to discuss how, if at all, we might mitigate the political predicament into which our simultaneous commitment to conflicting values draws us."
"42","Here we can return to the promissory note I offered above, namely, that Arrow helps us not just to appreciate the vicissitudes of plural values but to grasp an important feature of using models more generally. One virtue of Arrow's proof is that, due to its deductive character, it is irresistible. Note though that, as compared to Berlin, who issues an general warning about the conflicts between values (“human goals are many . . . and in perpetual rivalry with one another”), Arrow's model is particular. He illustrates the force of Berlin's abstract claim in a quite particular context, showing how a definite set of values unavoidably conflicts across common classes of collective decision‐making processes. Arrow's model is persuasive, on this view, not primarily because it is abstract, but because it is relatively concrete. And while I cannot defend the claim in detail here, there is good reason to think this is the case for models, whether or not they are mathematical, more generally. Models help us to define particular, relatively concrete conceptions (justice as fairness, for instance, or disciplinary power or value pluralism in capitalist democracies) of considerably more abstract, encompassing concepts (justice, power, value pluralism).13"
"43","To this point, I have established several things. The first is that influential political theorists—Rawls, Foucault, and, by implication, those influenced by them—rely on models to make their arguments. Second, those theorists use models in what, following Thomas Schelling, is an entirely familiar way. Third, in relying on models, Rawls and Foucault follow in the tradition of Western political thought, at least as Wolin depicts it. Finally, by establishing parallels between Berlin and Arrow, I suggest both that formalization sometimes can focus theoretical arguments in useful ways and that models clarify abstract arguments by rendering them more concrete."
"44","It might be tempting to take my case as instructive solely or primarily for political theorists. Political theorists surely should recognize the way models figure, or could be made to figure, in their arguments and how, by implication, their own work fits with the rest of the discipline. However, I also believe that my arguments have theoretical and practical implications for political scientists more generally. After all, I claimed at the outset that political theorists and political scientists rely on models for largely the same reasons. But I have argued throughout that political theorists rely on models for purposes of conceptual exploration.         "
"45","I must, as a first step, defend a crucial premise. Skeptical readers might question whether among political scientists the “standard rationale” for using models ultimately revolves around empirical prediction.14 If not, my argument would be significantly deflated. I cannot exhaustively defend my characterization of the standard rationale here. I nonetheless can offer some initial warrant.         "
"46","Austen‐Smith and Banks (1999, xi) claim they are “concerned with understanding political phenomena through the use of analytical models which, it is hoped, lend insight into why outcomes look the way they do and not some other way.” They differentiate the two most common “families of models” in the discipline—social choice and game theoretic—largely, but not entirely, in terms of predictive performance: “The former typically fail to predict any choice whereas the latter almost always do yield a prediction” (Austen‐Smith and Banks 1998, 259, 262). Hence, they cash out the aim of producing “understanding” and lending “insight” in terms of deriving predictions.         "
"47","Austen‐Smith and Banks do not insist that the predictions models generate (or fail to generate) be empirical. They are concerned with whether a class of models typically generates equilibrium outcomes and remain largely unconcerned with matters of testing. It therefore is important to appreciate how others amplify their concern. Morton (1999, 61), for instance, notoriously defines formal models in terms of the task of generating testable empirical predictions. And de Marchi suggests just how common Morton's view is: “Normally the ideal paper for the mathematical modeling crowd is a well specified game that reaches some equilibrium outcome, which is then instantiated and tested in an appropriate statistical model.” Moreover, he reassures us that he shares “the aspirations of those who wish to make political science an actual science, complete with predictions and policy advice about events in the real world” (de Marchi 2005, 2, 5). He uses such premises to advocate computational techniques because he believes they generate more robust empirical predictions than do game‐theoretic models (de Marchi 2005, 81–82).         "
"48","Proponents of formal models justify using them in terms of the accuracy of their empirical predictions. Critics unsurprisingly take them at their word. For instance, Mackie (2003) insists that central claims of positive political theory regarding electoral cycles are empirically unsupported. He dismisses the McKelvey‐Schofield models of global instability of voting as “empirically irrelevant” because “their predictions are falsified” (Mackie 2003, 174). By contrast, he concedes: “I cannot imagine doing without noncooperative game theory, which in the right hands yields rich insights into social life, along with testable, and supported, predictions” (Mackie 2003, 27). Thus, irrespective of his estimate of any particular modeling exercise, his criterion of assessment remains clear and constant. Other critics, if anything, demonstrate even less patience for formal modeling. King, Keohane, and Verba (1994) deem formal models of marginal value to the primary social scientific tasks of descriptive and causal inference. Results generated by formal models are hypotheses that like “other hypotheses do not constitute verified explanations without empirical evaluation of their predictions.” On that score, King, Keohane, and Verba are not sanguine. The stylized character of formal models makes it unlikely that they will “provide the correct empirical model for empirical testing” (King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 105–7). In terms of empirical performance, they find formal models wanting.         "
"49","These examples should suffice to warrant my depiction of “the standard rationale” for using formal models. Not every political scientist subscribes to this rationale. And those who endorse it likely do not do so exclusively or consistently. However, especially in general assessments of formal models in political science, advocates and critics of the enterprise alike rely on criteria of predictive capacity and empirical performance."
"50","The models I discuss in this article hardly conform to the standard rationale. They make no predictions. This cannot be because the original position or Panopticon are not formalized. Morton (1999, 61), for instance, characterizes “nonformal” models as concerned with empirical performance too. Neither can this be because they are “normative.” After all, Arrow's impossibility result, while formal, is thoroughly normative. Instead, it is because the capacity to generate predictions about the “real world” is a suspect criterion for assessing a model's usefulness.         "
"51","Consider an empirical observation about models. Highly influential formal models often make no prediction whatsoever. Two prominent examples are Akerlof's model of the “market for lemons” and Schelling's checkerboard model of residential segregation (Sugden 2000). More pertinently, however, neither Arrow's “impossibility theorem” nor the so‐called “chaos theorems” proven by McKelvey and Schofield that generalize Arrow's analysis make a prediction either. Undeterred, advocates of the standard rationale insist on treating the McKelvey‐Schofield results as “disequilibrium predictions” and, hence, as susceptible to empirical testing (Morton 1999, 102, 182–83, 208, 281; Mackie 2003). A sounder approach might recognize that because this work “does not predict anything at all,” attempts to subject it to empirical test are “moot” (Austen‐Smith and Banks 1998, 270–71; Cox and Shepsle 2007). This minimally would require political scientists to seriously qualify the standard rationale. It may suggest that they jettison it altogether.         "
"52","While political scientists tend to converge on a prediction and testing conception of how we use models, economists and philosophers articulate a wide array of alternatives. They recommend that we treat our models variously—as “analogies,” as “maps,” as “credible but counterfactual worlds,” as “metaphors,” often spun into “mathematical novelettes,” and, more generically, as “stories.”15 Within the latter category, there are disagreements regarding genre: Are models, for instance, best thought of as fables or as parables?16 This plethora of competing views underscores two points. First, once we look beyond the disciplinary confines of political science, no consensus exists regarding how to characterize models or their uses. That observation calls for examination and argument rather than confident reassertion of the standard rationale. Second, nearly all of the recommendations I identify trade in literary terminology. They thereby accentuate how models require interpretation (Rubinstein 1991).         "
"53","Political scientists may all find this merely a cacophonous distraction from the hard work of doing research. Yet the views I just sketched are not just talk. They raise a set of contested philosophical differences over how to interpret models and their uses. They invite us, too, to consider the consequences of these differences.         "
"54","The standard rationale tacitly draws on a syntactic interpretation of models as consisting in statements from which predictions can be deduced and tested to determine whether they are confirmed (Satz and Ferejohn 1994). This view confronts several difficulties. First, it trades on the highly contentious, if tacit, background assumption that the practice and progress of science—not just political science, but any science—are adequately assessed primarily, perhaps even solely, in terms of empirical performance.17 I set this matter aside because for present purposes it serves mainly to highlight the contrast between the syntactic view and its rivals. Second, many highly influential models simply make no predictions, let alone empirical predictions. As a theory of inquiry, the syntactic view fails to capture much of what goes on when we deploy a model. Defenders of the standard rationale should find this troubling. Morton (1999) seeks to mitigate this difficulty by differentiating sharply between pure and applied models. Yet, assuming she could persuasively sort the various models I mentioned above in such a way that they all fall into the category of pure theory, a difficulty remains. Even putatively “applied” models—including, ironically, the model of candidate entry in U.S. congressional elections (Banks and Kiewiet 1989) that Morton presents as an exemplar of the standard rationale—make no predictions either (Johnson 2010).18 It may be possible to resuscitate a syntactic interpretation of models and thereby lend credence to the standard rationale. But the difficulties involved in that task are considerable. They surely afford ample reason to explore rival interpretations of models and their uses.         "
"55","Some critics of the syntactic interpretation adopt a semantic interpretation of models as objects that, because they are not linguistic entities, can be neither true nor false. Clarke and Primo (2007, 2012) endorse this interpretation. They recommend that we think of models as maps, which, because they are partial, purpose relative, and neither true nor false, are best considered useful or not for some purpose or other (Clarke and Primo 2012, 63–72). Conversely, because a model is a quite particular sort of object, Clarke and Primo remain suspicious of talk about models as fictions precisely because fictions of whatever sort—analogies, metaphors, fables, parables, or stories—are linguistic entities.19 This suspicion reflects a constricted, if tacit, view of language that neglects the many ways we do things with words besides making declarative statements (e.g., assertions, propositions) about the world. It also creates a predicament for Clarke and Primo. They remain preoccupied with the ways formal models “represent a real world system” and so are left with the need to account for the way models, as maps, correspond to that real world. So while they endorse a pluralist view of how models factor in political inquiry, they retain a role—albeit a reduced one—for prediction (Clarke and Primo 2012, 83–93). Yet, if models are not just objects, but a specific form of object (a map), it is difficult to see how they can generate predictions at all. We use maps to navigate, but they are not sets of assertions that, like predictions, can be true or false.         "
"56","A third interpretation, the predicate view, sees models as linguistic entities—specifically, definitions or conceptions—that can be incorporated into theories (Hausman 1992b, 72–78). On this view, models are not themselves statements or assertions about the world and so are neither true nor false. Indeed: “It is a category mistake to ask whether they are true or attempt to test them” (Hausman 1992b, 78). Instead, the primary use of models is conceptual exploration. The predicate view affords a congenial interpretation of the models discussed in this article: the original position, the Panopticon, and Arrow's impossibility theorem. And insofar as such models operate in the subjunctive rather than indicative mode, it provides an opening for specifying the various literary characterizations of models I noted above. For if we take those claims seriously, a model is usefully seen as offering a “message,” “moral,” or “lesson,” oftentimes (this being one difference between, say, a parable and a fable) more than one. But how do they do so? There is no single answer to this question: Rawls sketches the basis for a “realistic utopia,” whereas Foucault and Arrow warn us of possibilities and impossibilities. For present purposes, however, we need not further pursue this matter.         "
"57","Many political scientists will worry that my arguments leave us mired in a merely philosophical disagreement over competing interpretations of models. This response would surprise game theorists like Rubinstein (1991, 909–10), who insists that formulating a proper interpretation “constitutes the very essence” of the modeling enterprise and that absent a plausible interpretation, the “application of game theory is utterly meaningless.” Indeed, the divergent interpretations of models I sketched are not merely philosophical. This is an instance where the philosophical commitments that underwrite social and political research, despite being contested and consequential, are unjustifiably neglected.         "
"58","Consider just two related consequences, one critical, the second constructive. The first is methodological. In recent decades, political scientists have embraced experimental methods with considerable enthusiasm. Advocates regularly defend experimental methods as (among other things) especially useful for testing predictions generated by formal models (Aldrich and Lupia 2011, 90; McDermott 2002, 31; Morton and Williams 2008, 349–50). Yet, those who subscribe to either a semantic or predicate interpretation of models will find such claims highly dubious. Not only is the proposal to test predictions of formal models with experimental data sharply contested (Hausman 2005; Rubinstein 2001), but advocates of that undertaking seemingly partake of the standard rationale and the syntactic interpretation of models on which it draws. They therefore confront a serious challenge. Before running tests on predictions, advocates of experimentation must provide some account of how formal models are the sorts of entity capable of generating empirical predictions in the first place. In the process, they must indicate how one might assess models—whether “pure” or “applied”—that make no predictions whatsoever. The standard rationale affords scant assistance with that task. Advocates of experimentation are under considerable pressure, in other words, to adopt some position in the interpretive debate I just sketched.         "
"59","Experimental methods simply afford an example that underscores a broader predicament that holds not just for those who advocate experimental tests of formal models but of anyone who endorses the impetus to test models built into the standard rationale. This raises the second, more constructive consequence I mentioned above. Part of what sustains the standard rationale is the lack of a well‐developed alternative. While I clearly cannot fully elaborate such an alternative interpretation of models and their uses here, it is possible to discern the coordinates around which to build it.         "
"60","Consider a surprising convergence of views regarding the most widely used family of models in political science: game theory. Elster both proclaims that the “invention of game theory may come to be seen as the most important single advance of the social sciences in the twentieth century” and insists that its value remains “mainly conceptual” (Elster 2007, 312). Similarly, Rubinstein insists that while game theory “concerns the real world,” it is a mistake to think we can use it to “predict behavior.” Instead, he presents game‐theoretic models as useful primarily in the “analysis of concepts used in social reasoning when dealing with situations of conflict” (Rubinstein 1991, 90).         "
"61","Hausman (who himself advocates a predicate interpretation of models) punctuates this convergence by extending it beyond the characterization of game theory to a discussion of economic models more generally. He insists that “the activities of formulating economic models and investigating their implications are a sort of conceptual exploration” and that it is a mistake to “regard these activities as offering empirical hypotheses and assess them in terms of some philosophical model of confirmation or falsification” (Hausman 1992a, 13). He also rightly insists that this “sort of conceptual exploration and development has been essential to the growth of all the sciences” (Hausman 1992a, 5).20"
"62","Perhaps Elster, Rubinstein, and Hausman only appear to converge. They might endorse divergent understandings of what counts as conceptual analysis and why we engage in it. I doubt that is so. For now, however, this apparent convergence—especially if informed by a predicate interpretation of models and their uses—affords substantial warrant for seeing the usefulness of game‐theoretic models as continuous with the sorts of models that Rawls uses to articulate his conception of justice and that Foucault uses to explore his conception of power. We use game‐theoretic models on this view to examine and talk about what “rational” might mean in different contexts of strategic interdependence. In so doing, we render the abstract concept of rationality relatively concrete in ways that allow us to define a useful conception of strategic rationality.         "
"63","While political scientists may consider this interpretation odd, it has a distinguished, if overlooked, pedigree (Morgenstern 1968; Schelling [1967] 1984, 215). We might engage in conceptual analysis for explanatory purposes—treating the beliefs and preferences of rational agents as one basic mechanism in an account of this or that event or pattern (Johnson 2010; Schelling 1978)—or we might do so for normative purposes: to justify or criticize some institution or reform proposal (Myerson 1999, 1068–70). In either case, we are discussing entities that, like justice or power, are at best difficult to observe and, arguably, strictly unobservable. In the case of game‐theoretic models, as with the original position or the Panopticon, we are concerned with examining and discussing conceptual matters: rationality or justice, or power. And, in each instance, we use a model to create a relatively concrete conception of a more abstract and encompassing concept. In that sense, by coming to appreciate how political theorists use models, not only are we able to grasp how problematic the standard rationale for why political scientists use models turns out to be, but we also are able to discern the basis for a more perspicuous alternative.
