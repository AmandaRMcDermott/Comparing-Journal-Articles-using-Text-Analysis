"1","My principal argument is that the diffusion of the merit principle is best understood by comparing the costs and benefits associated with establishing a local civil service commission against those associated with the status quo—patronage. Patronage generated net electoral benefits so long as politicians could provide government jobs with ease while also providing essential services to key constituencies. Indeed, throughout most of the nineteenth century, patronage was the preferred strategy for building coalitions, ensuring continued electoral support, and coordinating the activities of city hall (Henderson 1976; Mushkat 1971; Johnson and Libecap 1994). However, as this once profitable environment began to change, patronage imposed more costs on local politicians, thereby diminishing the net benefits of this form of political exchange.         "
"2","In particular, between 1880 and 1920, rapid industrialization created an enormous demand for labor. The tide of immigrants flooding into the U.S. and locating predominantly in the larger cities not only rose to fill that demand, but also added to the ethnic mix of these cities (Olzak 1987, 1304). What had been largely homogenous wards—that enabled the ward leader to collect information on the loyalty of every voter and maintain strategic control of the ballot boxes and polling places—became ethnically diverse (see Fox 1977; Zink 1930). City machines now faced a dilemma: should they include or exclude the new ethnic groups? Inclusion was certain to incur the wrath of existing constituencies while exclusion could prove costly in the long‐run because potential challengers could (and often did) incorporate the newcomers (see Teaford 1983). To make matters worse, the rising popularity of the strong‐mayor weak‐council form of government—which granted more appointive and veto powers to hitherto largely ceremonial office of the mayor—increased mayor‐council competition for control of local policy.         "
"3","Local conditions were exacerbated by developments at the national level. Of particular importance was the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883 because it greatly reduced the ability of local politicians to farm federal jobs for political gain even as the size of the traditional patronage constituency—foreign immigrants—was burgeoning. In addition, old‐style urban party organizations were in decline. As Skowronek (1982, 24–31) suggests, whereas in the nineteenth century the state and national parties had ensured organizational vitality via patronage while also delivering economic growth, this boom had come at the expense of administrative independence and efficiency (Mayhew 1986, 309). Finally, spoils became a source of embarrassment for national politicians (Johnson and Libecap 1994). The subsequent antiparty moves—direct primaries, more power and prominence to elected executives, nonpartisan elections in cities, the circumvention of elected officials via use of the initiative, the referendum and the recall, and the merit principle—gave birth to independent legislators (Mayhew 1986, 317). Absent the patronage‐based coordinating mechanisms available in the latter half of the nineteenth century, the increasingly independent legislator struggled to secure political office.         "
"4","In the altered political and socioeconomic environment, politicians could neither easily construct patronage‐based coalitions composed of diverse ethnic groups nor deliver services efficiently. Consequently, both the electoral fortunes of city councilors and their control over the policy outputs of local government became increasingly tenuous (see also Horn 1995; Johnson and Libecap 1994; Moe 1991; Reid and Kurth 1989).3 Local politicians responded to these changes by removing the majority of personnel decisions from the realm of politics and awarding control of hiring, firing, and promotion decisions to civil service commissions. The merit principle was a feasible alternative to patronage because not only did it enable politicians to better control the local bureaucracy and thereby enhance the likelihood of policy continuity, but it also allowed politicians’ to shirk patronage demands in a time when such demands were becoming increasingly difficult to fulfill (see also Hamilton 1910; Hoogenboom 1961).3"
"5","No doubt, politicians were also able to use the merit system to forestall the potential use of patronage by challengers. However, despite the prevalence of systemic conditions enhancing the net benefits of the merit system, local merit adoption did not automatically follow. Rather, and to a substantial extent, state and local political environments conditioned local politicians’ ability to shift out of patronage into merit. In the next section, I set forth the hypothesized influence of the particular state and local environments that I argue explain why local merit reform occurred when and where it did during the initial decades of the twentieth century."
"6","While ward politicians generally required the support of smaller, relatively homogenous constituencies, at‐large councilors had to appeal to a citywide electorate. Consequently, I expect the likelihood of a city establishing a civil service commission to increase as the proportion of councilors it elects at‐large increases. I test for this possibility by including a measure of the percent of city councilors elected at‐large (At‐Large) in the models I estimate.3 Further, larger cities impose significantly greater costs on at‐large politicians than do smaller cities because of the difference in the size of the constituency the politician must woo. Therefore, I expect councilors’ need for shifting the administrative machinery from patronage to merit will be relatively greater in larger cities and explore this possibility by measuring the population base of the city (City Size) and including an interaction term between the percent at‐large and city size (At‐Large *City Size).3"
"7","Additionally, not all city councilors are likely to feel the need to forestall future challengers for council seats while also securing current policy decisions. Specifically, city councilors facing frequent reelection (for example, every couple of years) face greater incentives to lock‐in current policies and tie the hands of fellow incumbents and potential challengers than councilors serving longer terms. I test for this possibility by including a dummy variable (Term Length) that assumes the value 1 if term lengths were at most two years and 0 if council term lengths exceeded three years.3"
"8","Nonpartisan elections, in turn, I expect to influence the transition to merit in two ways. First, councilors' ability to ignore party‐based demands of patronage should have been relatively greater under nonpartisan systems of election. Therefore, I hypothesize that Mayhew's (1986)“independent” legislator was better able to affect the shift to merit in jurisdictions where the shadow of party organizations no longer fell. Second, we now know that nonpartisan elections also diminish the ease with which voters can identify candidates and this is particularly true for the less educated voter—the traditional patronage constituency (Welch 1990). Thus, politicians should have been better able to shirk patronage demands and support merit systems when nonpartisan elections handcuffed patronage constituencies. I measure nonpartisanship via a dummy variable (Nonpartisan) that assumes the value of 1 if the city employs nonpartisan elections and 0 otherwise.3"
"9","Politicians' incentives are, however, insufficient to guarantee desired outcomes; success requires that the jurisdictional milieu present minimal obstacles to civil service reform. In the context of Progressive era reforms specifically, conventional wisdom suggests that while working‐class and immigrant groups’ dependence on patronage made them less likely to support the civil service idea, middle‐, upper‐class, and business interests were pro‐reform because they decried spoils politics (Gordon 1968; Tolbert and Zucker 1983; Wolfinger and Field 1966; Wiebe 1967; Hays 1974; Schultz and Maranto 1998). A large, potentially anti‐merit constituency is likely to provide most politicians, though skilled in the art of heresthetics and public entrepreneurship, with barriers that make it difficult to sell the pro‐merit agenda. All else being equal, then, we may expect the likelihood of merit reform to diminish with increasing proportions of the immigrant population. I attempt to capture this dynamic by including a measure of the proportion of total city population that is foreign‐born (Foreign‐Born). Because I expect increasing heterogeneity to positively influence merit adoptions, I also include a commonly employed measure of the effective number of ethnic groups in a jurisdiction (Effective Ethnic Heterogeneity).3"
"10","Local politicians’ abilities to manipulate the rhetoric of reform notwithstanding, the status quo (i.e., patronage) could also prevail if the larger, immediate political environment were inhospitable to reform. Indeed, given that cities are creatures of the state, the state political climate was particularly important for reform. In the context of merit systems, state governments could foster merit adoptions in two ways—(1) by establishing state‐level merit systems and blanketing cities as well, or (2) by providing cities with the latitude to alter governing arrangements through the grant of home rule charters. Because home rule charters allow cities to modify existing governing arrangements without first securing permissive state legislation, I expect the likelihood of merit adoption to be generally greater for home rule cities and measure this structural autonomy via a dummy variable (Home Rule) that assumes the value of 1 if the city enjoys home rule status and 0 otherwise.3 Certainly, state merit systems not blanketing cities might nevertheless induce local merit adoption either through emulation or by way of further reducing patronage resources. I allow for this possibility by including a dummy variable (Merit State) that equals 1 if the city is located in a state with a merit system for state‐level employees and 0 otherwise.         "
"11","Although politicians in both home rule and nonhome rule cities faced a common set of incentives for merit adoption, theoretically local politicians’ ability to act upon these incentives will be relatively greater under a home rule charter. In order to test whether home rule fundamentally altered the impacts of electoral conditions, I model the interactive effects between home rule status and the previously discussed incentive‐generating electoral structures—Home Rule*At‐Large, Home Rule*Nonpartisan, and Home Rule*Term Length.         "
"12","The explanatory power of regional location vis‐à‐vis municipal reformism is a long‐standing cause of disagreement among students of urban politics (see, for example, Lineberry and Fowler 1967; Wolfinger and Field 1966). Received wisdom suggests that in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction, patronage played a central and stabilizing role in party organizations in all regions of the nation. Subsequently, however, Shefter argues, “Party organizations constructed in the cities and states of the West were, as a result of this process of stabilization, weaker and more narrowly based than their counterparts in the Northeast” (1983, 459–60; see also Mayhew 1986). In contrast to this party‐based explanation, Bridges (1992) portrays regional influence as strategic location in the U.S. political economy; cities in some regions were latecomers to both economic development and the political community (Bridges 1992, 496). Given the centrality of this long‐standing dispute over regional variation in urban reformism, I include a set of dummy variables (each assuming a value of 1 if the city is located in that particular region and 0 otherwise) that demarcate the geographical location of the city—Northeast, South, and West.3"
"13","The crude hazard rate—a ratio of the number of cities adopting in a given year relative to all those at risk of adoption in that year—provides a reliable means of exploring whether the rate of merit adoptions changed over time. A cursory examination of the Nelson‐Aalen cumulative integrated hazard plot (see Figure 2) suggests that local adoption rates increased over time.3 What explains this acceleration in the pace of merit reform?Tolbert and Zucker (1983) offer a possible explanation; as time passed, the merit principle acquired (as is often wont to happen with policy and institutional innovations) legitimacy and eventually came to be institutionalized in American governance. This is a theoretically and intuitively appealing hypothesis. However, if what usually passes as legitimization is in effect the influence of time‐varying values of omitted explanatory variables, the legitimization effect evinced is unreliable. Assuming a correctly specified theoretical model, on the other hand, a statistically significant coefficient on the variable measuring passage of time will support the legitimization argument. Accordingly, I model the possibility of an institutionalization effect by means of an appropriate shape parameter.3"

"15","To summarize, city politicians are key actors in the tableau of twentieth‐century municipal civil service reform. Seeking to better manage the public bureaucracy while simultaneously minimizing the costs of winning and retaining office in the face of mounting heterogeneity of the polity and extra‐jurisdictional pressures that stiffened political competition in the cities of the nation, local politicians preferred to shift from patronage to merit. Because cities are legal creatures of the state, city politicians had greater room to maneuver when their state legislatures granted them the ability to reshape the local government machinery. The structural dimensions of the urban landscape—at‐large, nonpartisan elections, briefer term lengths, and changing demographics of the local polity—also induced a preference shift in favor of merit reform."
"16","To empirically test the central premise I advance here—that the purposive behavior of local politicians drove local adoption of municipal civil service commissions—I rely on event history analysis. Specifically, I model the influence of previously discussed city‐ and state‐specific political and demographic environments on the duration of time that elapses before cities adopt merit systems. Factors I hypothesize positively (negatively) influence adoption I expect to shorten (lengthen) the amount of time that lapses before a city adopts a merit system."
"17","I begin by identifying civil service adoptions occurring in the 1883–1940 period in a universe of 309 cities located in forty‐two states.3 While ideally one would like to initiate the analysis in the earliest year in which a city could have established a merit system (i.e., in 1883), data limitations restrict the survival analysis to adoptions occurring in the 1900–1940 period.3 Because this restriction creates a sample selection problem, I employ the conditional likelihood approach wherein all information available on a city, especially the selection mechanism (i.e., that the city is at risk and under analysis only because it did not adopt the merit system in the pre‐1900 period), is utilized to recover unbiased estimates (see Vermunt 1997; Guo 1993).3"
"18","Following Tolbert and Zucker (1983, 27–28), and because my explanatory focus is on voluntary decisions to adopt the merit principle, I exclude from analysis cities where adoption was involuntary either because the state constitution or state statute(s) required the cities to implement the merit system. Absent this exclusion, it is difficult to argue that local preferences are driving merit adoption in the latter case.3 This exclusion criterion further reduces the effective sample to 252 cities of which 179 established civil service commissions sometime between 1900 and 1940, while 73 did not adopt merit systems during this period.         "
"19","For each city, I identify the year of establishment of a civil service commission based on the 1940 report of the Civil Service Assembly of the United States and Canada. The Assembly recognizes a jurisdiction as having a civil service commission if formal legal provisions established the commission as the central personnel agency and if it administered a merit system of appointments based upon competitive examinations (see Civil Service Assembly 1940, 6–7). The dependent variable is the duration of time—measured in calendar years—since a city first becomes at risk of adoption (i.e., 1883) and the actual year of adoption. Table 1 lists summary statistics for survival times and all covariates for median survival times.         "
"20","Although by no means the only alternative, a Gompertz model is a convenient framework for analyzing the historical trend to merit reform evinced in Figure 2; the Weibull and the Exponential distributions are feasible alternatives. Accordingly, in Table 2, I report the estimates (and robust standard errors) from each distribution, respectively. However, because the Akaike Information Criterion (AICGompertz= 274.81; AICWeibull= 276.70; AICExponential= 295.11) and the Cox‐Snell residual plots of each distribution suggest a marginally better fit of the Gompertz, I limit my discussion of the results to the Gompertz estimates.3"
"21","The Gompertz specification models the transition rate to merit between 1900 and 1940 as an exponential function of covariates and time, i.e., r(t) = exp(Xβ+γt). These estimates are interpretable as the fractional change in the rate of merit adoptions for an infinitesimal change in the covariate. Overall, the results attest to the influence of state‐ and city‐specific political and demographic environs on municipal decisions to establish a civil service commission. Specifically, I find the proportion of at‐large councilors in the city, term length, home rule authority, the existence of a merit system for state employees per se, the relative size of the foreign‐born white population, city size, regional location, and the passage of historical time significantly influence merit adoptions.         "
"22","While I hypothesized that at‐large election systems would, in conjunction with city size, increase the likelihood of reform because at‐large politicians in larger cities faced significantly greater electoral and governance costs than their colleagues in smaller cities, City Size *At‐Large fails to achieve statistical significance. Nevertheless, both city size and at‐large election systems exert strong direct effects on merit adoption. Specifically, relative to a city electing all councilors from individual districts, the rate of adoptions is 22 percent higher for a city electing one‐third of its councilors at‐large and 85 percent higher for a city electing all councilors at‐large.3 In contrast to ward politicians, at‐large councilors faced stiffer electoral costs. Virtually without exception wards tended to be homogenous and therefore the costs of identifying and responding to the median voter were relatively minimal for ward councilors as compared to at‐large politicians. Consequently, at‐large politicians faced relatively greater incentives to replace spoils politics with the merit system. To be sure, a strategic desire for merit rather than patronage does not imply that by doing so city politicians necessarily excised graft from public office. Because merit requirements applied only to public employment decisions, the awarding of city franchises and contracts in exchange for electoral support remained largely untouched; to exclude old‐style “campaign contributions” would have served only to increase electoral costs.         "
"23","City size, in turn, exerts a direct effect on merit adoptions. The Gompertz estimate on city size (see Table 2) suggests that the rate of adoption increases by about 0.26 percent per 1,000‐increase in city size.3 All else being equal, politicians in larger cities must go to greater lengths to garner electoral support (see Welch and Bledsoe 1988). Insofar as patronage was the political currency in vogue at the turn of the century, as a city's population base increased, local politicians should have been unable to dispense patronage with as much ease as might have been possible in the past. With more hands clamoring for handouts but facing rapidly dwindling patronage resources, politicians could not easily sustain stable coalitions. Indeed, Erie (1988) argues that the machines destabilized in part because the melting pots that were the largest cities in the nation became difficult to govern via old‐style politics.         "
"24","While the coefficient on effective ethnic heterogeneity does not approach statistical significance, increases in the proportion of foreign‐born among the city's residents diminish the transition rate to merit.3 In particular, the transition rate is lower by almost 70 percent for a city with one‐half of its residents foreign‐born than for a city with no foreign‐born. Thus, it appears that pro‐merit incentives notwithstanding, politicians embedded in cities with relatively greater proportions of traditional patronage constituencies could not shirk patronage demands as easily as could councilors in cities with fewer immigrants. This is particularly interesting given that I also expected cities employing nonpartisan systems of representation to reflect higher transition rates to merit because nonpartisan elections handicap the low socioeconomic status vote (i.e., traditional patronage constituencies). The coefficient on the nonpartisan variable, however, fails to achieve statistical significance.3 Term length, though, is statistically significant; the transition rate of cities electing their councilors to two‐year terms is some 65 percent higher than for cities electing councilors to longer terms.3"
"25","Further, I hypothesized that home rule cities might reflect higher adoption rates because in general home rule permitted cities to modify governing arrangements without first securing permissive state legislation. I also expected the influence of general electoral systems to differ across home rule and non‐home rule cities. That the playing field is anything but level for cities with and without home rule is evident from the significance and magnitude of the coefficient on Home Rule; all else being equal, merit adoption rates are 300 percent higher for home rule cities. However, home rule does not appear to have filtered the incentives and opportunities afforded under varying electoral arrangements; the coefficients on the three interaction variables—Home Rule *At‐Large; Home Rule *Nonpartisan; and Home Rule *Term Length—fail to achieve conventional levels of statistical significance.         "
"26","Implementation of the merit principle in state government significantly increased (albeit to a lesser degree than did home rule) the likelihood of municipal adoptions. Specifically, the transition rate for cities located in states with merit systems is 86 percent higher than for cities located in non‐merit states. States establishing a merit system for state employees per se appear to have induced local adoptions either by further limiting the availability of patronage resources or by spawning emulation. Unfortunately, data limitations do not allow me to distinguish between these effects. That emulation, albeit over time rather than vertical (i.e., state to local) diffusion, nevertheless influenced merit adoptions to some degree is evident from the statistically significant shape parameter measuring the passage of historical time. In particular, the increase in the transition rates of two otherwise identical cities but for a separation in calendar time—say, one in 1910 and the other in 1935—is almost 524 percent."
"27","Certainly, while this might reflect Tolbert and Zucker's (1983) claim of an institutionalization effect, it is possible that the shape parameter is picking up the effects of the Great Depression and the politics underpinning FDR's New Deal Spending (see Erie 1988). Specifically, the crash of 1927 severely handicapped subnational governments and the subsequently rising unemployment coupled with declining public expenditure resources could only have heightened local politicians’ pro‐merit incentives. In addition, Roosevelt's politically motivated targeting of particular cities for Works Progress Administration and other work‐relief funds worsened the situation by reducing the availability of funds that the average city may otherwise have received (see Wright 1974). Unfortunately, lack of reliable data on city‐specific WPA funds prevents me from fully distinguishing between legitimization and post‐1927 fiscal effects.         "
"28","Finally, while Southern cities reflect a lower transition rate to merit—transition rates for Southern cities exceed those of Midwestern cities by about 53 percent—no regional influences are apparent for the Northeast and the West."
"29","This study paints a portrait of municipal civil service reform in which councilors occupy center stage (Reid and Kurth 1988, 1989; Frant 1993; Horn 1995). I find evidence supporting my argument that the decision to adopt civil service commissions was the strategic response of local politicians to a changing political climate. That is, while patronage politics could destabilize politics and policy processes, insofar as the merit system minimized frequent turnover among municipal employees, a more stable output of public services would result (see also Johnson and Libecap 1994). More important, though, may have been the electoral benefits politicians stood to derive from placing municipal employees under the merit system: No longer could incumbents or challengers rely on the promise of patronage to govern the city. Indeed, it is because merit systems could formally equilibrate local politics that city politicians sought to implement them.3"
"30","To be sure, the perspective offered in this article also blends well with the contemporary understanding of the decline of machine politics. Boulay and DiGaetano (1985) and Lotchin (1981), for example, document the demise of machine politics in the 1930s and pin responsibility for this demise on the shoulders of an urban economic landscape in flux. Astute, purposive politicians constructed machines because they recognized the benefits of hierarchically structured organizations oiled by purposive and solidary benefits (see Shefter 1978). The costs of sustaining these organizations were lower when city populations were relatively smaller and when local councilors were elected from wards. But absent one or both of these factors, the costs of fashioning stable coalitions based on patronage relations increased, predisposing local councilors toward the merit principle.         "
"31","While my analysis does reveal some support for Tolbert and Zucker's (1983) legitimization thesis, my findings contradict their more principal conclusion that while “[socioeconomic] variables are important determinants of the adoption of an innovation early in the process of its diffusion, they become relatively poorer predictors as the reform measure becomes more institutionalized. Over time, adoption is expected to become independent of internal … [and] cities will begin to adopt is as a ‘social fact,’ regardless of any particular city characteristics” (Tolbert and Zucker 1983, 30). In stark contrast to this claim, my analyses demonstrate that in addition to state political climates, a specific local political calculus buttressed local merit adoptions as much in the early 1900s as in the late 1930s. Jurisdictions do not adopt reforms primarily because they are in vogue at the time, but instead because of the relative costs and benefits associated with both reform and the status quo. Furthermore, since local elites—especially those who serve in government—occupy a privileged position vis‐à‐vis agenda‐setting and decision‐making, reform is relatively easily affected when local elites both stand to benefit from the change and are in a position to engineer change from the status quo.         "
"32","Of course, this does not necessarily imply that the various reform associations active in national, state, and local politics exerted no influence whatsoever on the rise and spread of municipal merit systems. The reformers influenced merit reform but via a circuitous (and altogether unintentional) route—by helping establish at‐large electoral systems, home rule, and other structural reforms that eventually combined with an altering urban landscape to disadvantage old‐style patronage‐based politics. However, the ability of Progressive era reformers to directly effect merit reform over the period under review here has long been overstated and, it now appears, without good cause."
"33","First, the Progressive reformist sentiment that surrounded civil service per se collapsed after 1914 and thus could not explain post‐1914 merit activity in municipal America. Second, while the reformers were most powerful when they could influence the vote, cities obtained merit reforms via statutes and ordinances as well, not by charter revisions alone. Absent the power of the vote, citizens’ ability to effect change is limited. Ironically, the very conditions that forced local politicians to adapt to the changing urban political economy—at‐large electoral systems and home rule—were also those that minimized the power of reform coalitions. Whereas district elections permitted interest groups to target their ward councilor, at‐large elections diluted the ability of minority groups to influence local politics and policy. Home rule eliminated the otherwise pivotal role local delegations in the statehouse may have essayed if pressured by reformers to pass legislation requiring the city adopt a merit system."
"34","To sum up, by altering the ground rules of local and state‐local politics, the structural reform movement and the home rule movement contributed most to urban merit reform by inducing preference shifts amongst the ranks of local politicians. Specifically, politicians who otherwise may have thrived on spoils politics were quick to appreciate the benefits of the merit system when facing dwindling patronage resources, increasing heterogeneity of the polity, and frequent at‐large elections. Reform is politics, and hence it is understandable that where and when governmental reform occurs is largely due to the potential payoffs from reform that critical actors stand to accrue, and the ability of these actors to seize opportunities as they arise."
