"1","One traditional story of the Great Compromise involves some kind of deliberative3 persuasion leading enough delegates to moderate their positions to cause the shift between June 11 and July 16. Much previous analysis explicitly (or, more often, implicitly) takes the view that deliberation was the hallmark of the convention: “[W]ith occasional exceptions, the framers of the Constitution strove for accommodation and compromise” (Nelson 1987, 465). The record of the convention certainly gives many examples of this spirit of compromise. On July 2, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney said he “did not entirely approve” the motion to accept equal state representation in the upper chamber, but that “some compromise seemed to be necessary” (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 511). Others, such as George Mason, Hugh Williamson, and Elbridge Gerry, specifically urged a compromise in the spirit of conciliation.         "
"2","The Grand Committee ultimately produced a complete report that proposed proportional representation in the lower chamber and equal state representation in the upper chamber (the report also fixed representation totals in the lower chamber). On the debate before the key roll‐call vote was taken, Madison simply writes, “On the question for agreeing to the whole {Report as amended &} including the equality of votes in the 2d. branch {it passed in the Affirmative}” (Farrand 1966, Vol. II, 15). He gives no flavor of debate indicating either that none occurred on that morning (possible, but unlikely since there were only four roll‐call votes taken: there was plenty of time) or that Madison chose not to record that debate. After listing the delegation positions, Madison goes on to repeat the compromise language, record some limited discussion of the language, and report the subsequent roll calls calling for an adjournment. Despite this comparative silence, Madison does record that “on the morning following … a number of members from the larger States … met for the purpose of consulting on the proper steps to be taken in consequence of the vote in favor of an equal Representation in the 2d. branch” (Farrand 1966, Vol. II, 20). His notes make clear that the delegates from the large states were quite divided about how to proceed; some favored standing firm for proportional representation, while others favored conceding the point and moving on to other matters. Whether or not the debate was settled in the minds of the participants at that caucus, the issue of representation is never revisited: this vote seals the outcome.         "
"3","With so little to go on, historians have necessarily been forced into broad interpretations of these events that rely on the previous weeks of debate. Jack Rakove describes the discussion of representation as “everything from heavy‐handed threats and poker‐faced bluffs to heartfelt pleas for accommodation, from candid avowals of interest to abstract appeals for justice” (Rakove 1987). A careful reader can discern the general positions of the state delegations, but there is little to clarify the root causes of the Great Compromise.         "
"4","In this void, scholars have tried to faithfully represent the complexity of the motivations and reasons behind the compromise. In this void, scholars have tried to faithfully represent the complexity of the motivations and reasons behind the compromise as deliberation leading to a conciliatory moderation of positions. Frank Garver called the convention “a deliberative assembly,” saying that"
"5","                        "
"6","Past experience, as well as political theory, was tested by reason and judgment. The very give and take of debate, tempered by a spirit of open‐mindedness, brought about many changes of view. Conciliation and compromise led to agreement. (Garver 1944, 424)               "
"7","Garver's view of the importance of open‐mindedness or conciliation has been endorsed, on some level, in a host of subsequent publications regardless of whether they praise or criticize the convention (Bestor 1989; Ellenbogen 1996; Hutson 1987; Jillson and Anderson 1978; Keller 1993; Knupfer 1991; Ohline 1971; Rakove 1996).         "
"8","Gordon Wood, in his masterpiece, The Creation of the American Republic, 1776–1787, portrayed the convention as consciously choosing a bicameralism to restrain the large state from taking control of the government, ”[b]y this mixture of states and people … the Convention had actually created a new kind of balanced government” (Wood 1969, 558). Passages such as this one reflect the idea that the convention—and, by extension, these critical votes—collectively decided on a compromise. While Wood (and the others who employ similar language) certainly does not mean to imply any kind of unanimity, this deliberative account of moderation implies that minds were changed when at least some convention delegates came to believe that some form of compromise was the most just outcome. Matson and Onuf reflect this judgment when they write, “But most of the framers came to recognize the legitimacy of state claims of constitutional protection—and the undesirability of giving the central government unlimited power… . Debate … made the delegates … willing to incorporate genuinely federal elements in their design” (Matson and Onuf 1990, 102).         "
"9","This idea—that some delegations were convinced of the rightness of the small‐state position—offers up a possible hypothesis. If individual minds were changed on the representation question, state delegation positions should show some evidence of a shift in the appropriate direction on that dimension of the debate. If we can find no such evidence of delegation movement, then the moderation hypothesis remains suspect.4Table 1 leaves little room for the possibility of moderation leading to conversion: with only Massachusetts and North Carolina switching actual positions, deliberation explanations must focus on those two states. Because we cannot consistently access individual votes, it is difficult to confidently point to individuals who could have caused the shift in votes. But we can determine whether state delegations shift positions within the convention by looking for roll‐call evidence that either North Carolina or Massachusetts moderated positions as the convention progressed.         "
"10","The other possibility to consider is that the votes on June 11 and July 16 were not really the same, because the intervening agenda structure had altered the content of the convention proposals and agreements. In essence, North Carolina and Massachusetts may have not really “changed” at all. Despite their obvious similarities with respect to proportional representation (the key issue), the June 11 and July 16 votes are not exactly the same because they came at different points in the agenda. The delegations may have expressed similar preferences over proposals that had slightly different content."
"11","One interpretation of the July 16 vote could essentially be a legislative bargain that involved a side‐payment. Various scholars have put forth particular bargains that could certainly have influenced the voting. Forrest McDonald hypothesizes that a secret bargain was concluded on June 30 (McDonald 1965). In his view, Roger Sherman (Connecticut) and John Rutledge (South Carolina) agreed to push through the “Great Compromise” along with other matters pertaining to slavery. Staughton Lynd (1966) argues that the secret bargain was over slavery and the Northwest Ordinance, with an agreement to permit the unfettered admission of new states (under the bill being then considered in New York by the Confederation Congress) and also support the three‐fifths clause.         "
"12","But other scholars find the evidence for these bargains wanting. James H. Hutson concluded about these specific theories and the general attempt to interpret motives for the compromises that “neither traditional political historians nor quantifiers appear, in recent publications, to be able to present a clear explanation of what was happening behind the rhetoric on the convention floor” (1987, 419). We must be somewhat reluctant to accept these claims without a clear quid pro quo, something not provided by either McDonald or Lynd. In the absence of that record we think it is more fruitful to investigate the roll‐call record than to accept the absence of evidence as testimony to the quality of the secrecy surrounding the possibility of side‐payments.         "
"13","No model could hope to clarify everything going on behind the rhetoric, but a careful model can help illuminate which claims are true and which claims are false. We take seriously the notion that something beyond the speeches was required to shift the votes of Massachusetts and North Carolina. When the small states began caucusing to produce the New Jersey plan in order to split the large‐state coalition, their “strategy was directed … toward more calculated ends than reasoned persuasion” (Rakove 1996, 68). Under this view, their aim was to find some sort of proposal that would simply be enough to draw away a large state delegation. This could be accomplished in one of two ways: either by finding a cross‐cutting dimension that would draw a few votes, or by revising the proposals on the proportional representation dimension in such a way as to increase the probability of attracting a vote from the large‐state coalition.         "
"14","The classic version of an agenda effect is the cross‐cutting dimension that forces voters into thinking about the problem in two dimensions. For instance, when a U.S. senator wanted to block the Defense Department from transporting lethal nerve gas within his home state, he argued that the issue was really about the constitutional power of the U.S. Senate to oversee foreign policy (Riker 1986, see 106–13). Another possible example is the way political entrepreneurs used the slavery issue to split the reigning regional coalition of the Atlantic states, the Deep South, and the northwestern territories. Slavery created a moral dilemma that realigned the politics along a north/south dimension (Riker 1982, see 214–32). For our purposes, the question becomes a fairly simple one: is there evidence that a cross‐cutting dimension drew the votes of the Massachusetts and North Carolina delegations away from the large‐state coalition? If we can find evidence of that possibility, it would support the idea of an agenda effect at the root of the Great Compromise. But it is not the only avenue for the agenda to affect the outcome.         "
"15","The small states could have simply granted some point on the proportional representation dimension in order to attract a vote or two. Several possibilities present themselves. Part of the explicit compromise was the question of origination of money bills. The small states could have argued that the concession that the Senate would not be able to originate money bills was a serious enough concession to cause shifts in the votes of Massachusetts and North Carolina. This gets the verbal support of at least one crucial delegate: Elbridge Gerry, who later said, “[The Compromise] never would have been agreed to by the Committee, or by myself, as a member of it, without the provision” (Farrand 1966, see 265). If we can find evidence in the model that North Carolina or Massachusetts would have been attracted by the proposal on money bills, this possibility gains some significant support.         "
"16","Another major possibility is slavery. Farrand dismisses this possibility, referring to the three‐fifths rule as a “mere incident” to the Great Compromise (1913, 108). Historical treatments of the Constitution have largely followed his pattern of treating the compromises either as separate events largely unconnected to one another (Foner and Garraty 1991; Johnson 1997) or when they do note that the issues are connected because both are about representation, they do not explicitly make the inference that slavery was vital for the roll‐call passage of the “great compromise” (Bowen 1966; Collier and Collier 1986; McDonald 1958; Peters 1987; Wood 1969). Jack Rakove has suggested that slavery was vital at the convention, but even he describes the compromises as “[t]wo divisions, two sets of compromises: these were what drove the politics of constitution‐making at Philadelphia. There the ephemeral struggles between small and large states and the more durable and evil‐fated rift between free and slave states defined the competing and conflicting interests that the framers had to resolve” (1996, 92). Ironically, Rakove in that same volume describes some of the ways in which the two compromises were linked by arguing that as the delegates considered questions of representation and slavery, “the more weight they gave to considerations of regional security,” such as the need to perpetuate slavery for the Southern states (1996, 75). The question will be finding evidence within the roll calls that either Massachusetts or (more likely) North Carolina was influenced by its delegation's desire to perpetuate slavery.         "
"17","The records of the convention are sparse enough that they permit many possible interpretations.5 Many traditional accounts emphasize a deliberation and moderation, but there is also a clear tradition suggesting the possibly vital role of the agenda. It is to the tools of roll‐call analysis—and the light they can shed on this question—that we now turn.         "
"18","Social scientists have already begun using the tools of roll‐call analysis to analyze the convention. Their efforts have clarified much of the debate. But we believe that tackling the specific question of the causes behind the “Great Compromise” implies a new model that permits analysts to estimate not just voting coalitions or general patterns, but also the specific locations of state delegations and proposals offered at the convention."
"19","Four predecessors have tried to comprehensively model the voting patterns and coalitions at the federal convention of 1787: Calvin Jillson (2002); Adam Slez and John Levi Martin (2007); Keith Dougherty and Jac Heckelman (2006); and John Londregan (1999a, 1999b). Our work is very much in the spirit of theirs, but it differs in important respects.            "
"20","Jillson (2002) offered a factor analytic model that identified the voting coalitions—not a scaling model of votes—for various periods of the convention. Instead of modeling votes, he fits a series of one‐dimensional factor analyses—each one covering exactly 100 votes, but each solution shifted by 20 votes from its closest neighbor (see pp. 26–34 for a specific discussion of his methods). Instead of the 100 votes as the observed indicators and the states defining the observations, the states are the items and the votes define the observations (defining a “Q‐factor” analysis). For each segment of votes, Jillson estimates a two‐dimensional exploratory factor analysis on the pairwise correlation matrix of the states votes (excluding divided votes and absences). States loading high on one “dimension” constitute a coalition, with the states that load on the other dimension the opposing coalition.            "
"21","Jillson's approach is a very dynamic one, analogous to a series of snapshots of the convention debate. Jillson examines the structure of the successive factor analyses, identifying when the states load on different dimensions, forming new coalitions. Jillson concludes that five periods could describe the convention, based on changes on which states load on the factors. Based on the content of the votes for these periods, he identifies the predominant issues as an early debate over an extended versus a small republic; the June and July debate over control of the legislature; an August debate over the scope of the national government; an August and September debate over state integrity and federalism; and, in the final weeks of the convention, a debate over the control of the executive and the Senate."
"22","Mindful of the strengths of Jillson's dynamic approach, we believe it is fundamentally limited in two ways. First, because Jillson never models votes and only identifies coalitions, he is not able to analyze any specific roll call, merely collections of them. Second, because Jillson focuses on state coalitions that change over time, his identification of the dimensions with time periods may be too restrictive an assumption. We were strongly guided by Jillson's careful work on the coalitions in June and July that fought over control of the legislature. And, because our maps of the convention largely track his, we are confident that our model is picking up an important cleavage in the debate, but the added power in our model of analyzing specific roll‐call votes and including estimates of the proposal positions allows us to go much further.            "
"23","Slez and Martin's (2007) work is the closest to Jillson's. They use multidimensional scaling to produce pictures of five periods of the convention that are very similar in content and spirit to the images offered by Jillson (see 2002, 50–62) for their discussion of periods). Their approach is to estimate the Euclidean distance between the states' vectors of votes in each period, specifying two dimensions. They apply both metric and nonmetric scaling to their five periods, arguing that the meaning of a roll‐call vote is contingent on its placement in time. We agree with their emphasis on time, although we would refer to “time” as the unfolding agenda. Their interpretations across periods also rely on the rotation of the map in each period to be similar to the map in other periods. Finally, their method also avoids any estimation of the proposal positions, a crucial element for analyzing specific votes.            "
"24","Dougherty and Heckelman (2006) present an ideal point model using the optimal classification algorithm of Poole (2000) to estimate ideal points in two dimensions, but without any of the period effects (they use all of the votes and ignore time effects). Their specific purpose is to examine the role of Sherman at the convention, concluding that he was a pivotal delegate. Similar to the other cases, their model eschews estimation of proposal positions, though we find that our estimation of the state positions is broadly comparable to theirs.            "
"25","Londregan (1999a, 1999b) provides an improved approach to estimating positions of the state delegations. Londregan uses an item‐response model—very similar to the method implemented below—in order to place the state delegations. His model also incorporates some information about the proposals in order to place a few individual delegates. Londregan is also concerned with changes in positions across the debate (i.e., delegations that shifted positions as the debate progressed). In order to solve this, he splits the convention into two parts and assumes that the first half (up until July 16) concentrates on the nature of representation in the fledgling government and that the second half (the rest of the convention) concentrates on the powers of the government. He then estimates an item‐response model for each dimension (separately) and reports the estimates from each period. In spirit, our approach is closest to Londregan's but we eschew his restrictions on time, preferring instead to code individual votes as fitting onto the dimensions of representation and scope and power (similar to Londregan's chosen dimensions, but without his timing restrictions). Furthermore, while Londregan incorporates information about the agenda structure, the positions of the proposal and status quo points are identified by the restrictive assumption that the proposal position is identical to the position of the proposer. Instead, we identify the proposal and status quo positions based on the structure of the agenda.            "
"26","In general, we agree with previous work that concludes the convention has multiple dimensions (perhaps as many as five, but certainly greater than two). However, that is only true of the entire set of convention votes. When focusing on the votes up through July 16 (as we do here), the dimensionality appears to be well captured by a two‐dimensional effort. It is to that model of the convention that we now turn."
"27","We estimate the positions of the states using an ideal point model based on a spatial model of voting (Poole and Rosenthal 1997; Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004). In spatial models of voting, the legislator considers two positions, represented in d dimensions of an ideological space: the “Yea” (bill proposal) position ωj and the “Nay” (status quo) position qj, for j = 1, … , m roll calls. The utility for the proposal and status quo are functions of the distance from the ideal point; utility decreases for alternatives further away from the ideal point. The legislator votes “Yea” if Uij(ωj) > Uij(qj), and “Nay” otherwise. The utility functions are               "
"28","For this particular model, the first dimension is “proportional representation”—the debate over the nature of representation which centered on such issues as whether or not the legislature's apportionment would be based on population or the equality of the states, but also included such things as the terms of representatives and other related matters. The second dimension is the “scope and power” of government—the debate over federalism and the centralization of power. These dimensions were identified by all of the previous modelers cited in the section above (Dougherty and Heckelman 2006; Jillson 2002; Londregan 1999a, 1999b; Slez and Martin 2007). Given the literature (and the historical literature also emphasizes these issue dimensions), we think this is a reasonable choice, but obviously other analysts may wish to make different modeling choices. To better clarify the dimensions, we restricted many of the votes to matter only on one of the two dimensions. The coding of these votes is available upon request.            "
"29","The typical implementation of this model, such as in Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers (2004) and Martin and Quinn (2002), do not estimate the proposal and status quo parameters directly. Instead, a reduced form model is estimated:               "
"30","One limitation of this model is that the progression of the agenda is ignored. One can scramble the ordering of the votes, yet the DW‐NOMINATE (and CJR) estimates will remain unchanged. Clinton and Meirowitz (2001, 2004) extend this model by incorporating the agenda directly into the estimation.7 First, for vote j, if proposal ωj passes, then the new status quo point equals this proposal: qj+1=ωj. If ωj fails, then the status quo remains unchanged: qj+1=qj. Second, if a proposal does not concern dimension d, even if ωj passes, the coordinates of the status quo for irrelevant dimensions will remain unchanged: qj+1,d= qj,d. In the canonical ideal point model, these constraints are not imposed. In the statistical model, each voting option (whether currently a status quo or proposal) is represented by an element of the parameter vector θ. The parameters qj and ωj are mapped into θ, indexed by y( j) and n( j), where qj=θy( j) and ωj=θn( j).8 By imposing the previously mentioned constraints inherent to the spatial voting model, one can directly estimate the structural parameters (status quo points and proposals), instead of the reduced form parameters βj and αj. The model is now               "
"31","Naturally, for modern legislatures where single votes may impact many policies simultaneously, such restrictions are difficult to impose (though perhaps not impossible for a specific issue such as health care policy). For Clinton and Meirowitz, the approach works well in the 1st Congress, where the primary issues considered are the location of the capital and the assumption of state debts. Bills propose specific changes to these areas, and irrelevant proposals are easily removed. The Constitutional Convention has a more varied agenda, but the proposals are very specific and the number of substantive subjects is limited. Procedural votes, since they do not affect the status quo if passed, are excluded. All unanimous votes are removed as well, along with any votes that contain only affirmative (or, in rare instances, only negative) and divided votes. Some of the unanimous votes could conceivably be used, as long as both the status quo and proposal positions appear in enough nonunanimous votes. In practice though, these votes cause problems for the estimation.            "
"32","Because the delegations voted by state, there is a complication due to aggregation. While this ideal point model is often applied for such actors,9 the use of this model does require some caution when discussing the “ideal point” of state i. In particular, we will refer to xi as the “revealed position,” since xi is a reflection of the delegation decision‐making process, which does not necessarily result in the revelation of the median or mean position of the delegation. An estimate of xi with a low score on both representation and scope and power reflects a state delegation with a decision‐making process that results in actions supporting equal voting among states and limited national government.            "
"33","Another complication with the Constitutional Convention data is the presence of divided votes. Since the states vote by delegation, it is possible for states to become deadlocked on any particular vote. How should these votes be addressed? One cannot feasibly treat each vote as an ordered or unordered indicator, since the number of divided votes is indeed rare. For votes with no divided votes, one could not separately estimate divided vote coefficients (in unordered models) or vote‐specific thresholds (in ordered models). Consequently, the approach taken in all previous analyses has been to exclude the votes as missing. Of course, this “throws out” some information about the states' revealed positions. In addition, the most important vote in the convention, vote 156 (on the Great Compromise), is partly decided by Massachusetts' switching from “Nay” to “Divided.” Furthermore, it would be unlikely that these thresholds could be considered identical across state delegations. Some states were more likely to be divided than others. One obvious factor was whether the delegation was small or large, odd or even. Also, some delegations had several opposing state political factions represented."
"34","We express the stalemate within the delegation as the delegation split evenly between “Yea” and “Nay” positions. The resulting behavior results in a revealed position close to the cutline, the closeness measured by parameter δ. Since some states are more likely to be divided than others, we estimate separate δi for each state. Consequently, if two states have the same xi, the state with the larger δi will be more likely to vote “Divided.” Following Sanders (1998, 2001), the decision rule is               "
"35","Much like factor analysis, certain restrictions must be imposed to ensure rotational invariance. Similar to a confirmatory factor analysis, the model can be identified with appropriate restrictions on the vote parameters. We fix the proposals on votes 40 (each state receives one vote in the Senate) and 41 (proportional representation also for the Senate) on the first dimension (θ22,1=−1 and θ23,1= 1) and proposals for votes 29 (members of the House elected by state legislatures instead of people) and 34 (national negative of executive) on the second dimension (θ17,2= 1 and θ19,2= 1). In addition to imposing the relational contraints implied by the agenda (successful proposals become the next status quo point, and status quo points remain until a successful proposal), we restricted many votes (including votes 34, 40, and 41) to load only onto one of the dimensions in each model, based on the content of the vote (e.g., only concerns proportional representation or scope and power). Twenty‐five of the 92 votes analyzed propose changes in both dimensions. Twenty‐four votes constitute changes only on the proportional representation dimension, and 43 only concern scope and power.            "
"36","Given the large number of parameters in the posterior distribution, the nonstandard form of the joint distribution, and the difficulty in estimating the parameters jointly using classical methods of maximum likelihood, we work in a Bayesian setting, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC; see Jackman 2009 and Johnson and Albert 1999 for a survey of these methods and their applicability to IRT models). The likelihood is               "
"37","Before turning to a discussion of the specific roll‐call votes, we want to examine the validity of the model to understand how well it has captured the convention. The left panel of Figure 1 displays the estimated positions described by the previous analysis. The results broadly confirm previous efforts and illustrate the division between the large and small states. Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York are grouped in the left half of the space, consistent with their demands for equal state representation. States demanding proportional representation can be found in the right‐hand side of the space (ignoring periods for now): Georgia, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia.         "
"38","                State Delegation Positions in Two Dimensions                      "
"39","Note: Right‐hand panel includes shifts for Georgia, Massachusetts, and North Carolina for votes after June 20.                     "
"40","The second dimension of the graphic pertains to the scope and power of the government. Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Delaware all generally favored a much more powerful centralized government than did the other states (each of those three states actually voted for a national negative over state laws). The Southern states can be seen in the lower right‐hand quadrant. Despite their affection for proportional representation (a generally nationalistic position), they apparently did not favor an extremely powerful government and tended to vote as a bloc against any proposal to give the national government power over slavery or excessive regulation of trade and commerce. Connecticut and New Jersey also take fairly anticentralization positions, consistent with their votes against such things as national negatives and strong executive powers."
"41","To better assess the model fit, we calculate, for each vote, Bayesian p‐values from the posterior predictive distribution using a test statistic based on the number of “Yea” votes cast, with the p‐value reflecting the probability the number of “Yea” votes predicted by the model is greater than the actual number of “Yea” votes.13 Only 10 of the 92 votes have extreme p‐values (defined as less than 0.05 or greater than 0.95), indicating a poor fit on those votes.14 Almost all of these votes are lopsided and relating to minor issues (eligibility of officeholders, stipends, length of time between censuses), and a vote confirming previously passed amendments on the number of representatives apportioned. Only one, vote 39, concerns an important substantive issue (ratio of representation based on all free persons and three‐fifths of all slaves). Later votes related to this particular issue are predicted well, and this particular vote occurs before representation in the Senate is considered. As a final check of the goodness of fit, we estimated the percent correctly predicted. Against the baseline of predicting only “Yea” votes where 52.5% of the votes would be correctly predicted, our model correctly classifies 66.4% of the votes (64% of the “yea” votes and 77% of the “no” votes), a substantial improvement.         "
"42","In sum, this picture of the debate is broadly consistent with most previous modeling efforts, and the available measures of goodness of fit suggest that the model does a good job of capturing the voting dynamics. Despite important differences in methodology, this picture closely corresponds to the work of Jillson (2002), Londregan (1999a, 1999b) and Slez and Martin (2007), as well as the scaling model of Dougherty and Heckelman (2006). Minor differences are probably due to the distinctions in terms of the period estimated—this model focuses on the period leading up to the Great Compromise and does not consider convention votes after July 16. It is encouraging that our model is consistent with other work. And it is worth noting that this is the first model to try a complete multidimensional estimation of the delegate positions and the proposal locations. If this model suggested patterns at odds with the previous scholarship, we would be relatively less confident in the model. But, satisfied that our general map of the events leading up to the compromise seems relatively straightforward, we turn to the question of explaining the compromise via the evidence in the roll‐call record.         "
"43","It is, of course, possible that at the last moment some members of the Massachusetts and North Carolina delegations simply decided that the small states deserved some kind of equal representation and accordingly voted that way. But we should be clear that no model with error could detect such idiosyncratic behavior, and without clear documentary evidence it is a difficult hypothesis to really confirm. More importantly, this sort of account is not really consistent with the conventional story of the convention that speaks of conciliatory gestures toward moderation. If this is a stand‐alone vote unconnected with the rest of the agenda, then nothing but a clear historical record could explain it (and to our knowledge no one offers such a smoking gun). But if moderation is the key, then we should observe a temporal shift in the positions of the Massachusetts and North Carolina delegations."
"44","To test this possibility, we divide the convention into periods. If the positions of the states shift in ways consistent with the deliberation and moderation hypothesis, we will have support for the importance of moderation on the ultimate compromise. If we find no such effects, then, while we may not be able to rule out the possibility that a few individual minds changed in the breach, we can say that delegations did not moderate their positions consistent with deliberation and conciliation."
"45","Selecting the periods is obviously important, but luckily the convention's structure gives some guidance on how to divide into periods. At the outset the delegates decided to begin their discussions in the Committee of the Whole. As Larson and Winship recently put it, “[T]his procedure for the proposed Constitution gave delegates the opportunity to consider each element of it at least twice—one in the Committee of the Whole and then in Convention—and allowed for them to experiment with new ideas, especially at the committee stage” (2005, 15). This gives a relatively clear benchmark (June 20) for the two periods. Before that time, the delegates were essentially always in the Committee of the Whole. After that period they were in the convention. Using this historical fact of the convention we divide the first six weeks into two periods, based on whether or not the delegates were in committee or in convention.            "
"46","The right panel of Figure 1 displays the positions of the states allowing Georgia, Massachusetts, and North Carolina to shift for the final period on the representation dimension (denoted by GA2, MA2, and NC2). These states (and no others) were permitted to shift on the following grounds: Massachusetts and North Carolina appeared to change their positions on the main dimension of representation; Georgia's delegation was substantially different at the later vote.15 The results suggest that both North Carolina and Georgia moved to the right on proportional representation. In other words, they dug in their heels about questions of representation, perhaps because of their high hopes for future population gains (Rakove 1996). It appears that as the convention wore on, the two states were even more likely to stake out positions against equal state representation.            "
"47","On the other hand, the estimated probability that Massachusetts moved to the left is 0.88. This shift is clearly consistent with moderation (Rakove 1996; Wirls and Wirls 2004; many others describe the story of the Massachusetts delegation in more detail). When we allow Massachusetts to shift on the proportional representation dimension, the predicted probability of a vote against the compromise falls from 58.2% to 43.7%, a substantial change clearly consistent with a story of moderation as conventionally told.            "
"48","With regard to Massachusetts, Madison records that Gerry and Strong voted for the proposal, while King and Ghorum voted against the Grand Committee compromise. Presumably either Gerry or Strong (or both) voted for proportional representation in the earlier vote on June 11. Neither of their positions at that time is clear enough to be absolutely certain. Whether or not one or both delegates switched is irrelevant to the final outcome: Massachusetts was evenly divided. Further speculation about the moderation hypothesis and its connections to the documentary record are beyond the scope of this article—though we hope that scholars will accept the evidence here as a help in analyzing the writings of these delegates. Suffice it to say that both the very limited documentary evidence and the roll‐call estimates admit of the possibility of moderation on the part of the Massachusetts delegation. But the available evidence for North Carolina's switch is flatly inconsistent with that. So we must look elsewhere to explain North Carolina's complete switch from favoring proportional representation to opposing it. For that, we turn to the agenda structure."
"49","We can begin by ruling out the possibility of a cross‐cutting dimension. Considering the two dimensions estimated here (“proportional representation” and “scope and power”)—dimensions that have been widely used by others either for the convention as a whole (Dougherty and Heckelman 2006; Londregan 1999a, 1999b) or for this period (Jillson 2002; Slez and Martin 2007)—we see little evidence for a cross‐cutting dimensional effect. Consider that North Carolina's estimated position on proportional representation is almost exactly in the middle of the large‐state coalition (see Figure 1), leaving little room for a proposal on the scope and power dimension to persuade North Carolina without leaving a trace on other delegations. But what about the possibility of a third dimension?            "
"50","To deal with this possibility, we evaluated a three‐dimensional model that included a specific slavery dimension (the other two dimensions would remain the same in that model). But we could find no evidence that this dimension was specifically affecting North Carolina—in part because there were only seven votes directly on the slavery dimension, and when we examined those votes it appeared that they could best be captured on the proportional representation dimension (which was the conclusion of all of our different modeling attempts for this period of the convention and by the literature cited above). We accordingly reject multiple dimensions beyond these first two as the best explanation for the shift in North Carolina's vote and restrict ourselves for the balance of the article to this two‐dimensional model."
"51","This leaves us with one final possibility to check: that the substance of the votes changed in ways that permitted the small‐state coalition to attract North Carolina with a revised proposal on the proportional representation dimension. The left panel of Figure 2 shows the key proposal locations from votes on June 11 and July 16 (note that the right panel displays the 95% HPD intervals on the proportional representation dimension). The first vote on June 11 was the proposal to base representation in the first branch of the legislature on proportional representation by population (in line with a position offered by Sherman). This vote passed easily—only New York, New Jersey, and Delaware voted against it—establishing the policy position found at point 6/11 SQ on the graph. But when Sherman followed up on that success proposing that “each State shall have [one] vote in the 2d. branch” (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 201) (the proposal is denoted Equal on the graph), the vote failed with only the five small states supporting it—the six large states in opposition. James Wilson of Pennsylvania and Alexander Hamilton of New York immediately proposed proportional representation in the lower house (the proposal is denoted Prop in Figure 2), persuading the convention with exactly the same vote divisions as went against the proposal Equal.16"
"52","                Delegation and Key Proposal Locations                         "
"53","Note: Left panel displays state delegation positions along with proposal positions and cutlines for June 11 and July 16. Right panel displays states and proposals on proportional representation dimension. Bars indicate 95% highest posterior density intervals.                        "
"54","At this point, the small states were seemingly defeated. Though there were additional votes on June 29 and July 2, the result did not change. Returning to Figure 2, on the right, just above the position of Prop, can be seen the July 16 SQ: despite a month of voting, the result of the convention remained essentially unchanged. But on that day the status quo was challenged by a new proposal, clearly closer to the large states on the proportional representation: GC, the Great Compromise proposed by the Grand Committee, a proposal that is clearly to the right of the equal representation proposal offered by Sherman earlier and much closer to the large states in general and North Carolina in particular (note the error bars in the right panel). Because it is so different from the June 11 vote, it is clear that the small states manipulated the agenda in some way to make this July 16 proposal more palatable to the large states.17 The question is what in the proposal accomplished this?            "
"55","One possible reason for the compromise was the origination of money bills. However, Madison “could not regard the exclusive privilege of originating money bills as any concession,” believing it would “have no effect” (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 527). This proposal had been offered previously in the convention (vote 61 on June 13). But it was voted down by a margin of three votes to eight. The model estimates North Carolina's probability of supporting that stand‐alone measure as only 11.8%, implying that North Carolina was not deeply interested in this provision. It seems unlikely, given the attitude of Madison and North Carolina's past voting history on the issue, that this was a decisive piece of the puzzle. Instead, we have to look at the rest of the agenda that unfolded over the next few days to see what proposals are most likely to have pushed North Carolina toward a vote for the Grand Compromise.            "
"56","Table 2 displays the votes that immediately preceded the vote on July 16, including a short description of the content, the model's estimate of the relevant probabilities, and then the state's actual vote. It is immediately clear that North Carolina was generally in favor of most of the items debated as part of the eventual compromise: the idea of a census, the proposal to link taxation to the census, and eventually the final vote on the compromise. Intriguingly, North Carolina votes against the proposal to count all persons—as opposed to the three‐fifths rule (displaying their commitment to that rule). But probabilities alone will not reveal the story; we must also examine the locations of the proposals with respect to North Carolina (see Figure 2).            "
"57","The Great Compromise was not simply a clean vote on representation. When GC is proposed, it includes a number of items, including slavery and the Three‐Fifths Compromise, the manner of the census, and the ability of the national legislature to regulate the rule of representation in the future. Beginning on July 11 (see vote 132 in Farrand), the delegates had been arguing over the method of the census and who exactly would be counted. The Grand Committee's proposal at that point contained two major parts, enactment of Sherman's proposal to have proportional representation in the lower house but also an apportionment of initial representation. From July 11 to July 13 the details of this representation proposal are hotly debated, but the substance is rarely if ever significantly changed. But on each of these days Northerners brought up objections to the counting method and the proportion of slaves accepted into the count. While all of this was going on, the Southern states must have grown more and more nervous.            "
"58","Vote 143 began the debate over the timing of the census, but most of the debate centered around how the census would work, not really its timing. By this point in the debate the Southerners had reached a boiling point and began to worry, in the words of Mr. Davie from North Carolina, “that it was meant by some gentlemen to deprive the Southern States of any share of Representation for their blacks.” He went so far as to say that “N. Carola. wold never confederate on any terms that did not rate them at least ” (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 593). Davie, and presumably others, wanted explicit guarantees for slavery, but the North was reluctant. Gouvernor Morris argued for a census rule that would allow the national legislature to “regulate Representation according to population & wealth” (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 593), to which the Southerners replied that “property in slaves should not be exposed to danger [from the national government]” (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 593–94).            "
"59","Rakove describes this exchange by saying that Morris argued that it was “better to trust to a future legislative discretion that would surely take the value of slaves into account .…[r]emarks like these could only prompt southern delegates … to favor a rule explicitly linking representation and slavery” (Rakove 1996, 72). James Wilson of Pennsylvania noted that            "
"60","                              "
"61","[L]ess umbrage would perhaps be taken agst. an admission of the slave into the Rule of representation, if it should be so expressed as to make them indirectly only an ingredient in the rule, by saying that they should enter into the rule of taxation: and as representation was to be according to taxation, the end would be equally attained. (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 595)                  "
"62","Wilson wanted to find a compromise that gave the South what it wanted without explicitly discussing slavery in the Constitution. If representation could be governed by a rule of taxation that was governed by the three‐fifths rule, slavery would be only an “ingredient” of the compromise without being an explicit part of it. At the end of this day (July 12), the delegates eventually agreed to his version of the resolution (see vote 147). Howard Ohline puts it this way, “James Wilson had achieved a political marriage of the slave interest with the ideals of … popular republicanism” (Ohline 1971, 581). In doing so, Wilson inextricably links slavery and the Senate, tying them together in the bargain that permits the Federal Convention to move past this seemingly unbridgeable divide to finish the proposed Constitution.            "
"63","Figure 3 displays the progression of the key votes just before the vote on the Great Compromise. The two proposals that make the most difference—in terms of moving the proposal closer to North Carolina's position—are the votes on census and taxation, especially votes 147 and 150. Indeed, according to the model, these votes are more important than the vote on the overall clause that included the Three‐Fifths Compromise. So what was it about these taxation votes that could have made so much difference?            "
"64","                The Agenda Leading Up to the Great Compromise                         "
"65","Note: Each panel displays the progression of proposals leading up to the Great Compromise (vote numbers correspond to Table 2). In the top panel, dark circles denote a successful proposal while open circles denote failure; NC denotes the position of North Carolina. The bottom panel displays 95% highest posterior density intervals.                        "
"66","In the model, Vote 147 moves the proposal in the direction of North Carolina, but it is really the proposal in vote 150 (which happened on July 13) that appears to move it even further in the direction of North Carolina, increasing the probability of a North Carolina vote on the Great Compromise. Note the lower portion of Figure 3 that indicates it is only with this proposal—vote 150—that the estimated positions of the proposal and North Carolina actually overlap.            "
"67","On July 13, Gerry offers two proposals on taxation, saying his principle was that “taxation & Representation ought to go together” (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 601). His proposal in vote 149 read as follows.            "
"68","                              "
"69","That from the first meeting of the Legislature of the United States until a Census shall be taken, all monies to be raised for supplying the public Treasury by direct Taxation shall be assessed on the inhabitants of the several States according to the number of their representatives respectively in the first Branch. (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 600–601)                  "
"70","That vote fails (despite being favored by both Massachusetts and North Carolina), but the slight alteration offered by Elbridge Gerry in vote 150 passes:"
"71","                              "
"72","That from the first meeting of the Legislature of the United States until a Census shall be taken, all monies for supplying the public Treasury by direct Taxation shall be raised from the several States according to the number of their representatives respectively in the first Branch. (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 603)                  "
"73","The only difference is that in the second proposal the power of the government is to raise taxes from the states, as opposed to levying taxes on the inhabitants of the states (making the power of taxation take a more indirect route of representation through the states). The difference in the two proposals is minimal—and since North Carolina votes for both of the proposals, the difference may be immaterial for our purposes—and so we are left with a question about the general idea. What was important about these votes on the census and taxation to the states favoring proportional representation, and to North Carolina in particular?            "
"74","On the surface it looks like a minor taxation debate. The only effect of Gerry's amendment would be to ensure that before the census, any taxation will occur according to the rule of representation already described. But Madison sees to the heart of that day's discussions."
"75","                              "
"76","Mr M[adison] said that having always conceived that the difference of interest in the U. States lay not between the large & small, but the N. & Southn. States …, He liked the present motion, because it tended to moderate the views of both of the opponents & advocates for rating very high, the negroes. (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 601–2)                  "
"77","This shows the connection to slavery in two ways. First, Madison realizes that the question of taxation under debate is not solely about revenue, but is really one of representation: how will the Southern states be represented? What will be the rules of representation that they will live under? Madison is pointing out that not only do taxation and representation go together (as Gerry had already said), but also the treatment of slavery and the representation of slave states go along with it."
"78","Second, Gerry's proposed rule in vote 150 helps bind future legislatures. Should it pass, it would actually create a status quo from which the future U.S. Congress would have to work. In any legislative procedure the location of the status quo is vital in determining future outcomes—and this talented group of statesmen must have known that fact intimately. Though no one at the convention describes how important this status quo could be, the fact that the vote on Gerry's amendment is a close one reveals that the proposal was a close call, with the Southern states voting for it (along with Massachusetts) and the Northern and mid‐Atlantic states voting against it."
"79","When it did pass, it created a powerful precedent for how the national government would initially treat representation, taxation, and therefore implicitly slavery. According to the language of the proposal, taxation would be a matter that included the state‐level representatives as well as the national representatives and would begin based on the rule of representation then being established—a rule that included the three‐fifths clause. There was discussion at the convention of freeing the national legislature to do as it pleases on this question of taxation and representation. Sherman argued that the future legislature ought to be “left at liberty” (Farrand 1966, Vol. I, 602). But the vote goes for Gerry's proposal, and this must have been somewhat reassuring to Southern states looking for guarantees about how representation would be treated by the new government. They knew themselves to be initially a minority, but one that was now guaranteed that key questions like taxation would include representation at both the state and national level and that the initial rule would ratify the Three‐Fifths Compromise. Perhaps North Carolina in particular was relieved as it waited for the crucial final vote. Vote 154 was the only other substantive vote before Vote 156 and did not change the situation because it did not pass (the vote was merely about whether new states would be treated on an equal footing with the original 13 states, with respect to representation).            "
"80","If we compare North Carolina's probability of voting for the Great Compromise to its position on equal state representation in the Senate previous to the amendment (see vote 110 on July 2), the model estimates that the probability of a positive vote as only 18.4%. But after changing the agenda and giving reassurances on slavery in votes 147 and 150, North Carolina's probability of voting for equal state representation (vote 156) rises to 42.2%. Indeed, it is clear that the final proposal (vote 150) mattered, as without passage of that proposal North Carolina's estimated probability of voting for the compromise falls to only 20.8%. The probability that North Carolina was more likely to support the compromise after vote 150 passed is 0.99, meaning we can be very sure about the effect. Without direct testimony from William Blount, William Davie, Alexander Martin, Richard Spaight Sr., and Hugh Williamson, we may not be able to know the psychology behind North Carolina's switch. But if North Carolina gave up something in terms of proportional representation, it did so after the Three‐Fifths Compromise was firmly placed into the Great Compromise and only after it was established as the precedent from which the infant government would begin."
"81","On June 11, when Sherman urges the convention to compromise on representation, he apparently fails. But a month later his proposal carries the day, when Massachusetts and North Carolina seemingly change positions on the question. Perhaps it is fitting that the roll‐call evidence suggests that both interests—North Carolina's need to have slavery and the representation of slave states guaranteed—and ideas—Massachusetts's apparent willingness to shift positions in a more moderate direction—were central to the Great Compromise. Our analysis began by suggesting two possible hypotheses needed testing: moderation effects and agenda effects. It is important to recognize that the roll‐call record strongly suggests that there were two different types of vote shifts going on, one parochial and one national. North Carolina did not moderate its position on representation—in fact it moved in a more polarized direction, something that is difficult to reconcile with the idea of deliberation and moderation, especially when one considers the evidence that North Carolina gained a concession on slavery and representation immediately before the decisive vote.         "
"82","Modern debates over constitutionalism often invoke the intentions of the founders (Rakove 1996). Setting aside the debate over whether or not current policy questions can be settled by such an appeal, we agree that understanding the origins of the most inscrutable institution in the American government is of vital importance. So worth turning over every rock in order to better understand those events, and the results here suggest that some past perspective on them is incomplete.         "
"83","In 1913 the greatest historian of the convention—Max Farrand—rejected any explicit connection between the Three‐Fifths Compromise and the Great Compromise by saying that “the three‐fifths rule was a mere incident in that part of the great compromise which declared that ‘representation ought to be apportioned according to direct Taxation’” (Farrand 1913, 108). Historians have largely followed his pattern of treating the compromises as separate events that are “mere incidents” to one another. But the roll‐call record strongly suggests otherwise. Any explanation of the vote switches must consider the specter of slavery with respect to North Carolina's vote. Separation into a compromise over slavery and a compromise over representation is unwarranted. The proposal on July 16 was not simply yet another vote about representation. When we carefully model the convention's agenda, that vote is clearly not proportional representation but was clearly a compromise born out of a desire to attract Southern votes.         "
"84","Frank Garver described the convention with terms like “conciliation and compromise.” His attitude is reflective of a broader consensus about the convention that describes it in similarly deliberative terms. We would not disagree with the general assessment that deliberation and persuasion were important elements of the convention. But our analysis does not permit the conclusion that the great compromise was simply a moment of conciliation and compromise. Reassurance on the slavery question appears to be crucial in bringing about the switch from North Carolina, and subsequently the American Senate. We would argue that this type of debate is characteristic of all great legislative moments (and probably many lesser ones as well) and that this general method of scrutinizing the positions of the participants and the unfolding agenda may be applied to any such situation. Is the resulting compromise a result of deliberation leading to a moderation of views, or is it bought with a bargain that reveals itself in the agenda?         "
"85","This finding that the U.S. Senate was purchased, in part, with a bargain related to slavery will, no doubt, make some students of the convention uncomfortable. Conventional wisdom that divides the convention's compromises by their quality generally separates representation and slavery—hence the name “Great Compromise” for the more preferred bargain. In the light of roll‐call analysis of the votes, that division strikes us as unwarranted and probably not a descriptively accurate assessment of the convention's outcome. Most legislative maneuvering involves trade‐offs and bargains that are not always what the bargainers might prefer in the absence of a controversy. It is left to history to judge whether the bargain—in this case a bargain that helped ensure both slavery and the U.S. Senate—was an acceptable compromise or not."
