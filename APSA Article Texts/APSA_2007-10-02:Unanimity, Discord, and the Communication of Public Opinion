"1","This article is concerned with the consequences of disagreement and opinion variance for the communication and diffusion of public opinion. This purpose requires that a preliminary question be addressed: Why should meaningful patterns of political disagreement persist among citizens in democratic politics? The answer to this question is important because several arguments imply that disagreement may be a rare event within communication networks."
"2","First, cost‐conscious consumers of political information can minimize their information costs by obtaining information through conversations with fellow citizens, and Downs (1957) suggests that a rational individual will obtain information from politically expert individuals who hold politically compatible viewpoints. Thus, to the extent that individuals rely on people with compatible views, one would expect very little disagreement to occur (but see Calvert 1985).         "
"3","Second, from the alternative vantage points of conformity theory (Asch 1963) and cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger 1957), disagreement has been seen as a psychologically punishing experience that people seek to escape. They might avoid disagreeable encounters, misperceive disagreeable messages, and modify their own viewpoints in an agreeable direction. Indeed, the utility of crosscutting cleavages as an explanation for opinion change is anchored in ideas such as these (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Mutz 2002a, 2002b).         "
"4","Finally, substantial research traditions based on dynamic models of opinion change (Abelson 1979; Axelrod 1997) point toward the experience of opinion heterogeneity as a transient, unstable state within a system defined in terms of interacting individuals. These models generate stable equilibria among interacting individuals in which disagreement is eliminated, opinion variance disappears, and uniformity is the stable end result.         "
"5","Not only are the implications of these analyses troubling to those who value the free give‐and‐take of political information (Mendelberg 2002), but they are also difficult to reconcile with the empirical record. Walsh (2004) demonstrates a lively, informal, and sustained process of discussion, disagreement, and deliberation among individuals involved in ongoing patterns of social interaction. An accumulated series of network studies shows that, while individuals are likely to agree with most of the people in their communication networks, the experience of disagreement tends to be widespread and persistent (Huckfeldt, Ikeda, and Pappi 2005; Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995). And the 2000 National Election Study indicates that, among those respondents who provide information on their political communication networks, more than one‐third of the Bush and Gore voters name at least one discussant who supports the opposite candidate, and less than half report unanimous support for their favored candidate (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004).         "
"6","A number of factors sustain politically diverse preferences within communication networks. First, disagreement is not a prohibitively painful or costly experience for everyone. For many individuals, a lively engagement in politics outweighs associated disagreement costs (Huckfeldt and Mendez n.d.). Even if people prefer to discuss politics with likeminded individuals, this preference competes with a range of other preferences and purposes. You may value lunches with a friendly and politically knowledgeable coworker (Huckfeldt 2001) with whom you share a range of interests, and hence you tolerate her wrong‐headed political views. Moreover, the selection of associates is a stochastic process, and the distribution of opinions among potential discussion partners severely limits individual control. If you are employed at a workplace full of Republicans, it may be difficult to find a Democratic workplace associate with whom to eat lunch (Finifter 1974; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995; Mutz and Mondak 2006).         "
"7","Finally, communication networks are often characterized by low densities, where many individuals are not directly connected (Burt 1992; Granovetter 1973). Hence, two discussion partners who regularly disagree may not share any other associates in common, and both might hold majority viewpoints within their own circle of associates. This is important because the political message conveyed by any particular associate is more likely to be both correctly understood and persuasive to the extent that it is reinforced by the messages conveyed from other associates (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004). In short, influence within a dyad is not automatic, and disagreement might be sustained as part of a stable dynamic equilibrium.         "
"8","As a consequence, people cannot necessarily assume political unanimity within their networks of political communication, and hence it becomes important to consider the consequences of opinion heterogeneity for the flow of information within and beyond the boundaries of political communication networks. These consequences, in turn, depend on the inherent ambiguity of the political communication that occurs among and between citizens."
"9","Political communication among and between citizens is a highly efficient means whereby individuals become politically informed (Downs 1957); it plays an influential role in the formation and diffusion of political preferences (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Druckman and Nelson 2003; Levine 2004); and it is central to patterns of political engagement and mobilization (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993). Notwithstanding these important functions, political communication often occurs in a context marked by high levels of ambiguity. The source of this ambiguity is an important issue in the analysis of political communication because it speaks directly to the potential of collective decision making in democratic politics, as well as to patterns of unanimity and discord.         "
"10","First, and perhaps most important, communication is typically informal and offhand, and politics seldom serves as the centerpiece for relationships and social encounters. This is not to say that politics is unimportant or insignificant, but only that it competes with other subjects and purposes for airtime in the conversational life of most citizens (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004). The same factors that affect individual levels of political participation and engagement also affect the frequency of political discussion. The importance of these factors is likely to be more pronounced in the context of public opinion than it is, for example, in the context of the vote for president. While many individuals are able to make accurate judgments regarding the presidential votes of their associates, it may be more difficult to reach judgments regarding opinions on a wide array of issues that are rarely discussed.         "
"11","Second, the ambiguity of political communication may be individually motivated, either by conscious strategy, or by social discomfort, or by both (MacKuen 1990; Mutz 2002). When people encounter associates with divergent political viewpoints, they may indeed change the subject, unwittingly misperceive the message, or consciously censor their own response to avoid an uncomfortable social exchange. Indeed, a rich and enduring tradition in the analysis of political communication calls into question the capacity and willingness of individuals to perceive political messages accurately when they are contrary to their own preferences (Festinger 1957; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995; Klapper 1968).         "
"12","Given the ambiguity of social communication and the uncertainty that it produces, the context of the communication becomes particularly important for understanding the judgments that individuals reach regarding the opinions of individual associates. Communication occurs within social contexts that are specific to a series of nested environments: political messages are conveyed within the context of particular dyads, located within larger networks, imbedded within larger environments of opinion. Each of these environments, in turn, has the potential to influence the inferential judgments that citizens make about the opinions of other individuals. Without actually hearing a friend's opinion on organized prayer in public schools, one might infer—correctly or incorrectly—that she holds the same opinion held by others. In short, ambiguous political messages and the uncertainty they produce create a setting in which prior information, taken from larger surrounding environments, becomes particularly influential in forming judgments regarding the preferences held by other individuals."
"13","The use of prior information may not come easily for many individuals in many settings, and a rich tradition of experimental research indicates that people often rely more heavily on their own vivid experience in reaching decisions and forming impressions about others (Tversky and Kahneman 1974). This raises a question: how important is prior information taken from the environment to political communication among citizens?Tversky and Kahneman argue that the effect of a base rate (or prior information) depends on the particular inferential context. Prior information is more likely to be employed when individuals interpret the information as revealing something quite important regarding the likelihood of an event due to “external‐situational factors” independently of the immediate circumstances (“internal‐dispositional factors”) affecting the inference (1982, 159). This article's argument is that environmental priors become particularly important in the context of political communication among citizens, and this view generates several implications.         "
"14","First, this environmental information is most informative when the opinion distribution is most consensual. To the extent that your own opinion, the opinions of your associates, and the opinions of the public at large tend to be in agreement, there is less need to collect information from individual associates regarding their opinions. You might more or less reliably assume that, since everyone holds the same opinion, communication with any particular individual proves to be less necessary to the formation of a judgment regarding that individual's opinion. Indeed, to the extent that one expects everyone to hold a particular opinion or belief, it might be difficult to believe that anyone would hold an opinion to the contrary!"
"15","Second, and conversely, the environment is least informative when opinion is most divided. To the extent that a higher level of variance exists among and between your own opinion, the opinions of your own associates, and opinions in the larger community, prior information taken from the environment will be less helpful in forming judgments regarding the opinions of particular individuals. In these circumstances, a deeply divided distribution of opinion is likely to provide little guidance, and hence the process of communicating with a given associate becomes particularly important in forming a judgment about that individual's opinion. This creates a problem, of course, if controversial opinions are believed to be inappropriate subject matter for political communication. In other words, if people fail to communicate their opinions regarding controversial subjects, then political communication fails just when it would be most valuable!         "
"16","The analysis for this article is based on the 1996 Indianapolis‐St. Louis study, conducted by the Center for Survey Research at Indiana University, with interviews that began early in March of 1996 and ended in early January of 1997. The study includes two samples: a sample of main respondents (N = 2,174) drawn from the lists of registered voters, combined with a one‐stage snowball sample of these respondents' discussants (N = 1,475). Main respondent samples are drawn from the voter registration lists of two study sites: (1) the Indianapolis metropolitan area defined as Marion County, IN; and (2) the St. Louis metropolitan area defined as the independent city of St. Louis combined with the surrounding (and mostly suburban) St. Louis County, MO. The preelection main respondent sampling plan was to complete interviews with approximately 40 main respondents each week before the election, equally divided between the two study sites. After the election, an additional 830 respondents were interviewed, once again divided between the St. Louis and Indianapolis metropolitan areas. Discussant interviews were completed at a rate of approximately 30 interviews each week during the preelection period, with an additional 639 interviews conducted after the election. In the preelection period, the discussant interviews for a particular main respondent were completed within two subsequent interview weeks of the main respondent interview.1"
"17","Early in the main respondent survey, the interviewers asked each survey respondent to provide the first names of their discussion partners. A random half sample was asked to name people with whom they discuss “important matters”; the other random half was asked to name people with whom they discuss “government, elections, and politics” (Burt 1986; Huckfeldt et al. 1998). The interviewers took up to five names before asking a battery of questions about each discussant in the sequential order in which the discussant was named. After asking the battery of questions for the last‐named discussant, the interviewer asked the respondent to identify the presidential candidate supported by each of the discussants.            "
"18","Near the end of the survey, after the respondent had answered extensive batteries of questions regarding other issues unrelated to the network battery, the interviewer asked a final battery of questions regarding the previously identified discussants. The purpose of this battery was to obtain the respondent's perception regarding each of her discussants' opinions on a particular political issue. For each respondent, this issue was randomly chosen from a list of four possibilities: a woman's right to an abortion, government aid for blacks and other minorities, equal rights for women, and organized prayer in public schools. The text of the question was as follows:"
"19","                              "
"20","We are about finished, and now I would like to ask you a few more questions about the (people/person) you named earlier. On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is strongly oppose and 5 is strongly favor, what do you think (discussant name's) opinion is regarding (the randomly assigned opinion)?"
"21","At the end of the question about each particular discussant, the interviewer used a keystroke to start a computer clock. As soon as the respondent answered the question, the interviewer used a second keystroke to stop the clock before recording the respondent's answer. The CATI system then asked the interviewer whether the timing was successful, and the interviewer asked the respondent a follow‐up question: “When you talk with (name of discussant), do you discuss these sorts of issues often, sometimes, rarely, or never?”            "
"22","At the end of the session, interviewers asked respondents for identifying information to use in contacting and interviewing their discussants. Eighty percent of the 2,174 main respondents (N = 1,740) named 5,491 discussants, and 1,475 discussants were subsequently interviewed, using a survey instrument very similar to the one used in the main respondent interview. Each discussant (N = 1,475) appears only once as the primary discussant in the data set of dyads, but main respondents (N = 872) appear multiple times: 469 appear in one dyad, 250 in two, 112 in three, 35 in four, and 6 in five. The analyses of this article draw on information taken from both the respondents and their discussants, where each observation in the resulting data set is a dyadic relationship between a main respondent and a discussant.2"
"23","These procedures yield the following measures for the matrix of 1,475 dyads. (1) Each dyadic observation includes the respondent's perception regarding the opinion of the interviewed discussant on a randomly selected political issue. (2) The dyadic observation also includes the self‐reported opinion of the discussant and the respondent on the same randomly selected issue. (3) The observation includes the respondent's judgment regarding the frequency with which “these sorts of issues” are discussed with each discussant. (4) A latency measure is included for the speed with which each respondent reports a perception of each discussant's opinion. (5) Each observation also includes the respondent's perception of each other discussants' positions on the same issue, regardless of whether the discussant was interviewed."
"24","Individuals are located within communities, counties, and other macroenvironments that are characterized by particular distributions of public opinion with respect to important political issues. They do not encounter these opinion distributions directly, but rather through networks of communication drawn from these larger populations (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995). Several questions thus arise: How are perceived opinion distributions within communication networks related to the actual opinion distributions within surrounding populations? How are opinion distributions at both levels related to the frequency of communication? In short, the initial focus is on the macroenvironmental factors that underlie levels of perceived opinion diversity within communication networks, the factors that enhance the frequency of communication within these networks, and the relationship between communication frequency and opinion diversity.         "
"25","The relationship between opinion diversity within communication networks and opinion diversity within the larger population is a particularly important issue for this analysis. To the extent that individuals exercise control over the political composition of their communication networks, one might expect to see little relationship between network diversity and levels of diversity in the larger population. If individuals seek out politically sympathetic discussants, or if they avoid political controversy and disagreement, communication networks should be politically homogeneous and agreeable, regardless of opinion distributions in the surrounding population. Alternatively, to the extent such control is incomplete, or to the extent that people are less motivated to exercise such control, the dispersion of opinion within networks should reflect the dispersion of opinion within the larger population."
"26","This problem is addressed in the two models of Table 1A, where the standard deviations of network opinion distributions are regressed on several explanatory variables. Both models show that larger networks tend to be more politically diverse—that is, people with more extensive networks of communication are more likely to encounter divergent political viewpoints (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004). In the first model of Table 1A, the most diverse issue within the networks is abortion, and the least diverse issue is the excluded baseline issue—equal rights for women—with the minority aid issue and prayer in schools issue lying between. The abortion issue is also the most diverse issue in the sample as a whole, and equal rights for women is the most consensual.3 Hence, in the second model, when the dummy variables for the issues are replaced by the mean and standard deviations of the issue opinions in the sample, higher levels of sample diversity predict higher levels of network diversity.         "
"27","In summary, even when the particular features of the networks and the respondents are taken into account, the analysis shows a strong and direct tie between the diversity of aggregate opinion distributions in the larger community and the diversity of opinion distributions within communication networks. Little evidence exists to suggest that individuals escape controversy by sequestering themselves in politically agreeable settings. Controversial issues in the larger political environment penetrate even closely held networks of political communication."
"28","A related issue revolves around the consequences of opinion diversity regarding a particular issue for the frequency with which that issue is discussed. Even if individuals are unable or disinclined to exercise lock grip control over the political composition of their communication networks, they may still censor their conversations, thereby reducing the frequency with which they discuss controversial issues. Hence, in response to divergent opinion regarding one issue, individuals might simply move on to conversations regarding consensual topics that are better suited for polite conversation."
"29","This problem is evaluated in Part B of Table 1 where the mean reported frequency of discussing the particular issue with discussants in the network is regressed on the same factors, with the standard deviation of network opinion regarding the issue as an additional regressor. In the first model, the respondent's political interest is a positive predictor of discussion frequency. Perhaps more surprising, perceived opinion distributions within the networks have no effect. The opinion with the highest standard deviation both in the sample and in the networks (abortion) is the least likely to be discussed, and the opinion with the smallest standard deviation (equal rights for women) is the most likely to be discussed, but it is not discernibly different from the minority aid opinion. In the second model, when the dummy variables for the issues are replaced by the mean and standard deviation of the issues in the sample, opinion diversity in the larger environment produces lower frequencies of communication (see MacKuen 1990; Mutz 2002a).         "
"30","In summary, issues that produce heterogeneous opinion distributions in the larger political environment also produce disagreement within communication networks. While individuals report higher levels of network disagreement regarding controversial issues, they also report discussing these issues less frequently. That is, individuals appear to avoid controversy, but the existence of opinion diversity still manages to penetrate their own reports regarding opinion distributions within closely held networks of political communication. Thus, regardless of decreased rates of discussion regarding controversial issues, political communication within these networks serves as an extension of the political process occurring in the larger political environment. Rather than sequestering individuals from disagreement, opinion distributions within these networks expose individuals to the political controversies of the day (Anderson and Paskeviciute 2004; Visser and Mirabile 2004).         "
"31","In this context, it becomes important to assess the implications of opinion diversity for the respondents' perceptions of the opinions held by their associates. Rather than focusing on the perceived opinion itself, the analysis begins by focusing on the accessibility of the perception (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004). In the present context, factors affecting the accessibility of the perception might be conceived in two different ways. First, in keeping with previous work (Huckfeldt et al. 1998), it might be seen as a consequence of the association in the respondent's memory between a particular discussant and a particular opinion. Alternatively, the accessibility of the perception might be seen wholly in relationship to the underlying attitude regarding the issue. If an opinion is seen as being consensual, people might respond to the opinion alone, automatically assuming that everyone they know supports or opposes the particular issue. Indeed, for some issues, it might be difficult for individuals to imagine their associates holding any other opinion. These alternatives are considered below, where the measurement device for accessibility is the time latency for the respondent's speed of response—the time required for a respondent to offer her perception regarding a discussant's opinion on the randomly selected issue. Response latencies are used quite widely as measures for accessibility, not only in laboratory settings but also in surveys (Bassili 1993, 1996; Fazio 1990, 1995; Huckfeldt et al. 1998; Mulligan et al. 2003).         "
"32","The response latency for the respondent's perception of the discussant's preference is regressed on a series of explanatory variables in the first model of Table 2. The first three explanatory variables are related to measurement procedures, sociometric order, and question order: (1) A dummy variable indexes the first named discussant; (2) a variable is included for the order in which respondents identified each discussant; and (3) another variable is included for the order in which the perceived opinion question is asked regarding each discussant.         "
"33","These order measures become important for several interrelated reasons. First, the speed of response to survey questions accelerates as respondents become familiar with the question format. The effect of such a learning curve is a potential problem in the present analysis because the sociometric order in which discussants are named may carry substantive meaning (Burt 1986; Huckfeldt et al. 1998). That is, the effects of the learning curve are negatively confounded with the effects of any intimacy or strength of relationship bias that is related to sociometric order. In anticipation of this problem, a modification was made in the order that respondents were asked for their perceptions regarding the opinions of the discussants. The perceptual battery always begins with a question about the first discussant's issue opinion, and hence, if the respondents named two discussants, this meant that they were asked about the first and then the second. If the respondents named three discussants, they were asked about the first, third, and second. For respondents who named four, the interviewers asked about the first, fourth, third, and second. Finally, respondents with five discussants were asked about the first, fifth, second, fourth, and third. While this produces a perfect correlation between the first discussant named and the first discussant about whose preference the respondent is asked, the correlation between question order and discussant order drops to −.14 for the remaining discussants, and hence the learning curve is independent of factors related to the sociometric order of identification.         "
"34","Two of the three measures produce statistically discernible effects on the response latencies. The response latency for the first discussant (and first question) adds nearly 1.5 seconds to the time required for an answer, and this response latency is shortened by .66 seconds for each succeeding question. The order in which discussants are named also produces a negative coefficient, but the relatively small coefficient and t‐value suggest a relatively minor and statistically indiscernible effect."
"35","Two more explanatory variables are also related to measurement issues. First, the baseline speed of response indicates that some respondents answer questions more quickly than others, and this baseline speed helps to explain the speed with which respondents offer perceptions regarding their discussants' opinions.4 Second, two name‐generator questions were used to ask respondents for the names of their discussants. One random half‐sample was asked for the people with whom they discuss “important matters,” and the other random half was asked to name the people with whom they discuss “government, elections, and politics” (Huckfeldt et al. 1998). While respondents answer more rapidly when asked about the politically defined discussants, the difference is not statistically discernible.         "
"36","Several of the explanatory variables included in Table 2 are related to the particular opinions held by the respondents and their discussants. First, the extremity of the perceived opinion for the discussant is negatively related to the response latency. That is, the respondents provide their opinions more quickly when they perceive a more opinionated discussant. Second, the extremity of the respondent's own opinion is also negatively related to the response latency. Opinionated individuals respond more rapidly in providing their perceptions regarding the discussants' opinions. Third, the extremity of the discussant's opinion, based on the self‐reported opinion, produces no discernible effect, and this lack of effect persists even when the variable measuring the respondent's perception of the discussant's opinion extremity is eliminated. Fourth, the absolute value of the difference between the opinion reported by the respondent and the discussant also produces an important effect—greater levels of dyadic disagreement produce longer, slower response times. Fifth, the subjective opinion stability (“how likely is your opinion to change?”) reported by the discussant produces no discernible effect.         "
"37","The frequency with which the respondent reports discussing “these sorts of issues” with a particular discussant produces a substantial effect in which more extensive discussion produces faster response times. Thus, the fact that higher levels of controversy inhibit the frequency of conversation makes it less likely that respondents will respond automatically when asked to provide the opinions of others regarding controversial subjects. That is, respondents are more likely to stop and think when asked to make a judgment about a discussant's opinion regarding a more controversial topic.5"
"38","Finally, dummy variables are included for three of the issues—a woman's right to an abortion, aid for blacks and other minorities, and organized prayer in schools—with equal rights for women being the excluded baseline category. These dummy variables suggest important differences across the issues, with perceptions regarding abortion opinions being the least accessible, and perceptions regarding women's rights being the most accessible, even after taking account of discussion frequency. The abortion issue adds .8 seconds to the response latency, and the school prayer issue adds .6 seconds. What might account for these differences?"
"39","One explanation for the differential accessibility of perceived opinions focuses on cues taken from the larger environment, and another focuses on cues taken from the micro‐environment. In terms of the former, some issues have achieved wide support in the larger environment, producing cultural unanimity among the larger population, while others remain contested. For example, in the larger American political culture, it is widely believed that women should have equal rights, at least so long as the meaning attached to equal rights remains unclear. In the case of these culturally uncontested issues, individuals may automatically assume that individuals hold an opinion that coincides with the culturally dominant opinion. Hence, cultural unanimity regarding an issue may drive the accessibility of people's perceptions regarding the opinions of others."
"40","A second explanation focuses on information transmitted through the more immediate micro‐environments within which individuals are imbedded. According to this second explanation, individuals learn about culturally dominant opinions through specific patterns of social interaction and political communication. To the extent that individuals are imbedded among individuals who communicate particular opinions regarding particular issues, these individuals are more likely to believe that any one of their associates holds similar opinions. Hence, unanimity within networks of social interaction may also be responsible for the accessibility of people's perceptions regarding the opinions of others."
"41","The first explanation is considered graphically in Figure 1A, where the dummy variables for the various issues in the first model of Table 2 are plotted on the standard deviations of these opinions in the entire sample.6 Each of the dummies is plotted as an incremental change in the response latency, and hence the baseline—equal rights for women—is plotted as zero. Part A of the figure produces a set of points that lies along a remarkably straight line in which higher levels of opinion diversity produce longer latencies. Figure 1B also shows a substantial relationship between the response latencies and the diversity of opinions within the remainder of the respondents' networks, but the predictability of the pattern is less pronounced.         "
"42","                 Response Latencies for Perceptions of Discussant Opinion by Opinion Variability, in the Sample and in the Respondents' Networks              A = a woman's right to an abortion M = government aid for blacks and other minorities P = organized prayer in public schools W = equal rights for womenNote: The standard deviation of the opinion in the sample is taken from the main respondent sample. The standard deviation within the network is defined as the mean for the standard deviation of respondents' perceptions of their discussants' opinions, sorted by the particular opinion.Source: The magnitude of opinion effects are taken from the Table 2 estimates in the first model.                     "
"43","Part C of Figure 1 demonstrates the strong association between patterns of diversity in the larger sample and patterns of perceived diversity within respondents' communication networks. The level of diversity is muted within communication networks—the range of diversity is lower within networks than it is in the population as a whole. This does not change the fact, however, that opinion networks fail to qualify as oases of political calm and unanimity within a culture of contentiousness. Indeed, the same disagreements that occur in the larger political environment are reflected in the patterns of perceived diversity that persist within even these closely held, personally idiosyncratic communication networks.         "
"44","Finally, the second model in Table 2 replaces the dummy variables for the issues with the mean and standard deviations for the opinions, both within the sample and within the respondents' networks. Both standard deviation measures produce nearly discernible effects on the response latencies in which higher levels of diversity yield slower response times.7 What does this mean? Figuring out associates' positions on issues becomes less straightforward—perceptions of their opinions are less accessible—when diverse opinions are present within the dyad, within the larger community, and within the more immediate communication network. In short, there is evidence to suggest that the accessibility of judgments regarding the opinions of others is driven by the reality of opinion distributions, both within the immediate micro‐environment and within the aggregate opinion of the larger community.         "
"45","The analysis has demonstrated that perceptions are more accessible to the extent that issues are distributed more homogeneously, both within the larger environment and within the individual's own network of communication. In this section the focus shifts to the factors that affect the perception itself—what are the factors that drive the perceptions? Previous research shows that individuals reach judgments regarding the opinions of their associates based on several primary sources—their own opinions, the opinions of other individuals in their communication networks, and the actual opinion of the associate in question (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004). From one perspective, the first two factors—an individual's own opinion and the opinions of other associates—provide shortcuts for the individual to use in assessing a particular individual's opinion. As long as the distribution of an opinion is characterized by unanimity, such shortcuts are likely to be highly reliable. In contrast, when the distribution of opinions on a particular issue is widely dispersed, these shortcuts become less reliable. The question thus arises, do individual inferences rely more heavily on the actual opinions of others when an issue is marked by discord rather than unanimity?         "
"46","In the first model of Table 3, the perceived opinions are regressed on the self‐reported opinions of the discussant and the main respondent, as well as the mean of the respondent's perceptions regarding the opinions of her remaining discussants. Dummy variables are included for three of the issues—the deleted baseline issue is women's rights. Finally, these dummy variables are used to create interaction variables with both of the self‐reported opinions, as well as with the respondent's mean perception of the opinions held by the remaining discussants.         "
"47","The model produces discernible effects for the main respondent opinion, the discussant's opinion, and the mean perceived opinion in the residual network (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004). The directions of these effects suggest that main respondents are more likely to perceive that their discussants hold an opinion to the extent that (1) they hold the opinion themselves, (2) they perceive that their other discussants hold the opinion, and (3) the discussant actually reports holding the opinion. The dummy variables for abortion and school prayer also produce discernible effects, as well as several of the interaction variables.         "
"48","The variable impact of the discussant's self‐reported opinion on the main respondent's perception is particularly important to the analysis, and the pattern of interaction effects for the discussant opinion produces a pattern of effects in which larger coefficients are correlated with the standard deviation for the opinions in the sample. In Part A of Figure 2, the estimates in the first model of Table 3 are used to consider the magnitude of the effect due to the discussant's opinion on the probability that the main respondent perceives the discussant to hold either a four or a five on the relevant opinion scale. The figure shows that the discussant's self‐reported opinion is most influential with respect to abortion—the opinion with the highest standard deviation in the sample; and it is least influential with respect to equal rights for women—the opinion with the lowest standard deviation in the sample.         "
"49","                 The Effect of the Discussant's Self‐Reported Opinion on the Main Respondent's Perception of the Discussant's Opinion, by Particular Issues and by the Standard Deviation of the Issue Opinions in the Entire Sample                            Note: The vertical axis is the probability that the main respondent perceives the discussant to hold either a four or a five on the opinion scale.Source: Part A is based on the first model's coefficient estimates in Table 3, and Part B is based on the second model's coefficient estimates in Table 3.                     "
"50","These results are reinforced in the second model of Table 3 by estimating an ordered logit model in which each of the three effects—the effects due to self‐reported respondent opinion, the self‐reported discussant opinion, and mean perceived opinion in the residual network—is contingent on the standard deviation of the opinion in the sample. As these results show, the contingent effect—measured as the interaction with the standard deviation of the opinion in the sample—is only discernible for the discussant's self‐reported opinion.         "
"51","Part B of Figure 2 once again displays the probability that the respondent perceives the discussant to hold either a four or a five on the relevant opinion scale. The effect of the discussant's self‐reported opinion is contingent on the standard deviation of the opinion in the sample, and these results closely mirror Figure 2A. The standard deviation of the opinions in the figure, from low to high, are held constant at the standard deviations for the opinions in the samples—women's rights, minority aid, school prayer, and abortion. And, the discussant's opinion is particularly important for the communication of the most variable opinion—abortion.8"
"52","In summary, the actual opinions of discussants become more important when the distribution of opinion is more heterogeneous in the larger population. Respondents are less able to rely on a surrounding consensus in reaching judgments regarding the opinions of others, and hence the actual opinions held by individuals become more important to these judgments.         "
"53","This final analysis addresses the consequences of dispersed opinions for communication misfires—instances in which individuals misperceive the opinions of others. The earlier analysis shows that opinion diversity affects the accessibility of perceptions regarding the opinions of others, as well as the means used to reach judgments about these opinions. Does opinion diversity also affect the accuracy with which individuals perceive the opinions?"
"54","The goal is to identify the factors that enhance and attenuate effective communication within communication networks, and thus Table 4 employs an ordered logit model to address the accuracy with which respondents perceive the opinions of discussants. Communication errors are defined as the absolute (positively signed) distances between the discussant's self‐reported opinion and the respondent's perception of the discussant's opinion. The model includes several explanatory variables—the self‐reported opinion of the discussant, the self‐reported opinion of the main respondent, the perceived opinion in the remaining network, and the interactions among these three variables. Dummy variables are also included for three of the issues, with women's rights as the excluded baseline. Finally, control variables are included for the discussants' judgments regarding the stability of their own opinions, the respondents' judgments of the frequency with which the respondent and the discussant discuss “these sorts” of issues, and the self‐reported ideological and partisan extremity of the discussant.         "
"55","The model produces discernible effects due to the respondent's opinion, the discussant's opinion, and the respondent's perception of opinion in the remainder of the network, as well as the interactions among these variables. None of the other variables produce discernible effects. The accuracy of the opinion perceptions are not differentiated across the issues. The more generalized partisan and ideological extremity of the discussants' opinions does not affect the accuracy with which they are perceived, and neither does the frequency of discussion nor the discussants' subjective assessment of their own opinion's stability."
"56","In short, all can be explained in terms of the distribution of the opinions within the dyad and the remainder of the network. At the same time, it is important to recognize that the distribution of the opinions within the dyad and within the network vary across the opinions. In particular, the standard deviation of the opinion in the sample affects the extent of disagreement between the respondent and the discussant, as well as between the discussant and the remainder of the network. And as earlier results show, the standard deviation of the opinion in the network is driven by the standard deviation of the opinion in the sample. (In results not shown here, the standard deviation of the opinion in the sample produces a substantial and statistically discernible effect on the level of disagreement within the dyad and within the network, as well as a substantial and discernible effect on the accuracy of the respondent's perception of the discussant.) Thus, it is not that the distribution of the opinion in the larger population does not matter, but rather that its effect is captured in the distribution of the opinion within the micro‐environments where communication occurs."
"57","The magnitudes of the discernible effects are shown in Figure 3. In each plot, the probability of misperception is graphed on the y‐axis, and the discussant's self‐reported opinion is graphed on the x‐axis. The three different parts of the plot correspond to mean opinions in the residual networks that are opposed, intermediate, and favorable. And each plotted line corresponds to a different main respondent opinion—oppose, intermediate, and favor. This means that, to the extent that a plotted line is horizontal, there is no effect on perceptual accuracy due to variation in the discussant's true opinion when the main respondent and the residual network opinions are held constant at those particular values. In contrast, as the plotted line becomes steeper in either a positive or negative direction, the discussant's opinion becomes increasingly important in whether or not the respondent perceives the discussant correctly.

"58","                 Predicted Probabilities of Significant Errors in Respondent Judgments Regarding the Opinions of Discussants                            Note: For purposes of this graph, a significant error is defined as a respondent judgment that is 2 or more points removed from the discussant self‐report. For example, if the discussants place themselves at “5” on the abortion rights scale, an error is defined as any respondent judgment that is less than or equal to “3.”Source: Based on estimates of Table 4.                     "
"59","What does the figure show? First, the discussant opinion has the least effect on misperception for midpoint respondent opinions in midpoint residual networks. The discussant opinion also has minimal effects on accuracy among opinionated respondents located in maximally divergent networks. Hence, there is only a minor effect due to discussant opinion for respondents who oppose an issue in residual networks that favor it, and for respondents who favor an issue in networks that oppose it. In these instances, it would appear that respondents are accustomed to encountering preferences that are different from their own, and hence they are better equipped to identify discussant opinion, regardless of what that opinion might be."
"60","Second, the discussant opinion produces a maximal effect on misperception when opinionated respondents are located in residual networks that share their opinions. Thus, one sees a substantial effect due to the discussant's opinion among respondents who favor or oppose an issue located within a residual network that similarly favors or opposes the issue. Indeed, the probability of inaccurate perception is about .1 if the respondent, the discussant, and the residual network unanimously favor or oppose the issue, but it increases to .9 if the discussant holds the opposite opinion. Assuming that each individual holds the dominant opinion works quite well when everyone agrees, but it also carries the potential to ignore divergent preferences!"
"61","In short, respondents are more likely to recognize divergent preferences accurately if they are located in heterogeneous micro‐environments, and this is another way of saying that the communication of individual opinion is most efficacious when disagreement is more common. If people seldom encounter opinions that are different from their own, they are unlikely to recognize divergent preferences when they do encounter them. Thus individuals are more likely to misperceive disagreement as agreement in relationship to environments and issues characterized by unanimity rather than discord. In this sense, conditions approaching unanimity can be seen as an obstacle to accurate communication and a catalyst for misperception.         "
"62","The analysis of this article supports the importance of opinion diversity as a factor that conditions political communication, as well as leading to less than obvious conclusions regarding the role of disagreement in the diffusion of public opinion. First, and perhaps most important, the political communication networks and micro‐environments where individuals transmit, receive, and process information about politics do not provide safe havens from the controversies that buffet the larger political environment. Issues that provoke controversies in the larger environment also provoke disagreement closer to home. While people are less likely to report frequent discussions regarding issues that are more controversial, they are also more likely to report higher levels of disagreement regarding these controversial issues within their communication networks. In short, politics is driven by conflict and disagreement, not only at the level of elites and formal institutions, but also at the level of citizens and the informal institutions of political communication that lie at the heart of democratic politics."
"63","Second, perceptions of the opinions held by others are less accessible with respect to controversial issues. An individual's judgments regarding the opinions of her associates are more likely to be automatic when a consensus has been reached in the larger environment with respect to the issue in question. Hence, people assume that their associates hold socially dominant opinions, and they respond less readily when they are asked to provide the opinions of their associates regarding controversial issues. Absent the existence of an underlying political consensus, citizens cannot assume that other individuals hold a politically normative opinion, and hence they must stop and think when asked to assess the opinions of the individual members of their communication networks."
"64","Third, dyadic communication regarding politics—the communication that occurs between two citizens—is most effective and important in the context of controversial issues. One person's perception of another individual's opinion is most affected by the reality of that individual's opinion in the context of controversial rather than consensual issues. When disagreement is a rare event, judgments regarding the opinions of individuals are frequently driven by aggregate opinion distributions and individual assessments of a perceived consensus. In contrast, little can be taken for granted when disagreement is widespread, and individuals pay greater attention to the particular messages that individuals communicate."
"65","Finally, individuals are more likely to recognize disagreeable opinions accurately when they are imbedded within politically diverse micro‐environments. To the extent that an individual is located within a micro‐environment that is perceived to be in homogeneous agreement with the individual's own opinion, the individual is less likely to recognize disagreement when he encounters it. In this way, the reality (or the perception) of a political consensus undermines the opportunity for the consensus to be disturbed by the recognition of viewpoints to the contrary (Noelle‐Neumann 1984). Indeed, perceptions of unanimity are frequently sustained by misperception—incorrect perceptions regarding the individuals whose opinions and beliefs lie beyond the boundaries of the perceived consensus.
