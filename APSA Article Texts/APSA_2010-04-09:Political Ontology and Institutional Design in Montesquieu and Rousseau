"1","The depth of Montesquieu's influence on modernity is largely unchallenged today—as has been the case virtually from the day he published the Spirit of the Laws in 1748. In early America, Montesquieu assumed the authority of an oracle. He is cited in the Federalist more than any other modern source and indeed more than classical figures such as Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and Plutarch combined. He provides both Federalists and Anti‐Federalists with some of their core arguments. His influence was arguably even greater in Europe. The Philosophes eagerly consumed his works and largely embraced his appeals to liberty and science as articles of faith. Voltaire intuitively adopted his sympathies for the English political system. Helvétius echoed his depictions of cultural diversity. Diderot was drawn to his belief in the natural sociability of human beings. And, of course, Rousseau would read him carefully—if not uncritically—throughout his career.         "
"2","The discovery of the New World was an astonishing event in modern Europe. That people had established and existed in parallel, but previously undiscovered, societies was a source of constant fascination. To be sure, the new civilizations were perceived in Europe as different and uncivilized, but this did not make them less interesting. To the contrary, it only enhanced European curiosities. Indeed, their diversity was precisely what most fascinated Westerners. This can be seen in Amerigo Vespucci's early account of Native Americans: “They live together without king, without government, and each is his own master. They marry as many wives as they please; and son co‐habits with mother, brother with sister, male cousin with female, and any man with the first woman he meets. They dissolve marriages as often as they please, and observe no sort of law with respect to them. Beyond the fact that they have no church, no religion and are not idolaters, what more can I say?” ([1502] 1966, 27). Such reports were devoured by Europeans with a kind of eagerness to be shocked.            "
"3","These accounts were just as inspirational to philosophers as they were a source of public curiosity. Locke employed them to argue against the long‐held European belief in innate ideas. Montesquieu was likewise stirred. Indeed, his earliest literary success, The Persian Letters, is in some sense an extended tribute to cultural pluralism. He describes Turkish and Muslim practices in detail—such as polygamy and radical hierarchy—and then contrasts them with European norms. At the same time, he reveals that his near‐Eastern protagonists find Western European culture to be incomprehensible. The eating of pork, the consumption of alcohol, the liberty of their women all conspire to perplex Usbek and Rica.            "
"4","While depictions of cultural diversity are employed for literary purposes in the Persian Letters, they play a more scientific role in the Spirit of the Laws. Montesquieu expends great energy in portraying the enormous differences separating civilizations across multiple continents. In his own preface, he remarks that the starting point of his treatise is the observation of “the infinite diversity of laws and mores” (SL, xliii [II: 229]). Specifically, he studies laws, mores, climate, religion, quality of soil, and even the degree of commerce. Various societies differ radically along lines that largely shocked his contemporaries.            "
"5","His first significant area of investigation is in the diversity of laws and regimes. Different societies tend toward different political institutions. The three major varieties are republics, monarchies, and despotisms. Each has its own principles. Republics are characterized by civic virtue, monarchies by honor, and despotisms by fear. Beginning in book 14, he turns his attention to climate and its role in shaping the laws. Naturally, different states have different climates. His primary focus is on the contrast between hot and cold climates. Each climate zone generates a particular set of consequences on citizens that he explores in detail. In book 18, he addresses the nature of the soil, once again, establishing a simple dichotomy. Soils can either be fertile or barren. And again, each type of soil generates myriad considerations in shaping its people and laws. Chapter 19 explores how mores or temperaments might differ from one society to another. Peoples might be sociable, vain, arrogant, lazy, trustworthy, flexible, inflexible, civil, uncivil, tranquil, passionate, fickle, etc. These temperaments or mores will vary, once again, considerably across cultures. In chapter 23, he explores the diversity in population sizes. They might range from smallish communities, like the Swiss Cantons, to the vast civilizations of Rome or China. Finally, in book 24, he describes the remarkable diversity of religions. Here he is mostly interested in the contrast between Christian and Muslim nations. All of these variables matter to Montesquieu. They become part of his science of politics."
"6","Most scholars acknowledge the presence of natural laws in Montesquieu. He proclaims in the opening of Spirit of the Laws, “the world … must have invariable laws” (SL, 1.1 [II: 232–33]). There is diversity of opinion, however, about the nature of those laws. This confusion stems from the different varieties of natural laws he employs. They include the natural laws of science, the social laws of nature, and the moral laws—with the last category subdivided into laws of preservation and immaterial moral laws.4 He is clear in describing the natural laws of science, which govern “the motion of matter” (SL, 1.1 [II: 232]). And further, there can be no question as to Montesquieu's intentions to reveal descriptive social laws akin to the laws of natural science, i.e., the social laws of nature. One of his greatest eighteenth‐century students, James Madison, said of Montesquieu that he “was in his particular science what Bacon was in universal science: He lifted the veil from the venerable errors which enslaved opinion, and pointed the way to those luminous truths of which he had but a glimpse himself” ([1792] 1999, 510). Madison read Montesquieu as a social scientist. Indeed, Montesquieu's studies laid the foundations of modern social science, as Durkheim (1960, 36–49) has argued. In this way, he differs from the simple chroniclers of new cultures, such as Vespucci. He does not merely describe the empirical facts of cultures. He seeks to understand these facts as cohering, according to principles and capable of being understood via theories. It is not enough to observe that a culture tends toward despotism. He presses forward to derive social laws from the large collection of empirical facts.            "
"7","The next level of law, the moral laws, requires a largely overlooked distinction. There are for Montesquieu the laws of preservation and the immaterial moral laws. These laws are distinct insofar as they are explicitly normative.5 The law of preservation6 possesses a minimal normative content deriving from quasi‐scientific principles. It assumes that, by nature, all people endeavor to survive. Thomas Pangle summarizes this as “nothing more than the rules of conduct which are the bare minimum necessary to preserve the existence of almost any society or league” (1972, 28).7 The law of preservation provides legislators with a minimum standard by which all potential laws must be measured. Montesquieu provides an example in his discussion of slavery. If a state is to have slaves, it must nourish and clothe them, as well as tend to them in sickness and old age (SL, 15.17 [II: 504]). That is, it must look to their preservation—and consequently its own. But the moral content here is admittedly modest. From the perspective of the law of preservation, slavery is tolerable, so long as the slaveholding society sustains itself.            "
"8","This passage concerning the treatment of slaves, however, is an aberration in his larger treatment of slavery. Generally speaking and repeatedly, he identifies it as an abomination subverting human dignity (e.g., SL, 15.1 [II: 490]). This rejection of slavery leads to an obvious question—on what grounds does he condemn this institution?8 It cannot be the natural or social laws of nature, since they are descriptive, not normative. It cannot be the law of preservation, since slaveholding societies—like the Rome that Montesquieu studied so carefully—demonstrated endurance. Nevertheless, it is worth recalling that Montesquieu insists that slavery is “not good by its nature” (SL, 15.1 [II: 490], emphasis added). Indeed, he says that the norms of slavery violate the “natural law”[droit naturel] (SL, 15.2 [II: 492]). This implies a different level of the moral laws of nature—the immaterial laws of nature.            "
"9","This mode of natural law in Montesquieu has gone largely unexamined in the literature in favor of emphasis on the law of preservation. Michael Zuckert, for example, speaks of Montesquieu's preference of ‘natural right’ over ‘natural law,’ where ‘natural right’ is equated with the laws of preservation. For Zuckert, “natural right prescribes preservation” (Zuckert 2001, 247). And to be sure, such a law exists for Montesquieu. But as Montesquieu's arguments against slavery and despotism imply, the law of preservation does not extend to all doctrines that he condemns. For this, he requires yet another law based on more substantial ontological commitments.            "
"10"," C. P. Courtney advises readers of Montesquieu to study him in intellectual context (2001, 41). This context necessarily includes a number of thinkers committed to the existence of two kinds of substance—material and immaterial. In other words, they were dualists. The most notable modern European dualist is Descartes, who separates mind and body only to stitch them back together through the pineal gland. For him, material substance is completely determined. This famously includes animals, which lack an immaterial component capable of resisting physical impulses. Human beings, by contrast, possess both material and immaterial substance. Their bodies are material; their minds are immaterial. It is the immaterial substance of the mind that, according to Descartes, makes human beings capable of resisting impulse and enables virtue or moral actions. Descartes was scarcely alone. There were movements inspired by Platonic9 immaterial ideas afoot in all corners of Western Europe, including Italy (Ficino), Prussia (Scherzer, Leibniz), England (Whichcote, More, Cudworth), and France (Descartes, Malebranche, and Lamy). These movements had been given special incentive to refashion their arguments to combat the perceived materialism of Spinoza and Hobbes. This was the battleground of eighteenth‐century metaphysics, and Montesquieu was deeply aware of its nature, dimensions, and stakes.10"
"11","Connected to this debate was another: conventionalism versus Platonism. Because the materialists had argued against immaterial substance, their political concepts had to be entirely derived from artifice. This is why Hobbes, for example, relies on contract. Human beings establish political norms by agreement. This was the birth of modern normative positivism. The dualists rejected convention as a sole source of political norms. Convention was merely another word for “arbitrariness” and paved a potential path for tyranny or despotism. It is the content of immaterial ideas, so they argued, that offers the greatest assurances against the worst governments."
"12","On Immaterial Substance Generally in Montesquieu Montesquieu was raised, so to speak, on a steady diet of modern French Platonists, such as Descartes,11 Malebranche, and Lamy. At age 11, his father sent him to the Collège de Juilly, where he would read Bernard Lamy, perhaps the most prominent student of the Platonist Nicholas Malebranche. Shackleton records that Montesquieu's library housed seven of Lamy's works (Shackleton 1961, 7). His greatest affection, however, was probably reserved for Malebranche, whom he identified as one of the “four great poets” of Western literature (Pensées, [I: 1546]).12"
"13","Textual evidence confirms that he did more than read from this tradition; he joined it. That is to say, he is a metaphysical dualist. He makes this clear in the opening of the Spirit of the Laws, where he posits, “Man, as a physical being, is governed by invariable laws like other bodies. As an intelligent being, he constantly violates the laws god has established and changes those he himself establishes” (SL, 1.1 [II: 234]).13 According to Montesquieu, human beings themselves partake in two categories of substance—material and immaterial. They are material insofar as they are influenced and sometimes determined by natural laws of science. They are immaterial as they actively resist those in favor of the moral law.               "
"14","Perhaps nowhere is Montesquieu's commitment to immaterial substance more evident than in his rejection of “Spinozism.” His early lost work, Traité des devoirs, reportedly began with a rejection of Spinozistic determinism, followed by an extensive refutation of Spinoza and Hobbes (Shackleton 1961, 71). In similar spirit, he remarks in his Pensées that               "
"15","                                    "
"16","… a great genius [Spinoza] promises that I will die like an insect. He seeks to flatter me with the idea that I am merely a modification of matter. He employs a geometrical order and some reasons, which are said to be forceful and which I have found very obscure, in order to elevate my soul to the dignity of my body, and en lieu of the immense space that embraces my spirit, he gives to my material body a space of four or five feet in the universe. (P, [I: 1138])                     "
"17","Indeed, Montesquieu was deeply offended when early readers of the Spirit of the Laws mistook his exposition of physical and social laws for Spinozistic materialism. Thus the very first task of his Défense de l'esprit des lois is to defuse this misconception. He defiantly rejects that he (i.e., Montesquieu) is “a Spinozist,” since he “in the first article of his book distinguished the material from the spiritual world” (DSL, [II: 1121]).14 In other words, Montesquieu points out that his first order of business in Spirit was utterly anti‐Spinozist. Although this accusation of Spinozism was not uncommon, Montesquieu was steadfast in his denial. Of course, skeptical readers today might doubt his explicit rejections of materialism as mere esotericism.15 But his rejection of Spinoza extends to the main text of l'Esprit, the very title of which evokes immaterial substance. In l'Esprit, he claims that although people of certain climates tend to be inactive, their legislators should work to activate their citizens—namely, they can inspire citizens to act counter to nature through their free will (SL, 14.5 [II: 479–80]). Durkheim (1960, 44–49; see Waddicor 1970, 18) confesses that such admissions render Montesquieu a metaphysical dualist and an advocate of free will, even at the expense of a coherent science. That is to say, for Durkheim, Montesquieu wants to preserve the immaterial will even if it threatens the immutability of his social laws. Isaiah Berlin comments, “It is to the eternal credit of Montesquieu that he committed this very crime” (1977, 150). This raises the thorny question of whether Montesquieu can reconcile his belief in freedom with the physical and social laws of nature as they operate on human beings. Durkheim denies he can. Nevertheless, Montesquieu's resolution of this tension is relatively straightforward. He says that “laws of nature” apply to human beings, but that they are free to deviate from them. To be sure, Durkheim is right to question whether these are then the “invariable laws” that he claims them to be. It might be more instructive to read these as “invariable tendencies,” which can then be resisted by free will.16 Indeed, Montesquieu's science may be endangered by his metaphysical assumptions—but this cost was scarcely as important to him as human agency. This agency based on an immaterial soul, in turn, was necessary for Montesquieu's normative foundations (Masterson 1981, 210–16). Morality required choice—and choice required escaping the laws of determinacy. This inspires his appeals to the immaterial realm. To be sure, Berlin gets this right about Montesquieu. This reading of Montesquieu, however, is only a partial truth. This is because Berlin, as I argue in §4, conflates two different political ontologies presupposing such truths—determinate and indeterminate.               "
"18","Justice as Immaterial and Transcendent in Montesquieu Recognizing Montesquieu's embrace of immaterial substance facilitates understanding his larger conception of justice. This is most evident in the 83rd Persian Letter where Montesquieu distinguishes justice from material phenomena. Contrary to Hobbesian and Spinozist conceptions, Usbek separates justice from self‐interest. Self‐interest and the passions are frequently at odds with justice—they are not its source.17 Indeed, epistemic access to justice is only possible when those interests and passions have been sufficiently silenced (PL, 140 [I: 256]). He presses forward to suggest that not even God is capable of altering the substantive content of justice. Following the Platonist Leibniz, “Assuming that he [God] perceives justice, it is necessary that he follow it” (PL, 140 [I: 256]).18 It is for these reasons, Usbek concludes, “justice is eternal and independent of human conventions” (PL, 140 [I: 257]). The independence from convention is especially important, as it is the crucial ontological feature of justice that distanced him from Hobbes and Spinoza. For them, justice was by definition a matter of human convention.19"
"19","This conception of justice finds its way into the first chapter of Spirit of the Laws:               "
"20","                                    "
"21","Particular intelligent beings can have laws that they have made, but they also have some that they have not made. Before there were intelligent beings, they were possible; therefore, they had possible relations and consequently possible laws. Before laws were made, there were possible relations of justice. To say that there is nothing just or unjust but what positive laws ordain or prohibit is to say that before a circle was drawn, all its radii were not equal. (SL, 1.1 [II: 233])                     "
"22","One might be tempted in the geometric model to equate Montesquieu with Hobbes. But Patrick Riley correctly asserts the opposite: “This assimilation of moral‐legal relations to relations of size in mathematics and geometry is entirely Malebranchian (as well as Platonic, Augustinian, and Leibnizian)” (Riley 1986, 170). The common denominator is a commitment to Platonism, as Malebranche, Augustine, and Leibniz were all staunch Platonists—and the core ontological feature of the idea of Platonic justice is its independence from convention. The difference between Hobbes and Montesquieu is significant. For Hobbes, geometry is a method employed to generate his laws of nature. But it does not imply the existence of a separate plane of reality, which he altogether denies. For Montesquieu, geometry is an analogy. The laws of geometry are eternally true—just as are the laws of justice. The laws of geometry themselves do not generate justice, since justice itself exists as an independent substantive idea.               "
"23","This conception of eternal justice underlies Montesquieu's judgments of political practices and institutions. His objection to slavery in this regard has already been addressed. His distaste for despotism also deserves attention. As Sharon Krause has remarked, “while readers may disagree about which regime Montesquieu prefers, there can be no doubt as to which one he most despises” (2001, 231; see also Zuckert 2001, 247; MacDonald 2003, 114). Montesquieu famously expresses his dissatisfaction with despotism as a regime type, even as he describes its optimal machinations from a pragmatic perspective. Consider just some of his judgments. Ruling primarily through fear, despotism reduces human beings to “beasts” (DSL, 3.10 [II: 260]). The despotic practice of torture has “the voice of nature crying out [in protest] against me” (SL, 6.17 [II: 329]). Under despotism “human nature would suffer” (SL, 8.8 [II: 356]).               "
"24","Such judgments cannot issue merely from his law of preservation. Montesquieu is too astute a student of world history to ignore that despotism has often sustained itself as long as, if not sometimes longer than, the most admirable republics. Fear—the primary engine of despotic regimes—is a reliable and effective tool. Indeed, this is why Hobbes found it an attractive alternative to appeals to civic virtue. Its materiality was neither epistemically suspect nor practically unreliable. Montesquieu understands this and describes the operations of despotism in a way compatible with a modern materialism. It is only in his judgments of the regime type that readers can appreciate his greater sympathy for Malebranche, Lamy, Leibniz, and Plato over Hobbes and Spinoza. In comprehending this normative element of Montesquieu, it seems necessary to move beyond the law of preservation into the realm of the moral laws of nature that affirm human dignity and a law beyond convention."
"25","As already suggested, Rousseau was familiar with Montesquieu's work. He was employed in 1748–49 by Claude and Louise‐Marie‐Madeleine Dupin as a research secretary for their attack against the Spirit of the Laws (Cranston 1982, 213–15; Shackleton 1961, 358). This took fruit ultimately in two works, the Réflexions sur quelques parties d'un intitulé and the Observations sur un livre intitulé de l'esprit des lois. But although Rousseau might have gained an intimate acquaintance with Montesquieu's text while in the Dupins' employment, Cranston argues, “It is inconceivable that Rousseau can have sympathized with the main line of the Dupin's thesis. … Indeed we cannot doubt that Rousseau was in far greater agreement with the views of Montesquieu than with those of his bourgeois critics” (1982, 214). And while he could not side with Montesquieu on all points, the following pages reveal crucial elements that he would borrow and develop in order to shape his approach to institution design and legislation.         "
"26","Though Rousseau has been painted by some to be an inflexible absolutist (e.g., Berlin 2002), his texts reveal a striking attention to matters of context, practical detail, and accommodation. His appropriation from Montesquieu is apparent and occasionally explicit. In one of his earliest works, he confesses, “With respect to political establishments, time and place are all‐important” (O, 51 [III: 56–57]). In book 3, chapter 8 of the Social Contract, for example, he observes, “Freedom, not being a fruit of every Clime, is not within the reach of every people. The more one meditates on this principle established by Montesquieu, the more one senses its truth” (SC, 100 [III: 414]). Elsewhere, he explains how societies are affected by their climate, soil, natural resources, and the size and temperament of their people. Each variable matters in identifying its appropriate government. For Rousseau, there is no answer to the question, “What is the best form of government?” because “each one of them is the best in some cases, and the worst in others” (SC, 90 [III: 403]). There is a time and a place for democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy (though—tellingly—never one for despotism). This makes it necessary to investigate regional circumstances with great care. In writing his proposal for constitutional reform in Poland, he insists on a “full knowledge of local conditions and particular details which … [one] needs to know in order to conform an institution to the people for whom it is intended” (GP, 177 [III: 953]). The science of legislation depends on knowledge of local circumstances and careful consideration of their effects, just as Montesquieu had implied.            "
"27","Like Montesquieu, Rousseau recognizes multiple types of “natural laws.” To be sure, this includes recognition of the scientific laws of nature. Human beings have one foot firmly in the causal material world—and are to some extent determined by scientific laws, whether social or physical. This was to be the subject of his unwritten book La materialisme du sage. While he never wrote it, he outlined its principles in the Confessions:            "
"28","                              "
"29","Climates, seasons, sounds, colors, darkness, light, the elements, food, noise, silence, motion, rest, all act on our machine and consequently on our soul, all offer us a thousand almost guaranteed holds for governing in their origin the feelings by which we let ourselves be dominated. Such was the fundamental idea for the outline for which I already had on paper, and from which I hoped for an all the more certain effect on well‐disposed people who, while they sincerely love virtue, mistrust their weakness, since it appeared easy to me to write a book out of it that would be as pleasant to read as it was to compose. Nevertheless, I worked very little on this work whose title was sensitive morality, or the Wise Man's materialism. (C, 343–44 [I: 409])                  "
"30","This reflects principles present in Montesquieu, who likewise read human beings as subject to myriad material forces (SL, 14.1–2 [II: 474–77]). In light of his interest in Montesquieu and the ambitions for his legislator, it is easy to understand how this work might have fit into Rousseau's corpus. Rousseau also expresses great enthusiasm for the new science: “Science in itself is very good, that is obvious; and would have to have taken leave of good sense, to maintain the contrary” (O, 33 [III: 36]). It has uncovered the workings of nature and has in this task performed a great service to humankind.            "
"31","It would be mistaken, however, to assume on the basis of such passages that Rousseau's conception of justice or natural law was exclusively attached to science. These laws are purely descriptive—and Rousseau is a moralist. His works are infused with normativity. The remaining question concerns the source of his judgments. He suggests in the Emile that it is nothing other than the “immortal and celestial voice” of conscience—which he defines as “an innate principle of justice” (E, 290 [IV: 600]; 289 [IV: 598]). This standard provides knowledge of the difference between right and wrong and the ability to judge.            "
"32","On Immaterial Ideas Generally in Rousseau Like Montesquieu, Rousseau also imbibed a heavy diet of modern European Platonism. He was a sympathetic student of Malebranche and Lamy, reading Malebranche carefully; and of Lamy he “read it [the Entretiens] and reread it a hundred times; I resolved to make it my guide” (C, 194 [I: 232]). He further identified Malebranche as one of the great true philosophers (Williams 2007a, 52). He was also in large part sympathetic to Leibniz.20 It is thus unsurprising that their doctrines would find their way into both his metaphysics and politics.21"
"33","There is much textual evidence suggesting his sympathies to—if not enthusiasm for—the existence of immaterial substance, side‐by‐side with a material realm. In other words, he is a dualist. This is most evident in his Letter to Beaumont.               "
"34","                                    "
"35","Man is not a simple being. He is composed of two substances. While everyone does not agree on that, you and I do, and I have tried to prove it to others. Once that is proved, the love of self is no longer a simple passion. But it has two principles, namely the intelligent being and the sensitive being, the well‐being of which is not the same. The appetite of the senses conduces to the well‐being of the body, and the love of order to that of the soul. The latter love, developed and made active, bears the name of conscience. (Beaumont, 28 [IV: 936])22"
"36","Rousseau outlines two varieties of substance—material and immaterial.23 Human beings have a foot in each. This doctrine of dualism stems back to Plato24 and is subsequently voiced by Montesquieu.25"
"37","The rejection of substance monism—specifically materialism26—is most notably depicted in the “Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar.”27 Each article of faith within the “Profession” is aimed at debunking the materialist philosophy of the Philosophes. Among other conclusions generated in the labyrinth of this passage include the belief in an immaterial god, a belief in an immaterial component of human nature capable of generating acts of free will, and the existence of an immaterial soul that survives the body. Each component of the doctrine assumes immaterial substance. Most importantly for immediate purposes, the freedom of the individual—made possible by freedom from physical laws of determinism—is necessary for the possibility of virtue. That is to say, the doctrines of the vicar are aimed at creating a realm for moral behavior—behavior ultimately judged by the conscience.               "
"38","Finally, it is important to contrast Rousseau's admission of material impulses—such as in his planned Materialism of the Sage—with his firm insistence that such impulses can be resisted by a free and immaterial will:               "
"39","                                    "
"40","How can you fail to be sensible [to the fact] that this same law of necessity which, according to you, alone regulates how the world and all events proceed, also regulates all the actions of men, all the thoughts in their heads, all the sentiments of hearts, that nothing is free, that all is force, necessary, inevitable; that all the movements of man, directed by blind matter, depend on his will only because his will itself depends on necessity? … For all your arguments, your honest heart protests against your sad philosophy. You are sensible to the sentiment of freedom, to the charm of virtue in spite of yourself, and this is how on all sides this forceful and salutary voice of the internal sentiment recalls everyone. (F, 284 [IV: 1145])28"
"41","While Rousseau acknowledges extended substance's role in shaping human behavior, the essence of human freedom—the necessary condition for morality itself in his view—is resistance against this very force. He elaborates in the Reveries that there is no virtue in “following our [material] inclinations. … [V]irtue consists in overcoming them when duty commands in order to do what duty prescribes” (R, 77 [I: 1052–53]). For Rousseau, like Montesquieu, there is a separate immaterial realm coexisting with the material serving as the essential prerequisite for human freedom and hence moral behavior.               "
"42","On Justice as Immaterial and Transcendent Rousseau's rejection of materialism is ultimately central to his politics. This is because the idea of justice itself can only attain status as eternal or transcendent if it stands above convention. Short of this, one is reduced to seeking justice in the right of the strongest, the arbitrary rule of a supposed royal descendent of Adam, or a mighty unconstrained leviathan. Book I of the SC is dedicated to rejecting a series of such attempts—that is, of grounding justice and political society itself on nontranscendent or radically indeterminate foundations. This is the underlying flaw uniting the failed attempts of Grotius, Hobbes, Pufendorf, and Burlamaqui. Their approaches all result, for Rousseau, in an unconstrained or absolute sovereign. This is the formula for despotism. The laws issuing from such systems may take any content whatsoever.29 And where such license is granted to governments, for Rousseau, they rarely miss the opportunity to abuse their authority. The “fallen” quality of human nature makes this a virtual certainty.               "
"43","The view that Rousseau's metaphysics is crucial to his politics has been challenged by Roger Masters in his “detachability” thesis. Masters argues that while Rousseau sincerely believed in immaterial ideas, these ideas were ultimately unrelated to his politics. For Masters, Rousseau's politics hold more in common with Hobbes than with Malebranche, Leibniz, or Plato. Nevertheless, there is much evidence to suggest the contrary. Rousseau frequently appeals to justice as eternal or transcendent—as free from contingency. Its content does vary from time to time or place to place. In the Emile, he speaks of an “eternal justice” (E, 292 [IV: 603]) and of “eternal laws of nature and order” (E, 473 [IV: 857]) that inform the properly educated citizen—that is, the uncorrupted citizen, the one who is free from evil.30 He does not mean this, however, to be merely a personal standard. There is ample evidence to suggest that he meant to incorporate such principles into his politics. Employing Montesquieu's vocabulary from the 83rd Persian Letter, he asserts, “What is good … is so by the nature of things and independently of human convention. … No doubt there is a universal justice emanating from reason alone” (SC, 66 [IV: 378]).31 He confirms this in his defense of the Social Contract—one must be certain of any social contract that “it has nothing contrary to the natural Laws” (LWM, 231 [III: 807]). Thus not only does Rousseau appear to embrace an eternal law of justice—but he also suggests that it is an indispensable standard guiding the social contract itself.               "
"44","This standard of justice retains relevance in the state as informing the general will. For Rousseau, the general will—the fountain of all laws—is linked to his conception of justice: “[O]ne need only be just in order to be sure of following the general will” (PE, 12 [III: 251]). Later, he insists, “The first and greatest public interest is always justice. All wish the conditions to be equal for all, and justice is nothing but this equality” (LWM, 301 [III: 891]).32 Thus not only does Rousseau have a transcendent standard of justice, but he also intends it to guide his politics.               "
"45","Although I have argued that both Montesquieu and Rousseau embrace transcendent norms, not all such norms are created equal. It would be useful to distinguish the types of conditions governing institutional design, and how these apply ultimately to the two principal thinkers considered. When designing institutions, the choice of regimes may be either constrained or unconstrained.33 Unconstrained institutional design implies the absence of limits or restrictions on the choice of regime types. In fact, to fit this category, the choice would have to be almost perfectly arbitrary. Perhaps the exemplar would be Thrasymachus, for whom justice is whatever the strongest desires. There are no substantive constraints whatsoever on the sovereign's choice of laws or institutions.         "
"46","Constrained institutional design, by contrast, implies the existence of limiting factors governing the choice of particular regime types. But constrained institutional design can be of three varieties. First is positive constraint, where there are conditions governing regime choice, but these conditions make no reference to any higher source than positive laws, norms, cultural standards, or individual choice. Such constraint can be found in John Rawls's theory of justice. Rawls argues that justice as fairness prioritizes liberty and equality—not because these principles are valuable in themselves, but because they are embedded in Western culture (1993, 8, 14). So presumably, a Rawlsian theory of justice would operate with an entirely different set of constraints in cultures with different values. That is, his conception of constraint is entirely relative to particular cultures. A similar philosophy can be found in many legal positivists, such as Hans Kelsen and H. L. A. Hart. Kelsen held that valid legal norms are merely those “accepted as valid” ([1934] 1967, 4), regardless of content. Such programs are necessarily “enchained to cultural relativism” (Seung 1993, 44), which has the problem of not permitting the type of criticism that many political critics desire. From the vantage point of positive constraint, only internal critiques are possible. One may not criticize a regime for championing the subjugation of women, for example, if it is consistent with the stated values of that culture. As Kelsen himself confesses, his system places no constraints that could reject the legitimacy of concentration camps ([1934] 1967, 40).         "
"47","Those uneasy with the limited constraints of the first two options have appealed to the second and third variants of constrained institutional design: the two varieties of transcendent constraint. Both reject positive constraint insofar as it abnegates the possibility of external critiques, and instead insist that some values are universal, eternal, and must be embodied in the choice of regimes. As such, they both appeal to those immaterial transcendent norms found in Montesquieu and Rousseau. But they differ in their details. Determinate transcendent constraint holds that the values are quite specific. In particular, those holding this view are likely to promote one regime type or set of laws as universally valid. This ontology is often expressed either by specific rules or commitments to particular institutions. One can find this kind of view in Condorcet, who argued, “A good law should be good for all men, just as a true proposition is true for all” ([1819] 2001, 58). Another expositor might be Robert Filmer, who argues for the “natural right of regal power” in his unconditional defense of absolute monarchy ([1635–42] 1991, 11). On this approach, the relative circumstances of peoples and places do not matter. Good laws or institutions do not vary according to conditions. Once one has determined the magic formula, it is valid for all times and places.         "
"48","As with determinate transcendent constraint, indeterminate transcendent constraint asserts certain universal political truths. The difference resides in the degree of determinacy in those truths. Whereas practitioners of determinate transcendent constraint often hold them to be determinate down to specific positive laws and institutions, indeterminate transcendent constraint shuns such specifics. Rather than expressing its truths as specific laws and institutions, it emphasizes principles such as “justice,”“liberty,” or “equality.” As is clear in the terms employed here, indeterminate transcendent constraint is expressed more in principles than in rules or particular sets of institutions. These principles embody a vagueness, to be sure. And for many proponents of determinate transcendent constraint, this will seem a liability. But this indeterminacy has a genuine virtue—that of adaptability and flexibility. Specifically, the realization of these principles can only take place with the kind of contextual knowledge required by both Montesquieu and Rousseau.         "
"49","This abstract point of metaphysics applied to politics might be rendered clearer via an analogy, as described by T. K. Seung."
"50","                        "
"51","Suppose you are stranded on a deserted island and that you are starving for food. Your goal is to obtain some food. But there are many ways to fulfill this goal. You can catch some fish, find some fruit, or roast some worms. Since these methods are specific, your goal can be called general. The relation between an end and its means is the relation between general and particular. Hence generality is as important a feature in making a choice as it is in processing information. For this reason, Plato thought that the Form of the Good was the highest principle of choice. Whatever goal you may undertake and whatever means you may adopt for the execution of your goal, you must evaluate your choice in reference to this highest principle of choice. Hence every choice is a descent from this highest principle to a concrete action. (2007, 123–24)"
"52","The islander's desire to eat and Plato's conception of the Good operate in the same way as Rousseau's idea of justice. While the means will shift according to the available resources—including the very resourcefulness of the individuals seeking their goals—the goal remains the standard or principle directing those actions."
"53","Such reflections apply to institutional choices or regime design, as practiced with indeterminate transcendent constraint. As circumstances differ from one culture to another, there can be no determinate set of principles applying to all. Any set of prescriptions must necessarily take into account the peculiar circumstances of that political moment—such as topography, proximity to other societies, history, religion, economic circumstances, and the character of its people. But there nevertheless are measures by which one can judge institutions better or worse. This is the important difference between unconstrained institutional design and indeterminate transcendent constraint. Both reject a preexisting set of determinate rules. But whereas the former offers no basis to judge superior and inferior regimes, the latter emphatically insists upon it."
"54","Both Montesquieu and Rousseau—in slightly different fashions—employ indeterminate transcendent constraint in addressing the problem of institutional design. The presence of indeterminate norms in Montesquieu has been alluded to in the literature. As Sara MacDonald has observed, “Montesquieu draws a faint outline of justice” (2003, 111). Mark Hulliung likewise describes Montesquieu as employing an “abstract and shadowy notion of justice” (1976, 113). Although “shadowy,” his indeterminate standard of justice frequently manifests itself. In order to make more concrete an idea that is opaque by nature, it is instructive to isolate negative implementations of his concept of justice. This includes his condemnations of slavery and despotism, which clearly violate his broadest principles of political justice. The negative operations of justice can also be seen in his condemnation of war pursued to settle private scores (PL, Letter 95). Additionally, he characterizes the behavior of the Troglodytes in their decadent stage as generally unjust (PL, Letter 12, 13).            "
"55","More usefully, there are also elements of a positive conception of justice in Montesquieu—though they are more scarce. In the Persian Letters, Usbek writes, “Justice is the proper relationship actually existing between two things” (PL, Letter 83). In Spirit, Montesquieu comments on the justice of the Athenian system of taxation that was based partly on proportions of wealth, partly on the needs of citizens—and an unjust one would be strictly proportional, such that even the poorest citizens would be required to hand over their property to the common treasury (SL, 13.7). This is evident, for example, in his citing of Solon:            "
"56","                              "
"57","Solon was asked if the laws he had given to the Athenians were the best; “I have given them the best laws they could endure,” he replied: this is a fine speech that should be heard by all legislators. When the divine wisdom said to the Jewish people, “I have given you precepts that are not good,” this only meant that the precepts were only relatively good, which sponges away all the difficulties one can propose about the Mosaic laws. (SL, 19.21 [II: 571])                  "
"58","This illustrates Montesquieu's contextualization—the fact that justice demands different laws for different peoples. Had the Athenians been a more virtuous people, they might have been able to accept a different or more demanding set of laws. Or more likely, the relative virtue of a people eliminates the need for multiplying laws, as Montesquieu cites with the Romans, who had no need of laws prohibiting embezzlement when their mores were “pure” (SL, 19.23 [II: 571]).            "
"59","Perhaps the most concrete element of Montesquieu's conception of justice resides in his enthusiasm for liberty. Sara MacDonald has argued that Montesquieu's embrace of free will as a metaphysical principle led to his championing of those regimes that are most “conducive to human freedom” (2003, 113). His umbrella definition of “liberty” is distinguished by virtue of “having the power to do what one should want to do and in no way being constrained to do what one should not want to do” (SL, 11.3 [II: 395]). This definition expresses both the extent and the limits of determinacy in his conception of justice, such as it is. To be sure, Montesquieu clearly links up his conception of liberty with normativity. “Liberty” is doing what citizens should do. But he carefully avoids laying down precise guidelines for what should be done.            "
"60","This conception of liberty provides genuine substance to his normative constraints on regime design. Specifically, he emphasizes, “liberty is found only in moderate governments” (SL, 11.3 [II: 394]). So although Montesquieu often describes the operations of immoderate governments (such as tyranny), readers can safely assume that insofar as he embraces liberty, he effectively rules them out with this normative principle. It is this emphasis on liberty that also leads Montesquieu to sympathetically sketch the British parliamentary system, since liberty is only present when power is not abused. The parliamentary system of checks and balances is designed precisely to thwart the tendency of human nature to grab more power than is consistent with widely shared political liberties. This assessment also makes good sense in light of Montesquieu's repeated assertions of human dignity in the face of slavery and despotism—those institutions most fundamentally opposed to freedom.            "
"61","This reading of justice as liberty informs Montesquieu's exploration of regime types. He is explicit in identifying “moderate” forms of government as more conducive to liberty than despotic ones (SL, 2.10 [II: 259–61]). At the same time, however, there is no reason to assume that only one set of institutions will satisfy the objective of securing justice, or at least avoid despotism. Indeed, Montesquieu suggests the opposite: that there are some circumstances that call for democracy, others that call for aristocracy, and yet others that demand monarchy. Different regime types thrive and fail under different conditions. Democracy, for example, thrives in the absence of luxury and greater economic equality (SL, 7.2 [II: 334–35]), whereas aristocracy and monarchy can better tolerate luxury and unequal wealth distribution.            "
"62","This being said, there may be general tendencies that—conditions being equal—would suggest that some institutional arrangements are best. Monarchies, for example, do a better job of securing liberty than despotisms, at least where the princes rule justly. But as the greatest point of honor in a monarchy is obedience to the prince, this liberty is certainly less than what might be found in a well‐functioning republic. To this extent, commentators have frequently identified republics or commercial societies to be far more to Montesquieu's taste—insofar as they work to promote that liberty present but muted in monarchies. But liberty, too, has its limits. This is why, I suggest, Montesquieu—to his credit—never advocates one regime type as universally superior. A poorly functioning republic or commercial society can easily have too much liberty. That is to say, liberty in a democracy, for example, can devolve into license (SL, 8.2 [II: 350]); and where this occurs, one might reasonably prefer a well‐functioning monarchy. This flexibility is a great advantage of Montesquieu's approach.            "
"63","Two problems burden Montesquieu's execution. The first is his lack of clarity. To be sure, one cannot even be sure whether these principles were entirely explicit in his own mind when writing the Spirit of the Laws. This is because the work is so overwhelmingly empirical. This is not a flaw insofar as it is read as political sociology. But it makes the work more difficult to read normatively. This dominant sociological tone has long confused the text's readers about his ultimate prescriptions and has led some to the conclusion that he had none. Montesquieu's occasional entertaining of institutions he ultimately condemns—such as slavery and despotism—only adds to this confusion. This reaction to l'Esprit is embodied in Rousseau's own reading of the text: “He was content to discuss the positive right of established governments, and nothing in the world is more different than these two studies” (E, 458 [IV: 836]). This is partly fair and partially unfair to Montesquieu. It is unfair insofar as we have uncovered a normative dimension informing his condemnations of slavery and despotism. It is nevertheless true, however, that these condemnations are more scattered than systematic. Montesquieu's moral judgments are almost offered as diversions from his social science in a fashion that arguably parallels much contemporary social science. Montesquieu's rigorous empirical analysis is accompanied by frequent implicit value judgments. But without a more explicit normative grounding, the reader is occasionally left wondering about his normative lessons. And indeed, his curiosity about the operations of the empirical world often obscures some of his most fundamental normative dispositions. While he condemns slavery and despotism, for example, he proceeds to explain how they might function most efficiently. It is this kind of equivocation in the Spirit of the Laws that most irks Rousseau. Once Rousseau has condemned slavery and despotism, by contrast, he is done with them.34 There is little utility in elaborating on the efficient use of unjust regimes or practices.            "
"64","A second problem is that his principle of liberty, which might well serve as his highest principle, suffers from perhaps insufficient determinacy. As readers of the tradition of political thought can confirm, liberty can mean radically different things to different people. Montesquieu does provide a definition, but he does not make clear just how far this liberty is to be taken. He acknowledges that liberty can be extended too far into the realm of license, but he does not clarify what other principle(s) might effectively constrain liberty. On this point also, Rousseau's developments may be of some use."
"65","Rousseau at first appears similarly vague in his statements of his highest normative principles. Collecting his many references to his transcendent conception of justice, however, one can derive some features. It tends toward equality (LWM, 301 [III: 891]); it is intimately connected to civil liberty (LWM, 261 [IV: 842]); it is inseparable from goodness (E, 282 [IV: 588]); it is the “love of order which preserves order” (E, 282 [IV: 589]); it is giving to each what is theirs (E, 285 [IV: 594]); it is the “truth of things” (R, 47 [I: 1028]). If one reads the general will as having similar content to justice,35 it would also include peace and fraternity (SC, 121 [III: 437]). None of these passages are precise in their sketching of justice. Certainly there is nothing here so concrete as Locke's laws of nature. As with Montesquieu, a useful starting point is sketching what justice is not. Justice is clearly not all of those variants of society described in book 1, chapters 2–4 of the Social Contract. It is neither force, tranquility, convention, slavery, nor inherited titles. That is to say, it cannot be anything like the mere peace and order promised by Grotius, Filmer, and Hobbes. As Shklar summarizes Rousseau, “The just society is evidently a society without subjection” (1969, 182). The negative function of justice laid out in the early chapters of the Social Contract along with the positive conceptions discussed elsewhere get us as close as we can come to a definition. His understanding of justice has content, even if it is indeterminate. This, combined with the transcendence described earlier, identifies Rousseau as employing indeterminate transcendent constraint.            "
"66","This blending of transcendent constraint with indeterminate principles is embodied in countless passages from his corpus. For example: “[T]he question, which is absolutely the best Government, does not admit to a solution because it is indeterminate: or, if you prefer, it has as many good solutions as there are possible combinations in the absolute and the relative positions of peoples” (SC, 104–5 [III: 419]). Such excerpts imply two things. First, Rousseau follows Montesquieu in acknowledging the diversity of political circumstances. Second, he still insists on an a priori standard by which to judge each particular government. All one has to do is to examine the circumstances. A democracy, for example, is good—but only contingently so. It can only thrive in a small territory with simple morals, equality of ranks, and no luxury (SC, 91 [III: 405]). Under these conditions, it would be an effective and just form of government. Absent these conditions, it is potentially dangerous and despotic. Likewise, an aristocracy can thrive in a middle‐sized territory, moderation amongst the wealthy, and contentment among the poor (SC, 93–94 [III: 407–8]). Where these conditions are lacking, the state is unlikely to be just.            "
"67","Although the characteristics of a state should vary according to its circumstances, the point here is that there are right answers for Rousseau. By requiring that different circumstances demand different institutions, he reveals his constraining standards. There are better and worse applications of justice in any given context. In order to serve justice well, however, one must truly know those circumstances. It is for this reason that he insists on a detailed knowledge of the state. In this context, it is easy to understand why it is that Rousseau opens his Government of Poland with this caveat: “A good institution for Poland can only be the work of the Poles or of someone who has studied the Polish nation and its neighbors first hand. A foreigner can contribute scarcely any but general views” (GP, 177 [III: 953]). The point is that Rousseau has a standard of “good” institutions that can only be realized with a detailed knowledge of local conditions.36 His indeterminate standard of justice thrives on this kind of knowledge. Without empirical knowledge, the indeterminate standard is nearly useless.            "
"68","Although indeterminate, Rousseau's principles have more determinacy than Montesquieu's. Most notably, Rousseau balances his commitment to liberty with simultaneous attachments to equality and order. This suggests a more explicit weighing of principles in Rousseau—and suggests how and why certain kinds of liberty might be limited. Whereas Montesquieu is concerned that liberty might devolve into license, he does not make explicit his principles of where to draw the line. By contrast, Rousseau's multiple principles offer more clarity to such constraints. This can be seen, for example, in his limiting of property rights. Although the property ownership is among “the most sacred of all the rights of citizens” (PE, 23 [III: 263]), it must be balanced by equality, a principle emphasized in the last paragraph of his discussion of private property in the Social Contract. Rousseau punctuates this discussion of the “sacred” right of property that without due consideration to a robust conception of equality, liberty and equality are “only apparent and illusory” (SC, 56 [III: 367]). As such, the right of property remains “subordinate to the right the community has over everyone” (SC, 56 [III: 367]). This balancing is typical of Rousseau's approach and suggests greater determinacy of principles than is found generally in Montesquieu.            "
"69","The virtues of Montesquieu and Rousseau's approach emerge in comparison with other options. It is worth briefly comparing it with the other ontologies raised earlier. Scarcely anyone explicitly advocates unconstrained institutional design, and this is for good reason. It leaves all options on the table—including those practices explicitly condemned by Montesquieu and Rousseau: slavery and despotism. Positive constraint has more advocates, but much the same difficulty. Consider Rawls, for example. Although Rawls's two principles resemble the Enlightenment values embraced by Rousseau, this commitment is contingent. He only prioritizes liberty and equality because they are embedded in his own particular culture, as he acknowledges. Presumably, different cultures would have to generate their own procedures based on their own principles. So if a political community embraced the subjugation of women, radical inequality, or torture, those values would factor in the foundation of its particular account of justice. Rawls's mature theory suggests no higher principles to suggest otherwise."
"70","It is precisely these concerns that have led many to seek more substantial footing for their political theories. Speaking in terms of political ontology, determinate and indeterminate transcendent constraint represent the two available options. I argue that confusion about these different approaches explains Berlin's error. Berlin derives his “contradiction” from a false assumption about political ontology. He has assumed that the only form of transcendent constraint is determinate—that if one believes in transcendent principles, those principles must be precise and realized with uniformity throughout all cultures and conditions. But if my analysis is right, Montesquieu and Rousseau point to a more promising approach with obvious appeals in a world where new constitutions are being drafted and tested. Those who might suggest that the regular rules of democracy and liberalism, on the one hand, or theocracy, on the other, should work everywhere will be undoubtedly frustrated for all the reasons that one might guess from a careful study of Montesquieu and Rousseau. One cannot assume that a modified democracy should work in Iraq, for example, simply because many believe it to work well in the secular West."
"71","The fear in abandoning such absolutism is the potential relapse to relativism. But if Montesquieu and Rousseau are right, one need not retreat to relativism in questioning the universal applicability of democracy. The choice between transcendent values and postmodernism, as it is often put, is false. Rousseau and Montesquieu maintain that some values are indeed universally good, but they do not hold that this implies a commitment to particular institutional arrangements. Although they are sympathetic to democracy under certain conditions, they do not hold democracy to be a moral absolute. Democracy itself can only be measured by yet higher values, including liberty, equality, and justice. Where democracy fails to safeguard these indeterminate principles, it holds little value. A democracy, for example, without order may be a democracy in the descriptive sense, but it is not normatively just for Rousseau. And to be sure, one can reasonably question whether democracy as instituted in new regimes in the Middle East serves these ends. The presence of certain institutional arrangements is by no means an indication of a just order on Rousseau's reading. That can only be measured against the ideas of justice, liberty, equality, and order."
"72","This view also encourages a greater sympathy for the diversity of existing institutions without taking recourse to relativism. One can observe the operations of differing institutional arrangements from this perspective without immediately coming to the conclusion that they are wrong insofar as they depart from a chosen determinate model. The question is not “how democratic?” but rather, “how respectful of values like liberty, equality, dignity, order, and justice?” insofar as those are transcendent values worth pursuing in all cultures.37"
"73","Scholars today are generally satisfied that Montesquieu and Rousseau were social scientists—even where they depart from some of their specific laws. In this sphere, we are unlikely to derive much contemporary relevance. But it is in the normative realm—particularly in Rousseau—that these figures make their greatest case for relevance. The simple fact is that implicit value judgments underlie the choice of all political institutions. If one is discontent with those choices, then Montesquieu and Rousseau provide a viable alternative—one that safeguards certain normative principles as transcendent without falling into dogmatism. Such, I argue, is one of the greatest lessons of the Enlightenment for our times."
"74","Finally, a study of Montesquieu and Rousseau in these matters sheds particular light on the relationship between empirical analysis and normative assumptions. It is typical for social science in recent decades to take certain normative assumptions as a given, such as Robert Putnam's (1993, 1995) assumption that democracy is suitable for his chosen areas of research. Indeed, Rousseau's misgivings about Montesquieu reflect an impatience for this disposition in the Spirit of the Laws. To some extent, of course, this philosophic laxity combined with empirical rigor is understandable and justifiable. This is especially the case since empirical results are much more obviously subject to debate than are ideas like liberty, equality, and justice. In other words, political science is generally more forgiving of laxity in its treatment of normative conceptions like justice, liberty, and equality than it is with the same attitude toward its empirical dimensions. In fact, Richard Rorty has expended great philosophic energies in arriving at the same conclusion shared with many social scientists—that it is permissible and often inevitable to simply take certain common norms for granted (1989, especially chap. 3). To be sure, this approach can be read by some as progressive, insofar as it dispenses with questions many deem epistemically inaccessible. But others read it as pernicious insofar as it seems to close off debate on those governing principles yielding enormous influence.         "
"75","Those dissatisfied with the normative rigor of many social scientists or the conclusions of Rorty might well remain in sympathy with Berlin's either/or approach, which has at least the appearance of great rigor in its sharp analytic division. The apparent advantage of Berlin's either/or approach over Rousseau's “middle way” is the greater apparent philosophical rigor associated with the former. The obvious problem with Berlin's approach, however, is its insensitivity to human needs and contexts, which is a strength of the indeterminist approach. Yet one need not assume Rousseau's indeterminism is incompatible with greater analytic rigor. Insofar as these ideas can be fleshed out in particular contexts and subsequently examined, it might well be possible to gain greater insight into the ideas that serve as the normative resource of this perspective. This remains the great frontier of future investigations in political ontology stemming from the early modern tradition."
