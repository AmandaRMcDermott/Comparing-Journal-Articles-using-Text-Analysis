"1","Given that sociotropic attitudes do not preclude economic policy preferences also having an egocentric basis, we now consider a different reason for why egocentrism may not always be apparent. Our argument first focuses on how contextual information may be a precondition for the emergence of egocentric preferences. We then consider how informed preferences might appear in terms of the domestic versus international monetary policy trade‐off: along factoral, sectoral, and/or firm‐based dimensions."
"2","In the pocketbook voting literature in American political behavior, scholars have long considered the role of information. However, these various arguments have not yet been integrated into the international/comparative political economy behavior debate. Furthermore, even in American political behavior, scholars have not distinguished between the types of information (contextual versus persuasive) that are (or are not) conducive to egocentrism. Our argument takes both of these steps."
"3","The conventional wisdom in American political behavior was that a lack of information about complicated issues led potential voters to express “primitive” egocentric preferences (Campbell et al. 1960, 205). As Kinder and Kiewiet (1981, 130) summarized about this conventional wisdom, “pocketbook politics requires little in the way of political expertise. Knowing who the incumbents are, where the polling place is located, and a few other details are all that is needed. Given the uneven and intermittent attention the American public pays to politics, the minimal informational demands placed upon voters by pocketbook politics contribute materially to its attractiveness.”            "
"4","Consistent with the argument to be advanced here, this conventional wisdom about ignorance leading to egocentrism was challenged within the American political behavior literature. As Citrin and Green (1990, 17) observed, “most people lack the information needed to adopt political opinions in a rationally self‐interested manner.” Previewing the type of information that might be conducive to the emergence of egocentrism, they further noted (Citrin and Green 1990, 18, emphasis added): “Ignorance of the costs and benefits associated with alternative policies thus mitigates the influence of self‐interest on preferences.”            "
"5","Within this debate, Sears and Funk (1990, 258, emphasis added) offered a possible compromise based on issue complexity: While information may not be a “critical precondition for self‐interest effects” in certain issues, “political issues would seem to be of only ordinary importance; perhaps information is only critical when the issues are very complex.” Indeed, this understanding leads directly into the political economy behavior debate where scholars seek a framework to understand individual‐level policy preference across what can be reasonably identified as relatively complex macroeconomic topics (including international trade and money). On this basis, we expect a lack of information to be an obstacle to the formation of egocentric preferences in these issue areas, even if it is not such an obstacle on simpler topics.            "
"6","But what type of information should be conducive to egocentrism? Our argument focuses on the role of “contextual” information, which must be distinguished from “persuasive” information. The former is defined as content about the costs and benefits of a particular policy. By itself, contextual information does not directly indicate that a policy is good or bad; instead, it summarizes the relevant policy trade‐offs. In the case of international trade, the simple statement that free trade can lower consumer prices but may also hurt certain domestic producers provides contextual information. This same statement does not tell the reader that free trade is good or bad; it only identifies some policy trade‐offs in this issue area.            "
"7","In contrast, persuasive information directly suggests that a policy is good or bad for particular groups.3 In the case of international trade, the alternative statement that free trade simply lowers consumer prices could be read as information persuasive for free trade. To the extent that this information identifies the policy as being good for a larger group (e.g., all consumers), it could even induce what appears to be sociotropic (national) pro‐trade preferences. Similarly, information focused on the need to limit imports from foreign producers in order to protect domestic workers could be read as persuasive against free trade. To the extent that this persuasive information leads the reader to identify with a larger ingroup of threatened American workers, it may even induce outgroup anxiety opposed to free trade.            "
"8","Given that surveys have become the primary instrument for obtaining the policy preferences of potential voters, it is useful to think about these two types of information in the context of a public opinion survey. While costly in terms of both survey time and space, contextual information can be provided through a vignette summarizing the policy trade‐offs in a complicated issue area. The goal here would be to provide enough information about both the costs and benefits of a particular policy so that respondents can consider the options and express coherent preferences between/among them. To the extent that respondents can link policy options to their material interests, expressed preferences may be egocentric."
"9","Alternatively, persuasive information is often delivered via a survey prime, or frame. If effective, this prime leads respondents toward a particular policy choice, thus homogenizing preferences and reducing the sample's variation for the attitudinal dependent variable. Given this reduced variation, personal material factors entered as independent variables should be expected to offer less explanatory power. The key point here is that not all information can be expected to facilitate the expression of egocentric preferences on a complicated policy issue. Without contextual information, expressed policy preferences on a complicated issue may simply be incoherent. But with sufficient contextual information, egocentrism may emerge. However, egocentrism could also be washed out through priming, either deliberate or accidental."
"10","Our hypothesis from the previous subsection is that citizens should be able to express coherent egocentric monetary policy preferences given sufficient contextual information. But what form should these egocentric preferences take? Will egocentric preferences be based on factoral or sectoral considerations? This was the central question in the first‐wave political economy behavior debate, but it deserves some careful reconsideration with the addition of “new” new trade theory (NNTT) to the theoretical debate."
"11","The Mundell‐Fleming framework posits that with international capital mobility, governments must choose between directing monetary policy toward either a domestic objective or exchange rate stability. Domestic monetary policy autonomy refers to using interest rates (the basic monetary policy instrument) for some internal policy goal; depending on the macroeconomic context, this could be raising interest rates to fight inflation or lowering interest rates to spur economic growth. Alternatively, interest rates could be directed toward exchange rate stabilization, or resisting the external pressure to move the exchange rate in a particular direction. If domestic monetary autonomy is chosen, then there may be movement in the exchange rate, potentially complicating international business transactions. But if the latter is chosen to facilitate international commerce, then monetary policy cannot be used for a certain domestic economic objective, either lowering interest rates to boost growth or raising interest rates to reduce inflation, depending on the macroeconomic context."
"12","The factoral model predicts that individuals who own more of the internationally mobile factor should more strongly favor directing monetary policy toward an external objective (Bearce 2003, 377). Starting with a two‐factor model that includes only capital and labor, capital is the internationally mobile factor, whereas labor is largely confined to the domestic economy. With their exit option, capital owners do not need to rely on domestic monetary autonomy; they can simply move their capital into national economies with better growth and inflation outcomes. But without an exit option, laborers should prefer domestic monetary autonomy and be relatively indifferent to exchange rate instability. Also considering a three‐factor model that adds human capital, thus distinguishing between more‐skilled and less‐skilled labor, individuals with greater education would be expected to have lesser preferences for domestic monetary autonomy given somewhat greater international mobility for higher‐skilled labor.            "
"13","This factoral model comes from the Heckscher‐Ohlin framework, which assumes that factors of production can move easily from one sector (or industry) to another within the national economy. But this assumption is almost certainly invalid in the short term, leading monetary policy scholars to rely more on the Ricardo‐Viner framework, with its assumption that factors cannot move easily across sectors. Inasmuch as factors are specific to sectors (at least in the short term), preferences should emerge along industry dimensions. Stated differently, individuals should all have the same policy preference within a given industry regardless of their factor endowments.            "
"14","As described by Frieden (1991), those working in sectors more confined to the national economy should have stronger preferences for domestic monetary autonomy. Conversely, those working in industries that do more of their business overseas should have stronger preferences for directing monetary policy toward the exchange rate given that currency movements may complicate their international business transactions. This understanding suggests that monetary policy preferences should fall along sectoral lines, with individuals working for more domestically oriented industries favoring greater domestic monetary autonomy. But a complication for the sectoral model is the assumption that all firms in a given industry have the same domestic/international business orientation. NNTT strongly challenged this assumption.            "
"15","The firm‐based preference model from NNTT begins with the empirical observation that very few firms are able to engage in international business activity; for example, only about 4% of American firms were exporters in 2000 (Bernard et al. 2007, 105). This fact is thought to arise because only a small number of businesses—generally the larger and more productive firms—are able to pay the high costs associated with entering and competing in foreign markets. Consequently, within most industries, only a handful of firms have an overseas business orientation, and many of these international firms produce across different sectors and are not limited to production defined by a single industry. Within most industries, including manufacturing sectors where production should be highly tradable, the vast majority of firms are confined to the domestic market. NNTT thus makes a similar prediction about preferences as does the sectoral model: Individuals working for more domestically oriented businesses should favor greater domestic monetary autonomy. But this firm‐based model expects this variation to be based on the individual's specific business and not to be based on average industry exports/imports, which have been the standard operational measures for testing the sectoral model.            "
"16","Having outlined the predictions from three different political economy frameworks, we now turn to the evidence: Do individuals, with contextual information about the domestic versus international monetary policy trade‐off, express egocentric policy preferences along factoral, sectoral, and/or firm‐based dimensions?"
"17","We begin to answer this question using two original surveys with American respondents. As mentioned earlier, we anticipate that most American citizens have little knowledge of the domestic versus international monetary policy trade‐off given that there has been no recent debate in the United States on this subject (unlike in most European democracies, with their recent and ongoing debates about Eurozone participation), so we have more control over the information content within an American survey sample. We control this content in each of the two surveys by administering an informative vignette to all respondents."
"18","The first survey, conducted using Mechanical Turk (MT) in August 2012, employs a convenience sample. The second survey employs a representative sample and was fielded within the 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) administered by YouGov Polimetrix before and after the November 2012 national elections. While the obvious disadvantage of the MT survey comes from the potentially nonrepresentative sample, the advantage of using this lower‐cost convenience sample is the additional time available, which allows for a longer and more contextually informative vignette. As one can see in the appendix, while the two vignettes are similarly structured, the MT vignette is 50% longer in terms of the word count (322 versus 214) when compared to the CCES vignette (more about the informational difference between these two vignettes will be provided below)."
"19","Although these two vignettes differ in terms of their length and potentially their informational strength, both are similar in that they are designed to deliver contextual information about the policy trade‐offs in this issue area. Neither vignette includes a deliberate attempt to prime the respondents toward a particular monetary policy preference, although there may be some accidental framing. It bears repeating that such priming/framing, either deliberate or accidental, should only reduce the sample's expressed preference variation, thus making it harder (not easier) to find variation along any egocentric dimension.         "
"20","While the vignettes ask the respondent to consider two different versions of the basic domestic versus international monetary policy trade‐off, our dependent variable is the respondent's position with regard to the following prompt: “When the domestic economy is not growing and the U.S. dollar's value is weakening in the international marketplace, use the sliding scale below to indicate which policy goal the government should prioritize using its monetary policy.” The sliding scale has “strengthening the U.S. dollar internationally” at one end and “promoting domestic economy growth” at the other, with higher values (0–100) associated with a more Domestic Monetary Preference. Since most production in the American economy does not cross national borders, it is not surprising to observe in Table 1 that the average respondent in both samples has a preference toward domestic monetary policy autonomy, associated with higher values of Domestic Monetary Preference (mean = 62 in the MT sample; mean = 60 in the CCES sample).            "
"21","We focus on this question to capture the extent to which the respondent has a preference for a domestically oriented monetary policy because our two surveys were administered in 2012 at a time when the American macroeconomic context included both slow growth (with almost no threat of inflation) and a dollar that was tending to fall (not rise) relative to the currency of many major U.S. trading partners.4 Hence, the contemporaneous domestic versus international monetary policy trade‐off was either lowering interest rates to stimulate the domestic economy or raising interest rates to stabilize the dollar internationally. Especially given the complicated nature of monetary policy, using a question with the correct macroeconomic context as our dependent variable is important because respondents are less likely to be able to articulate a preference with regard to a hypothetical monetary policy trade‐off, or one that does not currently exist (e.g., the trade‐off between raising interest rates to fight inflation or lowering them to stabilize the dollar at a more competitive level, as was the case in the early to mid‐1980s).            "
"22","We use a variety of operational measures to capture egocentrism for the factoral, sectoral, and firm‐based models. These multiple measures will then be combined into a single cleaner measure for the sectoral and firm‐based models. Beginning with the factoral model, we include an ordinal measure of Income with 10 categories: (1) less than $10,000; (2) $10,000–19,999; (3) $20,000–39,999; (4) $40,000–59,999; (5) $60,000–79,999; (6) $80,000–99,999; (7) $100,000–119,999; (8) 120,000–149,999; (9) $150,000–199,999; and (10) more than $200,000. To capture the variation in human capital, we also include an ordinal measure of Education with six categories: (1) did not graduate from high school; (2) high school graduate; (3) some college, but no degree; (4) 2‐year college degree; (5) 4‐year college degree; and (6) postcollege graduate education. Our egocentric factoral model, outlined in the previous sections, expects a negative sign on both Income and Education, as individuals with more of the internationally mobile factors (capital and human capital) should have a lesser Domestic Monetary Preference.            "
"23","For the sectoral model, we begin with three related industry‐based measures that are matched to the respondent's stated industry of employment/income. Using trade data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (2015),5 we first include a measure of Industry Exports and, second, a measure of Industry Imports, both expressed as a share of total industry output. We also include a third measure, a dummy variable for a Nontradable Industry, to capture the situation when there is no reported industry trade either in terms of exports or imports. Our egocentric sectoral framework from the previous section expects a negative sign for Industry Exports and a positive sign for both Industry Imports and Nontradable Industry. These three separate measures are then combined into a single sectoral measure labeled Net Industry Exports, which subtracts the second measure from the first (with the third indicating the situation when Net Industry Exports = 0). Our sectoral framework expects that Net Industry Exports should take on a negative sign, indicating that individuals working in sectors with greater net exports should have a lesser Domestic Monetary Preference.            "
"24","For the firm‐based model, our egocentric measures come from a general question about the domestic versus international orientation of their particular firm: “To what extent does your business/employer export their production to or do business in overseas markets?” In response to this survey item, respondents had four options: (1) none in overseas markets, (2) some in overseas markets, (3) most in overseas markets, and (4) all in overseas markets.6 With reason to believe that the distance between each of these categories should not be constant, we begin with a dummy variable for each category, with “none in overseas markets” as the omitted category. On this basis, we expect a growing negative sign, in sequence, for Overseas Business = Some, Overseas Business = Most, and Overseas Business = All. Based on the expectation that preferences for/against a domestic monetary policy should show their greatest change between Some and Most, we also combine this information into a single firm‐based measure labeled Overseas Business by combining None and Some ( = 0) and Most and All ( = 1). Our firm‐based logic expects that Overseas Business should take on a negative sign, indicating that individuals working in firms that do the majority of their business in external markets should have a lesser Domestic Monetary Preference.            "
"25","It is important to report that to avoid priming an egocentric response in terms of the attitudinal dependent variable, the queries behind these (and all of the other) independent variables (to be described below) came after the Domestic Monetary Preference prompt on the 2012 MT survey. For the 2012 CCES survey, these queries came on a different wave of the survey (separated by weeks) from the Domestic Monetary Preference prompt. We are thus not concerned that answering these material questions somehow primed an egocentric response with regard to the dependent variable.            "
"26","After our egocentric independent variables, we include a limited set of control variables that are deliberately focused on other “material” factors. Since our dependent variable is a monetary policy “attitude,” our right‐hand specification does not include any other variables directly measuring similar monetary policy attitudes following the concern raised by Fordham and Kleinberg (2012) about attitudes regressed on other attitudes. As a control, we include the dummy variable Union, which measures whether or not the respondent has ever been associated with a labor union. We control for the respondent's Age using an ordinal measure with seven categories: (1) less than 20, (2) 21–29, (3) 30–39, (4) 40–49, (5) 50–59, (6) 60–69, and (7) 70 or older. To capture any gender‐based differences in terms of monetary policy preferences, our specification includes a dummy variable for Female. To the extent that there could also be race‐based differences, we add dummy variables for White and Black, the two largest racial groups in our samples.            "
"27","Given the potential importance of political ideology and partisanship, we use a five‐level ordinal variable to control for this first consideration, with higher values indicating that the respondent self‐identifies as having a more Liberal Ideology. To control for the second consideration, we also include dummy variables for respondents identifying themselves as either Democrat or Republican (with Independents as the omitted category). It is important to note that while these last three variables are not, strictly speaking, material factors, they are also not measuring directly other monetary policy attitudes.            "
"28","Finally, we add dummy variables for respondents who report being Unemployed or Retired. In our 2012 MT sample, several individuals who fit these currently nonworking categories nonetheless answered the queries behind our Net Industry Exports and Overseas Business variables (presumably based on their past work experience). Unemployed and Retired both drop when using our 2012 CCES sample because the question behind the latter egocentric variable was not asked of any respondent who had self‐reported as not currently working.            "
"29","The descriptive statistics for these variables in both survey samples are presented together in Table 1. In terms of our egocentric measures, while the CCES sample is richer, it is less international in terms of the other egocentric measures. For basic demographic characteristics, the CCES sample is also older, more white, less liberal, and less Democratic than the MT sample. It is also important to note that the CCES sample is not necessarily more representative simply based on these demographic characteristics, but it can be made so through probability weighting (Ansolabehere and Rivers 2013), which will be part of our statistical specification when using the CCES sample (but not for the MT sample).            "
"30","Since the dependent variable Domestic Monetary Preference is continuous between 0 and 100, our models are estimated ordinary least squares (OLS) with robust standard errors clustered by state. Beginning with the 2012 MT sample, we estimate three versions of the model described above, presenting the results in Table 2. Our first model uses the longer set of disaggregated egocentric variables, which are then combined for the sectoral and firm‐based frameworks in the second model. Continuing with this preferred specification, we then reduce the statistical sample to assess the robustness of our results in this dimension.            "
"31","The results are consistent across the three models. Among the egocentric variables, neither of the factoral measures (Income and Education) exhibits a significant relationship with Domestic Monetary Preference. There is some limited support for the sectoral framework, as Industry Imports takes on a statistically significant positive sign in Model 2.1. Likewise, Net Industry Exports takes on a statistically significant negative sign when this combined measure is added in Model 2.2.            "
"32","But there is even stronger support for the firm‐based framework, as each of the Overseas Business category variables in Model 2.1 takes on a negative sign that gets larger with more international activity, although only the last two categories ( = Most and = All) are statistically significant. This result is consistent with our expectation that the most important preference break toward a lesser Domestic Monetary Preference should occur between Some and Most. Consequently, we proceed with our dichotomous Overseas Business variable (Most and All = 1) in Model 2.2, and this variable also achieves statistical significance with the expected negative sign.            "
"33","Using the combined sectoral and firm‐based measures (Net Industry Exports and Overseas Business), we explore the robustness of these results by restricting the statistical sample, dropping the respondents who reported as either Unemployed or Retired. The results are robust for each of the egocentric measures (i.e., insignificant for both Income and Education and a statistically significant negative sign for both Net Industry Exports and Overseas Business).            "
"34","The obvious concern about the MT results in Table 2 is that they come from a nonrepresentative convenience sample. Would one be able to observe any evidence of material egocentrism given a more nationally representative sample of Americans? To investigate this possibility, we bought a share in the 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). While this second sample can be treated as representative through probability weighing, the CCES sample includes a larger proportion of older retired Americans, and our question behind the Overseas Business variable was only asked of respondents who had already identified themselves as currently employed. Hence, our sample size becomes smaller when using the 2012 CCES sample.            "
"35","Table 3 presents a similar sequence of Domestic Monetary Preference models using this more representative sample. Model 3.1 uses the longer set of disaggregated egocentric variables, which are then combined for the sectoral and firm‐based frameworks in Model 3.2. Since our firm‐based question was not asked of those who reported as either unemployed or retired, there is no need for an additional model to parallel the sample in Model 2.3.            "
"36","As one can quickly observe, the egocentric results are weaker in this survey sample. For the two factoral measures, Education becomes statistically significant, but with the wrong sign for egocentrism. As argued by Hainmueller and Hiscox (2006), education may proxy socialization more than it captures human capital endowments. To the extent that individuals learn the benefits of domestic monetary autonomy for the American economy, the positive sign on Education is plausible. However, the result is not consistent with egocentrism.            "
"37","Among the sectoral variables, Industry Exports and Industry Imports are both statistically significant in Model 3.1, but with the wrong sign for the egocentric framework presented earlier. The same is true for Net Industry Exports in Models 3.2 and 3.3. We have no particular explanation for these unexpected results, but they appear to be a (small) sample property and do not emerge in any of our other survey or experimental samples.            "
"38","The firm‐based variables do, however, behave consistently with our egocentric expectations in the CCES sample, although the results are weaker than observed in the MT sample. In Model 3.1, only Overseas Business = All takes on a statistically significant negative sign. In Model 3.2, the dichotomous Overseas Business variable is also statistically significant with the expected negative sign, but its coefficient is only about half the size as that observed in the MT sample (–7.87a versus –13.53a).            "
"39","With a particular focus on the firm‐based results that appear in both survey samples, why are these egocentric results stronger in the MT sample than in the CCES sample? At least two possibilities come to mind. The first concerns the nonrepresentative MT sample. However, many scholars report similar survey questionnaire results in convenience versus representative samples (Gosling et al. 2004). Furthermore, the probability weighting used in the CCES sample to make it nationally representative serves to make the Overseas Business results somewhat stronger, not weaker. Thus, we are disinclined to think that the stronger Overseas Business results in the MT sample are due, at least primarily, to peculiar sample properties, especially given relatively similar sample characteristics as shown in Table 1 for Domestic Monetary Preference and for the Overseas Business measures.            "
"40","A second possibility concerns the strength of the informative vignette used in the two samples. As discussed above and shown in the appendix, the MT sample received a longer and potentially more informative vignette than did the CCES sample due to time limitations in the latter survey. Our hypothesis was that, given sufficient contextual information, egocentric monetary policy preferences would emerge. Perhaps the informational content of the CCES vignette was barely sufficient in this regard.            "
"41","To investigate this possibility, we first assessed the informational content of these two vignettes in order to better establish that the MT vignette was more informative than the CCES vignette. From information theory, the informative content of a textual passage can be measured by how much space is required to store the text. In this regard, the 2012 MT vignette requires 2.1 KB (50% more), compared to only 1.4 KB for the 2012 CCES vignette. Using Shannon's entropy measure (the minimum number of bits to encode the information in binary form), the MT vignette is also 50% more informative than the CCES vignette (10,685 versus 7,120). Finally, using content analysis software from Leximancer and AlchemyAPI, we find that the MT vignette has eight themes with 19 key words, whereas the CCES vignette has only four themes with 14 key words. Based on all these differences, we argue that there are important informational differences between our two primary vignettes."
"42","We thus conducted a survey experiment in two waves using Mechanical Turk (Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012), asking the same question about a Domestic Monetary Preference.7 In this survey experiment, however, we randomly assigned each respondent either (1) no vignette at all, (2) the less informative CCES vignette, or (3) the more informative MT vignette. The goal here was to determine to what extent the articulation of egocentric firm‐based monetary policy preferences depends on the strength of the contextually informative vignette. Including both waves, our survey experiment was administered to 1,383 American voting‐age individuals, with 456 randomly receiving no vignette, 467 receiving the shorter CCES vignette, and 460 receiving the longer MT vignette. Our randomization across these three treatments was effective, as demonstrated by the demographically balanced subsamples shown in Table 4. Using a range of different tests, there are no statistically significant differences for any of the independent variables. We thus omit the control variables since their inclusion has no effect on the various egocentric measures.            "
"43","Using the data from this survey experiment, Table 5 presents our model of Domestic Monetary Preference for different samples. Controlling for the vignette received,8 Model 5.1 uses the full sample, and one can observe the expected negative coefficient for Overseas Business (–17.56a), whereas the other egocentric measures are either statistically insignificant (Income and Net Industry Exports) or significant but with the wrong sign for egocentrism (Education). The next three models use only the restricted subsamples: those receiving no vignette (Model 5.2), those receiving the CCES vignette (Model 5.3), and those receiving the MT vignette (Model 5.4).            "
"44","Given our relatively large sample, we are able to find a statistically significant negative Overseas Business result in all of the treatment groups, including those that received no vignette (Model 5.2). But while statistically significant, the Overseas Business coefficient is relatively weak for those who received the CCES vignette treatment (Model 5.3), consistent with what was observed in Table 3. Indeed, there is no statistically significant difference between the Overseas Business coefficients in Models 5.2 and 5.3, suggesting that the CCES vignette was not more informative than no vignette at all. However, the MT vignette treatment produced a substantively strong Overseas Business coefficient in Model 5.4 that is statistically different from the same result in both Models 5.2 and 5.3.            "
"45","This latter result is confirmed using the full sample with Overseas Business and vignette‐specific interactions terms in Model 5.5. Using this specification, the marginal effect of Overseas Business with no vignette comes simply from the Overseas Business constitutive term, which is statistically significant (–13.79a). The marginal effect of Overseas Business with the weaker CCES vignette comes from the Overseas Business constitutive term plus the Overseas Business × CCES Vignette interaction term. The latter is statistically insignificant, indicating that there is no substantive difference between providing no vignette and the CCES vignette. Finally, the marginal effect of Overseas Business with the stronger MT vignette comes from the Overseas Business constitutive term plus the Overseas Business × MT Vignette interaction term. The latter is statistically significant, producing a negative association that is much greater than that for the other two treatment groups (–31.80a = –13.79a + –18.01a).            "
"46","The results of our survey experiment suggest that if a stronger vignette had been applied to the nationally representative sample, then stronger egocentric monetary preferences would have emerged along the firm‐based dimension. But we have not yet made this demonstration. We now turn to this final empirical task. To explore the results when using a more contextually informative vignette in a nationally representative sample, we bought a partial share in the 2013 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. In the 2013 CCES, we used the same vignette as that employed in the 2012 MT sample, although we had to drop the fourth paragraph due to time constraints.9 Following the vignette, we first asked our Domestic Monetary Preference question and then our Overseas Business query (in that order to avoid potential egocentric priming on the attitudinal dependent variable). The other independent variables come from the common content questions in the 2013 CCES. The descriptive statistics are presented in Table 6.            "
"47","In Table 7, we present the same sequence of Domestic Monetary Preference models as shown in Table 2. What we obtain in this nationally representative sample is a set of firm‐based results that parallel those for the 2012 MT survey. Overseas Business = Most and Overseas Business = All are both statistically significant with the expected negative sign in Model 7.1. In Model 7.2, the dichotomous Overseas Business indicator has a strong negative coefficient comparable to the parallel result in Table 2 (Model 2.2). Additionally, this result gets even stronger when we drop the unemployed and retired respondents in Model 7.3.            "
"48","The argument and evidence presented in this article make two contributions to the ongoing political economy behavior debate. Regarding the first‐wave debate—whether preferences are organized along factoral, sectoral, and/or firm‐based dimensions— our survey results provide some microfoundations in terms of monetary policy preference models. The evidence consistently shows American preferences about whether monetary policy should be more directed toward a domestic or an international goal to be based around firm considerations."
"49","The fact that there is no support for the factoral framework in terms of monetary policy may not be surprising since this has not been the primary preference model used by scholars in this issue area (unlike in international trade). But given the more frequent use of a sectoral framework by monetary scholars, it is perhaps surprising to observe that the expected preference variation between domestically versus internationally oriented producers is more strongly firm‐based than industry‐based. These firm‐based divisions have a foundation in new new trade theory, which predicts that only the larger and most productive firms would be able to pay the costs associated with entering foreign markets. Future research should thus directly explore this proposition with survey questions about other firm‐based dimensions (e.g., size and productivity)."
"50","With regard to the second‐wave debate—whether macroeconomic policy preferences have any egocentric basis—this article makes a contribution on the political behavior side by providing an intermediate position: Economic policy preferences are not inherently egocentric or non‐egocentric. Depending on the information context, they could be either. In this regard, egocentrism requires contextual information. But it is not too difficult to provide this contextual information even on complex macroeconomic issues like the international versus domestic monetary policy trade‐off. Thus, our experimental results suggest that while contextual information may operate as a precondition for egocentric preferences, advanced training in macroeconomics is not required. A carefully written vignette could suffice. Indeed, this understanding suggests that we might expect to observe stronger egocentric results in surveys about international trade and migration when contextually informative vignettes are included in the survey instruments.

"51","Finally, the survey evidence presented in this article sheds some light on the relatively uncontroversial nature of American monetary policy in actual practice. In all of our surveys, a large majority of respondents expressed a greater preference for domestic monetary policy autonomy. This is important because American monetary policy is set by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), a relatively autonomous bureaucracy insulated from popular pressure. Indeed, independent central banks, including the FRB, have often been criticized as nondemocratic institutions (e.g., Levy 1995/1996; Pixley, Whimster, and Wilson 2013). Yet in the post–Bretton Woods era (and even before), the FRB has consistently set short‐term interest rates in response to domestic economic conditions (either inflation, growth, or employment) with relatively little regard for the U.S. dollar's stability and value in international markets. Our descriptive data indicate that despite its bureaucratic insulation, the FRB is nonetheless delivering a domestically oriented monetary policy that is broadly consistent with the preferences of the American majority. This understanding could help explain why Americans have come to accept a nondemocratic monetary bureaucracy within an otherwise democratic political system.         "
"52","When the economy falls into a recession, the government could lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Alternatively, when prices are rising, the government might raise interest rates in order to fight inflation (rising prices)."
"53","The government could also use interest rates to stabilize or change the U.S. dollar's value in the international marketplace. When the dollar's value is falling, the government could raise interest rates to strengthen the dollar internationally. Alternatively, when the dollar becomes overvalued, it hurts U.S. exports by making American products seem more expensive. Thus, the government might lower interest rates to boost U.S. exports."
"54","Unfortunately, interest rates cannot be used to address all of these problems at the same time. Consider the following scenario: the economy is not growing and the U.S. dollar's value is falling in the international marketplace. If the government wants to stimulate economic growth, it would need to lower interest rates. But if the government instead wants to strengthen the dollar, it would need to raise interest rates."
"55","Now consider another scenario: prices are rising (inflation) and the U.S. dollar is overvalued, hurting American exports. If the government wants to fight inflation, it would need to raise interest rates. But if the government wants to boost American exports, it would need to lower interest rates."
