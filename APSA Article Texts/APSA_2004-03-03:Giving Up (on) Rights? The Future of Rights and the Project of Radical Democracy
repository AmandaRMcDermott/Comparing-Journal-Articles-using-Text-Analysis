"1","Within contemporary thought it is precisely those involved with the democratic practice of rights who have been most vocal in challenging the discourse of rights: namely, scholars in the field of CLS.2 Work in CLS heavily emphasizes that rights develop historically and thereby remain contextually dependent. In short, CLS scholars insist upon the cultural relativism of rights, strenuously denying that rights express either an abstract or transcendent truth, and they thus conclude that if rights themselves are culture‐bound, then so is their political meaning and social significance. Once the notion that rights are universals has been rejected, CLS moves on to expose the political impotence of rights. The abstract quality of rights undermines their potential as critical tools for social progress: arguments over rights tend to deny or ignore real‐world suffering. Tushnet argues in favor of a new focus: away from formal rights and toward the real‐world needs of those in pain. He argues, “we must insist on preserving real experiences rather than abstracting general rights from those experiences” (Tushnet 1984, 1382; see also Williams 1991). According to this line of reasoning, if rights can never be proven truly universal, then their legitimacy must always remain in question, their defense must always rest on shaky ground—ground that can and will be challenged in a court of law. Given the lack of credibility of a legal discourse of rights, Tushnet asks, why not base political/legal arguments on the much more solid foundation of empirically demonstrable need? Because needs are contextually dependent and practically verifiable, they can be defended concretely in legal battles.3"
"2","Given the broad audience in mainstream legal theory to which it speaks, the CLS argument proves both powerful and important. It has spurred some vigorous debate within legal circles, and it has likely led to changes in strategy by certain political organizations and legal activists—particularly those that defend the homeless and the poor (see Williams 1991). But the logic of the CLS critique of rights turns out to be anything but radical, because it leaves the main tenets of rights untouched. The CLS critique eschews the universalism of rights for the particularism of needs, but this analytic move only shifts us from one pole to the other. The argument for rights as universal protectors of certain abstract qualities of “man” (and this has been the historical argument) remains not only unchallenged but largely presupposed, since, as critics of CLS have pointed out, the shift from rights to needs only makes sense if those rights themselves remain in place and guaranteed (Perry 1984). In the present, the formal language of abstract rights may continue to serve certain groups better than needs; here one can think of groups as diverse as lesbians and gays, on the one hand, and business interests, on the other. And in the near or distant future, the universal language of rights may serve the function of defending the lowly and indigent more effectively than it does today. Thus, in arguing for a semantic shift, the CLS critique leaves the framework of rights intact.         "
"3","This is not the case with the critique of rights formulated by Brown, since she challenges not merely the language of rights but the very discursive framework which maintains and circulates rights in contemporary politics. Brown goes beyond the notion that rights might no longer be very helpful, as she tries to demonstrate that rights today “codify … modalities of subordination and exclusion” (1985, 12, emphasis added). Brown's argument challenges the contemporary configuration of rights at the structural level; that is, it challenges the very logic that the CLS criticisms leave standing. In fact, although she herself never really addresses Critical Legal Studies, Brown's critique—her analysis of rights as tending to resubjugate those subjects who appeal to them—applies as successfully and cogently (perhaps more so?) to the language of needs based on a framework of rights than it does to the appeal to rights alone. By attacking rights at a more fundamental level, Brown's work not only exceeds the work of CLS, but offers its own objection to their critical position. More significantly for my purposes, Brown's analysis of contemporary rights discourse provides a ground from which to begin building responses to the questions I posed at the outset (particularly the relation of rights to the project of radical democracy).         "
"4","As legal theorists, the CLS scholars tend to initiate their critique of rights from within the juridical framework. Brown's argument, in contrast, presupposes a step back from that framework so that one can see the operation of juridical power and interrogate the model itself.4 A juridical understanding of power suggests that freedom and power are in an inverse relation to one another—as one increases the other decreases. Put more precisely, within the juridical understanding power and freedom hold no relation to one another, since a relation to power creates precisely the conditions for unfreedom.5 Emancipation is freedom from power. Of course, liberty may itself make it possible for the political agent to act and thus exercise his or her own power, but (at least on an idealized view) the juridical model of power typically conceptualizes power only as a negative force acting against the political subject—blocking, obscuring, or preventing political agency. Only where there is no power, is there liberty.         "
"5","The point is not that this ideal‐type juridical model can be found operating somewhere in the world. Foucault's critique, as I will discuss below, argues not for or against the juridical model as such. Instead, it attempts to show that in any historical instance (but particularly in late modernity) we find both juridical power and disciplinary power in operation. The point, then, is that liberalism—and, in turn, the CLS critique of rights—sometimes assumes precisely this ideal model of juridical power. Liberalism takes rights as guarantors of the very space of liberty that exists outside the realm of power. Rights circumscribe the individual, drawing a line around the political subject that power shall not cross. Liberalism, particularly in the form of social contract theory, assumes that subjects can exist, preformed and ready‐made, outside of power. The problem of politics thereby becomes a problem of creating legitimate political power, establishing its origins, and setting limits on it. Rights protect the political agent who pre‐existed society once he or she enters society; rights set those limits, marking the line between liberty and power. In fact, according to Locke, we will only agree to leave the state of nature—in which our freedom and equality and the sanctity of our life and property are protected by the law of nature—if we can take our natural rights with us. Liberalism assures us of the preservation of a small sphere free from power exactly as we create a larger form of legitimate political authority (Locke 1960[1690]).         "
"6","I see no reason to recite Foucault's and others' critique of the juridical model of power. Such an exercise has been repeated all too many times in recent contemporary thought. But the implications of the disciplinary model of power provide absolutely crucial insights for our understanding of rights in contemporary politics, so Foucault's conclusions do bear repeating here. Foucault's provocative contention is that power itself does not exist. Power cannot be thought as a graspable and possessable entity, so Foucault insists (at least retroactively) that power always be thought as power relations (1994, 11; cf. 1978, 92–102). Only between subjects can we find (yet never really locate or pin down) relations of power. The political agent can never be truly free from power, because he or she always acts from within a matrix of power relations. This acting from within explains Foucault's often‐criticized claim that there is no outside of power, there is no way to escape it. But such a conclusion is only damning if one insists upon thinking of freedom through the juridical model, since on the juridical model Foucault's conclusion entails the very elimination of freedom. But it should be clear by now that to rethink power as power relations necessarily demands a reconceptualization of freedom.6 And Foucault himself makes the thoroughly consistent claim that freedom must be thought of not as a state but as a practice; following Foucault one might suggest that freedom be rethought as freedom relations (see Rousse 1994).         "
"7","Brown initiates her investigations into the discourse of rights with this very notion of freedom as a complicated, ambiguous, and contested political concept (1995, 5). My own contention is that the force of Brown's critique rests on the foundation of a disciplinary understanding of power. Brown's concern lies in joining this interpretation of power with a focus on the question of political identity. The result is an assessment of the problem of rights in contemporary politics. The late modern constitution of political identity depends upon an understanding of disciplinary power in which power not only acts on the subject but helps to constitute the discursive conditions of possibility for that very subject's identity, particularly as that subject seeks to take on the tasks of political agency. But what happens when these very politicized identities demand rights, a political concept derived from liberalism's assumption of a juridical model of power?         "
"8","Brown proves less than sanguine concerning the results. She argues that the invocation of rights by a subject produced by and through disciplinary power may only lead to the reinstantiation of the very historical injury for which that political agent or group seeks recompense. Such an assessment of contemporary rights discourse, especially as articulated within the frame of identity politics, leads to a rather counterintuitive result: namely, those very rights that were historically claimed against state power and authority are now asked for from, in the name of, and in such a way as to augment that very state power (see also McClure 1996). Brown's charge here hits identity politics at the most fundamental level, since it suggests that the demand for rights based upon a stigmatized political identity serves not only to deepen the attachment between the political identity and its historical injury but also to invert the fundamental tenets of liberalism. Rights, rather than securing the life, liberty, and property of the sovereign individual now serve to render that triad less secure (by increasing the state's power over life, liberty, and property) and even to call into question the sovereignty of the individual—since such sovereignty is now premised upon state recognition, rather than preceding it.7"
"9","Although an indictment of liberal rights is certainly not the focus of Brown's project, when she deals specifically with the problem of rights, she often chooses to pitch her account as a rather far‐reaching argument against liberalism. I would suggest that in doing so she mistakenly paints her critique too broadly and that we should therefore read Brown's arguments somewhat more narrowly. To clarify: Brown argues that identity politics is imbricated with the liberal conception of rights, and she shows that within a project of multiculturalism the discourse of rights yields the counterproductive effects detailed above. As I will show below, she then seems to offer this conclusion as a challenge to liberalism writ large. I would argue instead that Brown's real opponent turns out to be one specific, and perhaps dominant, variant of liberalism: namely, pluralism. It seems safe to say that, historically, liberal political theory took root in the ground of a juridical understanding of power8—hence my references to social contract theory above—but liberalism today proves to be a rather flexible and multifaceted set of sometimes conflicting political theories and doctrines.9 Brown therefore moves onto less stable ground when she sweepingly dismisses this entity called “liberalism.” Brown's rhetorical swipes at liberalism prove misplaced, but they belie a more sophisticated and tenable critique of pluralism.10 Brown writes:         "
"10","                        "
"11","The universality of the state is ideologically achieved by turning away from and thus depoliticizing, yet at the same time presupposing, our collective particulars … In short, ‘the political’ in liberalism is precisely not a domain for social identification … the universalistic ‘we’[must] remain without specific content or aim, without a common good other than abstract universal representation or pluralism. (1995, 57)               "
"12","Two pages later Brown completes her logic: “liberal discourse converts political identity into essentialized private interest” so that “liberalism politically neutralizes rights claims” (59). But “liberal discourse” simply is not as unitary or monolithic as this conclusion would suggest11 and Brown weakens her position by suggesting that it could be. Nonetheless, the pluralist strand of liberal discourse may well serve just this function, and if we read Brown's argument as a critique of pluralism, not liberalism, we can see why. Pluralist theory neutralizes the political realm in precisely the manner described by Brown, because within pluralism politics becomes a simple matter of the free and unfettered competition among interest groups.         "
"13","There can be no truly radical or contestable political identity within the terms of pluralism, since identities can only appear in the political realm to the extent that they are equalized or normalized as participants in pluralist competition. In the same way that the capitalist economy neutralizes all use‐values into exchange values, the pluralist market translates all political challenges or demands into competitive requests. Brown's argument illustrates just this phenomenon, but it would make more sense if emended as follows: “[the dominant pluralist strand of] liberal discourse converts political identity into essentialized private interest.” Indeed, this neutralizing effect can be seen as a legacy of Dahl's (1956) famous interpretation of Madisonian “factions.”Madison (1987 [1787]) insisted that factions could not be neutralized without destroying liberty, therefore their effects must be controlled. But by translating factions into “interest groups” Dahl manages to turn the control of factions—through open competition among interest groups—into precisely their neutralization. In other words, if all factious political voices are only allowed to be heard through the medium of interest group politics then Madison's worries about factions seem, almost magically, to disappear. The magic here almost certainly has something to do with the alchemy involved in turning factions into interest groups—a translation that Madison would have likely been unable to recognize and unwilling to accept—but the legacy of that alchemy now lives on within liberalism in which political articulations always run the risk of looking like marketplace requests.12"
"14","If we take Brown's attack on liberalism as a more modest challenge to the pluralist interpretation of liberalism, then Brown's own goals come into sharper focus. Brown sees contemporary identity politics as incapable of truly contesting the pluralist terms of liberalism:"
"15","                        "
"16","While the effort to replace liberalism's abstract formulation of equality with legal recognition of injurious social stratifications is understandable, what such arguments do not query is whether legal ‘protection’ for a certain injury‐forming identity discursively entrenches the injury‐identity connection it denounces. Might such protection codify within the law the very powerlessness it aims to redress? (1995, 21)"
"17","The claim for rights tends to fix or at least temporarily freeze the current matrix of power relations, thereby codifying the very historical injury that the rights‐based claim sought to overcome.13 Rights, one of the key components of liberalism's political vocabulary, cannot directly or easily be used against the liberal order—claims to appropriating the master's tools notwithstanding.         "
"18","This line of argument does not merely denounce the claims made by and through identity politics as not quite radical enough. The answer to Brown's arguments could never come by simply pushing identity politics a little further to the left, since the logic and spirit of her critique of rights discourse implies a much more radical rejection of identity politics (even if Brown herself never explicitly suggests an abandonment of identity politics). This conclusion comes into sharper relief once one combines Brown's own challenges to both identity politics and pluralist theory with a clearer understanding of the relationship, within a liberal regime, between disciplinary power and rights."
"19","As currency produced within the liberal regime yet subject to the constraints of interest‐group pluralism, rights always remain subject to the risk of extreme devaluation—particularly if the very terms of the democratic political order turn out to be bankrupt as well (see Bell 1992). As long as claims against the political order are made in the currency of rights (i.e., the currency of the regime), then the political regime, through the very pluralist alchemy detailed above, always has the power to translate the demand into one that the state can control and domesticate. As Brown puts it: “liberal discourse [read: the pluralist discursive practice within liberalism] itself also continuously recolonizes political identity as political interest—a conversion that recasts politicized identity's substantive … cultural claims and critiques as generic claims of particularism endemic to universalistic political culture” (1995, 59). Those radical demands that enter the system as urgent challenges, reappear as modest pluralist requests. Working now outside the framework of Brown's arguments, but still operating within the context of pluralism, I would argue that is the common currency of rights that guarantees this process of conversion. That is, if we understand both rights and liberalism under the frame of pluralism, then the language of rights domesticates and co‐opts political resistance by recycling it.         "
"20","Brown extends this more general critique of the logic of rights discourse by connecting it to the rights‐based strategies of identity politics. In response to theorists of multiculturalism, Brown invokes the Nietzschean concept of ressentiment, a force that moralizes rather than politicizes—that blames and accuses rather than fights. Brown traces a specific genealogy of multiculturalism, revealing its “reactionary” (in the Nietzschean sense) tendencies, tendencies that may well lead to “self‐subversion” (1995, 55). For Nietzsche, a reactionary agent (or force) proves to be too weak to act itself, incapable of simply fighting its enemies. Identity politics can only react by moralizing weaknesses, thereby suggesting that those weaknesses are, in fact, pious virtues. Rather than launch a political challenge to the historical configuration of power that has led to marginalization and disenfranchisement, identity politics abdicates the ground for political challenges to the very historical configurations of power that led to marginalization. It thereby tends only “to reproach power rather than aspire to it, to disdain freedom rather than practice it” (55). Brown contends that by reinstantiating historical injury, identity politics remains thoroughly invested in its own subjection, since it is that very subjection which provides the grounds for emancipatory claims. And those emancipatory claims always turn out to be rights claims—claims for rights‐based compensation based upon prior historical sufferings or disenfranchisement. To Brown's Nietzschean sensibilities, these claims to rights exude the stench of ressentiment.14"
"21","But Brown's particular battle with identity politics, while of much import in its own right, does not centrally concern me here, since I wish to focus upon the entailments of the challenge to the discourse of rights. To repeat the question I asked at the outset, does the critique of the discourse of rights mean that we have to give up the very rights that have been fought for, and finally attained for so many groups, over the history of liberal regimes? But to narrow and focus that question I need now to ask, does the critique of the logic of rights leave us without any recourse to the protections of rights? What does a theory of democracy look like if it is not premised upon rights? More significantly, what democratic alternatives remain once one has deconstructed such a core element in the liberal‐democratic order?"
"22","Brown describes her own project as a work in the “old‐fashioned genre of political theoretical critique,” meaning that it articulates a future only out of a critique of the present (1995, 3). Brown focuses that critique on the evisceration of the meaning of political emancipation in contemporary political theory. She seeks to show that too much ground has been ceded to liberal‐capitalism, so that the fight for political freedom can now only be waged within liberalism's own (pluralist) terms, i.e., as a fight for the granting of more rights from the state (with the concomitant codification of historical injury that I enumerated above). I see Brown waging a crucial battle, but I fear that she seeks to make herself out to be the sole defender of liberty in a land that has lost touch with the possibilities for political emancipation. As a result, I will show that she lumps together her possible allies with her enemies, making her critique of the present—her critique of rights discourse—too broad and her vision of the future too narrow.         "
"23","Brown's appropriate opponents are, first of all, those defenders of the welfare state who can only respond to the Right's critique of the welfare system by arguing that the state should be the protector of the downtrodden and disenfranchised (Piven and Cloward 1987; Block 1987). “In the course of this defense, they decline to consider the state as a vehicle of domination or to reflect on ‘protection’ as a technique of domination” (1995, 15). With this argument Brown brings the disciplinary model of power to bear upon the arguments of welfare‐state defenders, showing that state policies can subjugate precisely as they supposedly “empower” (see Cruikshank 1994). These authors and activists, while striving for plausible and possibly democratic goals, have lost touch with some of the basic insights of Critical Theory—most importantly, the critique of the state as a site of capitalist domination.         "
"24","At the same time, Brown offers a salutary critique of Foucault's rejection of Marx. Foucault appropriately castigates certain strands of Marxism for their economism—for their reductionist formulation of power and their naïve reliance upon a crude base/superstructure model—and he resists any conceptualization of power that would reduce it to the status of a commodity. But Brown rightly suggests that Foucault's abhorrence of French structuralist Marxism leads to a certain blind‐spot: “Foucault deprives Marxism of its analysis of the diffusion of domination throughout the production process, where it inheres not only in the extraction of surplus value but in the discourses enabling commodity fetishism, reification, and ideologies of free and equal exchange” (1995, 13). To put this in the starkest terms, one could say that by sometimes mistaking Marx for a Marxist, Foucault's otherwise helpful insights into the discursive aspects of power lead him to go too far in his avoidance of the terms of Marxism. In de‐emphasizing the domination of capital and in avoiding any analysis that would take the state as a source of power, Foucault ends up ignoring the valuable insights of Marxism—insights that can help us to rethink the meaning of political emancipation in late‐modernity. Like the defenders of the welfare‐state, those who follow Foucault down this path find themselves with very few radical alternatives to liberal‐capitalism.         "
"25","But Brown herself goes too far, I contend, when she positions certain “radical democrats” along enemy lines. My argument here will be straightforward: Brown rejects “the project of radical democracy” too casually and on inadequate grounds, and in doing so she cuts off access to a valuable resource for reinvigorating the discourse of rights. However, sorting out the nature, meaning, and scope of “radical democracy” proves somewhat less than straightforward, so I will try to clarify terms here before setting out my rejoinder to Brown."
"26","Some commentators might suggest that in a general sense “radical democrat” is little more than a cooler‐sounding name for “social democrat” or “democratic socialist.”15 One can say in more precise terms, however, that there is an important tradition in political thought that aligns a Marxist critique of capitalism with a republican emphasis on political participation.16 Brown herself fits squarely within this tradition—though she has augmented it significantly with the addition of Foucauldian understandings of power—and she should certainly be labeled a “radical democrat” in this sense.         "
"27","Running at times parallel to, and at times intersecting with, this understanding of radical democracy, one finds “the project of radical democracy” as associated with the work of Laclau and Mouffe, and tied directly to the publication of their co‐written work Hegemony and Socialist Strategy (1985), subtitled “Towards a Radical Democratic Politics.” That work argues that the vision of socialism resting on orthodox Marxism is in crisis, and to back up that claim it offers a rather deconstructive reading of the history of Marxist thought. Laclau and Mouffe conclude that the rigid, class‐based economism of Marxism is no longer tenable, and suggest instead that the goals of socialism can only be reached through democratic means. But radical democracy cannot be fairly reduced to social democracy because the former insists that the social field can never be closed, that differential power relations can never be finally overcome, and, therefore, that “incompletion and provisionality belong to the essence of democracy” (Laclau 1996, 16). Equality, freedom, socialist utopia—these would appear on most accounts to be the final goals of social democracy. Radical democracy, however, insists on the impossibility of any telos for democracy:         "
"28","                        "
"29","Between the democratic logic of identity and equivalence and the liberal logic of pluralism and difference, the experience of a radical and plural democracy can only consist in the recognition of the multiplicity of social logics and the necessity of their articulation. But this articulation should always be recreated and renegotiated, and there is no hope of final reconciliation. This is why radical democracy also means the radical impossibility of a fully achieved democracy. (Mouffe 1992, 4, emphasis added)               "
"30","The confusion over “radical democracy” sets in after the publication of Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: the book inspires a whole host of other authors to take up the project of radical democracy (many of whom associate the project with Laclau and Mouffe, and not the earlier tradition defined above and of which Brown counts herself a member), while Laclau and Mouffe move on to independent writings that pull them in different theoretical and political directions. In her critique of radical democracy, Brown mentions the joint work of Laclau and Mouffe both parenthetically and in the footnotes, while she only ever refers directly in the text to one specific later article by Mouffe. Yet, on the basis of this article, Brown makes frequent reference to the problems with the “radical democrats.” Indeed, Brown consistently puts the name “radical democrats” in quotation marks. She means not to question whether “the project of radical democracy” exists but whether it is as radical as it claims to be: “what is difficult to discern in the work of those who have appropriated the name of ‘radical democrats’ in recent years is precisely where the radicalism lies” (1995, 11). In other words, Brown contests the very application of the term “radical democracy” to the work of Laclau and Mouffe, preferring to link that term with the older tradition of Marxist and republican thought.         "
"31","Through her brief reading of Mouffe's article, Brown accuses Laclau and Mouffe of a certain political idealism, which she describes as, “the promulgation of select political ideals de‐linked from historical configurations of social power and institutions” (12). She suggests that “radical democracy” treats the political sphere as completely autonomous from the economic sphere. It thereby focuses on “ideal” political goals and eschews the truly radical demands of a Marxist critique of the capitalist system of domination. Brown goes so far as to read Laclau and Mouffe's departure from and critique of orthodox Marxism as some sort of embrace of liberal‐capitalism:"
"32","                        "
"33","It is as if the terrible unfreedom and indignities attendant upon ‘actually existing socialisms’ of the last half century persuaded such thinkers that free enterprise really is freer than the alternatives, that alienation is inherent in all labor, and that freedom, finally, is a matter of consumption, choice, and expression. (13)"
"34","This conclusion makes clear why Brown would suggest that “the project of radical democracy” proves to be anything but radical: having given up on the Marxist critique of capital and by naïvely assuming a clean break between the economic and political spheres, the best that Laclau and Mouffe can hope for is a hollow, mainstream idealism about democratic politics against the backdrop of a given capitalist order."
"35","This reading of the “radical democrats” turns Laclau and Mouffe (Mouffe, by herself, cannot be the “radical democrats,” plural, to which Brown refers) into liberals who reject Marxism for its economism, deny the importance or necessity of transforming capitalist relations of production, and thus reentrench autonomous spheres of the political and the economic.17 But such a critique of the project of radical democracy simply cannot be squared with the work of Laclau and Mouffe, since it must wholly disregard the fundamental thrust of Hegemony and Socialist Strategy. That book works tirelessly, on my reading and I think on most others,18 to resuscitate a radically democratic yet thoroughly Marxist vision in the face of both neo‐conservative (i.e., what they would also call neo‐liberal) criticisms, on the one hand, and economistically reductionist Marxist orthodoxies, on the other. Despite Brown's suggestion that the radical democrats somehow do not prove their worth as good Marxists (certainly no one who embraces “free enterprise” can be much of a Marxist), Laclau and Mouffe insist on this point: “every project of radical democracy implies a socialist dimension, as it is necessary to put an end to capitalist relations of production” (178, emphasis added). Laclau and Mouffe rail continually against Marxist orthodoxies that would remain committed to the economism of a rigid base/superstructure model, with all the determinist, apolitical implications of such a model. But they simultaneously remain committed both to Marx's critique of capitalist domination and to the broader radical egalitarian goals of socialism, and they insist that any project of radical democracy must commit itself to transforming the relations of production.         "
"36","Laclau and Mouffe's Gramscian‐inspired rereading of Marxism as the practice of hegemony seeks, most significantly, to demonstrate the mutual imbrication of the political and the economic—to deconstruct the base/superstructure model and consistently to resist/reject any attempts to close up the space of the social. They refer to this last move, that which would “close” the social sphere, as the “final suture.” The suturing of the social sought by orthodox visions of Marxism always remains a totalizing teleological move, an ideal posited for the end of history. Laclau and Mouffe contend that any final suture must be avoided at all costs since precisely the possibility of democracy rests upon the very openness and unevenness of the social. The social remains “uneven” for Laclau and Mouffe because political groups always exist within a matrix of power relations, and power relations (unlike chemistry equations) can never be purely symmetrical or balanced. Taken in light of this background condition of the unevenness of the social, one sees that the lack of a final suture constitutes the conditions of possibility for democratic politics. It is for this reason, among others, that the project of radical democracy would never seek “simply to proliferate rights,” as Brown puts it (1995, 12). Laclau and Mouffe remain attentive to exactly those historical configurations of power that Brown signals as important; in fact, much of their book reads like a political and intellectual history of Marxism rather than a set of naïve (read “ideal”) political solutions.         "
"37","Brown's suggestion that the “radical democrats” assume a separation between the economic and political spheres thus misses the mark by quite a wide margin. Brown asks where the radicalism in their arguments lie, but for Laclau and Mouffe the answer seems clear. The project of radical democracy must be considered radical because of its departure from orthodox Marxism, on the one hand, and its continued commitment to challenging the domination and oppressive effects of capitalism, on the other. Laclau and Mouffe are radical democrats because they remain thoroughly committed to both socialism and democracy. And to continue the trope, this last commitment proves radical precisely because they see the convergence between democracy and socialism as the only possible realization of either."
"38","When she rather casually dismisses the project of Laclau and Mouffe Brown rejects an avenue to which she herself seeks recourse later on in her book, and she closes down a path that may very well lead to the same vision of political emancipation that undergirds Brown's own project for democracy. By turning to the more recent work of Laclau, I will try to demonstrate in the following section a possible way out, around, or through the impasse concerning rights in contemporary politics: Laclau's redescription and reinterpretation of the relationship between the universal and the particular in late‐modern politics provides one very significant alternative to simply proliferating rights or completely giving up on them."
"39"," Hegemony and Socialist Strategy sought to reconsider the history of Marxism and reenvision a radical democratic future for socialism. But, in a sense, the book almost immediately became out of date: just four years after its publication, the Berlin Wall fell. Emancipation(s) (1996) can be read as a partial, independent effort by Laclau to update the project of radical democracy. The book collects a series of Laclau's essays written between 1989 and 1995, essays that Laclau describes as “critical interventions” into concrete political events. As the title would indicate, Laclau shares Brown's interest in the meaning of political emancipation in late modernity: he wishes to reconsider the question of “emancipations” (plural, because there can be no single solution, no final destination for democracy) after the end of the cold war and during the subsequent outburst of ethnic and national conflict.         "
"40","Laclau seeks to counter a rather dominant post‐1989 narrative. That narrative suggests that the cold war was an epic, final battle between two competing universals; its end marks the victory of capitalism over socialist‐communism; thus, we reach the end of history with one universal emerging triumphantly (see Fukuyama 1992). Laclau refuses to lend this interpretation of recent political history the credence that might come from merely mentioning it directly—Fukuyama's name does appear twice in the book, but only in parentheses. Laclau interprets the end of the cold war as “the rebellion of various particularisms” (vii). The post cold‐war world does not celebrate the success of one universal; instead it witnesses the explosion of various and diverse particular battles against any and all totalizing ideologies.         "
"41","The idea of a victory of a single universalism (liberal‐capitalist democracy) must be rejected, according to Laclau, on two interrelated grounds. First, Laclau simply lists a few of the many political events of the early 90s that point to particularist challenges to any universalist claims—war in Yugoslavia, multiculturalism in North America, the rise of the Right in Western Europe (vii). If universalism has won out, then why does the world seem so much more fractured and fractious? This rhetorical question should not be taken as an empirical claim about the degree of violence in the post cold‐war world; it merely serves to emphasize that most of that violence is carried out in the name of particular identities, not universal causes or movements.         "
"42","Secondly, Laclau also gestures toward the critique of foundationalism, the challenge to the classical philosophical discourse of universalism. Laclau does not so much argue as take for granted the fact that various forms of postfoundational philosophy have challenged the vision and goals of classical universalism. In a powerful and important review of Laclau's work, Zerilli (1998)19 articulates this point that Laclau leaves implicit:         "
"43","                        "
"44","There is nothing that we all share by virtue of being human or of living in a particular community that guarantees a common view of the world; there is nothing extralinguistic in the world that guarantees that we all share a common experience; there is no Archimedean place from which we could accede to a universal standpoint. (8)"
"45","Here we have a rather straightforward rejection of classical universalism that rests on the notion that the closure, synthesis, or communitarian fullness posited by a universalist discourse can never be achieved in a world marked by contingency, relationality, and partiality. Consistent with the principles of radical democracy, Laclau does not merely make the pragmatic point that this ideal cannot be attained, he goes on to reject the ideal itself. According to Laclau, the totalizing closure of any universalist discourse would mean the very end of democracy.20 And this, again, is why the open‐ended and on‐going project of radical democracy diverges from democratic socialism.         "
"46","Laclau spends little time on the critique of philosophical universalism not because he disagrees with it, but because it is not his main concern. For Laclau universalism proves to be a particularly trenchant political problem in contemporary societies, yet the problem remains occluded as long as it stays tightly connected to the philosophical question of universalism. For this reason, Laclau has no intention of making extreme political pronouncements based on the deconstruction of classical universalism. He refuses to conclude from the postmetaphysical critique of universalism that “there is an implosion of all meaning and the entry into a world of ‘simulation'” (59). Laclau describes the triumph of either “communist society” or the “free world” as an attempt at a “final suture”—a closing down of the social that eliminates all particularity by positing a transcendent universalism. To counter this effort requires a rethinking of the universal, not a careless turn to the free play of pure particularisms.         "
"47","This last point proves crucial to Laclau's endeavor to reconsider the universal/particular relation, for in rejecting classical universalism Laclau denies the assumption that we just end up in a world of particularity. Laclau allows no room for misunderstanding on this point: “an appeal to pure particularism is no solution to the problems that we are facing in contemporary societies” (26). Laclau sees two significant reasons why the strong claim for a multiculturalism that would reject all variants of universalism on the grounds of pure particularism proves utterly self‐defeating. First of all, if one argues for a right to self‐determination for a particular group only from a foundation in the legitimacy of particularism itself, then one must accept any particular group's claim to a right of self‐determination. A principle of pure particularism rules out, by default, any form of exclusion. In one way, this seems like an emancipatory idea, but it turns out to legitimate the practices of all sorts of discriminatory groups—since they too would have a right of self‐determination. And this principle could be used in an attempt to justify the very acts of discrimination that the original group's claims to a right of self‐determination sought to overcome or eliminate. This means that pure particularism will always result in conflict, while the principle of pure particularism itself proves incapable of resolving that conflict—attempts at resolution would need to resort to some set of more general principles (26). Pure particularism proves either logically inconsistent or practically untenable.         "
"48","Yet the problems with a politics of pure particularism run deeper than this, and they help to explain Laclau's strong resistance to certain forms of multiculturalism. Even if one makes the unrealistic assumption that conflicts between various groups in society could be resolved (and without appealing to universal principles), pure particularism still turns out, in the end, to be a self‐defeating political starting point. If all political identities (group or individual) could establish themselves in a harmonious, purely particular relationship with one another, then those identities would be established only as differentials—only in their relation to other identities. But the relations between political identities are always, Laclau reminds us, relations of power. “That is, each group is not only different from the others but constitutes in many cases such difference on the basis of the exclusion and subordination of other groups” (27). Relational identities never exist outside a certain matrix of power, but if those identities are articulated only on the basis of pure particularism then they can never challenge the current configuration of power relations. In short, a politics of pure particularism results in conservatism, where the establishment of identity only maintains the status quo. Since a political identity has no ground outside of particularity for its existence and preservation, it cannot alter or transform the relations of power currently in play. Thus, pure particularism might only be viable in a realm free of power relations. And for Laclau such a realm could only be produced by a “final suture” a closure of the social that amounts to the very end of politics. Laclau compares this logic to the notion of “separate developments” in South African apartheid, but we could just as easily glimpse it in the Plessy v. Ferguson defense of separate but equal. And thus, Brown v. Board provides the critique of this very logic; “separate but equal” is inherently unequal precisely because it preserves inequality (what Laclau would call the unevenness of the social).21"
"49","If neither universalism nor particularism can serve as a logic for contemporary politics, where are we left, particularly with respect to rights? Brown's critique dovetails with Laclau's rejection of classical universalism, yet Laclau proves anything but optimistic about the politics of pure particularism. If rights imply an appeal to universal principles, can we simply give up on them? And what would it mean to try to maintain them? Answers to these questions, I contend, must begin with an apparently simple argumentative move that Laclau repeats throughout Emancipation(s). He stresses that we must not merely reject universalism or particularism but instead demonstrate the mutual imbrication of the two. By articulating the complex relation universalism/particularism, Laclau seeks to demonstrate that a selection of either universalism or particularism is a false choice. Rather than choosing one or the other, one must attempt a political articulation of the relation between them. It is precisely in his rethinking of universalism/particularism that Laclau's work offers insights into a political future for the discourse of rights.         "
"50","Laclau gives to that political articulation of the relation between the universal and the particular the name of hegemony. But the idea of democratic politics as the practice of hegemonic articulations is the conclusion to this story; before telling it, one needs to start by assessing the manner in which Laclau has rethought both particularism and universalism. The former reconceptualization proves fairly obvious since it depends upon Laclau's critique of a politics of pure particularism, which I elaborated above. Those criticisms make it clear that outside of the logic of apartheid, there can be no powerful political claims to pure particularism. Any appeal to particularism will implicate itself with the universal: “the right to difference … has to be asserted within the global community … that is within a space in which that particular group has to coexist with other groups. Now, how could that coexistence be possible without some shared universal values … ” (32).         "
"51","A claim to particular rights can never be simply a claim to or for particularity. When Laclau states that the “right to difference has to be asserted within a global community” he makes a redundant claim, since in it he simply argues that the right to difference has to be asserted as a right—that is, as a universal marker of some sort of shared humanity. Rights lay claim to the universal simply by being enunciated within a political context—given the background condition of differential power relations (28). We can conclude from this that there is no such thing as a purely particular right. There is no such thing as a special right; this is precisely why opponents of the demand for rights made by certain groups in society do all they can to get those demands translated into a claim for special rights. Rights may be, and will be, demanded or claimed by certain particular groups, but rights are exactly that which is not specific to one group but rather that which marks a group's membership and participation in some larger community (even though, as we shall see, that community can never be fully realized).         "
"52","But if particularism always finds itself contaminated by some trace or ghost of universalism, then universalism, in Laclau's analysis, must be thought of outside the terms of classical philosophical discourse. Though Laclau himself rarely mentions Foucault, Laclau's approach to the problem of universals mirrors Foucault's methodological guidelines for studying historical discourses. Foucault argues that we should look to discursive practices in history not in order to seek out some underlying, hidden, transcendent truth, but rather to analyze the strategies effected by those discursive practices and thereby to study the “regime of truth” produced by the discourse (1972, 1973). Laclau and Mouffe take a strikingly similar approach to discourse: “a discursive structure is not merely a ‘cognitive’ or ‘contemplative’ entity; it is an articulatory practice which constitutes and organizes social relations” (96), and Laclau makes a parallel methodological move when he rejects the search for a meaningful, substantive content to the universal (17).         "
"53","Laclau denies the possibility that there could be a universal that would hold no trace or remainder of the particular. This means that he rejects the modern, European concept of mankind as a universal, and, more significantly, that he denies such universal content without remainder could ever be achieved. As Zerilli's essay illuminates, in his thorough‐going critique of the universal/particular binary Laclau simultaneously rejects a false universal/true universal dichotomy. The problem is not that the modern European universal discourse happened to be exclusive (and carried out subjugating atrocities in the name of that universal). If that were the only problem, then the answer to it would simply be to locate or discover an all‐inclusive universal discourse. Laclau fears that certain strands of multicultural politics are mired in this hopeless search. The search proves to be in vain because the problem with the classical vision of the universal is not that it is a false universal but that any attempt at a fully reconciled and sutured concept of the universal must necessarily fail. The universal can never be divested fully of a particular; consequently, no political effort to achieve a “true” universal could be carried out without exclusion. “Universality is incommensurable with any particularity but cannot, however, exist apart from the particular” (Laclau 1996, 34). In other words, no particular identity could assimilate the universal to itself, and yet the universal will always and only emerge out of particularity.         "
"54","If the social remains both open and uneven (a full and final suture no more than a universalist dream), then the universal can have no fixed substantive content. Laclau embraces this seeming paradox by arguing that we reconceptualize the universal as an “empty” placeholder within political discourse: “if democracy is possible, it is because the universal has no necessary body and no necessary content” (35). This perspective on the universal allows Laclau to analyze its function in a post cold‐war world (to study the articulatory practices that produce the universal). In order to explain that function Laclau reintroduces his readers to the concept of hegemony, previously developed with Mouffe. Laclau and Mouffe seek to read the notion of hegemony both with and against the grain of Marxist thought and thereby to renew the concept for a world in which Marxist orthodoxies ring just as hollow as capitalist ideologies. For Laclau and Mouffe, this world needs a viable socialist politics, one that remains committed to challenging the logic of late‐modern capitalism while remaining sensitive to the political complexity of the contemporary situation."
"55","Laclau draws from that previous work the following conclusion concerning the relation between the universal and the particular: “in a climate of extreme repression any mobilization for a partial objective will be perceived not only as related to the concrete demand or objectives of that struggle, but also as an act of opposition to the system” (1996, 40). It is precisely the negativity contained within the demands of a particular group that gives those demands the potential to appeal to the universal (14). Laclau argues that the “opposition to the system” contained within particular demands always holds the possibility of linking up, through what he names a “chain of equivalence” (57), with other antisystem practices and protests. For Laclau, democratic politics today depends substantially upon the possibility of creating chains of equivalence.         "
"56","The extension of this chain of equivalence accomplishes two tasks. First, it prevents each particular demand from closing in on itself and remaining isolated from broader political practices. In other words, the chain of equivalences undermines a politics of pure particularism. But secondly, the connections between various particular demands point to a universal, but an “empty” one. Laclau explains:"
"57","                        "
"58","Precisely because community as such is not a purely differential space of an objective identity but an absent fullness, it cannot have any form of representation of its own, and has to borrow the latter from some entity constituted within the equivalential space—in the same way as gold is a particular use value which assumes, as well, the function of representing value in general. This emptying of a particular signifier of its particular, differential, signified is … what makes possible the emergence of ‘empty’ signifiers as the signifiers of lack, of an absent totality. (42, emphasis added)               "
"59","The universal emerges out of the intersection and even conflict between and among various particular discursive practices. Laclau defines hegemony as this emergence of the universal out of the particular: hegemony is the political articulation of the universal as an empty signifier by a particular group or groups. “Empty” must be thought somewhat novelly here: since the universal only emerges through the linking of particular (and very much specific) antisystem demands, then the specific content of the linked particulars is one condition of possibility for the emergence of the universal. Yet, maintaining the link requires the emptying of the specific content from the universal itself, as a second condition of possibility. The universal's emptiness is like a ghost: it is there yet it waits to be incarnated.22 Finally, this logic also entails that articulation be thought not as proclamation or enunciation by an individual or a group, but in line with the passage on discourse (quoted above), as a precarious relationship established through politics.         "
"60","These hegemonic practices of politics demonstrate the inextricable interconnections between the particular and the universal. These very links suggest that the universal is never truly empty: it “is an absent fullness, or rather … the very idea of fullness” (15). In other words, “the impossibility of a universal ground does not eliminate its need” (59); the argument for the “impossibility” of the universal does not reduce to an argument for the incoherence or unspecifiability of the universal. The concept of hegemony illuminates the universal/particular relation as one in which the universal emerges out of certain sorts of particular demands. Furthermore, a hegemonic articulation performs the function of filling the empty signifier—of giving, at least temporarily, the absent fullness of the community the form of a particular group's demand; “to hegemonize something is exactly to carry out this filling function” (44). The universal/particular relation is therefore best thought not as simply hegemonic (in a static way) but as hegemonized (in a dynamic and always political way). The relation between universal and particular must always remain open to renegotiation since the universal only occupies a place (an absent fullness) rather than providing a content. And as Laclau himself emphasizes, such renegotiation must be thought not as the subject of pluralist compromise and barter but on a more agonistic model of democratic politics.23 Indeed, Laclau argues that democratic politics must be a politics of hegemony, a politics that mediates the gap between universal and particular precisely through the production and filling of empty signifiers. “The recognition of the constitutive nature of this gap and its political institutionalization is the starting point of modern democracy” (46).         "
"61","I opened my argument by analyzing Brown's critique of the discourse of rights, demonstrating its limitations (in the broad dismissal of liberalism) and illuminating its oversights (in the rejection of radical democracy). I have now offered on alternative reading of the project of radical democracy by elaborating an understanding of hegemony as the political articulation of the universal/particular relation. To close the circle of my analysis I now need to show directly how this revised concept of radical democracy links up with question of rights. The goal of this final section will be to demonstrate that the theory of hegemony can serve to revive the discourse of rights in such a way as to elude the Brownian critique."
"62","Debates over rights today often boil down to claims for “equal” or “special” rights, with defenders taking up the former name and critics the latter. But the special and equal poles of these debates turn out in the end to be nothing more than opposite sides of the universal/particular dualism, and neither is politically efficacious: the equal rights pole proves problematic because it has no substantive content, and the special rights pole winds up politically bankrupt because it maintains the status quo and invokes the very logic of apartheid. Laclau's arguments for the politics of hegemony provide another, more viable way of viewing rights within contemporary politics. We can interpret rights as empty signifiers that mediate the gap between universal and particular. As such, rights might regain the critical political currency they seem to have lost within the terms of late‐modern liberalism. Indeed, the implication of my argument is that in order to maintain their viability and efficacy in contemporary politics we must interpret rights as empty signifiers.         "
"63","When political groups articulate their demands solely as particular demands (i.e., for their group) they simultaneously undercut their own political standing, and this for two interrelated reasons. First, we can combine the insights of Brown and Laclau to show that the assertion of what Laclau would call a pure particular, runs the risk of turning into what Brown (following Nietzsche) would call a reactive moralizing claim, one that eschews the agonistic terrain of politics for a discourse of victimhood. Even putting the problems of ressentiment aside, we can see that the purely particular claims of certain strands of multiculturalism hold no potential for sparking a hegemonic politics because the logic of pure particularism blocks the possibility of various groups’ demands linking up in a chain of equivalence. Second, and in more concrete political terms, we can see that the claim to or for pure particularism also lends itself more easily to the politically damning charge of “special rights.” I have tried to demonstrate the logical untenability—indeed, impossibility—of something called special rights, as rights always point toward or lay claim to something beyond the particular, but the logical absurdity of the concept does not alter both its existence and its political power within the rhetorical register. Much like “pro‐abortion” or “anti‐life,”“special rights” constitutes a discursive position that no political actor wishes to take up or defend. A demand for pure particularism, then, turns out to be logically untenable and politically dangerous.         "
"64","However, when a particular group uses the discourse of rights as a fund from which to formulate and assert their demands, then those very demands necessarily harbor some appeal to the universal. Yet that universal usually goes unspecified and lacks any concrete content; the universal toward which rights discourse gestures is an empty signifier. “In so far as these are claims presented as rights that I share as a member of the community with all other groups, they presuppose that I am not simply different from the others but, in some fundamental respects, equal to them” (Laclau 1996, 49, emphasis added). For a group to articulate its very difference through the discursive practice of rights necessarily entangles that difference in a chain of equivalence—in an appeal to some absent fullness (cf. Zerilli 8). In and of themselves, rights signify nothing more than this absent fullness; rights hold out the promise of a political community in which all are truly equal. But only the particular political demands—that is, the hegemonic articulation—of some group or groups can perform the function of filling this empty universal with a particular (but therefore never permanent) content.         "
"65","In today's political context, Laclau argues that “the universal emerges out of the particular demand not as some principle underlying and explaining the particular, [as would be the case with classical universalism, and with modern and cold‐war political ideologies] but as an incomplete horizon suturing a dislocated particular identity” (28). In turn, I would argue that the discourse of rights offers the only viable option for playing the role of the universal as empty signifier, for offering the hope to “dislocated” identity of a possible (yet never complete) suture—the American civil rights movement provides one obvious example. What I am suggesting here is not simply that Laclau's political reinterpretation of the relation between universal and particular can give us a better way of understanding the role of rights in contemporary politics (although I am arguing this as well, as I have suggested above), but also that the viability of hegemonic politics today depends upon the discourse of rights. So Laclau's analytic offers hope for respecting and dealing carefully with the critique of the discourse of rights without simply abandoning rights as worn out relics of modern thought and politics. Moreover, with respect to Laclau's own political project, we can see that rights serve as a necessary medium for practicing hegemonic politics."
"66","Elaboration of this last claim depends upon viewing the context out of which Laclau and Mouffe develop the concept of hegemony that lies at the heart of the project of radical democracy. They read hegemony out of the tradition of Marxism, so their examples of hegemonic articulation almost always remain rooted in class antagonisms. Thus, in their account the empty signifier toward which a hegemonic articulation gestures is typically class unity or a socialist utopia. The point I wish to make seems both simple and significant: in the face of the collapse of Soviet communism and the velvet revolutions of eastern Europe, class unity and communism are no longer viable or productive possibilities to play the role of empty signifier in a hegemonic politics.24 Rights, however, despite the dangers of the discourse that Brown so vividly describes, still hold great potential for the project of radical democracy. Brown shows how much rights have been devalued in contemporary politics, but they are still the primary currency in which such politics is conducted. Rather than discard them, as CLS scholars recommend and as Brown's critique sometimes implies, I contend that we must remanufacture or recoin them along the lines suggested by Laclau's work.         "
"67","It should be clear that making this recommendation does not entail a mere return to identity politics. To naïvely embrace a political strategy for more and more rights at any cost would prove just as politically dangerous (and potentially bankrupt) as an outright denial of any importance of rights. Brown's critique of rights must be heeded, but that very critique tends to leave its readers hanging—do we just give up on rights? Brown's criticisms need Laclau's revised understanding of the universal/particular relation in order to lend her critical remarks political motivation and perhaps political payoff. Laclau provides direction for radical political projects after withstanding the force of Brown's challenge to rights discourse.25 My answer, then, is that we cannot just give them up. But I am not recommending that one blindly follow Laclau's project either, for his position needs to be tempered by Brown's critique in order to be sustainable. I think that Brown's arguments also help one to avoid impalement on either the universal pole (contentless equal rights) or the particular pole (illegitimate special rights). When read into the terms of Laclau's political project, Brown's critique of the discourse of rights helps to prevent a specific political demand for rights from either (a) staying solely on the level of the particular or (b) jumping directly and illegitimately (because there is no ultimate ground or foundation to support that sort of universalism) to the level of the universal.         "
"68","Together, the works of Laclau and Brown offer an enlarged understanding of the role of rights in contemporary politics and their theories combine to explore the possibilities that the discourse of rights has in political projects geared toward some form of democratic freedom (cf. Bell 1992). So it goes almost without saying that the vision of rights that emerges here throws the contemporary discourse of rights in North America into sharp relief as exceedingly narrow. This vision can, in turn, make it possible both to illuminate and reexamine contemporary political events currently interpreted only through the frame of special versus equal.26 When read in the manner I have proposed here I think that Brown and Laclau provide both the motivation for furthering the democratic project and for challenging and reconstructing certain tools used within that project.         "
"69","Perhaps the convergent vision of “democratic freedom” that I just alluded to sounds like a vague goal, but it is one that Laclau and Brown share in ways that turn out to be very significant. Brown contends that contemporary identity politics—with its relentless effort to attain more and more bundles of rights and the concomitant rules and regulations that come with them—has constricted our view of political freedom, and she criticizes the concept of emancipation proffered by multicultural politics. She gestures toward a richer meaning of political freedom when she refers to “the dream of democracy—that humans might govern themselves by governing together” (1995, 5). Laclau, too, places a deconstruction of the modern notion of emancipation at the forefront of his recent work on radical democracy, and he suggests that the critique of emancipation may be what makes this sort of democratic freedom possible. He writes, “we can perhaps say today we are at the end of emancipation and at the beginning of freedom” (18). If rights have reached their end within the terms of liberal, multicultural, and identity politics, then their new beginning may be found within the project of radical democracy."
