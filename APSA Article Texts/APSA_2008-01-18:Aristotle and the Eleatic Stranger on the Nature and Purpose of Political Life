"1","Plato's Statesman recounts the Eleatic Stranger's attempt to define the statesman for Socrates and his companions. Taking as his interlocutor a young mathematician and gymnast also named Socrates, the Eleatic begins by suggesting that the statesman is a “knower,” to which no one objects.5 The Stranger splits the kinds of knowledge into practical and gnostic, that is, a knowledge which is bereft of action and limited to cognition (such as arithmetic), and a knowledge which brings things that did not previously exist into being (like carpentry). However, before determining into which category political knowledge falls, the Eleatic makes two other arguments.         "
"2","First, he observes that a ruler ought to possess the kind of knowledge necessary for his rule, but many actual rulers, in fact, fail to have this knowledge. Those private individuals who have the knowledge appropriate to rulers are capable of advising rulers on the basis of this knowledge and ought, therefore, to be called rulers. It is the possession of “the science which the ruler himself should have” that defines the ruler (259a7–8), even if most of those who are called rulers lack that knowledge. Therefore, rulers are not identified by the possession of office but by the possession of the appropriate knowledge."
"3","This argument is followed by the Stranger's contention that there is no difference between the kinds of rule of the statesman, the king, the slavemaster, and the household manager. He first narrows the range of possible differences by suggesting that there is no difference between a household manager and a slavemaster, nor between a statesman and a king. Then he observes there is little difference “in point of rule” between a large household and a small city (259b10); the only difference is one of size, thus implying there is little difference between despotic rule and kingly rule. There is but one ruling science, whether it is called “royal, political, or economic” (259c2–3; despotic rule drops out and is not mentioned again). It is only at this point that the Stranger returns to his initial question of whether the ruler's knowledge is gnostic or practical. Both of the subsequent questions have suggested that ruling is gnostic. If one may be rightfully called a ruler without having the power to rule, ruling cannot be a kind of knowledge which demands practical application. Moreover, having identified the types of rule, the Stranger is able to argue that, insofar as a king can do little for his subjects by means of bodily strength but must rather rely on “the intelligence and strength of his soul” (259c7–8), the knowledge of ruling must be primarily gnostic."
"4","The Eleatic Stranger's arguments about knowledge being the sufficient condition for rule and the identity of the kinds of rule convince Young Socrates to agree with the placement of statesmanship into the gnostic sciences, a placement upheld throughout the dialogue. Toward the end of the dialogue, the Eleatic praises him for recalling that “whoever has the royal science, regardless of whether he rules or not, must all the same, according to the previous speech, be addressed as royal” (292e9–93a1) and, later, reasserts that “that which is in its being royal must not itself act but rule those who have the capacity to act” (305d1–2).6"
"5","It is not surprising that the Eleatic Stranger would suggest, and that his audience would accept the claim, that the true statesman must be one who knows. The suggestion that political knowledge is gnostic rather than practical, however, is more puzzling, particularly insofar as the claims about the kinds of rule and knowledge as justifying rule seem to be made in its support. Why, then, might the Stranger want to make the claim that ruling is gnostic? First, the disappearance of despotic rule from the dialogue indicates the Stranger's desire to oppose the view, which will always have its adherents, that politics is simply about power. If ruling is a kind of gnostic knowledge, rule cannot be primarily a matter of force. The Stranger also wants to deny that the statesman brings the citizens whom he rules into being. He may shape or form them, through education and regulating the marital bonds which result in procreation, but he does not bring them into being as a carpenter does a table. Aristotle, in fact, agrees with this understanding: “political expertise does not create human beings but makes use of them after receiving them from nature” (Pol. 1258a21–23).         "
"6","Aristotle also agrees that the statesman possesses a form of knowledge, but he denies the Eleatic's three other claims: that there is no difference among the kinds of rule; that a ruler is defined solely on the basis of knowledge; and that the knowledge of ruling is gnostic. For Aristotle, the types of rule—political, kingly, household, and despotic—are distinguished according to the end of the ruling relationship: The initial relationships of male/female and (natural) master/slave are necessary for preservation (1252a26–28), and, similarly, the household—the community formed by these two earlier pairings—exists for the sake of daily life (1252b12–14). The village, a union of several households, similarly exists to secure “nondaily needs” (1252b15–16). Political rule, however, is unique to the polis, which comes into being for the sake of living but exists “for the sake of living well” (1252b27–30). Being directed toward different ends—preservation, needs of daily life, nondaily needs, living well—the kinds of rule differ not merely according to the number of those ruled, as the Eleatic suggests."
"7","Having distinguished the kinds of rule on the basis of the ends they seek to secure, Aristotle cites the Eleatic's position a second time (1253b16–19). Here, however, his intention is to go beyond simply distinguishing the kinds of rule and to arrange these kinds in hierarchical fashion. In particular, Aristotle wishes to emphasize that despotic rule, like parental and marital rule, is a part of household rule. Aristotle separates the use of slaves—despotic rule—from their acquisition (1253b20–1254a17), but also subordinates both the use and acquisition of slaves to household rule. As the usage of slaves is merely a part of household management, economic rule is not only different from but also superior to despotic rule. Aristotle says in this context, “A part is not only a part of something else, but belongs wholly to something else” (1254a10). Despotic rule, then, belongs wholly to household management. This devaluation is especially important, for despotism is a kind of rule which emphasizes power—particularly power over the goods and lives of individuals—and which Aristotle, like the Eleatic, is concerned to undermine, lest it lead to the despotic rule typical of Persia (1313b9‐10, 1324b11 ff.).         "
"8","Having shown that despotic rule is merely one part of household management, Aristotle denies the claim of the Eleatic a third time by observing that “all the sorts of rule are not the same as one another, as some assert. For the one sort is over those free by nature, the other over slaves, and household management is monarchy (for every household is run by one alone), while political rule is over free and equal persons” (1255b15–20). According to Aristotle, the kinds of rule differ not only according to their end, but also because of the kinds of people involved. He uses the three kinds of rule within the household cited earlier (1253b1–10) as his example: While slaves are to be ruled despotically, the wife ought to be ruled in political fashion, the children in kingly. The different treatments are justified by the absence or presence of the deliberative part of the soul, which the slave lacks, the female has without authority, and the children have incompletely (1259a37 ff.).7"
"9","This passage again emphasizes the ignobility of despotic rule, insofar as it is over those individuals who are slavish by nature. Moreover, Aristotle instructs household managers to pay greater attention to developing the virtue of free people rather than of slaves (1259b19–20). Despotic rule is something which economic rule disdains insofar as it “has nothing great or dignified about it,” and, so far as possible, the household manager turns despotic rule over to others (1255b33–37). Although Aristotle seems to make not only despotic but also political rule subordinate to household management, he soon indicates the priority of truly political rule: “For since the household as a whole is a part of the city … both children and women must necessarily be educated looking to the regime” (1260b13–16). The highest aim of household management is fostering virtue among free persons, but such virtue can be understood only in light of the polis. This conclusion recalls Aristotle's first criticism of the Eleatic Stranger's argument: The kinds of rule—political, despotic, economic—differ according to their ends, but they differ in such a way that there is a hierarchy among them, with political rule guiding the exercise of economic rule, and economic rule guiding despotic rule."
"10","By arguing that political communities are distinguished by the kinds of people participating in them, Aristotle also denies the Eleatic's claim that knowledge is the sufficient condition for ruling. The character of the ruler is as, if not more, important than his knowledge: “Now the master is so called not according to a science [he possesses] but through being a certain sort, and similarly with the slave and the free person” (1255b20–23). Despotic rule can be justified only when one has the proper nature to rule despotically and, perhaps even more importantly, rules only those who are suited for such rule. Obviously, Aristotle would agree that knowledge is necessary to rule well despotically, but knowledge alone cannot justify despotic rule. To impose despotic rule on those who ought to be ruled politically is wrong, for despotic rule looks primarily to the advantage of the master and only incidentally to the advantage of the slave, whereas correct regimes look toward the common advantage (1278b32–1279a21)."
"11","Having observed that ruling requires more than knowledge, Aristotle also explains that the kind of knowledge involved in ruling is practical, not simply or even primarily gnostic. In discussing business expertise, he asserts that not only knowledge but also “what relates to practice must be treated. All things of this sort have room for a free sort of study, but experience in them is a necessity” (1258b9–13). In other words, Aristotle recognizes that the kind of knowledge necessary for ruling well cannot be acquired only through study."
"12","Business expertise, according to Aristotle, requires experience because it deals with particular facts: the terrain, the climate, the demand for certain kinds of animals and vegetables. In this way, then, it resembles what Aristotle says in the Nicomachean Ethics about the intellectual virtue of practical wisdom, or phronēsis, which involves making good judgments “concerning some particular thing” (NE 1140a28–30). Phronēsis is inextricably linked with particulars “since it has to do with action, and action is concerned with particulars,” the knowledge of which can be gained only through experience and not through study (NE 1141b14–16). Indeed, it may even require the familiarity that comes with experience more than the knowledge that comes with study, which is why we often find that “some people who do not have knowledge [yet] who have experience … are more adept at action than others who do have knowledge” (NE 1141b16–18). But phronēsis is not only necessary for individuals; it is also a necessity for “those who manage households and handle political affairs” (NE 1140b10–11), and, therefore, the experience on which it depends is also necessary.8"
"13","In sum, Aristotle argues, against the Stranger, the kinds of ruling are not the same because (1) the associations differ in kind according to their end and not merely by size, (2) there is a hierarchy among them, and (3) people have different natures and souls, which demand different kinds of rule. We cannot define a ruler based only on his knowledge because whether one is a ruler also depends on the nature of both ruled and ruler, and whether he has acquired the necessary experience. Ruling, therefore, is not a purely cognitive activity."
"14","As we have seen, the Eleatic Stranger's only condition for legitimate rule is that the ruler has knowledge. Therefore, it is unsurprising that he indicates one essential criterion for distinguishing regimes, and it is equally unsurprising that Aristotle—who has a more expansive view of what goes into legitimate rule—critiques the Stranger's division when he offers his own classification: “Now an earlier [thinker] has expressed this view [a six‐fold classification of regimes] as well, though without looking to the same thing we do” (Pol. 1289b5–6).         "
"15","The Stranger offers a division of regimes as part of his attempt to distinguish “the greatest enchanter of all the sophists … from those who are in their being statesmen and royalty” (291c3–5). He argues that neither the number of rulers nor the way in which they rule is “the distinctive mark” which identifies them (292c5); rather, it is simply whether the rulers possess “a kind of science” (292c8). The best regime is “the only regime in which one might find the rulers truly with know‐how” (293c5–7). All but this true regime are ruled by pretenders who claim to possess the science but do not; they are sophists who merely imitate, as closely as possible, the best regime. All other divisions among regimes are subordinate to this one “distinctive” difference. The Stranger therefore rejects the conventional opinion, endorsed by Young Socrates, that regimes ought to be distinguished by looking “toward the forcible and voluntary, poverty and wealth, and law and lawlessness” (291e1–2; cf. 292a–c)."
"16","If the city ruled by “whoever has the royal science” is the one true regime, regardless of whether it is ruled by law or by force (292e9–10; cf. 293ab), neither the number of those being ruled nor the number of those ruling makes any difference, save for the impossibility of more than a few ever possessing the ruling science. Not even the relative wealth or poverty of the rulers matters, only the possession of knowledge. Young Socrates is agreeable to the suggestion of the Stranger, including the claim “that one must rule even without laws” (293e8–9). It is only when the Stranger intentionally provokes him—by painting vividly the consequences of such a doctrine, e.g., that such a ruler might justifiably engage in violent purges of the citizens (293d4–8)—that Young Socrates objects to absolute and unbounded rule. It strikes him, as perhaps it strikes us, that consent is a necessary component of legitimate government."
"17","Consent may be important for the Stranger—indeed, it is one reason why he admits lawful regimes are better than lawless regimes—but it cannot be a defining trait of the best regime. True rule is based on knowledge, and it is impossible, the Stranger says, for a multitude to ever acquire “any art whatsoever,” much less political knowledge (300e5, e9). To subordinate the true ruler to consent would be to subordinate knowledge to opinion, which is precisely the problem in the imitative regimes. In these regimes sophists, who know only how to imitate, copy the laws of the best regimes as far as possible, making use of trial and error, or experience, rather than knowledge (300b)."
"18","But this imitation, the Stranger warns, comes at a cost. No law can ever comprehend precisely what is best for every particular circumstance, although law remains—even in the best regime—indispensable for general guidance (295ab). A true ruler should not hesitate to deviate from or change the laws when he sees fit (295e, 296e–97c). Such a ruler can be found only in a regime “of a few, small, and the one,” while the other regimes “are to be set down as imitations, some imitating this [better regime] with more beautiful results, and some with uglier” (297b9–c1). However, because imitative regimes lack the capacity to recognize what is truly best for particular circumstances, they must adhere to the laws as written. Any attempt to maintain that flexibility appears tyrannical, because flexibility is easily mistaken for lawlessness (300b). Therefore, unlike the one true regime, imitative regimes “must never do anything contrary to the writings and ancestral customs of the laws that have been established for them” (301a2–4)."
"19","Having made the fundamental division between the true and imitative regimes, the Stranger now turns to consider the different kinds of existing regimes. He suggests that regimes are ruled by either one, few, or many, and each of these can be distinguished according to whether such rule is lawful or lawless.9 But the distinction according to lawful or lawless remains secondary to the distinction between the one true regime and all others (302e4–8) and becomes necessary only because of the conditions of human existence that prevent the realization of the perfect regime (302e).         "
"20","Of the six imitative regimes, kingship is the best if it is governed by good laws, but tyranny is the most difficult under which to live. The Stranger argues that “it's by far the first and best to live in the first regime [kingship], except for the seventh [true knower]” (303b2–3). It is possible that one person could acquire some amount of the knowledge necessary for ruling; his rule, when bounded by laws, would best conduce to securing the ends of the city. Without laws, however, the rule of one person is likely to be tyrannical and extraordinarily burdensome."
"21","Most people believe that no person could rule justly without law, which is precisely the kind of rule the true knower ought to have. In fact, the Stranger himself admits that “there is no king that comes to be in the cities, as we in point of fact assert, who's of the sort that naturally arises in hives—one who's right from the start exceptional in his body and his soul” (301d8–e2). In other words, the quality of the true knower's soul would not be visible because the body does not necessarily reflect the soul, as Aristotle observes (Pol. 1254b20–55a1). Even if the excellence of the soul were somehow visible, the multitude would likely be unable to recognize it because of their lack of knowledge. Because of their close resemblance, all three kinds of rule by one person look like tyranny (301cd).         "
"22","Even if it is not the best, then, lawful democracy may be the best which can be achieved, if we presume that the same arguments against the rule of one would apply against the rule of the few. Unlike the rule of one or few, offices in a democracy are dispersed among a variety of people, which means that it has little capacity for good or for evil (303a). It will not achieve much, but nor will it be burdensome. This makes it both the worst of the lawful regimes and best of the lawless regimes."
"23","But Aristotle, having argued that political rule is not primarily a matter of knowledge, denies that there is a regime based only on knowledge and offers an alternative division of regimes and a different assessment of their relative worth. He identifies tyranny, the opposite of kingship, as being “the deviation from the first and most divine regime” (Pol. 1289a40). Thus, from the start, Aristotle's scheme is compressed from seven to six regimes. Among these six, he alleges that an earlier thinker has divided the regimes in the same way, though according to a different standard, i.e., lawfulness (1289b5–7). However, he charges that his predecessor erred in considering each of these to be respectable, for no democracy, oligarchy, or tyranny should be said to be “better” but merely less bad than another.10 Aristotle again appears to be criticizing Plato's Eleatic Stranger without naming him.         "
"24","Aristotle begins with the same division as the Stranger—rule of the one, few, or many—which is again divided into two. For Aristotle, however, this division is based not on lawfulness, but on whether it governs according to the advantage of the ruler or to the common good (1279a26–31). When rule is for the common advantage, the rule of one is kingship, of few aristocracy, and of many polity. Those which govern for the sake of the rulers are said to be “deviations” and are, respectively, tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy (1279a31). Moreover, Aristotle begins, as he so often does, with what is conventionally taken to be the case, while the Stranger almost immediately rejects Young Socrates's approval of the common distinctions according to force, law, and money (292a10). Aristotle's distinguishing of regimes according to whether they serve the common good has the effect of legitimizing some existing regimes which are not ruled by the true knower. He believes that the kind of knowledge demanded by the Eleatic is not, in fact, necessary for a legitimate regime.         "
"25","Like the Stranger, Aristotle modifies his initial division, but the reason for, and manner of, his modifications differ significantly. Whereas the Stranger classified regimes not only according to the number of rulers but also according to whether they were law‐abiding, Aristotle distinguishes them in terms of the end or purpose they serve as well as the characteristics of the rulers and ruled. Immediately after the division according to number and advantage, he points out that the deviant regimes of oligarchy and democracy are defined not by number, but rather for whose advantage they rule. Democracy rules for the benefit of the poor, and oligarchy for the sake of the wealthy. Though it is almost always the case, it is accidental that the former are more numerous than the latter (1279b30–80a5)."
"26","Oligarchs and democrats are ultimately defined not by their economic status, moreover, but by their concept of justice. The former, being unequal in wealth, believe they ought to be unequal in all things; the latter, being equal in freedom, believe they ought to be equal in all things (cf. 1280a7 ff., 1301a25 ff.). This is consistent with Aristotle's earlier comments that more than knowledge is necessary for rule. Oligarchs and democrats justify their positions by making claims about what they are, that is, whether they are, or are not, equal."
"27","Like the Stranger, Aristotle recognizes that some regimes rule according to law and other regimes do not. But, Aristotle insists, law or law‐abidingness is not the fundamental distinction among the six regimes. While he concedes that “good management does not exist where the laws have been well enacted yet are not obeyed,” he emphasizes that it is “one sort of good management when the laws are obeyed as enacted, and another sort when the laws being upheld have been finely enacted (for it is possible that even badly enacted laws will be obeyed)” (1294a3–8). Aristotle admits that government by law is generally better than government by arbitrary decree, but he insists that the specific character or content of the laws is paramount and that the character and content of the laws will reflect both the knowledge and character of the people who make them. “Laws are necessarily poor or excellent and just or unjust in a manner similar to the regime [to which they belong]” (1282b8–9)."
"28","Because the content of the laws depends upon the character and wisdom of those who make the laws, Aristotle turns to the question of what part of the city ought to make the laws. The classification of regimes according simply to number is as inadequate as the mere division between law‐abiding and lawless. It is a matter not only of people's knowledge, or their relative conditions of equality, but also their relative levels of virtue. Aristotle undermines the claims of the few by championing the collective wealth—and, in at least some cases, virtue—of the majority over the few in deliberation and judging, and by observing that the claims the few make against the many can be made by the one against the few (1281a40 ff., 1283b20–35). Unlike the Eleatic Stranger, Aristotle believes that the multitude, while incapable of full virtue, may possess some level of virtue—such as military virtue, or perhaps even something higher (see Pol. IV.11)—and the rule of such a multitude is polity (1279a40–79b3). Aristotle gives the “good” rule of the multitude a different name from democracy to highlight its proper orientation.         "
"29","Because political life requires a variety of goods, it requires a variety of people who can contribute these different goods (cf. 1276b26 ff., 1277a4–12). Political life is a kind of human community, and all those who contribute to that community are citizens. And because of what they contribute, they not only make the claim to some share of ruling, but they are in fact justified in doing so. Those who contribute the most to the political community—those who contribute most to the “noble actions” of the city (1281a2–3)—“have a greater part in the city than those who are equal or greater in freedom and family … or those who outdo them in wealth” (1281a4–8). But the observation that the virtuous should have “a greater part” in ruling implies that the other groups in the city should also have some part in ruling. This is what leads him to propose the mixed regime, in which each part of the city has its distinct contributions recognized through appropriate offices. It is not merely instituted to appease some part of the city; rather, Aristotle says, the mixed regime is necessary because each part of the city does, in truth, have “some part of justice” in the claims they make (1281a9–10)."
"30","Aristotle's mixed regime also offers a solution to the problem, noted by the Stranger, created by the tendency of the ruling class to change laws to its own liking. Because mixed regimes do not allow one group to rule simply and directly in its own interest, they also tend to be ruled by laws that reflect some general consensus on the common good. Aristotle is therefore able to praise the rule of law, not that of human beings, as the best political regime: “it is laws—correctly enacted—that should be authoritative” (1282b2–3). Law is “intellect without appetite,” while asking human beings to rule “adds the beast,” insofar as humans cannot but be overcome by their passions in certain circumstances (1287a28–31). This is, of course, not as simple as it sounds, for Aristotle is aware of the limits of law: “laws are completely unable to speak precisely on account of the difficulty of making clear general declarations about everything” (1282b3–4). Virtuous individuals will be needed even in a regime of good laws, but the mixed regime provides necessary flexibility in the laws while avoiding the danger that the particular interests of one group will dominate the writing of laws."
"31","There may be circumstances in which there are people who are “preeminent in virtue relative to political leadership,” and when such persons arise it is “just” that they “have authority over all matters” (1288a17–18). But Aristotle concludes that “it does not accord with nature” for a part to be over the whole in such fashion (1288a27). Though such persons may exist, their rule would not be political, for political rule is of those who rule and are ruled in turn (1287b38).11 Aristotle's reservations about the rule of one individual are connected to his earlier argument about political rule involving more than knowledge alone. Political rule—that is, ruling and being ruled in turn—is necessary where the multitude contributes to the goods of political community. It is only when there is an individual by nature so superior to the rest of the community that the sort of rule endorsed by the Eleatic Stranger can be justified.         "
"32","Aristotle's division of the regimes, then, differs significantly from the Stranger's. First, because he does not consider rule to consist essentially in knowledge, Aristotle does not separate a seventh “best” regime from the six he divides. Second, Aristotle's division of the six existing regimes is based not on whether they are lawful or lawless, but whether they look to the common advantage. The kind of rule, as well as the people who rule and are ruled, are relevant to the division of regimes. And while both Aristotle and the Eleatic Stranger recognize the limits of the rule of law, they differ on whether the rule of law can be the simply best political regime. Aristotle proposes a mixed regime that can minimize the dangers of changing the law while preserving the benefits of having flexibility in the laws."
"33","Book I and the division of regimes in Book IV are Aristotle's only direct responses to Plato's Statesman in the Politics, but the differences that emerge are so fundamental that they have important consequences for the political theories articulated in the two works.12 One such consequence of the different understandings of politics is a different stance toward innovation.         "
"34","Because he both identifies statesmanship with knowledge and recognizes that very few, if any, inhabitants of a given city will have that knowledge, the Eleatic Stranger contends that once a city has the “second‐best” laws, it should not allow anyone to question them. His understanding of politics as a science thus leads to an extremely conservative practical stance. The Stranger's discussion of the rule of law concludes with a thinly veiled threat against one—perhaps like the elder Socrates—who would question the laws of a city. Any regime which is comprised of the wealthy and the multitude, i.e., the few and the many, would be incapable of discovering the truth about political life. The laws that they do have were based on experience, and any attempt to change them—since it cannot be based upon knowledge—is bound to be “for profit or private whim” (300a5)."
"35","Anyone who questions the laws, then, must be considered “a talker about highfalutin things, a kind of garrulous sophist,” insofar as he tries to imitate that which neither he nor anyone else knows (299b7–10). Such a person will be accused and tried “on the grounds that he's corrupting different people younger than himself” by convincing them to act “not in conformity with laws” (299b8–c1). The Eleatic argues that those who encounter such a talker will “draw up an indictment and haul him before a—what do you call it?—court of justice” (299c2–3). Plato's readers cannot help but be reminded of Socrates, especially when the Eleatic goes on to say that one who is convicted of persuading others contrary to the laws will be subjected to “extreme penalties, for he must in no way be wiser than the laws” (299c5–6)."
"36","Just as he questioned the legitimacy of rule without consent, Young Socrates objects that if the arts were not allowed to undergo change, they could not improve and “life, which even now is hard, would prove to be altogether unlivable” (299e8–10). The Stranger counters by arguing that to permit change in the laws is “a still greater evil” than to forbid change in the arts (300a6–7). Without the knowledge of the true statesman, a change in laws is more likely to result in a worse situation rather than a better. It would, the Stranger agrees, be best if a true statesman could be found and the laws changed to accord with new circumstances, but the “second sailing” requires that change in the laws be prohibited (300c2).13"
"37","Aristotle also takes a somewhat conservative stance toward innovation in politics, as is evidenced by his criticism of Hippodamus in the Politics for proposing a reward for “those who discover something advantageous for the city” (1268b23).14 In contrast to the arts, Aristotle recognizes, all changes in the laws have serious costs. “Change in an art is not like change in law,” he explains, “for law has no strength with respect to obedience apart from habit, and this is not created except over a period of time” (1269a16–22). Nevertheless, Aristotle recognizes that some changes in the law could be advantageous for the city.         "
"38","Though there is no formal discussion of changing the law in the Politics as we have it, there are hints throughout that Aristotle disagrees with the Stranger's rejection of any change in the laws. Cities often suffer from mistakes at their founding which will later require repair (1302a1–7), and a wise legislator will be able to identify the long‐term consequences of change (1303b26 ff.). At one point, Aristotle explicitly refers to a “second sailing” (again, ) as what is required when the lawgiver fails to constitute the regime properly from the beginning (1284b19). While the Eleatic believes the second sailing requires adhering to extant laws, Aristotle believes the second sailing requires changing the laws!         "
"39","According to Aristotle, political knowledge requires practical experience. Therefore, he observes, better regimes come to be founded only after people see the faults of defective rule. One of the explicit tasks for political science, after all, is the discovery of how to preserve regimes in existence (1288b28–34). The Eleatic recognizes that the rule of law itself was based on a kind of practical experience, trial and error. Aristotle suggests that the same kind of experience can and should produce incremental modifications and improvements in existing cities over time. Unlike the Stranger, Aristotle recognizes that the multitude's experience can be helpful in evaluating the possible consequences of political action, which is why the mixed regime makes use of the experience of the multitude in evaluating proposals (1282a14 ff.)."
"40","This difference between Aristotle and the Eleatic Stranger with regard to innovation and change in the law reflects a more fundamental difference in their understanding of the character of political knowledge. Aristotle's practical philosophy—that of the Nicomachean and Eudemian Ethics and Politics—is directed toward not only thought but also action. While the Stranger begins by asserting that the science possessed by the statesman is gnostic, Aristotle begins the Nicomachean Ethics by proclaiming that “every art and every inquiry, and likewise every action and choice, seems to aim at some good” (1094a1–2). But while theoretical sciences aim at the good of truth, the practical sciences aim at the good of action (1139a20–30, 1140b4–10). Inquiry into the practical sciences aims not simply at the acquisition of knowledge but at the improvement of our character and our actions.         "
"41","Having stated that political science is a part of the gnostic arts, the Eleatic tells Young Socrates that their procedure “has no more cared for the more august than for what was not” (266d7–10, cf. Soph. 226d–27b). This is, in short, a denial that their endeavor will be directed toward understanding action, which would be evaluated in terms of better or worse, not true or false. The perspective from which the Eleatic views politics is that of a theoretical observer, not a practitioner. The Stranger confirms this understanding later when he suggests that the search for the statesman has been undertaken not for its own sake so much as “becoming more skilled in dialectics about everything” (285d2–3). That the Stranger is relatively unconcerned with political matters is visible from his action as well as his argument: Unlike Socrates who remains in Athens, discussing political matters with the young, the Stranger travels from place to place, caring less for the moral than the intellectual improvement of those he encounters. Philosophy, for him, is and should be separate from politics.15"
"42","By contrast, at the very beginning of the Ethics, Aristotle declares that the responsibility for not only grasping the good but also attaining it “would seem to belong to the one that is most governing and most a master art, and politics appears to be of this sort” (NE 1094a26–28). At the beginning of Book II, he states quite boldly—without using his characteristic “seems” or “appears”—that “our present occupation is not for the sake of contemplation, as the other kinds of study are (for we are investigating not in order that we might know what virtue is, but in order that we might become good, since otherwise there would be no benefit from it)” (1103b26–29; cf. 1179a35–b2). As Richard Kraut summarizes it, the end of the Ethics indicates that the goal of the Politics is to discover “how the polis can contribute to human well‐being” (2002, 378).         "
"43","In Book IV of the Politics, Aristotle asserts that the function of political science, though proceeding—in part—from theoretical investigations, is practical: “the political expert should be able to assist existing regimes,” not merely to describe them (Pol. 1289a6–7). This sort of practical knowledge depends, in part, on theoretical knowledge, but the latter is insufficient on its own. Living well, for Aristotle, consists in the proper identification of aims and ends but also “discovering the actions that bear on the end” (1331b26–29). The excellence of a city is achieved not by chance or fortune but by “knowledge and intentional choice,” the putting into practice of what political science tells us (1332a31–32). The relationship between political theory and political practice is much closer for Aristotle than the Stranger.         "
"44","As has been seen, Aristotle and the Eleatic Stranger differ in significant ways, but at the root of these differences is something only hinted at thus far. It will now be argued that Aristotle and the Eleatic Stranger differ about politics because they differ, more fundamentally, in how they understand the order of nature and the relationship of that order to human life."
"45","The Eleatic Stranger presents his understanding of nature only through cosmological myth.16 Drawing on the traditional Greek tales about the age of Cronos and the transition to the age of Zeus, the Stranger's version of the story reveals less about the gods themselves than about the human condition in the world. In the age of Cronos, life was much easier; the god provided for the needs of all humans and beasts, and there was neither war nor faction nor savagery. There were no regimes or families, and food was provided spontaneously, without labor (271d–72b). Because the cosmos is not divine, it cannot always remain in the same condition, however, and the god has therefore had to withdraw his care. As a result, human beings must now fend for themselves until the god resumes his divine care, which will occur only when the cosmos is about to be destroyed by lack of order (273d).         "
"46","We now live in the “age of Zeus,” and the Stranger's characterization of human life in this age is “the point for the sake of which the whole speech set out” (274b1–2). When the god withdrew, the beasts grew savage and began attacking human beings, who were not only physically weak but also “without devices and without arts in those first times” (274c1–2). They did not have to develop such devices and arts before this because their needs were supplied by the god. The need for humans to develop the arts gave rise to the stories about the gods providing human beings with “instruction and education,” but the Stranger suggests that these are but “storied gifts,” and not the truth of the matter (274c7). Once the god withdrew from the universe, human beings “through themselves had to manage their way of life and their own care for themselves” (274d5–6). Humans find themselves in a hostile world, and it is only through devices and arts—like, for instance, politics—that they can be preserved.17"
"47","In light of this human need to preserve and care for themselves, the Eleatic sees, the primary task of the statesman is to keep the city safe, and any attempt to improve the citizens must be subordinate to that task. “Politics is understood by the Stranger,” according to Stanley Rosen, “almost exclusively in defensive terms, and the enemy is nature” (1995, viii).18 Because divine care has been removed from the cosmos (272b ff.), the Eleatic suggests through his myth that human beings are “weak and unguarded” (274b9–c1). Politics is about providing the necessary things, about the security of life. The Stranger posits a hostile relationship between nature and man: Not only statesmanship but all the arts are created in order to provide what nature does not and even to protect man against nature itself (274c ff.). The paradigm of weaving which the Stranger chooses to illuminate statesmanship (cf. 279b) is thus perfectly appropriate: Weaving is a defensive art, concerned with protecting the body—as are the Stranger's other analogies for the statesman, the doctor and the gymnastics coach (279cde).         "
"48","The right regime is one in which rulers employ “science and the just” (293d8–9) to keep the city safe and make it “better from worse to the best of their ability” (293e1). This passage is a critical one in determining whether the statesman is concerned only with the preservation of life or also with the promotion of virtue. Insofar as the Stranger says that statesmen must keep the city safe but that they only should improve the city “to the best of their ability,” it seems to emphasize the former task over the latter. The promotion of at least partial virtue is necessary for the safety of the city, but that is not the same as promoting the fullness of virtue, let alone promoting virtue for its own sake.         "
"49","Later, the Stranger says that good rulers are to “always distribute to those in the city that which with mind and art is most just, and can keep them safe, and make them better from worse as far as possible” (297a7–b3). The statesman's first task is to distribute what is “most just”[δικαιóτατoν], but the central question of the Republic—namely, what is justice?—is never raised, let alone answered, in the Statesman (cf. Griswold 1989, 159). When he laments that the legislator cannot write laws which are perfectly precise in regulating “the just and their mutual contracts” (294e10–295a1), the Stranger suggests that the laws ought to be directed toward securing justice in exchanges and contracts. As Aristotle notes, however, this is only one part of justice (NE 1129a 30 ff.). It is the sort of justice guaranteed by a league, which neither is a political community in the fullest sense nor makes its citizens just (Pol. 1280b20 ff.).19"
"50","Likewise, by saying that a statesman should “make them [those in the city] better from worse as far as possible,” the Stranger subordinates the attempt to improve the character of the citizens to the tasks of distributing justice and keeping them safe. Because of the limited sense of justice noted above and the subordination of improvement to safety, it seems that keeping the citizens safe is the primary task of the statesman, paramount for the Stranger's conception of political science. We should not be surprised, for the physical analogies of the physician, trainer, and weaver—however Socratic they appear—all deal with the care and protection of the body. Even the metaphor of the ship captain is limited to this minimalist approach: The good captain “keeps his fellow sailors safe and sound” (297a2).20"
"51","The Stranger describes the particular task of the statesman as weaving together the opposite characters of the manly and moderate so as to preserve the city. Again, however, although part of his weaving is the superintendence of education and the exiling of those who are unable to be educated, this education is not directed at the improvement of souls for their own sake.21 Rather, he is to use divine bonds, which are “true opinion with steadfastness about the beautiful, just, and good things” (309c5–6), to bind the city together to the extent possible.         "
"52","Although many commentators (e.g., Rowe 1995; Weiss 1995) suggest that this passage shows that the Eleatic Stranger, like Socrates and the Athenian Stranger, envisions the statesman as responsible for the care of souls, this conclusion is unsupported by the text.22 At no point in the dialogue does the Stranger suggest that it is the duty of the statesman or king to care for the souls of the citizens. In fact, the word “soul” appears rarely (four times) in the context of the statesman's weaving of moderate and manly; the terms “character” and “nature” are used more frequently. More importantly, to the extent that statesmanship is concerned about the soul and virtue, it is for the sake of the city's preservation and not for the sake of improving individuals.23 That is why the Stranger is content with fostering “true opinion” rather than knowledge about courage and moderation; the virtue that the statesman fosters in citizens is merely political, in both its content (opinion, not knowledge) and its end (the city, not the individual). Even Weiss concedes the statesman's concern for the soul is limited to what is necessary for the city: “The weaver paradigm is in its essence Socratic, as it assigns to the weaver direct concern with the just, beautiful, and holy—though the weaver is concerned with these as they pertain not only to individual souls but to the polis as a whole” (1995, 222, emphasis added). The bold claim of the Athenian Stranger—that politics is the art which cares for souls (Leg. 650b)—is nowhere echoed by his Eleatic counterpart.         "
"53","By contrast, positing the end of statesmanship as mere survival is not only consistent with the text but also allows us to understand the reasoning underlying the first, and perhaps most puzzling, claim of the Eleatic Stranger: All of the associations—despotic, household, political, and royal—are dedicated to the preservation of life. There is no difference between their ends but only the number of people within the association."
"54","Like the Eleatic Stranger, Aristotle connects his understanding of politics with his understanding of nature. And while he does not make use of myths, he fails to give a comprehensive account of how he understands nature, particularly in his practical philosophy. However, he does offer remarks that, when taken together, indicate an understanding of nature—in particular, nature's relationship to human life—very different from that of the Stranger. Aristotle sees nature as an orderly arrangement hospitable, rather than hostile, to human life; this allows him to have higher hopes and expectations for political life."
"55","Aristotle introduces nature early in the Politics, shortly after he cites the opinion of the Eleatic Stranger, and explains that he will begin by analyzing “how things develop naturally from the beginning” (1252a24). He traces the development of human communities, from the first partnerships of male and female and (natural) master and slave, through the household and village, to the polis, which “while coming into being for the sake of living, it exists for the sake of living well” (1252b29–30). In addition to emphasizing that the polis has an end different in kind, not degree, from the other partnerships, Aristotle wants to deny that political rule is artificial and merely conventional. He thus argues that “every polis … exists by nature,” developing out of the earlier communities (1252b30; cf. 1253a2).24 The polis exists as the culmination, or perfection , of those earlier communities, and nature herself, by granting human beings the unique capacity for deliberating about the just and advantageous, provides both the impetus and capacity for that development (cf. Miller 1995, 30 ff.).         "
"56","But such development would be unlikely, if not impossible, if the earlier human communities were not able to achieve an ever‐increasing amount of self‐sufficiency .25 This sufficiency, Aristotle argues, is made possible not only by human effort but also by a hospitable nature. He believes that there exists a hierarchical teleology in the order of nature such that plants are made for the sake of certain animals, and that some—if not all—of these animals are for the sake of human beings (1256b15–23; cf. 1258a35). We may use some of these for food, others for tools, and others for necessary materials—for instance, to take an appropriately Eleatic example, sheep for the wool necessary for weaving cloaks.         "
"57","The fundamental political problem, according to Aristotle, is distinguishing the rulers from the ruled (1332b23 ff.). In contrast to his more negative suggestion in Book I, Aristotle claims that nature “has provided the distinction by making that which is the same by type have a younger and an older element, of which it is proper for the former to be ruled and the latter to rule” (1332b35 ff.). Young citizens, endowed with strength, are well suited for military service, which enables them to acquire the necessary experience of being ruled before they become rulers. Having gained experience in practical matters, they will develop the necessary prudence to deliberate well regarding the advantageous and judge justly in their middle age (1329a2 ff.). Later in life, they will serve as priests, for it would be improper for anyone other than citizens to honor the gods (1329a26 ff.). The natural growth of human beings—in soul and intellect as well as body—provides the necessary distinctions so that a polis can be harmoniously arranged.26"
"58","To be sure, Aristotle recognizes that nature, in fact, can fail to achieve her intentions and that these failures can have pernicious consequences for human life.27 What is significant, however, is that Aristotle describes these as failures. The implication, then, is that when nature does achieve her purposes, it is in such a way as to be hospitable toward human life.         "
"59","According to Aristotle, therefore, nature is far from hostile toward human life. Rather, it is generally hospitable to human life and so makes possible a human community which can be concerned with something more than the merely necessary. This community is the polis, a compound of families and villages which enables human beings to live “happily and finely … for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together” (1280b40–81a3). The political ruler is therefore to legislate for the goods of both body and soul, but particularly for the goods of the soul (1333a37–40). Indeed, legislation for the goods of the body, while necessary, is for the sake of the good of the soul (1334b24–28). Associations which are solely for the bodily goods—such as those which defend each other (1280b9–10, 25–26) or promote commerce (1280b21–23, 31)—are not truly cities (1280b7–8). Such cities may guarantee “just things” in exchanges but they do not “make the citizens good and just” (1280b11–13). Rather, the city must exist “primarily for the sake of living well” (1280a32), and this is why people “strive to live together even when they have no need of assistance from one another” (1278b19–20). By contrast, the Eleatic Stranger indicates that in the Age of Cronos, when there was no human neediness, there were no political communities  (271e8).         "
"60","If nature were as hostile as the Eleatic portrays it, it would be difficult to understand how human life could transcend the necessary in pursuit of the noble. We nevertheless live in a world in which modern science has largely displaced Aristotle's understanding of an ordered cosmos. How then can we understand or maintain a view of politics as anything more than a means of collective self‐preservation? In order to provide a basis for a nobler understanding of political life, Stephen Salkever has attempted to provide a defense of Aristotelian teleology on the level of individual species that is not “inextricably bound to a false cosmology” (1990, 39; cf. 49 ff.). He argues that Aristotle's “concept of the human good” is dependent not upon “assumptions about the world that are no longer tenable,” but rather “a way of life that is definitive or normal for us as a species.” This conception of the good requires no more than accepting that individuals are members of a species, “a group defined by certain norms that are really there in nature” and discovered through “empirical inquiry” (53). He suggests such a view of nature is more consonant with Aristotelian ethics and politics than a deterministic cosmological teleology which would “rigidly override the problematic character of most important human choices” (39). However, Salkever himself admits that contemporary critics would “quite correctly” allege that Aristotle's approach to political life is one which presupposes “a particular conception of human nature and nature simply” (58, emphasis added).28 And it is not so clear that human nature can be separated from the broader “nature simply” of which it is a part.         "
"61","One of the traits which typify human nature is, according to Aristotle, a natural desire to know (Meta. I.1). This desire is satisfied by the acquisition and use of the intellectual virtues, whose exercise is frequently presented as the highest form of human activity (e.g., NE 1177a12 ff.). And it may be impossible to defend Aristotle's contention that perhaps the highest form of human existence is this bios theoretikos, i.e., the contemplation of eternal beings, without defending his teleological cosmology.29 In the Ethics Aristotle maintains that there are things which are known “by necessity” and therefore must be “everlasting” (1139b22). Wisdom is said to be knowledge of “the highest things in the cosmos” (1141a25), which are “most honorable in their natures” (1141b3); it is, therefore, “the most precise kind of knowledge” (1141a17). (By contrast, as we have seen, the Eleatic Stranger denies that the cosmos is ever in the same condition.) Aristotelian philosophy depends, then, on a conception of the heavenly bodies as eternal and orderly and so capable of apprehension by human reason.         "
"62","More pertinently, as Aristotle makes clear in the Politics, human life cannot be discussed in isolation from the rest of nature. Human beings, although they have a nature particular to their species, are a part of the natural world in which they reside, and Aristotle always discusses them in that light. The natural environment in which humans find themselves is significant for the way of life they choose to pursue as a community. Salkever fears that a teleological conception of nature might remove the problematic, and so political, characteristics of human choice. However, nature does no more than determine the framework in which human choice occurs, but that framework makes possible human flourishing. Although nature provides adequate resources for human life, humans—unlike animals (1256a25)—are required to choose how to put those resources to use (1256b1–10, 1332b3–5, cf. NE 1152b26–1153a15, 1154b21–31). Deliberation about the way in which it is best for particular communities to do so is, after all, one of the hallmarks of human speech (1253a9–19, 1255b30–56b5). In this way, then, Aristotle's conception of the hospitable relationship between nature and humanity is in the mean between the extremes as depicted by the Eleatic Stranger in the Age of Cronos on the one hand and the Age of Zeus on the other.         "
"63","To be sure, not all modern thinkers would accept such a hospitable view of nature; but neither, as we have seen, did all ancient philosophers. Obviously, people who believe in a benevolent creator would accept such a cosmology. From a secular and scientific perspective, however, it may be more important to observe that such a hospitable view of nature also animates much contemporary environmentalism. Like Aristotle, environmentalists now argue that the earth would provide for us quite adequately if we were willing to limit our desires and acquisitions. The problems arise from a widespread inability to distinguish between the kind of acquisition or use that is both natural and necessary and the unlimited kind of acquisition or expropriation contrary to nature—precisely the topic discussed in Book I of the Politics.30"
"64","Aristotle's critique of the Eleatic, then, flows from his fundamentally different beliefs about nature. Indeed, the differences go deeper than beliefs about human nature and are rooted in different conceptions of nature in its broadest sense. For Aristotle, the statesman differs from the household manager and the despot insofar as the former deals with political life, which is directed toward the noble and not merely the necessary. The associations of household and village are necessary to secure the goods required for life, but because nature is hospitable these associations are able to develop into the political community, in which the necessary can be transcended in pursuit of the noble. The Eleatic, because of the overwhelming threat posed by hostile nature, sees only necessity in all forms of rule and thus does not distinguish among them or their ends. Aristotle's emphasis on the end of regimes, not their mere form, accords with his view that regimes can not only preserve life but can also promote the good life.         "
"65","Likewise, the Eleatic—concerned only with the preservation of life—is more skeptical of change in the laws than is Aristotle, who is concerned with the quality of life of the polis. And because the ends of political life are so low, the Eleatic remains above and uninterested in politics. Aristotle, on the other hand, sees inherent nobility in political life, which is why he is concerned with its actuality and not merely in its ideal form or as an object of abstract inquiry. This difference explains why Aristotle opens the Politics with a critique of the Eleatic Stranger: Insofar as the Athenian Stranger and Socrates agree with Aristotle on the ends of political life and the way in which politics involves caring for the soul, Aristotle's disagreement with the Eleatic is more fundamental.         "
"66","The Eleatic Stranger's depiction of a hostile nature which makes necessary a politics of preservation anticipates certain aspects of early modern political theory. Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Locke all begin from a state of nature in which man is driven by scarcity and conflict to join a political society. Politics is an attempt to escape nature, rather than to fulfill it. A hostile nature demands the full attention of political society, and the aims of politics are necessarily lowered, from the achievement of virtue to the securing of preservation. In short, the demands of life take priority over living well.31 A rejection of the teleological view of nature, then, seems to lead to a minimalist politics concerned with preservation.         "
"67","On the basis of his critique of the Eleatic, Aristotle can serve as a more trenchant critic of modern liberalism than perhaps expected. It is less of an anachronism to put Aristotle into dialogue with modernity, because he confronted views which bear some resemblance to those of Hobbes and Locke. However, at the same time, an emphasis on his teleological understanding of nature also makes the return to Aristotle's politics more difficult than most people are willing to recognize because that understanding has been questioned by modern science. This makes it important for those who wish to return to Aristotle to discover to what extent his politics depends on his teleology and to what extent and in what form that teleology remains tenable today.32"
