"1","There are three players: a representative citizen, an (elected) executive, and members of the communities whose actions can affect terrorism prevention. For simplicity, we will refer henceforth to the latter as the community. The executive chooses a level of (repressive) counterterrorism activities that we denote by . The community also chooses a level of activities to reduce terrorism, which we denote by . Since terrorism prevention is an explorative activity that entails detecting and disrupting terrorist plots before they mature into attacks, counterterrorism tactics such as drone strikes, coercive interrogations of suspected terrorists, or various surveillance activities are conducted in secrecy.7 Thus, the executive and the community choose their actions simultaneously.8"
"2","Terrorism occurrence is a binary variable;  denotes a successful terrorist attack and  no terrorist attack. The actions of the executive and the community translate into a probability of a successful terrorist attack, given by the function . This probability decreases in both arguments, and it is convex in both s and i (i.e., there are decreasing marginal returns to terrorism prevention in both i and s:  and ). For simplicity of exposition, we assume that the cross‐partial .9"
"3","Let  be the executive's payoff if the outcome is . The executive prefers that no terrorist attack occur, and we denote the size of the utility difference by . The executive also cares about reelection and receives an additional payoff R if and only if reelected. Finally, a function  measures the cost of engaging in counterterrorism activities. This cost is increasing in s (i.e., ) and is strictly convex in s (i.e., ). We also assume that  and that .10 In summary, the executive's utility is            "
"4","The community can also affect terrorism prevention by choosing a level of antiterrorism activities i. In practice, there is a range of community actions that reduce the threat posed by terrorism. For example, community members can discourage fellow members from providing active and passive support to terrorist groups, thus reducing the terrorists' ability to operate and plan attacks. They can also actively discourage extremism and violent activities, thus increasing the costs of terrorism by making it a less acceptable activity. Community members can provide information to executive officials about suspicious activities as well as about individuals who might be attracted to radical ideas, who might be connected to terrorists, or who are actively planning a terrorist attack. Indeed, numerous researchers and security officials have underscored this aspect of community intelligence. Wilkinson writes that co‐opting the communities to provide intelligence is the “secret of winning the battle against terrorism in an open society” (2006, 61).         "
"5","However, repressive policies are likely to undermine the legitimacy of counterterrorism efforts in the eyes of the targeted communities (Art and Richardson 2007; Bueno de Mesquita and Dickson 2007; Cole 2005; Donohue 2008; Richardson 2007; Rosendorff and Sandler 2004; Siqueira and Sander 2006; Sthol 2006; Wilkinson 2006). Harsh and indiscriminate policies such as drone strikes, ethnic profiling, tougher immigration measures, surveillance directed at certain ethnic and religious groups, suspension of habeas corpus rights, preventive detentions, and coercive interrogations can create a perception that liberal democracies have double standards, rendering members of the targeted communities far less likely to help terrorism prevention. Indeed, recent empirical research indicates that the perceived legitimacy of counterterrorism efforts is the primary factor shaping the willingness of the members of the Muslim minority communities in the United States (Tyler and Huq 2010) and in the United Kingdom (Huq, Tyler, and Schulhofer 2011) to help the efforts of terrorism prevention.11"
"6","To capture these ideas, we assume that a higher level of (repressive) counterterrorism activities, s, induces community members to care relatively less about terror prevention. Technically, we assume that  (i.e., the community shares the objective of terrorism prevention), but  (higher level of [repressive] counterterrorism activities reduces the intensity with which the community members care about terrorism prevention).         "
"7","Also, the function  measures the cost of the community for engaging in terrorism prevention activities. We assume that the cost function is increasing in i (i.e., ) and is strictly convex in i (i.e., ). We also assume that  and that . In summary, the community's utility is            "
"8","Alternatively, we can formalize the intuitive idea of a negative effect of (repressive) counterterrorism activities by assuming that the community's preference for reducing terrorism is independent of s but that the community's marginal cost for terror prevention activities increases with an increase in s, all else equal. That is, the community has a cost  with a positive cross‐partial, . Both formulations are plausible. In the analysis, we use the first formulation although the results are identical if we use the second one.12"
"9","Given the interaction between the executive and the community, the representative citizen observes whether a terrorist attack occurs or not and then makes a binary decision whether to reelect or not to reelect the executive. The representative citizen's utility from reelecting the incumbent executive is , where W can be thought of as the utility from nonpolicy attributes (i.e., a valence parameter) and where W is a random variable when the executive chooses s. We assume that  is decreasing in T (i.e., the representative citizen dislikes terrorist attacks), and increasing in W. The representative citizen's utility from electing the challenger is .13"
"10","We start with the analysis of the election stage, which is very simple. The representative citizen reelects the incumbent executive if and only if . For each , , there exists a critical level, , such that the executive is reelected if and only if . Because  is decreasing in T and increasing in W, it follows that . Let  denote the probability that the representative citizen reelects the executive when . Note that  implies . That is, the reelection probability is higher if the executive is more successful in preventing a terrorist attack, a result that has received empirical support.14"
"11","We use a simple probabilistic voting rule for the representative citizen because our primary focus is to assess the security rationale for executive discretion, which presumes that increased electoral incentives to prevent a terrorist attack induce the executive to choose optimal security policies. In the appendix, we provide a micro‐foundation for our reelection rule in a framework in which the policy outcome provides information about an unknown level of the executive's competence to prevent terrorist attacks and in which the representative citizen is prospectively rational in the sense that her goal is to maximize future utility."
"12","In this section, we analyze the game in which the executive has discretion to choose any action it finds optimal to reduce terrorism, without facing any legal constraints; we label this interaction the discretionary executive game. In the next section, we analyze the game in which the executive faces some legal limitations on its actions; we label this interaction the constrained executive game. We compare the equilibria of the two games in terms of how the executive achieves the objective of terrorism prevention and how the probability of a terrorist attack changes when the executive faces increased electoral incentives to provide security from terrorism."
"13","As mentioned, we can summarize the election stage by q1 and q0, which denote the reelection probabilities if  and if , respectively. Substituting  in 1 and rearranging it gives us the executive's objective function:            "
"14","We now solve for the Nash equilibrium of the discretionary executive game. Maximizing the executive's objective function, equation 3, implies that its optimal action is the solution of the first‐order condition:            "
"15","The executive's objective function is strictly concave in s because the second derivative is negative. Thus, there is a unique optimal s. The community's objective function 2 is also strictly concave in i, and thus the unique optimal i is the solution of the first‐order condition:            "
"16","The equilibrium of the game is the solution to the system of equations 4 and 5. Because 4 is independent of i and because there is a unique solution of 5 for every value of s, there is a unique equilibrium. We have the following proposition:            "
"17","Proposition 1.The discretionary executive game has a unique pure‐strategy Nash equilibrium.               "
"18","The two players' response functions and the resulting equilibrium are shown in Figure 1. Applying the implicit function theorem to equation 5, we can find the slope of the community's best response function to be            "
"19","Since the game has a unique pure‐strategy Nash equilibrium, we can perform a comparative static analysis on how changes in the executive's electoral incentives to provide more security from terrorism (i.e., increased Q) affect the players' equilibrium actions and the equilibrium probability of a terrorist attack. Applying the implicit function theorem to equation 4 gives            "
"20","The preceding expression is strictly positive, and therefore an increase in Q shifts the executive's best response function to the right in Figure 1. Intuitively, the increased responsiveness of the representative citizen to successful terrorism prevention means that the executive now prefers to choose a higher level of (repressive) counterterrorism activities, s. The same logic applies to an increase in R, the executive's payoff from being in office. As a consequence, the equilibrium changes from  to ; and while the equilibrium value of s increases, the equilibrium value of i decreases.         "
"21","Because the security‐enhancing aspect of a higher equilibrium level of s is counteracted by a reduction in the equilibrium level of i, the overall effect on the equilibrium probability of a terrorist attack depends on which one of these effects is more important. Proposition 2 provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the equilibrium probability of a terrorist attack to increase if the executive's electoral incentives to provide security from terrorism increase.            "
"22","Proposition 2.When the executive faces increased electoral incentives to prevent a terrorist attack, the equilibrium probability of a terrorist attack increases if and only if                  "
"23","Proof.See the appendix."
"24","Both the left‐hand side and the right‐hand side of expression 7 are positive. Therefore, for the probability of a terrorist attack to go up when the executive has more electoral incentives to prevent a terrorist attack, the decrease of the community's action, i, must outweigh the increase in the executive's action, s. This is more likely if  is small in absolute value, so that the direct effect of the executive's action is limited; if  is large in absolute value, so that the reduction of the community's action has a large effect on the probability of an attack; if  is large, so that the negative marginal effect of executive action on the community's goodwill is significant; and if  is small, which implies that the community's objective function is not very concave, and thus marginal parameter changes in the community's optimization problem have a large effect on the optimal value of i.         "
"25","Also, the extent to which the executive reacts to increased electoral incentives depends on how secure the executive is of her reelection. Both an executive who is very secure and one who has only a very small chance of reelection will respond less to increased electoral incentives than an executive in a very competitive electoral situation. However, this matters only for the size of the effect on security, not for its direction."
"26","As mentioned, some researchers argue that executive officials should have legal flexibility of action because elections induce correct incentives in terms of choosing efficient security policies. That is, executive officials will do their best to maximize security if this is what citizens want. In particular, if the executive knows about the negative effect a higher level of s has on the incentives of the community, the executive will refrain itself from choosing an inefficient level of s. Proposition 2 suggests that this rationale for executive discretion is not necessarily correct. When the executive has increased electoral incentives to prevent terrorist attacks, the executive will do more of what is under its control (i.e., increase s), irrespective of the effect on i because what matters for the community is the expected level of s, not the chosen level. As a result, the executive does not have a marginal incentive to restrain itself in order to achieve more cooperation from the community. For this reason, stronger electoral incentives may not produce efficient security policies, as often assumed.         "
"27","The previous analysis suggests that when the executive responds to increased popular demands to provide more security and has legal flexibility to choose any policy it finds optimal, security from terrorism can actually decrease. In this section, we show that there is a security rationale for having some legal limits on executive counterterrorism actions. To this end, suppose that there is a legal limit  such that the executive can only choose a counterterrorism level of activities  where  is smaller than the equilibrium choice in the discretionary executive game, .15"
"28","As mentioned, we label the interaction in which the level of counterterrorism activities is limited (i.e.,  such that ) as the constrained executive game. The following proposition shows that there is a range of such limits that result in a higher utility for the executive as compared to the discretionary executive game.            "
"29","Proposition 3.There exists an interval  such that the executive's utility is strictly higher when  than in the discretionary executive game.               "
"30","Proof.See the appendix."
"31","Proposition 3 shows that some legal constraints on s are desirable even from the executive's perspective. The reason is that such a constraint ameliorates the problem identified in the previous section in that the executive is in some sense too aggressive for its own benefit and cannot restrain itself when facing increased electoral incentives to provide security from terrorism. The restriction  provides a credible constraint on the executive. It encourages cooperation by the community, which, for the executive, has large positive benefits while only leading to relatively minor direct losses from the decrease in the level of s.         "
"32","We next analyze how the executive achieves the objective of terrorism prevention in the constrained as compared to the discretionary executive game. In this context, let the executive's utility from terrorism prevention be defined as the benefits minus the costs of terrorism prevention, .16 We have the following result:            "
"33","Proposition 4.The utility from terrorism prevention, , is higher in the constrained executive game than in the discretionary executive game.               "
"34","Proof.See the appendix."
"35","Proposition 4 suggests that the executive achieves the objective of terrorism prevention more effectively when there are some legal limitations, , on executive actions. Because of reelection concerns, the executive's incentive to prevent a terrorist attack is somewhat excessive in the discretionary executive game in that the executive will choose a higher level of s than what is optimal for terrorism prevention. Proposition 4 then shows that it is beneficial for the objective of terrorism prevention to restrict the executive by more than the executive would prefer if the executive were to have legal flexibility of action.         "
"36","James Madison argues in Federalist 57 that an ideal representative is one who cares about the public good but nonetheless is also responsive to electoral concerns. Note that we can think of the executive in our model as a Madisonian representative; that is, the executive's utility in equation 3 is such that the executive cares about terrorism prevention, the public good, and reelection.17 Proposition 4 suggests that even in such a rather ideal situation for executive discretion, the objective of terrorism prevention is better achieved if there are some legal limitations on executive power.         "
"37","Propositions 3 and 4 show that it is beneficial to have a legal limit  on the executive counterterrorism actions. Next, we analyze a situation in which there might be a need to adjust the rules that govern the policy intended to prevent future terrorist attacks (i.e., ) as citizens demand more security from terrorism because of external shocks such as a large‐scale catastrophic terrorist attack.18 In the discretionary executive game, we showed that increased electoral incentives to prevent terrorist attacks can lead to an increase in the equilibrium probability of a terror attack. Proposition 5, in contrast, shows that, in the constrained executive game, increased electoral incentives translate into a reduced equilibrium probability of a terrorist attack if the restriction  is adapted optimally to the new demands.            "
"38","Proposition 5.Increased electoral incentives to provide security (weakly) decrease the equilibrium probability of a terrorist attack in the constrained executive game.               "
"39","Proof.See the appendix. "
"40","Propositions 2 and 5 have implications for designing decision‐making procedures when there may be a need to redraw the scope of governmental powers in order to respond to popular demands for security. That is, there can be external shocks, such as large‐scale terrorist attacks, shocks that may require a readjustment in the scope of individual rights and consequently restrictions on executive power because citizens want more security.19 However, even when citizens want a readjustment in the balance between security and liberty, Propositions 2 and 5 suggest that it is not necessarily security‐beneficial if the executive decides on the scope of governmental power.         "
"41","Overall, our results suggest an efficiency rationale for legal limits on executive counterterrorism actions. The intuition for why some limitations on executive power help is as follows. In the discretionary executive game, the executive chooses its optimal action such that the direct benefits and costs of the marginal unit of s just balance each other. In equilibrium, the executive knows that a higher level of s has a negative effect on the community's incentives; however, the executive cannot credibly restrain itself when facing increased electoral incentives to provide security from terrorism. A known legal limit on executive actions can serve as a commitment device when the executive has incentives to respond to popular demands for more security.20"
"42","We obtain our results in a framework where the electoral incentives to provide security from terrorism are provided solely on the basis of the (observed) policy outcome: a terrorist attack or no terrorist attack. Scholars have also argued that a public perception that the executive is tough on fighting terrorism has its own electoral rewards. Such a public perception can create incentives for the executive to undertake even a higher level of antiterrorism activities as compared to the equilibrium level of s in the discretionary executive game.21 Modeling such additional electoral incentives then can only increase the policy inefficiency documented in Proposition 2 and thus strengthens our argument for some limitations on executive power.         "
"43","In the online supporting information, we present four extensions of the basic model. First, we analyze a situation in which the community's and the executive's actions are complements or substitutes in the function . Second, we analyze a situation in which there is a terrorist organization in addition to the executive, the community, and the representative citizen. This extension provides a microfoundation for the function  and shows that all our results can be obtained in a model in which there is a terrorist organization as a strategic player. Third, we show that our results are robust if the community observes an imperfect signal of s before choosing its level of i. Fourth, we show that our results are robust if all players observe the legal limit with some error; that is, , where χ is some common observation error.         "
"44","Our analysis shows that the equilibrium of the discretionary executive game is relatively inefficient and that this inefficiency can be corrected by explicitly restricting the range of executive actions. One might conjecture that reputational mechanisms in repeated games can be an alternative manner of correcting the inefficiency. However, the executive's ability to commit to a level of s lower than  (by using reputational mechanisms) might be very limited for at least two reasons.         "
"45","First, reputational “folk theorem” arguments require that players have strong interest in future payoffs relative to the present (i.e., their discount factor is close to 1). However, elected officials' discounting is likely to be relatively steep because they always have to take into account that they will be voted out of office. As a result, they will be inclined to increase the chance of winning the next election, even if this might create problems in the future."
"46","Second, the executive's ability to commit to a certain action depends on how effectively the community can punish the executive for deviations. However, the community's ability to punish the executive is limited because of the secrecy of counterterrorism operations, which is typically maintained for a substantial period of time. Because the delay with which the actions of the executive can become “common knowledge” is substantial, the community cannot learn potential deviations by the executive very soon. As a result, this makes it difficult to provide incentives for the executive not to behave aggressively in equilibrium."
"47","Our analysis suggests an efficiency rationale for legal limitations on executive powers and has some implications for ongoing scholarly debates. First, the notion that discretionary powers are necessary for effective crisis government rests upon an impressive intellectual and historical pedigree. Even prominent liberal scholars including Locke, Madison, and Hamilton have insisted that executive discretion is necessary to handle crises effectively."
"48","This classical image of the effectiveness of discretionary powers needs reconsideration when the task is crisis prevention rather than management of an already realized crisis.22 In the classical paradigm, executive discretionary powers are triggered by a realized crisis. For example, a terrorist attack such as 9/11 creates an immediate state of emergency. Besides the obvious devastation wrought by the attack itself, executive officials have to deal with widespread fear, confusion, and ensuing panic, as well as with massive disruptions in transportation, communication, and finances. They might need to take extraordinary measures such as imposing a quarantine in certain areas or closing down transit and financial systems. The powers used in this context are reactive, and the executive's actions respond to the specific consequences of a terrorist attack.         "
"49","Preventing a crisis is a different issue altogether; executive officials act before a crisis occurs, and therefore the purpose of discretionary powers is preemptive. Thinking about crisis prevention requires us to account for the interactions between executive and nongovernmental actors whose actions also affect (future) crisis occurrence. Our analysis shows that, when accounting for such strategic interactions, executive discretion can lead to less security if citizens demand more security from terrorism. It suggests that to effectively prevent a crisis, it can be beneficial for security if there are some legal constraints on executive powers."
"50","Second, the idea of an irreconcilable tension between constitutionalism and democracy pervades scholarly and policy discourse. In this view, the principles of constitutionalism and democracy do not fit together well. Democracy is a way of exercising political sovereignty: citizens, through their elected representatives, have control over governmental policy. On the other hand, constitutionalism requires that certain decisions are not policy options; that is, there are limits on the exercise of public authority, even if elected officials have the approval of a majority of citizens."
"51","This tension most clearly comes to the fore in times of security crises. Carl Schmitt, perhaps more than any other scholar, had incisively argued for an irreconcilable opposition between constitutional limitations and democratic government in such situations. Schmitt's writings are particularly relevant here since scholarly and policy arguments that suggest allowing executive officials legal flexibility of action in the context of terrorism prevention implicitly or explicitly rely on Schmitt's analyses (Posner and Vermule 2010; Tushnet 2005).         "
"52","From a Schmittian perspective, the executive should have unfettered powers to decide what measures are necessary to ward off potential crises because a security crisis is always a possibility and because no legal norm can foresee the policy measures required in an emergency situation. The explicit or implicit approval of citizens confers legitimacy to executive discretionary actions, and such legitimacy takes precedence over formal legality (Schmitt 1932). In this account, legal limits then are but devices for restricting legitimate and effective usage of executive power. However, the analysis presented here suggests that some limitations on the exercise of executive power do not necessarily weaken but actually strengthen democratic processes to produce better public policies. In short, even for the purpose of providing security, some legal checks on executive actions can have a positive impact."
"53","The analysis also has some implications for current policy debates about fighting terrorism. The dominant paradigm that shapes how we think about antiterrorism policies posits a fundamental trade‐off between civil liberties and security from terrorism. This paradigm presumes that executive discretion is effective in reducing terrorism, and the only remaining question is whether liberty interests outweigh security gains. Yet, starting the debate on these grounds places the burden of empirical proof on opponents of executive discretion who must show high liberty benefits of limiting the exercise of executive power."
"54","Our analysis questions the efficiency rationale for executive discretion on its own terms by showing that some limitations on executive powers are beneficial for security alone. At minimum, our results suggest that the burden of empirical proof should be on executive officials who must show that discretionary powers achieve the intended security benefits and, perhaps, whether such benefits can be achieved without setting aside fundamental liberal‐democratic principles. Moreover, our analysis also indicates that even when citizens want a readjustment in the balance between security and liberty, it is not necessarily security‐beneficial if the executive decides on the scope of government power."
"55","Notwithstanding the normative value of limiting executive action, executive officials have positive incentives to undertake repressive policies even though such actions might be counterproductive.23 An important future research avenue then pertains to studying the mechanisms through which limitations on executive action can be maintained.24 On this topic, in the Federalist Papers, James Madison suggested that limits on the exercise of governmental power can be maintained by contriving the interior structure of the government in such a manner that the public interest must be safeguarded (Federalist No. 51). The Madisonian argument for setting institutional checks and balances might also be relevant in the context of designing the structure of liberal governments when the social goal is to prevent security crises.         "
"56","Here, we provide a microfoundation for the representative citizen's reelection voting rule we used in the main analysis."
"57","Let the probability of a terrorist attack be , where  represents a candidate's type (where the type can be thought of as ability to prevent terrorist attacks) for , and where I denotes the incumbent and C denotes the challenger.            "
"58","From an ex ante perspective, there is symmetric uncertainty about ;25 that is, none of the players knows the value of . Let the ex ante expectation of  be . Also, from an ex ante perspective,  is equally probable to be high,  (meaning that the candidate is less competent than expected so that the probability of a successful attack is higher than the average), or low,  (meaning that the candidate is more competent than expected so that the probability of a terrorist attack is lower than the average).26"
"59","In any period of the game, let the representative citizen's utility be defined as follows:               "
"60","The representative citizen, the incumbent executive, and the challenger all have the same utility from terrorism prevention, , given that candidate k is in office.            "
"61","Suppose a candidate k can only be in office for two periods. After observing the outcome  in the current period, the representative citizen reelects the incumbent executive if and only if having the incumbent executive in office gives her a higher utility in the next period than having the challenger in office. Thus, the representative citizen reelects the incumbent executive if               "
"62","Given this reelection rule, we next show that the probability that the incumbent executive is reelected is higher if the observed outcome in the current period is  rather than .            "
"63","The representative citizen uses her observation about  in the current period to update her expectation about . If there is no terrorist attack, then by Bayes' rule, , where  is evaluated at the current period equilibrium values . Similarly, . Also, if there is a terrorist attack, then by Bayes' rule, . Similarly, .            "
"64","As a result, the updated representative citizen's expectation about the incumbent executive's ability to prevent terrorist attacks, given the observed outcome  in the current period, is as follows:               "
"65","Given the above expressions, we have the following:               "
"66","Using this result in 10 implies that the incumbent executive's winning probability is higher if there is no terrorist attack in the current period, which is similar to the reelection voting rule we used in our main analysis (i.e., the reelection threshold  is higher if the policy outcome is  rather than , which implies that the reelection probability q0 is higher than q1). Furthermore, since uncertainty is symmetric, the expected probability of a terrorist attack is  (taking expectations over ), and thus all equations in the subsequent analysis are the same as in the main text.            "
