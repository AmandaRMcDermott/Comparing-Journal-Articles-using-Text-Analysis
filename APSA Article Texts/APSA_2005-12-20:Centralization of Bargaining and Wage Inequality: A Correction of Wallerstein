"1","We use exactly the same data as Wallerstein (1999). His dependent variable is a common measure of wage inequality. Using standard data from the OECD, Wallerstein measures wage inequality ι, as the ratio of the gap between the ninetieth percentile of the earnings distribution (w90) and the tenth percentile (w10) to the earnings level for the tenth percentile (w10):            "
"2","To facilitate his regression analysis Wallerstein transforms this measure by taking the natural logarithm,3 so that for country c and for year t his measure is: yc,t= lnιc,t.         "
"3","The three key explanatory variables in Wallerstein's analysis are:"
"4","Bargaining Centralization Bargaining centralization is measured according to a 4‐point scale: (1) local wage setting; (2) wage setting at the industry level; (3) central wage setting without sanctions; and (4) central wage setting with sanctions (see the detailed description in Golden, Lange, and Wallerstein 2000).4"
"5","Concentration This is a Herfindahl concentration index to calibrate intraconfederal union concentration inside the largest labor confederation (Golden, Lange, and Wallerstein 2002). It corresponds to the probability that two randomly selected members of the same union confederation belong to the same national affiliate (for details, on its construction, see Wallerstein 1999, 657–78).            "
"6","Coverage This is defined as the share of the workforce covered by a collective agreement; the data extend those compiled by Traxler (1994).            "
"7","Wallerstein incorporates his wage inequality variable into what is known as a “partial adjustment model.”5 In such a specification, there is a long‐run stable level for y associated with a given set of sustained settings for the exogenous variables. Denoting the exogenous variables by , and letting  denote a vector of coefficients, the long‐run stable level for the wage inequality index is:               "
"8","The actual level of the wage inequality measure is a weighted average of the long‐run level and last period's actual level, plus a random error term:               "
"9","Substituting from Equation (1) into Equation (2) gives rise to:               "
"10","While many of Wallerstein's explanatory variables are reported for every year during the period 1950 to 1992, his dependent variable, wage inequality, is reported for only a handful of years, all of which are concentrated toward the end of the sample period. Wallerstein analyzes a subset of these years, using up to three nonconsecutive observations for each country, indexed by {t0, t1, t2}. These roughly correspond to 1980, 1986, and 1992. In the few cases where there are gaps among the explanatory variables, Wallerstein uses linear interpolation to attribute the missing values. Because the effects of the decision to work only with three observations for the dependent variable, and the choice of attribution rule are tangential to the thrust of our correction, we work with the same observations that Wallerstein does.            "
"11","After iterated application of Equation (3) to deal with missing observations for his dependent variable, Wallerstein derives his basic estimating equations:               "
"12","To operationalize this dynamic specification, Wallerstein assumes that all variables are equal to zero before 1950 save for the constant term, random error terms, and, in the versions of the model that use them, country‐specific fixed effects. Adding the assumption that the uc,t are independently and identically normally distributed with mean 0 and unknown variance σ2u, the model can be estimated by maximum likelihood. Because of the gaps between observations for the dependent variables, this model cannot be implemented using any “canned” routine in any statistical software of which we are aware. However, it was straightforward to program the likelihood function in Gauss.6"
"13","Rather than maximizing the likelihood function directly, Wallerstein imposes several different trial values for the λ parameter, maximizing the log likelihood conditional on each λ (Wallerstein 1999, 664). While this approach offers some convenience—the conditional maximum‐likelihood estimates can be calculated by weighted least squares—it has the drawback of not directly including λ in the estimation. As a consequence, the analyst must choose a value for λ. Wallerstein reports that the value of λ that he uses—0.95, to be specific—maximizes the likelihood function for one particular specification, claiming that the “maximum likelihood estimate for λ changes only slightly” when the specification varies.7 However—and this is the heart of our objection—the estimated values of λ and the regression coefficients are interdependent: change the list of explanatory variables, and the maximum‐likelihood estimate of λ also changes. Wallerstein does not jointly estimate λ and his other parameters for each specification. When we do recalculate λ we find that it has important consequences for the coefficient estimates.            "
"14","In what might be regarded as his basic formulation (reported in Column 5 of  his Table 2 [Wallerstein 1999, 665]) Wallerstein claims to estimate the long‐term impact8 of his explanatory variables on wage inequality. However, the coefficient estimates Wallerstein actually reports correspond to the short‐term impacts of the variables, that is, he actually reports:            "
"15","This creates some internal inconsistencies in his exposition, as he then unravels the long‐term coefficients from his estimates.9"
"16","To avoid additional confusion, we estimate the model Wallerstein claims to estimate, so that our parameter estimates correspond to the long‐run coefficients."
"17","In the first column of Table 1 we report the estimated long‐run impacts for the explanatory variables (corresponding to  in equation 3), that result when Wallerstein's assumed value for λ of 0.95 is used.10"
"18","Fixed effects permit the analyst to control for the influence of variables that have been omitted from the analysis (usually because they are difficult to measure) but that are closely collinear with country‐specific or time‐period specific effects included in the model. In the context of wage inequality, Sombart (1906) and Lipset and Marks (2000) catalog hard to measure noninstitutional factors that may make citizens of the United States unusually tolerant of high levels of income inequality (such as perceived opportunities for upward economic and social mobility), and similarly slow changing factors are probably at work in the other countries of the sample. While most would agree that norms in Sweden are more egalitarian than in the United States, there is no readily accepted standard by which to calibrate this difference. In the absence of such measures, including country‐specific and period‐specific effects is much to be preferred to the alternative of ignoring the influence of omitted variables, which generally leads to inconsistent regression coefficient estimates and to flawed inference. Wallerstein acknowledges this, and his Table 2, column 7, reports the statistical results once country and period fixed effects are included in the analysis, again conditional on the assumption that λ= 0.95. His finding that the large estimated impact of centralized bargaining persists even when fixed effects (which are statistically significant) have been included would constitute highly persuasive evidence were it not based on a computational error.         "
"19","We replicate Wallerstein's fixed‐effect specification, and his methodological error, in the second column of coefficients that we report in Table 1. We estimate the long‐run coefficients, and as expected,11 our estimates are exactly 20 times larger than the estimated values for the short‐term impacts that are reported by Wallerstein. Comparing the results of the first two columns of Table 1, we see that the inclusion of fixed effects is associated with an increase in the size of all of the estimated standard errors, as well as with a reduction in the size of the coefficient for “concentration.” Wallerstein notes this and comments that the effects of the concentration measure cannot be distinguished from other sources of between‐country variation omitted from the analysis (see Wallerstein 1999, 666).         "
"20","We now correctly estimate λ by maximum likelihood. Our results, displayed in column 3, reveal that the correctly calculated maximum‐likelihood estimate for λ of 0.7063 is considerably smaller in both the statistical12 and the substantive sense than the value of 0.95 imposed by Wallerstein in his analysis. This is perhaps not surprising, since unmeasured country‐specific fixed effects can induce what appears to be serial persistence in the dependent variables.13 Accounting for the country‐specific effects thus removes a potential source of spurious intertemporal correlation, tending to produce a smaller estimate for λ.         "
"21","In contrast with Wallerstein's observation that other variables tend to be statistically insignificant “… once the institutional variation in wage setting is controlled for,” the country‐specific fixed effects are jointly statistically significant.14 This means that the hypothesis that they do not belong in the specification is rejected and that including fixed effects is necessary.         "
"22","Most importantly from the standpoint of substantive interest, Wallerstein's procedure also has an impact on the other coefficients that are in the model, including on that for the bargaining variable. Nor are these changes due to the country‐specific fixed effects throwing away so much cross‐sectional information as to render the substantive prarameter estimates imprecise. Here full maximum‐likelihood estimates for the model with fixed effects produces coefficients for the variables measuring bargaining level and concentration that are more precisely estimated, and there is only a modest reduction in the precision with which the coverage parameter is estimated.15"
"23","The most striking consequence of using the correctly calculated estimate for λ is that the impact of bargaining centralization on wage equality, while still statistically significant by conventional standards, is substantially smaller than Wallerstein's original estimates. Our results indicate that the “long‐term impact” associated with “a permanent change in the system of wage setting from the system of plant or individual level bargaining (as in Britain, Canada, or the US), to a system of industry‐level bargaining (as in Switzerland, Austria, or Germany),” is associated with a change in the wage inequality index of 1 −e−0.0559= 0.05437, or about 5%, with an α= 0.95 confidence interval running from 0.0111 to 0.0957. This is much smaller than the 30% decline indicated by Wallerstein's findings.         "
"24","In contrast to the striking consequences of Wallerstein's computational error for the measured effects of bargaining centralization, the correctly estimated coefficients for the coverage and concentration variables have implications that are substantively similar to those estimated by Wallerstein, although our more precisely estimated coefficient for coverage is more decisively significant than is his estimate."
"25","Wallerstein reports several other specifications of his model, mostly involving different additional explanatory variables in combination with those reported here. One of these adds union density and a measure of interconfederal union concentration, whereas a second adds two dummy variables measuring the leftward and rightward ideological “tilt” of government as well as measures of the size of government and trade openness. A third specification adds two measures of educational attainment. In each case, we reestimate Wallerstein's model,16 and in each case full maximum‐likelihood estimation with fixed effects leads to a much smaller estimated effect of the bargaining level on wage inequality than that reported by Wallerstein. Because Wallerstein's dataset includes fewer than four dozen data points, we are reluctant to lean on the specifics of these different estimates.         "
"26","Why are our results so different than those reported by Wallerstein?Figure 1 shows how the estimated value of βbarglev depends on λ for the specification used in Wallerstein's Table 2, column 7. As we increase the value of λ assumed for the model, the best‐fitting value for βbarglev changes, becoming more negative, and so larger in magnitude. Conditional on his imposed value17 of λ= 0.95, Wallerstein obtains a large estimated value for βbarglev, the crucial centralization parameter, corresponding to the point labeled “W” in Figure 1. However, when country effects are added to the model, the maximum‐likelihood estimator for λ of 0.7063 is a long way from Wallerstein's imposed value of 0.95, and the estimated value for βbarglev moves with it, to the point identified as “MLE” in Figure 1.         "
"27","                 Estimated Impact for Bargaining Level Given λ                      "
"28","We have revisited Wallerstein's analysis of bargaining centralization on wage inequality. When we remedy a computational flaw in his calculation of the maximum‐likelihood estimates for his model, we obtain substantially different results than those yielded by his procedures. Our findings show that bargaining centralization, although still within conventional limits of statistical “significance,” has a much more attenuated impact on pay equality than Wallerstein reports. The differences between our results and Wallerstein's stem from our actually having maximized the likelihood function. We find that Wallerstein's shortcut of imposing the same value for λ across specifications has pernicious consequences, leading to the conclusion that results are robust to the inclusion of country‐specific effects when they are not. By default, our reanalysis leaves a larger role for factors other than bargaining institutions in accounting for wage differentials. These might include changes in the supply of and demand for skill (Freeman and Katz 1995, 4), or the impact of tax policy (see Piketty 2003; Piketty and Saez 2003). In short, calibrating the importance of the various determinants of wage and income inequality remains on the agenda. Our reanalysis of Wallerstein's data suggests a less important role for bargaining institutions in explaining wage inequality than is commonly accepted today.         "
