"1","Several previous studies have focused on the relationship between citizens' knowledge, sophistication, or other related concepts and their attitudes toward Congress. Kimball and Patterson examined the possibility that “those who are familiar with political affairs…are more prone to strong feelings one way or another about the congressional institution” (1997, 716). From this perspective, the question is whether knowledge produces a direct effect—either positive or negative—on evaluations of Congress.         "
"2"," Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse (1995, 2002) also considered the knowledge‐opinion link. They posit that, on the one hand, a base of institution‐specific knowledge may lead to a greater appreciation of Congress. But on the other hand, knowledgeable citizens may be well positioned to pursue accountability, in which case failings in government performance may bring especially critical reactions from the best informed. Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse's empirical results support the latter view. In their earlier study, the authors showed that approval of members of Congress is nearly twice as high among political novices as among political experts, suggesting that “increasing knowledge of politics seems to go along with decreasing support for members of Congress” (1995, 144). A similar outcome is obtained in their second study, where results reveal that “the politically knowledgeable are less approving of Congress” (Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse 2002, 70). These findings provide strong and consistent evidence that greater knowledge about Congress is associated with more critical evaluations of the institution and its members.         "
"3","In addition to the direct‐effects perspective, a second view holds that high‐ and low‐knowledge citizens will differ in how they use other factors when assessing members of Congress. This approach implies an interactive specification, with knowledge conditioning the impact that other predictors exert on congressional approval. Born (1990) invoked a variant of this perspective in his study of the link between attitudes toward Congress and attitudes toward respondents' own representatives. Using a dummy variable for education to capture variance in cognitive sophistication, Born finds, contrary to his expectations, that the link between opinions about Congress and its members is the strongest among respondents with lower rather than higher education levels. Born interprets this finding as suggesting that cognitive ability may enable individuals to construct “differentiated images of Congress and congressman” (1990, 1238).         "
"4"," Bernstein (2001) also introduces a conditional approach. Specifically, Bernstein examines the correlation between presidential approval and congressional approval, with separate estimates calculated for high‐, moderate‐, and low‐knowledge respondents. The correlation between the two approval measures is found to be fairly strong (r = 0.35) for poorly informed respondents, substantially weaker for those with moderate levels of information (r = .13), and negligible (r = 0.03) for the well informed.         "
"5","More recently, Kimball (2005) explored whether partisanship matters the most as a determinant of congressional approval for respondents with high levels of political knowledge. Kimball's results indicate that the effects of partisanship are indeed generally greatest for the most knowledgeable, and, conversely, that the effects of other factors such as presidential approval tend to matter the least for those respondents who are best informed.         "
"6","The present article seeks to integrate and extend these past findings by offering a more cohesive account of what lies behind the knowledge‐opinion relationship. A great wealth of research has shown that knowledge matters at every turn in information processing and decision making. People with high levels of knowledge find it easier to process, assimilate, and retrieve new information, and they possess well‐developed cognitive structures that aid in these tasks (Berent and Krosnick 1995). The upshot of this is that knowledge alters the grounds on which opinions are formed. In the assessment of Congress, it is argued that the criteria individuals bring to bear will differ for well‐informed and poorly informed citizens. Hence, the crucial role of information may not be on what assessment of Congress a person forms, but on how that assessment is constructed.         "
"7","The account presented here draws on the dual‐process models developed by social psychologists (e.g., Chaiken 1987; Petty and Cacioppo 1986) and work in political science on the moderating effect of expertise on political judgments (e.g., Althaus 2003; Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; McGraw and Pinney 1990; Mondak 2001; Zaller 1992). Especially relevant is research by Sniderman and his colleagues, who develop a parallel view of the role of information in electoral choice, suggesting that well‐informed and poorly informed voters rely on different considerations (Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock 1991). Poorly informed voters only take into account the performance of the incumbent, while the better informed use a much wider array of information including not only the performance of the incumbent but also the policy proposals of both the incumbent and the challenger. In the words of Sniderman, Brody, and Tetlock, “[I]t is not reasonable to suppose that the voter who is exceedingly well informed about politics and the one who is largely ignorant of it would enumerate potentially relevant considerations with the same exhaustiveness” (1991, 165).         "
"8","These research streams emphasize that a person's ability, including cognitive ability, is critical in determining the quantity and quality of information that will be considered prior to the formation of an evaluative judgment. This suggests that individuals who are well informed about congressional matters will evaluate Congress using highly relevant, institution‐specific criteria. In contrast, people who are poorly informed about Congress may base their appraisals on readily available, though more peripheral, factors such as their assessment of the president. Citizens with different levels of knowledge, in other words, should rely on different considerations and apply different standards of criteria when asked to evaluate Congress."
"9","The view outlined here accounts well for the results reported by Born (1990) and Bernstein (2001). In those studies, individuals with low levels of sophistication seemed to grasp at cognitive straws. Low‐educated respondents in Born's study failed to differentiate opinions about their own representatives from opinions about Congress as a whole, and, similarly, Bernstein's low‐knowledge respondents failed to distinguish presidential and congressional approval. From the present perspective, these results suggest that citizens who lack an adequate base of information to judge Congress on its own merits will form appraisals through application of information that is cognitively accessible but of questionable relevance for the task at hand. It should be clear, though, that such an evaluative process tells only half the story. The present view of the Born and Bernstein findings accounts for patterns among citizens who are poorly informed, but questions remain as to the criteria by which knowledgeable respondents evaluate Congress.         "
"10"," Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse (2002) hint at the decision‐making processes of well‐informed citizens. Although testing only for a direct effect of knowledge on congressional approval, their argument is that a large store of knowledge enables the individual to assess Congress in terms of institution‐specific criteria. In the framework developed here, this implies, for example, that people who feel that Congress has fared well in terms of representation and the production of public policy will voice approval of Congress, and this effect, in turn, should be most pronounced among the well informed. Conversely, those who believe that Congress is not meeting its responsibilities in terms of representation and public policy should disapprove of Congress, and the level of disapproval should be especially high among the most knowledgeable citizens.         "
"11","The current thesis puts a different twist on the central dilemma under consideration, that a knowledgeable polity and a well‐respected legislature may be mutually exclusive. The answer suggested by the present perspective is that knowledge per se should not lead to disapproval of Congress. If high‐ and low‐knowledge citizens draw on different considerations when evaluating Congress, it is entirely possible that this variance will lead one group to view Congress more favorably than the other, but this effect simply would be a consequence of the differing criteria used to judge Congress. There arguably is nothing about knowledge in and of itself that should prompt disapproval of Congress. Indeed, this apparent effect should disappear once the analysis takes into account the different considerations that low‐ and high‐knowledge citizens invoke in their evaluations.         "
"12","Because knowledge stands at the forefront of this article's thesis, it is essential that knowledge be measured both precisely and comprehensively. Although previous studies devoted some attention to the role of knowledge, in no case was this assessment the central task. Hence, these studies understandably have made do with coarse knowledge measures—at best, scales constructed with data from a handful of items. The current argument requires a much richer measure."
"13","The 2002 Exercising Citizenship in American Democracy survey was administered by the Center for Survey Research at Indiana University, with interviews conducted from early September to late November. The cross‐sectional survey includes 1,485 respondents. Of these, slightly more than three‐fourths were interviewed prior to Election Day. The pre‐election and post‐election instruments were virtually identical, with the exception of changes from future to past tense in question wording to account for the occurrence of the November election. Additional information on the survey is reported in the appendix.         "
"14","A central objective of the survey was the development of a detailed data base regarding what Americans know about Congress and what Americans think about Congress and its members. The survey also includes an extensive series of items designed to identify respondents' attitudes regarding various contemporary policy issues. Each of these batteries is put to use below. Analysis begins with a systematic review of responses to the factual knowledge items. The knowledge data subsequently are used to test the thesis regarding the relationship between political knowledge and Americans' attitudes toward Congress."
"15","Knowledge about Congress is viewed here in relative terms—what level of variance exists in what Americans know about Congress, how much people know about some aspects of Congress versus others, and, most importantly, what implications, if any, variance in knowledge brings for citizens' attitudes toward Congress. Following Delli Carpini and Keeter (1996), measurement of knowledge about Congress occurred in three broad areas: procedures, policy output, and party politics.2 Data are discussed in this section in terms of these three areas. Later, however, the data will be combined into a single scale, as no empirical tests yielded conclusive evidence that knowledge of Congress is multidimensional. All items were closed‐ended with two or three response options, with “don't know” responses discouraged.         "
"16","Question wording and results for 16 knowledge items are reported in Table 1. The first two of the nine items regarding procedure mention Congress only as an incorrect response, but they are included because a full grasp of congressional procedures requires knowledge of what Congress does not do as well as what it does.3 For knowledge about procedures, the expected number of correct responses for a fully uninformed respondent is 3.00. The observed mean on the nine‐item scale is 5.54 (s.d. = 2.41). Viewed in terms of improvement relative to chance, a mark of 0.42 is obtained, meaning respondents as a whole fell a bit short of the midpoint between a complete lack of information (expected value = 3.00) and a perfect score (9.00).4 A full 14% of respondents answered all nine of the procedural items correctly, and 40% were right on at least seven questions. Conversely, 24% answered between zero and three of the items correctly, results that fail to outperform chance. On the individual items, two of the three lowest marks were obtained when respondents were queried about what is arguably a matter of only minimal substantive importance, the length of the terms of office for the House and Senate. Respondents were much more successful on questions regarding day‐to‐day congressional operations.         "
"17","Because there exists no definitive guide as to how good is good and how bad is bad on knowledge items such as these, there should be hesitance in offering any sweeping claims regarding how well informed or poorly informed Americans are about congressional procedures. At a minimum, however, the data permit rejection of the view that ignorance of procedural matters is the norm. Over 50% of respondents answered at least six of the procedural items correctly. For many people, there appear to be occasional gaps in what they know about how Congress operates, but it is simply not the case that most Americans are innocent of understanding in this area.         "
"18","Three dichotomous questions provide data on knowledge of partisan politics. The mean number of correct answers across the items is 2.04, versus an expected mean of 1.50 given a full lack of information; these marks result in an improvement over chance statistic of 0.36. The pattern of results for the individual items is sensible in that the highest score is obtained for the question that taps the most lasting aspect of partisan politics, the fact that the Republican Party resides to the ideological right of the Democratic Party. Conversely, the lowest score emerges for party control of the Senate—not surprising given that the Democrats held only the thinnest majority prior to the 2002 elections, with the Republicans subsequently recapturing control.5 A total of 36.4% of respondents answered all three of the party items correctly, well in excess of the 12.5% figure that would be expected with purely random response.         "
"19","The final four items tap awareness of policy output. Because these items are dichotomous, blind guessing corresponds with an expected mean of 2.00, and the observed mean of 2.60 correct responses yields an improvement relative to chance statistic of 0.30. Over 19% of respondents answered all four items correctly."
"20","Although data on knowledge of procedures, party politics, and policy output have been discussed separately, a summary scale is used when focus turns to attitudes toward Congress.6 The mean on the 16‐item scale is 10.17 (s.d. = 3.38), versus an expected mean of 6.50 with blind guessing. Some 16.7% of respondents answered six or fewer items correctly, a figure that rises to 24.1% when a seventh correct answer is included. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that roughly one‐quarter of the sample suffers from a severe lack of information about Congress.7 At the other extreme, 5.3% of respondents recorded perfect scores on the 16‐item knowledge battery, and 27.7% answered 13 or more of the items correctly.         "
"21","The pattern of results across the 16 knowledge items is in many ways suggestive, and the data support two straightforward conclusions. First, considerable variance exists in what Americans know about Congress. Knowledge levels range from marks that suggest sheer guessing to those that identify citizens as quite well informed regarding congressional procedures and outputs. Second, the 16‐item scale provides a plausible representation of what people know about Congress. The 2002 survey provided the opportunity to assess knowledge about Congress with considerable breadth and depth. As a result, it now is possible to explore in some detail how differences in knowledge influence evaluations of Congress."
"22","Two approaches will be followed to measure attitudes toward Congress. The first uses data from a familiar single‐item indicator of approval of Congress. The second is a multi‐item scale of views regarding congressional performance. Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse note that “people are amazingly attuned, hypersensitive even, to the possibility that decision makers will attempt to improve themselves at the expense of everyone else” (2002, 85). In measuring attitudes toward congressional performance, the approach followed here strives to capture the constellation of views broadly related to such perceptions."
"23","Data on congressional approval are shown in Table 2. To put these data in context, data on presidential approval also are reported. The survey began soon after the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks, and interviews were completed well before the start of the war in Iraq. This was a period when presidential approval was high, as almost 70% of respondents indicated that they approved of the job being done by George Bush. At 61%, approval of Congress also is high. Although the presidential and congressional indicators fall within 10 percentage points of one another, the attitudes differ in intensity. Half of respondents who approve of George Bush strongly approve of him, whereas barely 10% of people approving of Congress voiced strong approval. A similar difference is observed for disapproval.         "
"24","Views of congressional performance are measured with data from eight items on the competence, integrity, civility, and responsiveness of members of Congress. Question wording and results are shown in Table 3. The data reveal both that many people view congressional members critically and that the intensity of this criticism varies widely depending on the facet of performance under review. Roughly 80% of respondents assessed Congress negatively on three items: whether most members of Congress will tell lies if they feel the truth will hurt them politically, waste a lot of taxpayers' dollars, and spend more time trying to get reelected than doing work in Congress. A majority of respondents also felt that Congress is too beset by bickering and that members of Congress do not care what people think. Conversely, fewer than half of respondents view members of Congress as poorly informed and dishonest, and only a small minority believes that members of Congress do not work hard at their jobs. Collectively, the picture painted here is of a quarrelsome Congress in which members are well informed and hard working, but where members are willing to sacrifice both their principles and the interests of their constituents in the name of political expedience.8"
"25","Items in Table 3 were recoded to range from 0 (most negative assessment of Congress) to 3 (most positive), and then summed to produce a 0–24 scale.9 The mean evaluation of congressional performance is 9.24 (s.d. = 4.27). The mean falls to the negative side of the scale's midpoint, and scores between 0 and 12 were recorded for 76.8% of respondents. Most respondents do not offer rock‐bottom appraisals of congressional members, but the consensus view of Americans toward Congress is critical nonetheless.         "
"26","In modeling attitudes toward Congress, analyses first attempt to replicate the finding that familiarity breeds contempt—that Congress will be held in the lowest esteem by respondents who are well informed. Models include political knowledge, approval of the president and of one's own House member, along with demographic controls, measures of economic perceptions, and four dummy variables for partisanship and ideology. Strong effects for the latter variables are not expected because control of Congress was split in 2002, but the strength of Democrats in past decades leaves open the possibility of a lingering effect of political predispositions. Two variables capture the impact of a policy expectancy gap. The first scale includes data from 11 items that asked respondents how well various issues had been addressed. The items were of the form “As of today, how close do you think the United States is to having equal rights for ethnic and racial minorities?” Responses are coded 0 (not at all close) to 3, and perceived policy success is measured by summing across the items.10 The second variable used to capture effects of an expectancy gap is derived from a single‐item, three‐category measure of representation: “Thinking about the U.S. House of Representatives as a whole, how well does the entire U.S. House of Representatives represent your views?”11 Scale values range from 0 to 2 (mean = 0.64). This variable is moderately correlated with the measure of policy success (r = 0.30).         "
"27","Results are reported in Table 4.12 The effects for most predictors are consistent for the two dependent variables, a finding that is unsurprising given that both tap attitudes toward Congress. However, the effects for political knowledge are strikingly different. Consistent with past research, approval of Congress decreases sharply as political knowledge increases. No such tension between knowledge and attitudes toward Congress is seen when focus turns to perceptions of congressional performance. Results in the second model of Table 4 reveal that respondents' views of congressional performance become substantially more positive as a function of knowledge. At least in this domain, familiarity with Congress does not breed contempt.         "
"28","Although it might be tempting to dismiss the inconsistent results for political knowledge as an aberration, several factors suggest against doing so. First, the effects are obtained with data from a single sample, and the models are specified identically. Second, neither knowledge effect is weak either substantively or in terms of statistical significance. Third, the effects of education—a variable sometimes used as an indicator of sophistication when an objective knowledge measure is unavailable—reveal a pattern similar to that of knowledge in that the signs on the coefficients match those for knowledge, reversing from one model to the next."
"29","The thesis proposed here is that there is not, in fact, reason to expect that levels of political knowledge should matter in themselves as determinants of attitudes toward Congress. Instead, it is posited that the criteria that inform evaluations of Congress vary as a function of knowledge, with the most‐informed and least‐informed citizens using different bases when evaluating Congress. This implies that the negative relationship between political knowledge and congressional approval, and the positive relationship between knowledge and congressional performance, may be artifacts that result from not taking into account the fact that people who differ in political knowledge may weigh considerations differently when evaluating Congress. Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse suggest a view similar to the present thesis, noting that “it seems that knowledge leads people to hold high expectations and to be critical when government fails to live up to those expectations” (2002, 68–69). If this view is correct, corroborative evidence would be found in the influence knowledge exerts in conditioning the effects of other predictors.         "
"30","The models in Table 4 include four predictors that permit testing of the knowledge‐as‐conditional‐variable hypothesis. The least knowledgeable are expected to premise their evaluations of Congress on simple, and arguably extraneous, considerations. Presidential approval is one such factor, and approval of one's own House member another. Well‐informed observers should be able to form independent assessments of Congress and the president, and of Congress and a district's representative. Taking presidential approval as an example, the less informed should be more prone to link these judgments either because respondents extend their evaluations of the president to Congress or because opinions about Congress and the president trace to the same simple antecedents (e.g., blanket feelings of cynicism toward government; see Bernstein 2001). Presidential approval exerted strong influence on congressional approval in Table 4, and approval of one's own representative brought strong effects for both dependent variables. Upon introduction of knowledge interaction terms, significant negative coefficients are expected for the product terms, indicating, for example, that the connection between presidential approval and congressional approval weakens as knowledge of Congress rises.         "
"31","Knowledgeable respondents are expected to base their evaluations of Congress less on factors such as presidential approval and more on criteria that are specific to Congress. The indicators of perceived policy success and representation of the respondent's views are two such criteria. In Table 4, these variables yielded strong effects as determinants of both congressional approval and perceptions of congressional performance. The present argument holds that unmet expectations in terms of either specific policies or representation in general should be most consequential for the appraisals of Congress formed by the most knowledgeable citizens. Thus, introduction of product terms for these variables should produce patterns of results opposite to those for presidential approval. That is, the knowledge product terms should bring significant positive coefficients, indicating that the effects of policy success and perceived representation on judgments about Congress are strongest for the best‐informed citizens.         "
"32","To be clear, the four test variables used here—presidential approval, approval of one's own House member, perceived policy success, and perceived representation—do not exhaust the list of criteria that high‐ and low‐knowledge respondents may invoke when assessing Congress. Instead, these indicators stand as examples of the sorts of factors that may produce effects that differ across knowledge levels. What is critical for present purposes is that the variables tap either general or Congress‐specific perceptions. Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse's (2002) research suggests that variables related to the inner workings of Congress also might be influential, but this possibility cannot be tested with items on the 2002 survey. Kimball (2005) shows that the effects of partisanship on approval of Congress vary by knowledge in some years, but split partisan control of Congress in 2002 minimized the relevance of partisanship in the 2002 data.13"
"33","Results in Table 5 conform well with expectations. With a full interactive specification, levels of knowledge in themselves now bring muted effects for both dependent variables. Knowledge qua knowledge apparently does not inevitably correspond with negative approval ratings of Congress, nor do levels of knowledge produce noteworthy direct effects on views of congressional performance. Instead, it now appears that the effects of knowledge seen previously emerged primarily because baseline models included no product terms to account for the fact that high‐ and low‐knowledge respondents bring different considerations to bear.         "
"34","Five of the eight interaction terms yield statistically significant effects, all in the expected directions. Specifically, low‐information respondents draw heavily on presidential approval in both models, and these respondents base congressional approval largely on views of their own House members. Conversely, well‐informed respondents base their assessments more on Congress‐specific criteria—the perceived quality of representation in the first model, and policy success in the second."
"35","The results for presidential approval are critical to understanding why past research has suggested that high levels of political information and respect for Congress may be incompatible. Similar to what was seen in Table 2, Americans typically respond more favorably to the president than to Congress (e.g., Dennis 1981; Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse 1995). When this pattern holds, the link between presidential and congressional approval among low‐knowledge respondents results in a halo effect; Congress reaps benefits when presidents are held in high esteem. Without the inclusion of an interaction term to capture this effect, multivariate analyses will produce results such as those observed in Table 4—it will appear that, for some unspecified reason, knowledge causes citizens to downgrade their appraisals of Congress. Present results offer a more plausible account. Knowledge in itself does not lead one to view Congress critically. Instead, a full base of knowledge alters the considerations that inform judgments about Congress, and, as results for congressional approval reveal, one consequence is that a halo effect beneficial to Congress is eroded.         "
"36"," Figure 1 depicts estimates of the impact of presidential approval, approval of one's own representative, and perceived representation on congressional approval among high‐ and low‐knowledge respondents.14 In Panel A it is seen that presidential approval is inconsequential for well‐informed respondents, whereas estimated approval of Congress rises sharply as a function of presidential approval among respondents who are poorly informed. Estimates in Panel B reveal that the link between approval of one's own House member and congressional approval is somewhat stronger for respondents with low levels of political knowledge. The estimates in Panel C show that the impact of the perceived quality of representation on congressional approval is considerable for well‐informed respondents, but negligible for their poorly informed counterparts. Collectively, these results make clear that low‐knowledge and high‐knowledge citizens employ different considerations when asked to evaluate Congress.         "
"37","                 The Moderating Impact of Knowledge on the Determinants of Congressional Approval                      "
"38","More modest effects are shown in Figure 2, with focus on evaluation of congressional performance. Here, a positive relationship between presidential approval and views of Congress exists only for respondents with low knowledge levels, and, conversely, the impact of perceived policy success on assessments of Congress is most pronounced for the well informed.         "
"39","                 The Moderating Impact of Knowledge on Perceived Congressional Performance                      "
"40","Thus far, all evidence suggests that familiarity with Congress does not inevitably breed contempt. First, high knowledge corresponds with positive, not negative, assessments of congressional performance in the baseline model. Second, levels of knowledge in themselves are irrelevant for evaluations of Congress once product terms are added to the models. Third, consistent with expectations, high‐ and low‐knowledge respondents differ in the criteria they use to assess Congress. Still, much stronger support for the current thesis would emerge if similar results were found using different data, a different year, and different model specifications. Toward this end, a brief replication is conducted using Hibbing and Theiss‐Morse's 1992 data set.15"
"41","In Table 6, the first two columns of results are for congressional approval and the last two columns are for a congressional feeling thermometer. The first model in each pair omits knowledge interaction terms, whereas the second model adds those interactions. Knowledge interactions focus on three variables: presidential approval/presidential feeling thermometer, approval of one's own House member, and an indicator of how well Congress has addressed the respondent's most important issue. Values on the knowledge scale range from 0 to 9.16 Results once again support this article's thesis. First, high levels of knowledge appear to spark significant negative evaluations of Congress when interaction terms are excluded. Second, both of these negative effects vanish once product terms are added to the models. Third, four of the six interaction terms yield effects that reach at least minimum levels of statistical significance, all in the expected directions. The impact of approval of one's own House member on congressional approval decreases as a function of knowledge, the link between the presidential and congressional feeling thermometers decreases with knowledge, and, in both models, well‐informed respondents base their evaluations of Congress largely on their assessments of how well Congress has addressed important issues.17"
"42","Data examined in this study confirm the presence of a negative relationship between political knowledge and congressional approval, but analyses show that this relationship masks more than it reveals. There exists nothing intrinsic to knowledge that causes the public to hold a low opinion of Congress. There is no intractable dilemma. Instead, well‐informed and poorly informed citizens use different criteria when evaluating Congress, and it happens that the criteria employed by people who lack detailed knowledge of Congress often lead the institution to be cast favorably."
"43","Congressional approval among the least‐informed segment of the citizenry is something of an artificial high. Current analyses reveal that knowledgeable individuals judge Congress on its own merits, and mixed assessments are produced. In contrast, uninformed citizens evaluate Congress and its members less on the basis of considerations specific to Congress, and more by linking seemingly disparate judgments. Congressional approval rests on a weak foundation if that approval is brought on merely because Congress is associated with a popular president or local House member rather than because of something intrinsic to Congress."
"44","On the surface, the critical judgments regarding Congress formed by knowledgeable citizens may seem troubling. Upon deeper inspection, however, these judgments signal a vibrant interplay between masses and elites, not a system in peril. Knowledgeable individuals who voiced criticism of Congress did so because they felt that important policy needs had been unfulfilled, and because representation had been inadequate. Also, it warrants emphasis that the well‐informed offered the most positive assessments in the baseline test of the determinants of perceptions regarding congressional performance."
"45","Although congressional approval was observed to be lowest among those respondents with the highest knowledge levels, this outcome will not be seen in all scenarios. Again, the critical point is that high‐ and low‐knowledge respondents draw on different considerations when evaluating Congress, and it is the respective nature of these considerations that produce disparities in approval.18 If presidential approval were to plummet, the link between presidential and congressional approval for poorly informed respondents would mean that congressional approval likely also would fall. Indeed, precisely this was observed in the spring of 2006—with President Bush's approval rating in the low 30s, approval of Congress dropped to a similarly low level.19 Conversely, if Congress were to record a series of major policy successes, the attentiveness of knowledgeable citizens would mean that congressional approval among this group would rise. What these examples demonstrate is that the observed inverse relationship between knowledge and congressional approval is hardly set in stone. As circumstances change, the very same considerations that currently lead one group of citizens to view Congress favorably can later lead them to assess Congress unfavorably.         "
"46","The behavior identified on the part of the most knowledgeable respondents—judging Congress on the basis of its own successes and failures—represents a sophisticated and entirely reasonable approach to the evaluative process. Indeed, accountability could not exist, and thus representation likely would founder, if citizens failed to evaluate Congress using performance‐based criteria. The bottom line is that when Congress appeals to a sophisticated audience, approval must be earned—a result that is consonant with expectations based on the need for responsible, accountable government."
