"1","A widely accepted notion in political behavior research is the idea that citizens are overwhelmingly located in politically homogeneous microenvironments, surrounded by people holding agreeable political preferences. The implications of such a view are quite profound, both for the formation of individual preferences and for the functioning of democratic politics. Thus it is important to consider the processes that might extinguish the communication of disagreement within electorates (Ikeda and Huckfeldt 2001).         "
"2","First and foremost, social influence has the potential to eliminate disagreement, and hence disagreement might be the source of its own demise as people are brought into political correspondence with their surroundings. Not surprisingly, scholars who advocate such a view often point to the early Columbia studies which drew attention to the socially contingent nature of citizens' voting choices (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1944).         "
"3","The problem with this argument is that it only applies in situations where agreement exists within a citizen's network of social contacts. That is, when a German citizen's associates all support the Christian Democrats, it is reasonable to expect that this citizen might be persuaded to support the Christian Democrats as well, thereby leading to the elimination of disagreement. But what if the citizen's associates are split in their support between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats? Such a situation is quite conceivable, particularly if these associates are not directly connected to each other (Burt 1992; Granovetter 1973). The Columbia sociologists addressed this general issue in the form of cross‐pressures (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1944), and while their entire argument is not relevant here, one might recast the problem in terms of the circumstances which expose citizens to divergent political viewpoints, thereby insuring that individuals experience disagreement (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004).         "
"4","A second factor with the potential to eliminate disagreement is the tendency for individuals to locate themselves in politically homogeneous microenvironments. These politically self‐selected patterns of social interaction might be motivated by several factors. Some people simply prefer to be around others who hold reasonable political viewpoints and to avoid individuals with wrong‐headed opinions, while others select compatible associates to realize economies in collecting and processing politically reliable information (Downs 1957).         "
"5","While people certainly engage in self‐selection when they construct patterns of association, it is an open question whether self‐selection would eliminate political disagreement. Politics is only one among many criteria that people invoke in establishing relationships, and political views may not be the most important associational criteria for most people (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995). Indeed, it is not clear that disagreement compromises the political utility of socially communicated information (Calvert 1985).         "
"6","A third set of factors frequently credited with eliminating the experience of political disagreement is related to cognitive dissonance and its potential for creating patterns of selective perception and selective retention. An influential program of research demonstrated that people engage in systematically biased patterns of social and political cognition depending on their own preferences and beliefs (Festinger 1957). A Democratic loyalist might be able to ignore or forget all the nasty things that a bowling partner says about Bill Clinton, and instead recall this friend's dislike for Dick Cheney. A more recent but complementary stream of research focuses on the “false consensus” effect—the tendency of individuals to assume that others agree with their own preferences (Fabrigar and Krosnick 1995). In this way, citizens are exposed to political disagreement without recognizing it, and in this particular instance perception may be more important than reality.         "
"7","At the same time, it is important to recognize that not all citizens are so deeply affected by the experience of political disagreement with an associate. First, many citizens do not hold deeply felt political commitments, and hence political disagreement is not so unsettling. Second, rather than finding disagreement to be unpleasant or disturbing, many other citizens thrive on the give‐and‐take of political conversation and debate. As a consequence, the tendency for disagreement to produce cognitive dissonance and a false consensus might indeed vary across individuals, and perhaps even across different cultural settings. Finally, the experience of cognitive dissonance is perhaps most likely to occur in seemingly simple judgmental situations where people lack a compelling explanation for a judgmental discrepancy (see Ross, Bierbrauer, and Hoffman 1976). In contrast, complex and ambiguous decision‐making settings—such as voting—are perhaps less likely to give rise to cognitive dissonance because there are multitudes of alternative explanations to account for judgmental discrepancies (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995). A committed Social Democrat might reconcile her friend's support for the Christian Democratic candidate based on the associate's wealth, his family background, or perhaps his political naïveté!         "
"8","While a variety of individual‐level factors that might expose people to, or shield them from, the experience of disagreement with their associates, patterns of agreement and disagreement are not simply matters of individual taste and preference. They are also affected by circumstances external to the individual—circumstances located in the structure of social interaction and the opportunities for association with others who are politically like‐minded."
"9","First, the likelihood of experiencing disagreement is rooted in the stochastic nature of social interaction. Consider a committed supporter of the Green Party in Germany, where approximately 10% of other voters are also supporters of the party. If patterns of social interaction were random with respect to support for the Greens, then the probability that any given associate would be a Green supporter should be .1. Of course, social interaction patterns are not random with respect to party support (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995), and hence we temporarily assume that the agreement probability for any given associate of our committed Green is instead equal to .5. The particular numbers are really unimportant for present purposes. We need only to demonstrate that, as the circle of associates increases, the probability of disagreement increases at an exponential rate. Assuming that the probability of agreement is independent across contacts, the probability of agreement with any single associate is .5, but the probability of agreement with two associates drops to .25, and the probability of agreement with three declines to .125. Thus, the probability of agreement across all social contacts might decrease quite rapidly as a function of network size, depending on the probability of agreement with any single associate. Quite clearly, those most exposed to this stochastic logic are people imbedded within larger networks of association.         "
"10","At the same time, the effect of being imbedded within an extensive network of communication might be nullified if the correlation among network members' political views is extremely high. In this case, it would not matter whether a citizen had one or 20 discussants because all the discussants would be likely to agree (Granovetter 1973). Once again, we are faced with an empirical issue that must be examined in the analysis—whether the stochastic logic of social interaction increases the probability of disagreement among citizens with more extensive networks of communication.         "
"11","Second, the probability of agreement also depends on the external circumstances of supply. Members of political minorities have fewer opportunities to locate agreeable associates than members of politically dominant parties and groups. In the 1993 election, Liberal Democrats in Tokyo had better opportunities to find other Liberal Democrats than, for example, supporters of the New Party Sakigake had to find other Sakigake supporters. (Sakigake no longer exists as a political party.) It would have been possible, of course, for committed Sakigake supporters (or Greens or Free Democrats or Perot supporters) to search more aggressively when looking for an associate, but this fact merely serves to underline the crucial point. Unless a member of the political minority is more aggressive in searching out an agreeable associate, or unless patterns of social interaction are in some other way segregated by political opinion and sentiment, she will be less likely to realize agreement (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995). And thus, all else being equal, we would expect political minorities to experience higher levels of disagreement.         "
"12","Third and finally, to the extent that a society is politically polarized along a social cleavage that serves to segregate patterns of social interaction, we should expect levels of political agreement to increase. As an example, consider the case of Mississippi in the 1984 presidential election. More than 90% of Mississippi black voters supported Walter Mondale, and more than 80% of Mississippi white voters supported Ronald Reagan. Relatively few blacks and whites belonged to each other's personal networks of communication, and hence the probability of experiencing political disagreement was relatively low. Such circumstances are not necessarily rare, even in modern democracies, and they are more frequent in societies characterized by patterns of racial, ethnic, ideological, or religious segregation."
"13","Our goal is to determine whether microenvironmental patterns of agreement and disagreement among citizens are contingent on individual characteristics and political predispositions, the structure of political communication networks, and the political composition of the larger macroenvironmental settings where the citizens are located. We are particularly concerned with the macroenvironment defined at the level of the nation, and hence our effort is explicitly cross‐national in its focus. As a consequence, the data requirements of this undertaking are quite demanding. We require information on individuals, their networks of social and political communication, and we need to collect this information in several different national contexts."
"14","These data requirements are addressed on the basis of several cooperative election studies, undertaken in East and West Germany in 1990, the United States in 1992, and Japan in 1993. The field work for each study was designed to implement a model of citizen communication which allows us to investigate the acquisition of political information at the intersection between individual citizens and the environment. The focus of the present effort is on individuals, the social communication of disagreement within their networks of communication, and the national political setting within which the information is obtained. Measurement thus occurs at several levels. First, surveys were conducted with representative samples of the four national electorates. The 1990 German election was immediately subsequent to German unification, when the process of social and political integration had only barely begun, and thus we treat the two Germanys separately in these analyses.1 Second, social network data are collected for each respondent in every national setting, and hence we are not only able to characterize individuals, but we can also undertake an analysis of the dyads contained within these communication networks, as well as to characterize the composition of the entire network. Third, for many purposes it is useful to aggregate these dyads at the level of the political party's electoral coalition, within each of the national settings. And finally, we are able to engage in a cross‐national comparison of individuals, their networks of political communication, and the composition of party coalitions. This means that the unit of analysis will vary from individuals, to dyads, to networks, to political parties and their supporters' communication networks, to the four nations.         "
"15","The design of the name generator for collecting the social network data is particularly important to our analysis. Each of the main respondents in each of the four surveys was asked: “Looking back over the last six months, I'd like to know the people you talked with about matters that are important to you. Can you think of anyone?”2 This probe was used to compile a list of no more than four first names, and a follow‐up question asked for the first name of someone else with whom they discussed the election: “Aside from anyone you have already mentioned, who is the person you talked with most about the events of the recent presidential election campaign?”3 We intentionally adopted a name generator that encouraged the respondent to provide as many names as possible in order to push beyond the boundaries of the small socially cohesive groups. Moreover, we are interested not only in associates who are particularly important as political discussants, but also in the more general contexts within which people maintain relationships and communicate matters that are of importance to them.         "
"16","Before beginning our substantive analysis, it is important to examine several cross‐national differences in the responses to our surveys. Our studies suggest quite sizable differences in the ways that citizens in different cultures respond to interviewers and their questions. The proportion of nonresponses to the network name generator is .09 for the U.S. sample, .16 for the West German sample, .2 for the East German, and .34 for the Japanese. Among those responding to the name generator, the mean number of names provided also varies quite considerably: 1.8 for the Japanese, 2.4 for the West Germans, 2.7 for the East Germans, and 3.1 for the Americans."
"17","The resulting analytic challenges are enhanced by the fact that these sorts of response differences might be produced either by (1) cross‐national cultural differences in the willingness to answer questions posed by perfect strangers, or by (2) different field procedures put into place by four different survey organizations, or by (3) cross‐national cultural differences with respect to the underlying phenomena in question. For example, when we see that the Japanese respondents provide a smaller number of names in response to the network name generator, is this because the Japanese actually have less extensive networks, or is it because the Japanese are uncomfortable answering these survey questions, or is it because the Japanese survey organization was less aggressive in converting nonresponses?"
"18","Considerable progress has been made in constructing theories of the survey response (Zaller and Feldman 1992), and the current analysis points to the importance of considering national level differences in the ways that people respond to survey questions. For example, other implementations of the “important matters” name generator in the Japanese context produce results similar to those shown here. Japanese culture has been characterized as a culture of self‐effacement (see Markus and Kitayama 1991), and many Japanese respondents may be too modest to suggest that they discuss “important matters” at all. These problems are surmountable, but they are in the background for much of this analysis, they confront any effort to undertake cross‐national comparisons of survey data, and we will address them later in the analysis.         "
"19","We begin by comparing the incidence of agreement and disagreement within dyads across the four national settings, and in this context it is important to consider several measurement issues. First, for these immediate purposes the unit of analysis is the dyad, and thus individual respondents to the survey are potentially represented in multiple dyads—one dyad for each name the respondent provides in response to the network name generator. Thus, a respondent who reports three discussants will be represented in three dyads, ignoring problems of missing data."
"20","Second, all respondents were asked to report their candidate or party preferences, either in the immediately past election or in the immediately upcoming election.4 They were also asked for their perceptions regarding the party or candidate choice for each of the previously identified discussants. Throughout our analysis, for each national sample, the information regarding discussant preferences is always taken from the report of the main respondent, and hence we are analyzing the perception of agreement and disagreement among the respondents and their discussants. Does such a practice compromise the results of the undertaking? The American data set is the only one with sufficient discussant interviews to allow an analysis and comparison of perceived agreement with objective agreement, where objective agreement is based on the self‐reports of both members of a dyad. Other analyses of these data, not shown here, demonstrate that perceived agreement tends to overestimate the levels of objectively defined agreement, but not by much (Huckfeldt et al. 1995). In general we expect that our analysis of perceived disagreement will systematically but modestly underestimate the actual level of disagreement that is present among citizens in the four national settings.         "
"21","As an operational necessity, agreement is defined in terms of vote alternatives, but we must not forget that in many ways this is a constrained view, particularly in multiparty systems. Thus, for example, a supporter of the Christian Democrats and a supporter of the Free Democrats might agree on a wide range of issues other than the vote, and we would still define them as not agreeing. A great many political discussions revolve around topics other than vote choice, and a great deal of convergence undoubtedly occurs among discussion partners regarding these other topics. Indeed, agreement regarding these substantive issues may sometimes hide the fact that individuals do not agree on their choices of candidates or parties. Two citizens may share the view that campaign finance, or a balanced budget, or European integration, or governmental corruption, or a tax cut is the most important challenge facing their country, but this does not mean that these citizens will support the same candidate or party. Thus, not all the “disagreements” as we define them necessarily involve irreconcilable or rancorous differences."
"22","In evaluating the extent of agreement within respondents' social networks, we consider three possible circumstances: (1) the respondent supports a particular party or candidate in the election and perceives that the discussant supports the same party or candidate; (2) the respondent supports a particular party or candidate in the election and perceives that the discussant supports a different party or candidate; (3) the respondent supports a particular party or candidate in the election but is unable to tell the interviewer which party or candidate the discussant supports. We refer to these three situations as agreement, disagreement, and indeterminacy. Of course, some respondents are uncertain regarding their own preferences, and others are unwilling to share their preferences with the interviewer. The dyads for these respondents are omitted, and thus our analysis is restricted to dyads in which the respondent possesses a clearly stated preference."
"23","The patterns of agreement, disagreement and indeterminacy within the communication networks of respondents are shown in Table 1. The table shows important differences across the nations, particularly with reference to levels of indeterminacy and disagreement. Indeterminacy is especially pronounced among the Japanese, where 36% of the dyads involve a respondent who is unable to provide the discussant's preference. Levels of indeterminacy drop to 18.8% among the West German dyads, 17% among the East German dyads, and only 8.4% among the American dyads. Partially as a consequence, the American dyads demonstrate the highest level of agreement, as well as the second highest level of disagreement. Perceived agreement ranges from 59.6% for the American dyads, to 56% for the West German dyads, to 50.5% for the East German dyads, to 49.6% for the Japanese dyads. Perceived disagreement varies from 32.5% for the East Germans, to 32.1% for the Americans, to 25.2% for the West Germans, to only 14.4% for the Japanese.         "
"24","Varying levels of indeterminacy produce important consequences in Table 1. First, notice that the distribution of indeterminacy drives the distribution of perceived agreement and disagreement. If we omit the indeterminate dyads, the agreement levels become 77% for the Japanese, 69% for the West Germans, 65% for the Americans, and 61% for the East Germans. In short, not only is the level of indeterminacy highest among the Japanese, but so is the ratio of agreement to disagreement. We do not intend to eliminate the indeterminate dyads from the analysis for the simple reason that indeterminacy is as important for our purposes as agreement or disagreement. Indeed, the levels of agreement and disagreement take on an entirely different meaning depending on the inclusion or exclusion of the indeterminate dyads.         "
"25","We cannot, on the basis of conclusive empirical evidence, choose among the three possible explanations for cross‐national variation in levels of agreement, disagreement, and indeterminacy. These patterns might be generated by: (1) cross‐national differences in interviewing procedures; (2) cross‐national differences in the willingness to answer survey questions; or (3) cross‐national differences in political institutions and underlying political cultures. At the same time we are much less convinced, as a matter of compelling argument, by the first two explanations. The respondents are willing to respond to the name generator, to answer questions regarding their discussants, and to report their own political preferences. It seems unlikely that they would be unwilling to provide their perceptions of an anonymous discussant's political preference, based either on varying field procedures or on an unwillingness to answer survey questions.5"
"26","Thus, it would appear that the level of political ambiguity across a citizen's social contacts may be a genuine characteristic of the political cultures and institutions within these nations. This is not to suggest that we fully understand the mechanisms generating this ambiguity. It may simply be that the Japanese are, in general, less willing to state their political preferences unambiguously within the context of social exchange. Or it may be that the Japanese more specifically avoid the recognition of political disagreement through the ambiguous representation of their positions in situations where disagreement is likely (MacKuen 1990).         "
"27","Perhaps the most important message to take from Table 1 is that the commonly accepted wisdom regarding uniformly high levels of political agreement across the range of a citizen's social contacts does not account for the high levels of political diversity within any of these nations. Even in Japan, where citizens are relatively unlikely to perceive disagreement, the levels of perceived agreement are still quite low, and thus, at the very least, social interaction is unlikely to be uniformly supportive of a citizen's political preferences. Moreover, as we will see below, levels of agreement are even lower if we change the level of analysis to the individual and ask what percentage of the respondents experienced neither ambiguity nor disagreement within any of their relationships. In this context, where lack of agreement is not a rare event, it is important to identify the factors underlying patterns of agreement and disagreement among citizens and their social contacts.6"
"28","Thus far we have carried out the analysis at the level of dyadic relationships—the appropriate level for examining the issues we have addressed. But citizenship is not exercised in the context of a single relationship. Rather, citizens make choices and reach judgments on the basis of an aggregate social and political experience, and in the analysis that follows we treat the individual citizen's communication network as an aggregation unit to examine the larger pattern of agreement and disagreement experienced by individuals."
"29","Our main concern in this analysis is whether, and under what circumstances, citizens are located in politically homogeneous microenvironments—in networks where they perceive political agreement with all their discussants. The binomial logit models in Table 2 examine the probability of political homogeneity across a citizen's social contacts subject to several explanatory variables: the number of discussants named by the respondent, individual partisanship, and the particular party supported by the respondent. Our primary question thus becomes, under what circumstances are citizens more likely to experience political agreement across their entire networks of communication?         "
"30","The coefficients and t‐values for the binomial logit model can be used to reveal the directions of effects, as well as whether the effect is statistically discernible and different from zero. Thus, we see from Table 2 that the likelihood of political homogeneity within microenvironments is depressed in all four samples by increasing numbers of discussants. Partisanship, defined as the presence of any party loyalty, produces a consistently positive effect on the probability of homogeneity, but one that does not consistently generate a substantial t‐value.7 Finally, most of the minor party supporters are less likely to experience politically homogeneous sentiment within their social networks. The only possible exceptions are the Japanese supporters of Komeito and the West German supporters of the Greens. (We do not define the supporters of the West German Social Democrats or the American Republicans as supporters of minor parties.)         "
"31","In order to estimate the magnitudes of these various effects, we employ the Table 2 logit models to examine the consequences of variation in particular explanatory variables while the other explanatory variables are held constant. In Figure 1 we examine the effect of network size on the likelihood of political homogeneity for each national sample, and we do this separately for both the dominant party and one of the minor parties.8 First, Figure 1 shows quite dramatic effects for network size. In each national sample, the probability of political homogeneity within microenvironments drops from between .6 and .7 for supporters of the dominant party with one discussant to between .1 and .3 for supporters of the dominant party with five discussants. The effects are also dramatic between the parties. Quite clearly, supporters of the minority party are much less likely to reside in politically homogeneous microenvironments, and the effect is especially profound among citizens with less extensive communication networks. In contrast, while Figure 2 shows the same dramatic effects for network size, the effect of partisanship is much less pronounced.         "
"32","                 Predicted Probability of Homogeneous Network by Party and Size of Communication Network                      "
"33"," Source:                        Table 2 estimates.                     "
"34","                 Predicted Probability of Homogeneous Network by Presence of Partisan Attachment and Size of Network                      "
"35"," Source:                        Table 2 estimates.                     "
"36","Hence, this analysis reveals a dramatic effect due to network size on the likelihood of experiencing political homogeneity within microenvironments. This effect is due primarily to the stochastic logic of social interaction which insures that the probability of encountering homogeneous agreement is reduced exponentially as a consequence of an extended social network (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004).9 Unless the probability of agreement within a single dyadic relationship is extraordinarily high (or low), the probability of homogeneous agreement across a range of social contacts can be expected to decline precipitously.         "
"37","These dramatic effects due to network size provide strong support for the argument that discussants in larger networks do not hold political preferences that are highly correlated. As a consequence, people within larger networks are more likely to obtain new information that does not simply duplicate the information they have previously obtained from another discussant (Granovetter 1973). In other words, at the same time that larger networks expose citizens to an increased probability of disagreement, they also present citizens with richer sets of information that are more varied and diverse.         "
"38","When the effect of party support levels is overlaid on network size, we also see dramatic change in the probability of political homogeneity within citizens' communication networks. The probability of uniform agreement for a supporter of the LDP with only one discussant is about .7, while the probability approaches 0 for a supporter of Sakigake with five discussants. For a supporter of the Democratic Party with only one discussant, the probability is .7, but for a Perot supporter with five discussants it is about .05. Similarly dramatic differences are present within the two German samples, and hence it would appear that these two factors—network size and party support levels—are central to explaining the levels of agreement realized by citizens in democratic politics."
"39","Patterns of agreement and disagreement among citizens are important for the individuals who are directly involved, but these patterns are also centrally related, at aggregate levels, to the structure and process of democratic politics. Thus, individual level processes produce important aggregate outcomes, and in this light it is important to reconsider our informal, verbal model of the process whereby citizens encounter agreement and disagreement through the social communication of political messages:"
"40","                        "
"41","While patterns of political communication are nonrandomly clustered among supporters of the same parties, the overall probability of political agreement with any given associate is consistently less than unity, ranging from about .5 to .6 in the four national samples."
"42","These nationally aggregated probabilities disguise significant and systematic patterns of within‐nation heterogeneity, however. In particular, the probability of agreement is much higher for supporters of dominant parties than it is for supporters of minor parties, and this pattern of effects is, in general, remarkably consistent across the four national samples."
"43","If the probability of agreement is fixed and independent across citizens' communication networks, the stochastic logic of social interaction suggests that the probability of political agreement across all social contacts should decline exponentially as network size increases. Indeed, our empirical analysis shows a precipitous decline in the probability of political homogeneity within networks as the size of the network increases. And this effect is, once again, remarkably consistent across the four national samples."
"44","Finally, the strong negative effect of network size on the probability of political homogeneity within networks suggests that the correlation among discussant opinions is far less than complete. Hence, these larger networks are likely to provide new information and new viewpoints to citizens."
"45","What are the consequences of this process for the aggregate distribution of agreement and disagreement across political groups? In this final analysis, dyadic relationships are aggregated at the level of the political party's electoral coalition within each particular political system. The resulting data base allows an examination of the political communication patterns that occur among each party's supporters. Several questions motivate the analysis: How important is the aggregate level of party support for the aggregated mix of political communications received by party supporters? Does the importance of party support vary across political systems? Does it vary across parties within political systems? Is there evidence to support the persistence of political cultural differences between nations in the individual experience and recognition of political agreement and disagreement?         "
"46","We begin by examining levels of agreement within party supporters' communication networks in Figure 3. The solid diagonal line represents the random mixing assumption—every point on the line produces a probability of agreement that is a direct translation of the underlying support level in the population—and thus we once again see the tendency toward political clustering in patterns of social communication. Every party coalition in each country lies above the line, indicating levels of political agreement among party supporters that exceed the random mixing baseline. At the same time, however, these data demonstrate a strong positive effect due to the parties' levels of electoral support. Indeed, the simple OLS regression line—shown as a broken line—runs approximately parallel to the diagonal, but nearly 25 points higher. The observations fit the regression line so well that adding nation‐specific dummy variables does not alter the effect or even generate statistically discernible differences among the national samples (see Part A of Table 3).         "

"48"," Source: Aggregated survey data.                     "
"49","The same basic procedure is used to examine patterns of disagreement and indeterminacy in Figures 4 and 5, with the diagonal line omitted. While we see the expected negative slopes for the simple regressions, the observations are not so neatly clustered around the OLS simple regression lines. Not surprisingly, much of this is due to the different patterns that are present in the Japanese data. In Figure 4 we see that the Japanese are much less likely to perceive disagreement, and in Figure 5 we see that they are much more likely to be uncertain. When we take account of national variations in Part B of Table 3, there is both a strong and negative nation effect for Japan, as well as a strong and negative effect due to party support levels. Indeed, this negative effect on disagreement due to support levels is nearly as large as the positive effect on agreement (−.82 versus .98), and it is much stronger than the simple effect shown in Figure 4. In contrast, Table 3C shows a pattern of national variation with respect to indeterminacy—particularly for Japan, but very little in the way of an effect due to party support levels.10"

"54","We have seen a strong relationship between aggregate party support and the levels of political agreement within individual party supporters' networks of social communication. At the same time, the simple regression line in Figure 3 fits the data better at the higher end of party support. Indeed, there is virtually no significant deviation in the predicted agreement levels within the major parties—the Christian Democrats in East and West Germany, the Social Democrats in West Germany, the Liberal Democrats in Japan, and the Republicans and Democrats in the United States. The variance around the regression line increases significantly at the lower levels of party support, however. In particular, one of the Japanese parties—the Komeito—lies far above the line, and even though the two minor West German parties have roughly equal levels of support, the Greens lie above the regression line while the FDP lies considerably below it. (The East German FDP lies significantly below the line as well.)         "
"55","How can we explain these differences? First and most obviously, the estimates for the major parties are based on more sample information than the estimates for the minor parties, and hence the minor party estimates are less stable. But there is also reason to believe that we may be observing the consequences of divergent patterns of social organization within the parties. Turning to the German case first, while the FDP is a minor party, it is located well within the mainstream of German politics, and during the past 25 years it has participated in ruling coalitions headed both by the Christian Democrats and by the Social Democrats. In short, the social divide separating supporters of the FDP from supporters of the major parties is apt to be neither high nor wide. In contrast, the Greens have historically constituted a more direct ideological challenge to conventional, mainstream politics in West Germany, and Green supporters may be more introverted and segregated than supporters of the other parties (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995), particularly in the West.         "
"56","Perhaps the most revealing picture of minority party divergence in patterns of social communication can be seen for the Japanese case in Figure 3. Among the minor Japanese parties, the Komeito shows the highest level of agreement within its supporters' communication networks, followed by the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), and the Social Democratic Party of Japan (JSP). At the opposite extreme, those minor parties with the lowest levels of agreement among party supporter networks are the Japan New Party (JNP), the New Party Sakigake, and the Japan Renewal Party (JRP). How are these parties different in terms of their internal social organization?         "
"57","First, the Komeito (the clean government party) has received its main support from a Buddhist lay organization, and hence the social interaction patterns of party supporters are structured on an institutional, organizational basis. At the opposite extreme, the JNP, the Sakigake, and the JRP were, at the time of the election, recently formed conservative parties that represented dissatisfaction with the LDP coalition. Hence, there was perhaps less in the way of either an organizational or ideological base that would segregate their supporters from the supporters of other parties. Finally, the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and the Social Democratic Party of Japan (JSP) have historically represented the left and labor in Japanese politics, and hence they are segregated both organizationally and, particularly in the case of the JCP, ideologically as well."
"58","Hence, some minority parties enjoy at least partial insulation from the debilitating consequences of minority status. Either as a consequence of a strong organizational base that segregates the social interaction patterns of party supporters, or as a consequence of ideological commitment that encourages party supporters to seek out others who hold the same views, the supporters of some parties experience levels of agreement within their communication networks that exceed those expected based on the size of the party in the electorate."
"59","In summary, Figures 3 through 5 demonstrate several important points. First, microlevel patterns of communication and association have macrolevel consequences for the functioning of political parties and their electoral coalitions. Major parties enjoy the advantage of supporters who are more typically reinforced in their political preferences through patterns of social interaction and communication, while minor parties depend on the support of individuals who are much more likely to encounter social resistance and disagreement regarding their political preferences. In such a context, the structurally imposed disadvantage of minority parties becomes quite clear (Miller 1956).         "
"60","Second, while the low levels of perceived disagreement among the Japanese respondents reveal some important cross‐national cultural differences, Figure 3 and Table 3A demonstrate important cross‐national continuities in the functioning of democratic politics. The important point for this analysis is the highly comparable pattern of perceived agreement—a pattern driven by the level of support for particular preferences within the electorate. None of the party coalitions in any of the national settings enjoy the support of citizens who are imbedded in homogeneously supportive political environments, and in every country the minor parties are particularly vulnerable to the stochastic structure of social interaction—a structure that exposes their supporters to alternative political viewpoints. Particularly in the case of Japan, nonagreement does not necessarily mean disagreement, and ambiguity in political communication plays a more important role in Japan than in the United States. But in all four national samples, patterns of political agreement are a highly predictable consequence of the electoral support received by particular political parties.         "
"61","The preceding analysis helps to explain some, but not all, of the divergent cross‐national patterns of agreement, indeterminacy, and disagreement within dyads that were demonstrated in Table 1. None of the country dummy variables produce statistically discernible effects in Part A of Table 3, indicating that aggregate levels of agreement are indistinguishable across the four samples once levels of support for party preferences are taken into account. This situation changes in Parts B and C of Table 3, particularly with respect to Japan, where levels of reported disagreement are lower and levels of reported indeterminacy are higher.         "
"62","What do these results tell us? The levels of agreement are the same across the four nations—country level differences are driven to the margins—once we take into account the aggregate level of support for particular partisan preferences. Hence the differing levels of agreement within dyads shown in Table 1 are best understood as the result of different institutional arrangements—multiparty systems with many small parties versus two‐party and modified two‐party systems with fewer and larger parties (Ikeda and Huckfeldt 2001).         "
"63","The sum of indeterminacy and disagreement forms the complement to agreement, and thus factors that account for agreement also account, inversely, for nonagreement. Persistent national and cultural differences are demonstrated in the decomposition of nonagreement into disagreement and indeterminacy. Indeed, the mix of indeterminacy and disagreement diverges quite dramatically in the Japanese case, but notice that both indeterminacy and disagreement decline among the Japanese in Figures 4 and 5 as a function of more popular preferences.         "
"64","In short, the individual response to the absence of agreement would appear to be culturally driven—the Japanese are more likely to respond to nonagreement by reporting indeterminate preferences on the part of their discussants. Other analyses of different data sources demonstrate that the respondents to a community based study in Japan are less likely to recognize disagreement accurately—based on the self‐reports of the discussants—than are the respondents to a community based study in the United States (Ikeda and Huckfeldt 2001). Are the Japanese less likely to report disagreement in the context of an interview conducted by a stranger? Do the Japanese simply avoid political discussions in situations where they sense the possibility of disagreement, thereby producing indeterminacy in potentially disagreeable circumstances? While a complete answer to these questions extends beyond the available data, it would appear that the informal rules of social exchange discourage the confrontation of political disagreement among Japanese citizens.         "
"65","What are the implications of this analysis for democratic politics, as well as for the civic capacity of citizens and electorates? The empirical literature concerning participation and engagement in politics has been understandably ambivalent with respect to political disagreement and diversity (Mutz 2002a, 2002b). While the potential of democratic politics is only fully realized by thoroughgoing communication regarding the dramas, debates, and disagreements of politics, the personal experience of disagreement within patterns of everyday living is frequently thought to lie beyond the psychic limits of many citizens (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1948; Festinger 1957). In particular, the experience of political cross pressures was seen to be sufficiently disturbing so as to create political withdrawal and disengagement (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954).         "
"66","Political withdrawal can be conceived in various ways, relative to various forms of political engagement. Two of the most important among scholars of electoral politics have been political interest and partisanship—the extent to which citizens express personal concern in events of election campaigns (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1996, 358–61), and the extent to which citizens express loyalty toward a particular political party (Campbell et al. 1960). The issue that we address is the extent to which these two forms of engagement are related to the experience of political diversity within communication networks.         "
"67","In the earlier analysis of Table 2 we saw that partisan attachments were at least sometimes related to politically agreeable discussions within social networks. We pursue this issue here to consider whether partisan attachments—as a singularly important form of political engagement—preclude the persistence of political heterogeneity within networks. Part A of Table 4 shows that, while homogeneous agreement is in general more likely to occur among partisans, partisan attachment does not come remotely close to producing political homogeneity within communication networks. With respondents who report no discussants included in the analysis, the percentage of partisans imbedded in homogeneous networks varies from 27.4% to 34.6% across the four samples, while the percentage of nonpartisans who are similarly located varies from less than 14.1% to 30.2%.11 In short, political unanimity is a relatively rare event, and while partisan attachments are positively associated with political homogeneity, the proportion of partisans located in homogeneous networks barely exceeds one‐third for any of the separate national samples.         "
"68","Partisan attachments do not preclude the experience of political disagreement, but partisans are more likely to be located in politically supportive networks, at the same time that they are more likely to be engaged in political life. What are the joint consequences of individual partisanship and political communication networks for levels of political engagement? Part B of Table 4 addresses this question, with particular attention to the relationship between agreement and an alternative measure of political engagement—the citizen's self reported interest in the election campaign. The table uses an ordered logit model to regress political interest on three explanatory variables—whether the respondents are located within politically homogeneous networks, the size of their networks, and whether they are partisans.         "
"69","The presence of homogeneous agreement within communication networks fails to produce a discernible effect on levels of political interest for any of the samples. In contrast, partisan attachments produce statistically discernible positive effects in Japan and the United States, and they come close to producing a discernible effect for the West German sample. Finally, network size—measured as the number of discussants reported by the discussant—produces effects on interest that are positively signed for all four samples, and statistically discernible for each sample except the East German."
"70","Indeed, none of the three variables produce statistically discernible effects for the East German sample, and the chi‐square for the model is correspondingly small. The divergence of the East German sample is likely related to the dramatic events of German unification. Other analyses show that the East German respondents demonstrate uniformly high levels of interest—an understandable consequence of the circumstances surrounding the 1990 German election (Huckfeldt, Ikeda, and Pappi 2000).         "
"71","How large are these various effects? As Figure 6 shows, the number of discussants produces an effect that matches or surpasses the relationship to partisan attachment for each of the samples. (Note that overall levels of interest cannot be directly compared across the plots in Figure 6 because the interest variable is based on different numbers of categories in the various surveys.) One criticism of these results might be that interest stimulates network size rather than network size simulating interest. Readers might recall, however, that network identification is accomplished with a network name generator defined primarily with respect to the discussion of “important matters” rather than to the discussion of politics. Hence it appears improbable that political interest would be the driving force responsible for producing larger networks.12"

"73"," Source:                        Table 4(B) estimates.                     "
"74","Finally, the relatively weak effects of partisanship on interest are in part due to the construction of the samples for the Table 4 analysis. American respondents are only included in the analysis if they report having a preferred candidate in the immediately preceding presidential election. Japanese and German respondents are only included if they report a preferred party in the immediately upcoming elections. Other analyses, not shown here, demonstrate an enhanced effect due to partisanship if respondents without preferences are included in the analysis, but the partisanship effects continue to be surpassed by the effects due to network size.         "
"75","In summary, there is no evidence in these data to suggest that political homogeneity stimulates political interest. At the same time, partisanship tends to stimulate interest, and it is inversely related to the incidence of disagreement. Conversely, larger networks tend to stimulate political interest, but they also produce an increased likelihood of political disagreement within networks.13 Hence the relationship between disagreement and engagement is complex, and simple assertions that disagreement attenuates civic capacity do not survive close scrutiny.         "
"76","The reconciliation of democratic decision making with an absence of disagreement among citizens requires a model anchored either (1) in individually autonomous citizens who act as isolated information processors or (2) in oversocialized individuals whose political preferences have been submerged in their social surroundings (Granovetter 1985). In contrast, our own model is rooted in the shared deliberations of interdependent citizens—citizens who discover and articulate their own preferences through a process of social communication. In keeping with such a model, this paper has shown that relatively few citizens are located in politically homogeneous microenvironments—sufficiently few that we might even speak of political heterogeneity as the norm within the citizen communication networks of modern democracies.         "
"77","Does it really matter whether citizens experience disagreement? The answer is yes, at both individual and aggregate levels. At the individual level, disagreement forces people to think again about their own preferences (McPhee 1963), and hence it gives rise to an enhanced likelihood for individual change. Indeed, Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee (1954) argue that citizens experiencing disagreement provide the necessary dynamic in collective democratic decision making—they are the ones who are less certain of their preferences and more susceptible to persuasion, thereby generating the potential for deliberation and change within electorates.         "
"78","The aggregate consequences are also important. Supporters of minority parties are more likely to be told, through systematic patterns of social interaction and communication, that their choice is the wrong one! Thus, as Miller (1956) shows us, individual effects produce important aggregate consequences for the performance of political groups. Members of a political minority are more likely to encounter divergent preferences, and this fact helps explain the disadvantaged position of political minorities that is endogenous to a democratic political system.         "
"79","What keeps minor parties from simply disappearing? Some minority parties realize significant benefits from resolute supporters who are committed to the cause, and others benefit from supporters who are imbedded within complex networks of communication that sustain their capacity to disagree (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004). Finally, we should not ignore the importance of the Markov principle—a small defection rate operating on a large population will offset, at some equilibrium point, a large defection rate operating on a small population.         "
"80","In summary, the political messages citizens receive from one another are not typically or necessarily mirror images of their own preferences and viewpoints. Hence, this analysis provides additional evidence to support a view of citizenship which anchors the individual within larger collectives at a variety of levels. Some citizens are social isolates, but many others are not (Putnam 1993), and the socially integrated citizens are likely to play particularly crucial roles in sustaining the lively public deliberation that is central to democratic politics.
