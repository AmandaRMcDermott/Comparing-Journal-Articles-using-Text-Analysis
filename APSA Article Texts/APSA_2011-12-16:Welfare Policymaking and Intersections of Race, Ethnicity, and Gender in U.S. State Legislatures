"1","An Additive Approach, as suggested above, examines welfare policy and politics through a gender (‐only) lens, adding women (undifferentiated by race or ethnicity) to the theoretical and empirical story. It begins with the observation that the history and politics of welfare in the United States are gendered in many of the same ways they are raced. One can see gender in the demographic composition of welfare recipients and the poor more generally; in the history of social welfare policymaking and implementation; in public opinion; and in the behavior of elected officials. In all of these arenas, gender biases and differences suggest that welfare is very much a “women's issue” and that those who advocate for and actively represent women on this issue will fight to make welfare policy more generous and accessible—in effect, more women‐friendly.         "
"2","Researchers have long noted the “feminization of poverty” (McLanahan and Kelly 1999; Pearce 1978). In 2008, for example, the poverty rate for women and girls (14.4%) was approximately 2% higher than that for men and boys (12.0%), which translates into almost 4.5 million more females living in poverty.3 Because poverty assistance is targeted almost exclusively to poor families with dependent children and most of those families are headed by single women, adult welfare recipients are almost always female. In FY1996, 87% of all adult AFDC recipients were female.4 Under TANF, little has changed. In FY2006, a full 90% of all adult recipients were female.5"
"3","These figures only begin to capture the myriad ways in which social welfare policy, from colonial times to the present, has been gendered. In its design and implementation, the American welfare state has been quite selective, extending its most generous assistance to those “deserving” women whose morals, marital status, sexuality, and reproductive lives comport with dominant gender and family norms (e.g., widows with small children). For those deemed undeserving (e.g., unmarried mothers), assistance has been either denied altogether, or meted out in the most miserly, intrusive, and punitive fashion (Abramovitz 1996; Gordon 1994; Mink 1995, 1998). Women receiving welfare benefits often have been subject to state surveillance and regulation of their personal lives, not simply to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, but also to ensure morally “suitable” homes and proper parenting (Abramovitz 1996; Mettler 2000; Mink 1995; Roberts 1997; Smith 2007; Williams 2004). PRWORA is certainly not the first attempt to regulate women's lives (Abramovitz 1996), police women's sexuality (Smith 2007), restrict poor women's fertility (Roberts 1997), and instill more “personal responsibility” among low‐income, single mothers (Mettler 2000). But it may be the most emphatic and explicit (Smith 2007, 89 and 94).         "
"4","Public opinion on welfare is also gendered. For decades, national surveys have shown women to be significantly more liberal than men on various social welfare issues. Shapiro and Mahajan (1986), for example, show that throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and across hundreds of survey items and multiple survey organizations, women were more supportive of a government role in providing jobs, minimal incomes, health care, and other types of aid to the needy. By the 1990s, such gender gaps in support for a public safety net were well established and widely recognized as a major cause of gender gaps in party preferences and vote choices (Center for American Women and Politics [CAWP] 1997; Chaney, Alvarez, and Nagler 1998; Kaufmann and Petrocik 1999; Schlesinger and Heldman 2001). Extensive analysis of the American National Election Study (ANES) also reveals that since the 1960s, women have been more likely than men to cite poverty as an important national problem and policy priority (O’Brien 2004; see also CAWP 1997). Other research further indicates that “gender specific assumptions about the sexual and reproductive behavior of welfare recipients” (Foster 2008, 173) fuel opposition to welfare spending, as do racially specific assumptions about recipients’ work ethic (Dyck and Hussey 2008; Gilens 1999; Peffley, Hurwitz, and Sniderman 1997; Soss et al. 2003). Survey respondents who believe that receiving welfare encourages women to have more children than they otherwise would are more likely than those who do not to oppose any increase in welfare spending (Foster 2008, 172).         "
"5","Researchers have not examined policymakers’ attitudes toward welfare recipients directly, but there is evidence to suggest that gender gaps in the welfare policy preferences and priorities of the electorate are reflected in those of elected officials. Research spanning multiple decades and levels of office shows that, compared to their male counterparts, female officials are more liberal and more likely to take the lead on a variety of women's rights and social welfare issues, including poverty alleviation (Reingold 2008). In a 2000 national survey of state legislators, for example, Poggione found that female lawmakers “hold more liberal preferences on welfare policy than their male colleagues, even after accounting for other factors like constituency demands, party, and ideology” (2004a, 305). Other studies have found that women are more likely than men to introduce welfare or antipoverty legislation, even after controlling for party, district demographics, and committee assignments (Bratton and Haynie 1999; Bratton, Haynie, and Reingold 2006; but see Reingold 2000; Thomas 1994). In these ways, shared gender identity is thought to motivate female legislators to pursue more liberal welfare policies.         "
"6","Yet, while evidence suggests female legislators are more likely to act for poor women on or in need of welfare, it is still unclear whether they could, as a group, exert enough influence to impact state policy. When the PRWORA was signed into law in 1996, women had never claimed a majority of the seats in any state legislative chamber. In most states (38, to be exact), women held no more than a quarter of the seats in the legislature (CAWP 1996). Perhaps for this reason, studies that have examined the impact of legislative women on state policy outcomes report mixed results, at best. On some issues, such as abortion and child support, studies show that female legislators can and do make a difference (Berkman and O’Connor 1993; Crowley 2004; Keiser 1997); but on other “women's issues” such as domestic violence and women's health, female lawmakers have no discernible impact (Tolbert and Steurnagel 2000; Weldon 2004, 2006a). In the most comprehensive study to date, Cowell‐Meyer and Langbein (2009) find that the percentage of women in state legislatures is associated with the adoption of only eight of the 34 women‐friendly policies examined; and in three instances, the relationship is in the opposite direction. Likewise, on the seven dimensions of TANF policy examined, the greater presence of female legislators is just as likely to increase the odds of adoption as it is to decrease the odds, as it is to have no effect at all (Cowell‐Meyer and Langbein 2009, 508–11; see also Keiser 1997).         "
"7","Some studies of welfare policymaking are more optimistic about the liberal influence of women in power. In‐depth analyses of legislative efforts leading up to the passage of the PRWORA in the Republican‐dominated 104th Congress show that some of the more senior, moderate Republican women were able “to temper or moderate some of the harsher effects of the proposed legislation and to expand the legislation to include provisions for child care, child support, and child protection” (Hawkesworth et al. 2001, 46; Dodson 2006). Poggione (2004b) also finds that state legislative women can have an impact on TANF policy, under certain conditions. When the percentage of women in the majority party is high and the majority party holds a slim margin, and when the percentage of women on welfare‐related committees is high and the committees are relatively autonomous, TANF policies are significantly more liberal.         "
"8","As these studies suggest, “sheer numbers” of legislative women may not be enough (Beckwith and Cowell‐Meyers 2007; Browning, Marshall, and Tabb 1984; Weldon 2002). The impact of women on state policy outputs may also depend on their incorporation into dominant coalitions and leadership structures. We therefore anticipate that it is the combination of women's descriptive representation and legislative incorporation—their presence and positions of power in the legislature (Preuhs 2007)—that enables them to move welfare policy in a more liberal, generous, accommodating, and women‐friendly direction.         "
"9","            "
"10","H1 (Single‐Axis Hypothesis): The greater the incorporation of women in the state legislature, the more generous, accessible, flexible, and lenient the state welfare policy.                  "
"11","An Intersectional Approach posits that welfare politics in the United States is not simply gendered or raced, or even gendered and raced; it is raced‐gendered (Hawkesworth 2003; Neubeck and Cazenave 2001). The raced‐gendered nature of welfare is perhaps best understood where it is most powerfully manifested: in the distinctive position—real or imagined—of poor women of color (Simien 2007).6 It is, after all, not simply women, African Americans, or Latinos who are overrepresented among welfare recipients; it is women of color. As the histories of social welfare policy (cited above) make clear, determinations of which women are more or less deserving of assistance, privacy, and dignity have always been tainted by racial and ethnic biases. As a result, poor women of color have been subject to the most stringent eligibility requirements, the most intense moral scrutiny, and the harshest penalties welfare policy has to offer.         "
"12","Evidence also suggests that it is not simply racial or gender stereotypes of lazy or overly fecund welfare recipients that have fueled successive waves of disciplinary welfare reform. Rather, it is the “controlling image” of the raced‐gendered welfare queen who promiscuously gives birth to multiple children in order to receive more benefits and avoid working that has come to symbolize the typical recipient and all that is wrong with American welfare policy (Collins 2000; Hancock 2004; Neubeck and Cazenave 2001; Roberts 1997; Sparks 2003; Williams 2004). In Foster's (2008) analysis, for example, public support for government welfare spending is contingent upon the predicted reproductive behavior of (hypothetical) black welfare mothers, not that of white welfare mothers.7O’Brien (2004) finds that, as the number of black women on welfare rose and the welfare queen emerged in popular discourse, women no longer spoke in one voice about the need to alleviate poverty. Starting in the late 1970s, African American women became much more likely than other women to consider poverty a major national priority.8 Perhaps as a result, gender gaps in public support for “welfare” spending in particular were noticeably absent in the 1990s and early 2000s; national samples of (mostly white) women and men were equally opposed (Clark and Clark 2006; Gilens 1999; but see Dyck and Hussey 2008).         "
"13","The raced‐gendered images and assumptions associated with the welfare queen, which featured prominently in congressional debates on welfare reform in the 1990s (Hancock 2004; Hawkesworth 2003; Sparks 2003), may have had similar effects on the behavior of legislators. According to Hawkesworth, “Congresswomen of color were among the most outspoken opponents” of the PRWORA precisely because they saw “the Republican focus on out‐of‐wedlock births, unwed mothers, and single‐women heads of households…[as] a thinly veiled attack upon poor women of color” (2003, 542–43). But while congresswomen of color were united in their opposition to welfare reform, their white female colleagues were deeply divided; some, in fact, were on the forefront of efforts to frame poverty and welfare reform in terms of deviant behavior and the lack of “personal responsibility” associated with the welfare queen (Hawkesworth 2003; Hawkesworth et al. 2001; Neubeck and Cazenave 2001). Here again, scholars point to collective identities and experiences as motivating factors; only this time, those identities and experiences are intersectional. Hawkesworth argues that it was the “anger and resistance engendered by…experiences of racing‐gendering in the halls of Congress” (2003, 532) that compelled congresswomen of color to “devote such time and energy to the representation of an unorganized majority‐white underclass” (539). Mink (1998, 1–27) and Neubeck and Cazenave (2001, 170–76), on the other hand, attribute the relative indifference of white feminists in Congress and elsewhere to their own positions and experiences of race and class privilege.         "
"14","For all these reasons, one might expect that, at the state legislative level, it is women of color who are the most vocal and active advocates for more generous and less punitive approaches to welfare and who, in the end, have the greatest countervailing influence on welfare policy. It might even be the case that what previous studies (e.g., Preuhs 2006, 2007) have characterized as the ability of (all) black and Latino legislators to “mitigate [welfare] policy backlash” is really the doing of black female and Latina legislators. And, given how racially polarized the experience and politics of welfare have been, white female legislators may be more ambivalent about welfare reform, and more reluctant to become involved. As a result, they may make little or no distinct impression upon state welfare policy.         "
"15","            "
"16","H2 (Intersectional Hypothesis): The (liberal) impact of legislative women of color on state welfare policy will be greater than that of other women or of men of color.                  "
"17","But while legislative women of color may be the most committed and active advocates for poor women, they also may be the least influential. The women of color who fought so hard against welfare reform in Congress met with little success. Even when they had a seat at the table (during the Democratically controlled 103rd Congress), their efforts were rebuffed or ignored altogether and their credibility was repeatedly impugned (Hawkesworth 2003). Hawkesworth, in fact, uses welfare reform as a “particularly appropriate case” for examining “racing‐gendering” within Congress and the mechanisms by which elected women of color are themselves marginalized and disempowered (2003, 539). As in Congress, state legislative women of color often lacked the “sheer numbers” and positions of power with which to influence the development of TANF policies. In 1997, they were entirely absent from 12 state legislatures, constituted less than 10% of the remaining legislatures, and held positions of leadership (top party positions or committee chairs) in only 19.9 Furthermore, Smooth's (2008) study of African American women serving in the Georgia, Maryland, and Mississippi legislatures illustrates how women of color can be effectively denied power and influence even when they possess (relatively) large numbers, seniority, majority party status, and positions of leadership.         "
"18","Nonetheless, other studies suggest that state legislative women of color can and do have influence, under some circumstances at least. Orey et al. (2006) find that, contrary to their expectations, bills sponsored by African American women in the Mississippi state house in the late 1980s and 1990s were no less likely to pass than those introduced by others. Fraga et al. theorize that Latina state legislators “are uniquely positioned to leverage the intersectionality of their ethnicity and gender” in ways that enable them “to be the most effective long‐term advocates on behalf of working‐class communities of color” (2008, 158). Their survey of Latino/a state legislators shows that Latinas are more likely to forge coalitions across ethnic and gender lines, giving them a “strategic advantage” (162) in the policymaking process. By empirically gauging the distinct impact of state legislative women of color on welfare policy, this study sheds additional light on these debates about the power of intersectionality in legislative settings.         "
"19","To gauge the impact of legislative women on state welfare policy with attention to the intersecting dynamics of race and ethnicity, we compare two models of policy adoption. The first, additive model tests the single‐axis hypothesis (H1) by gauging the relationship between state welfare policy and the presence and power of all women in the legislature, controlling for the presence and power of (all) black and Latino legislators. The second, intersectional model tests the intersectional hypothesis (H2) by gauging the impact of the size and power of three potential legislative coalitions, each identified in terms of gender and race/ethnicity: women of color, other “white” women, and men of color.         "
"20","Our empirical analysis relies on data we collected for all 50 states, starting (when possible) with 1996, the last year AFDC was in effect, and ending (when possible) with 2007. For reasons explained below, we focus on the states’ initial (pre‐1999) reactions to the PRWORA mandate. Data sources and descriptive statistics for all measures are included in the online Supporting Information (Tables SI.1 through SI.3)."
"21","We gauge the impact of legislative women on multiple dimensions of state TANF policy, including those frequently examined in the existing literature as well as those particularly relevant to the raced‐gendered stereotypes and political dynamics discussed above. Together, our dependent variables capture many of the most salient, controversial, and consequential components of TANF policy (Soss et al. 2001, 380) and were all subject to the discretion of state policymakers.            "
"22","Most studies of state AFDC and/or TANF policy have focused at least in part on the generosity of the cash assistance provided to families on welfare, for this is one of the few areas in which state policymakers have always had discretion (Plotnick and Winters 1985; Preuhs 2006). To build upon this long‐standing interest, our first dependent variable gauges the level of cash benefits, operationalized as the dollar value of the TANF benefit for a family of three, adjusted for the state‐level annual cost of living (Berry, Fording, and Hanson 2000). We expect the real value of TANF cash benefits will be higher in states where legislative women—especially women of color—are more numerous and powerful.            "
"23","Most of our analysis focuses on “the rules and penalties that condition access to resources and structure the treatment citizens receive in government programs” (Soss et al. 2001, 379). TANF rules and regulations are the tools with which the state attempts to modify the behavior of poor people so that they take more “personal responsibility” for themselves and their children (Mettler 2000; Soss et al. 2001). In exercising discretion over these welfare rules, state policymakers choose just how tough they want to be when granting access to TANF benefits and determining the work‐related obligations of those who receive them.            "
"24","We therefore employ two broad indices of state welfare rules designed by Fellowes and Rowe (2004), one capturing how restrictively the states define initial and continued eligibility for TANF benefits and the other capturing how flexibly states impose work requirements upon TANF clients. Because the Fellowes and Rowe indices are available only for 1997–99, we replicated their measures as closely as possible for 1996–2007, identifying and coding the same 28 eligibility rules and the same 12 rules governing compliance with work requirements. All rules were coded as more or less restrictive/flexible according to the information available in the Urban Institute's Welfare Rules Database (WRD).10 Our expectation is that, in states where legislative women—especially women of color—are more numerous and powerful, TANF eligibility rules will be less restrictive (the eligibility index will be lower) and the TANF rules governing work‐related activity will be more flexible (the flexibility index will be higher).            "
"25","Our next set of dependent variables focuses on TANF rules that may be particularly salient to women. The first indicates whether a state has a family cap provision (as documented in the WRD).11 States that adopt the so‐called “family cap” rule limit the incremental increase in benefits when an additional child is born to a mother receiving aid. One of the most controversial welfare reforms of the 1990s, family caps address many of the concerns surrounding “welfare queens” who allegedly have more children in order to maximize and fully exploit their “government handouts.” Numerous scholars have criticized such policies as racialized violations of poor women's reproductive rights (e.g., Neubeck and Cazenave 2001; Roberts 1997; Smith 2007). Our expectation, therefore, is that family caps will be less prevalent in states where legislative women—especially women of color—are more numerous and powerful.            "
"26","Another dimension of the PRWORA that may be particularly salient to women is the Family Violence Option (FVO), which permits states to temporarily waive program requirements for survivors of domestic violence. Our final dependent variable indicates whether a state grants time limit extensions or exemptions for TANF recipients fleeing from or receiving treatment for domestic violence (according to the WRD).12 The FVO may very well have been inspired by the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA), which “initiated a nationally coordinated effort to study the problem of domestic violence”—including its relationship to poverty and welfare (Josephson 2002, 9). In the context of the VAWA, domestic violence was clearly a “women's issue,” both in terms of the bipartisan support it received from congresswomen and in terms of how they chose to frame the issue (Hawkesworth et al. 2001).            "
"27","Nonetheless, initial uncertainty and apprehension about how the FVO would be implemented in the states may have made even the most liberal, pro‐women state legislators hesitate. Indeed, according to the WRD, 12 of the 34 states that made available a time limit waiver for domestic violence survivors under AFDC in 1996 declined to adopt one under TANF in 1997. Battered women's advocates (even some who helped draft the FVO provisions) worried that, without effective guidelines, state discretion in identifying and evaluating the needs of survivors could do more harm than good. It could, for example, put such individuals in greater danger, invade their privacy, and jeopardize the assistance they would otherwise receive (Davies 1997; Raphael 1999). Advocates for poor women more generally were concerned that domestic violence waivers might make it more difficult or even impossible for other vulnerable recipients to receive similar waivers for other hardships (Graham 2001–2, 454–55; Mason 1998, 634). Given the long history of raced‐gendered welfare politics, poor women of color and their advocates may have been even more wary of state implementation of domestic violence services (Crenshaw 1991; Josephson 2002).            "
"28","Our expectations regarding the impact of legislative women on state adoption of domestic violence waivers are somewhat uncertain, given these early misgivings. If female state legislators were aware of the potential problems, say through their ties to women's advocacy networks, then they may have been more ambivalent about adopting FVO waivers than they were about adopting other measures ostensibly designed to ease the restrictions and sanctions associated with TANF. In that case, we would not expect FVO waivers to be any more prevalent in states where legislative women are more numerous and powerful. For reasons mentioned above, however, it may be that legislative women—and women of color especially—were even more wary of state implementation of FVO than their male colleagues, especially before 1999, when most of the implementation issues were resolved (Graham 2001–2, 454–55; Josephson 2002, 8). In that case, we might expect to see, prior to 1999, a negative relationship between the incorporation of women—especially women of color—in the state legislature and the likelihood of state adoption of domestic violence waivers.            "
"29","Although our data permit time‐series cross‐sectional analyses, modeling changes in state policy over the entire 12‐year time period (1996–2007) is not always appropriate (Soss et al. 2006, 802–4). Our own analysis indicates that most of the changes made in state welfare policy occurred between 1996 and 1998. For example, between 1996 and 1998, states made 70 adjustments to their TANF eligibility rules, for an average of 35 adjustments per year. Two‐thirds of those adjustments involved more than one rule change. In contrast, between 1998 and 2007, states made 108 adjustments in their eligibility rules, or an average of only 12 adjustments per year. Only 29% of those adjustments involved more than one rule change. Cash benefit levels is the only dimension of state TANF policy (examined here) that does not follow this trend. States made slightly more adjustments per year after 1998 than before (11.25 adjustments per year between 1998 and 2006; seven adjustments per year between 1996 and 1998).            "
"30","Thus, with the exception of cash benefits, the trends in state welfare policy adoption suggest a sort of punctuated equilibrium (Baumgartner and Jones 1993): a flurry of legislative activity immediately following the 1996 passage of the PRWORA, followed by relative stability. It is in the states’ initial reactions to the PRWORA, then, where the influence of state legislative women may be most pronounced and readily observed (Avery and Peffley 2005, 50). We therefore employ cross‐sectional analyses of our indicators of TANF policy as they existed in 1998, when the equilibrium likely began.13 And, while the PRWORA may have offered states the opportunity to start from scratch, we anticipate the more likely possibility that states adopted a more incremental approach to the transition from AFDC to TANF (Preuhs 2007). Controlling for the 1996 status quo of comparable AFDC policies, we gauge the ability of legislative women to effect more subtle shifts in state welfare policy toward less restrictive, more flexible, and more generous options (with the possible exception of the domestic violence time limit waivers).14"
"31","To test our hypotheses regarding the relationships between state TANF policy and the legislative incorporation of women and women of color, our independent variables measure the size and institutional power of several identity‐based coalitions in state legislatures. Given existing knowledge of the significance of African Americans and Latinos as both welfare recipients and legislators, the lack of research on the relationship between other racial/ethnic minority groups and welfare politics, plus the very small numbers of Asian American and Native American welfare recipients and state legislators (except in Hawaii), we focus on the potentially distinctive impact of black and Latino legislators—male and female. For the additive models, we measure the single‐axis incorporation, or the numerical presence and institutional power, of all female, all African American, and all Latino legislators in each state; for the intersectional models, we measure the race‐gender incorporation of black and Latina women (“women of color”), all other (“white”) women, and black and Latino men (“men of color”).15"
"32","Each measure of group incorporation is a factor score derived from three component variables: (1) descriptive representation, or the percentage of legislative seats in the upper and lower chambers that are occupied by group members; (2) general institutional incorporation, or the average proportion of weighted leadership positions across the two chambers that are occupied by group members (Preuhs 2006); and (3) specific institutional incorporation, or the percentage of social/human services committees in both chambers that are chaired by group members (Preuhs 2006).16 For each group, the three component variables (especially the first two) are strongly related and load on the same factor. Thus, we are confident these factor scores effectively measure the underlying, unidimensional concept of political incorporation (Browning, Marshall, and Tabb 1984; Preuhs 2007).            "
"33","Across all models, we control for the possible confounding influence of other state political, socioeconomic, and demographic pressures on welfare policymaking. A voluminous body of research identifies a large number and wide variety of factors that shape state welfare policy. We cull from that literature the factors that are also likely to affect the level of legislative representation and incorporation enjoyed by women (overall) and women of color (specifically) in the states (Reingold, Bratton, and Haynie 2009; Sanbonmatsu 2010).17"
"34","As noted above, the racial and ethnic composition of state populations (and welfare rolls) is key to understanding both the dynamics of welfare policymaking within and across the states and the election of African American and Latino men and women to state legislatures (Lublin et al. 2009; Preuhs 2007; Reingold, Bratton, and Haynie 2009). The racial/ethnic makeup of the state population is also strongly correlated with every measure of group incorporation we employ. Thus, we control for the racial and ethnic composition of state populations (percent black and Latino) in our models.18 For similar reasons, we also control for the ideological leanings of state electorates (citizen ideology; Berry et al. 1998); party control of the legislature (Democratic  control  of  legislature;Klarner 2003);19 several measures of statewide demand and capacity for welfare reform and expenditures, which are also related to women's socioeconomic status (percent high school graduates, unemployment rate, unmarried birth rate); and state political culture (moralistic; Elazar 1984).20 All time‐varying group incorporation and control variables are lagged one year prior to the observed dependent variable.21"
"35","We first assess whether the legislative incorporation of all women, regardless of race and ethnicity, affects states’ initial decisions regarding TANF benefits and rules. The key independent variables in these additive models are our factor scores of the political incorporation of all women, all black, and all Latino legislators. We include these, along with the control variables, in the five cross‐sectional models presented in Table 1.22 In Model 1, we regress the index of eligibility restrictions on the three single‐axis incorporation factor scores. Although none of the coefficients for the incorporation variables reaches standard significance levels, the estimated effect of female incorporation is close (p < 0.167). Thus, the presence and power of women legislators may have a slight, liberal effect on TANF eligibility policies.            "
"36","The remaining models in Table 1 provide even less support for the single‐axis hypothesis. According to Model 2, female legislative incorporation does not influence the degree to which states adopt more flexible TANF work requirements. This model does suggest, however, that state legislatures with higher degrees of Latino incorporation opt for more flexible TANF regulations. Holding all other dichotomous and categorical variables constant at their medians and all other continuous variables at their means, we estimate that, as Latino incorporation increases from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above, the predicted flexibility index score increases from 5.5 to 8.4 (King, Tomz, and Wittenberg 2000). African American incorporation also has a positive effect on flexibility, but it is noticeably weaker and not quite statistically significant (p < 0.172).23"
"37","In Model 3, we estimate the impact of legislative women on the probability of states adopting a family cap policy. Here, none of the group incorporation coefficients achieves standard significance levels. Model 4 gauges the impact of the single‐axis group incorporation scores on whether states permitted domestic violence time limit waivers in 1998. Here again, the results indicate that the legislative incorporation of women has no discernible impact on state TANF policy. Instead, the incorporation of Latinos in state legislatures appears to be associated with a lower probability of adopting domestic violence waivers. Also surprising (given previous evidence of racial backlash) is the finding that states with larger black and Latino populations are more likely to grant such waivers.24"
"38","Model 5 indicates that female legislators’ incorporation is associated with lower cash benefits during the early years of the TANF program. Figure 1a illustrates this relationship: as the factor score for women's incorporation increases from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above, the mean predicted cash benefit decreases from $528 to $500.25 Without accounting for racial/ethnic cleavages, we might conclude that states with more numerous and powerful female legislators were more likely than others to reduce cash benefits in the transition from AFDC to TANF. Our intersectional model will cast doubt on this conclusion.            "
"39","                Predicted Effects of Group Incorporation"
"40","Overall, the models in Table 1 provide lackluster and contradictory findings regarding the single‐axis hypothesis. In only one instance—eligibility requirements—does the presence and power of (all) women legislators even come close to having a significant, liberal effect on TANF policy. In other areas, namely cash benefit levels, female legislative incorporation may have the reverse effect. For the remaining TANF policies, however, legislative women seem to have no significant impact at all.            "
"41","In contrast to the additive models, the intersectional models (presented in Table 2) distinguish the potential impact of women of color from that of other women and from that of men of color, on the same set of state TANF policies. The key independent variables for the intersectional models are factor scores of the legislative incorporation of women of color, other “white” women, and men of color.            "
"42","Model 6 considers how well the intersectional model characterizes the relationship between gender, race/ethnicity, legislative incorporation, and state‐to‐state variation in TANF eligibility policies. From this model, it appears that women of color may have a more pronounced impact on the eligibility index than other legislative women and men of color have. Figure 1b shows that as the legislative incorporation of women of color increases from one standard deviation below the mean to one above, the predicted eligibility index falls from 0.60 to 0.52. States where legislative women of color are present and powerful have somewhat more lenient eligibility requirements. The impact of other legislative women is in the same direction, but noticeably weaker; the regression coefficient on the factor score for white women is just slightly above standard significance levels (p < 0.114). However, a Wald test reveals that the effect of women of color is not statistically different from that of white women.26"
"43","In Model 7, we find that the legislative incorporation of both women and men of color impacts the flexibility index. The effect of women of color is no different from that of men of color (Wald F‐test statistic = 0.02, p < 0.896), but does appear to be greater than that of other women (Wald F‐test statistic = 2.71, p < 0.108). Figure 1c shows that as the presence and power of women of color in the state legislature increases, so too does the flexibility of TANF work requirements. In contrast to the additive model, which indicated that legislative women have no influence over the flexibility of work requirements, the intersectional model shows that some legislative women (and some of their male colleagues) can and do have an impact.            "
"44","Model 8, on the other hand, shows that the intersectional framework is no more helpful than the additive approach in explaining state‐level variation in the family cap. The legislative incorporation of women of color (as well as other women and men of color) does not influence whether a state has a family cap policy. Since many states implemented family caps before 1996 through waivers to the AFDC program, our analysis of welfare policy changes that occurred between 1996 and 1998 may not allow for a full investigation of the impact of female legislators on family cap decisions. Indeed, across the additive and intersectional models, the strongest predictor of family caps in 1998 is whether the state had a family cap policy in 1996. The highly salient nature of this policy innovation, so strongly imbued with images of the welfare queen, may also have made it particularly difficult for these legislators to resist or reverse."
"45","The results of Model 9 confirm our suspicion that, given the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of domestic violence waivers in the early years of TANF, women of color may have been particularly reluctant to entrust such initiatives to the states. Thus, contrary to our general expectations, the presence and power of women of color is negatively associated with having domestic violence time limit waivers in 1998. Equivalence tests show that the coefficient for women of color is significantly different from that of other legislative women (χ2 statistic = 4.84, p < 0.028), while the impact of women of color is not different from that of men of color (χ2 statistic = 1.00, p < 0.318).27Figure 1d illustrates that as the women‐of‐color factor score increases from one standard deviation below the mean to one above, the predicted likelihood of having domestic violence time limit waivers decreases from 0.78 to 0.28.            "
"46","Interestingly, in Model 10, women of color and white women seem to have opposite effects on the initial adjustment from AFDC to TANF cash benefits; benefits appear to increase when women of color are present and powerful, and decrease when white women are more fully incorporated. The coefficients for the two factor scores are of nearly equal magnitude, but in opposite directions. The coefficient on black and Latina women's factor score is just slightly above standard significance levels (p < 0.127), but significantly different from that of other women (Wald F‐test statistic = 7.82, p < 0.008). If we were to consider the additive model exclusively, we might conclude that all legislative women have a negative effect on cash benefits. However, our intersectional model demonstrates that only white women's incorporation is negatively associated with cash benefits. This nuanced yet powerful finding is illustrated in Figures 1e and 1f. As the factor score for white women's incorporation goes from one standard deviation below to one above the mean, the predicted cash benefit decreases from $531 to $497. In contrast, as the presence and power of women of color increases from one standard deviation below the mean to one above, the predicted cash benefit increases from $501 to $527.            "
"47","In sum, our intersectional analyses indicate that in the formative years of TANF policymaking, legislative women of color did play a distinct role. Our results also demonstrate that the additive model may sometimes obscure the impact of race, ethnicity, and gender as they interact to affect state politics and policymaking. Intersectional models such as ours appear more adept at capturing such complex and contingent relationships (McCall 2005).            "
"48","At first glance, looking through a single‐axis lens, it may seem as if state legislative women failed to move welfare policy in a more liberal, women‐friendly direction, even in a period of policy disequilibrium. At best, they may have managed to relax the eligibility criteria a bit; at worst, they may have had a hand in reducing cash benefit levels. But on most policy dimensions examined here, the presence and power of (all) women in state legislatures seem to have made very little difference."
"49","The picture looks quite different, however, when viewed through an intersectional lens. Taking into account the intersecting gender and racial/ethnic identities of state legislators highlights both the contingent effects of gender and the pivotal role of women of color. In some instances, our analysis suggests that legislative women of all racial/ethnic backgrounds made a difference in state TANF policy. Eligibility restrictions were eased somewhat in states where legislative women of color and white women were more numerous and powerful. In other instances, legislative women of color seem to have acted without their white female counterparts. It was the incorporation of women of color, along with that of men of color, that pushed some states to adopt more flexible work requirements, not that of other women. At the same time, the presence and power of women of color (alone) made some states more reluctant to grant time limit waivers to victims of domestic violence. Given the initial uncertainties surrounding state implementation of the Family Violence Option, legislative women of color may have been most wary of the unintended but potentially harmful consequences of this seemingly women‐friendly policy. In yet another instance, legislative women of color and other women appear to have worked at cross‐purposes. While the presence and power of white women in the legislature are associated with a decrease in cash benefits, the incorporation of women of color is associated with an increase in cash benefits. Across all these divergent patterns, however, one trend is clear: the legislative incorporation of women of color mattered, suggesting they were indeed the most effective advocates for poor women in the era of welfare reform (Fraga et al. 2008).         "
"50","As our results imply, the impact of women on welfare policy depends on which women and which policies one examines. Nonetheless, it is quite remarkable that women—especially women of color—had any effect whatsoever. Women as a whole were a minority of legislators and legislative leaders in every state, a small minority in most. Women of color enjoyed fewer resources still. During the transition from AFDC to TANF, black women and Latinas never claimed more than 10% of the votes; they held top leadership positions and chaired social service committees in few states. State welfare policy itself proved resistant to nonincremental change, even in a period of disequilibrium. Overcoming inertia and pushing against the popular mandate of get‐tough welfare reform was a tall order, indeed. Yet, women of color, when they were able to gain a foothold within their legislative institutions, managed to make a difference."
"51","The implications of our findings are equally notable. They demonstrate, first and foremost, the utility of intersectionality as a concept and an analytic tool, as well as the limitations of more “parsimonious” single‐axis or additive approaches to studying the politics of gender, race, and class. The politics of welfare and other cross‐cutting issues (Cohen 1999; Htun and Weldon 2010) may not be properly understood in terms of either race or gender or class. Nor can we be content with simply adding women (or racial/ethnic minorities or poor people) to the equation, literally or figuratively. Doing so may very well obscure more than it reveals.         "
"52","Our study also adds an important cautionary note for the study of race, gender, and representation, reinforcing recent calls for more complex theorizing about the descriptive and substantive representation of marginalized groups (Beckwith and Cowell‐Meyers 2007; Reingold 2008; Htun and Weldon 2010). Our conclusions about which women and which policies suggest that questions about group representation and group interests may be better framed and best answered in terms of contingency. “Women's issues” may mean different things to different women, in different places. That such a small but highly motivated group of black female and Latina state legislators can make a difference in welfare policy also suggests that substantive representation at the aggregate level is not simply a function of large numbers or a critical mass of distinctive individuals (Weldon 2002). Rather, “critical actors” who “put in motion individual and collective campaigns” for policy change (Childs and Krook 2006, 528) may hold the key (see also Preuhs 2005). Here again, intersectionality plays an important role. It not only implores us to think critically about the unity of identity‐based, single‐axis coalitions and the “vague imperatives of ‘sex’ or ‘gender,’‘race’ or ‘ethnicity’” underlying the logic of critical mass theory (Childs and Krook 2006, 528). It also suggests who might be the most likely critical actors: those who, like legislative women of color confronting welfare reform, can best understand and appreciate the complex intersections of inequality and marginalization, power and privilege at work.         "
"53","We do not mean to suggest, however, that our approach to intersectionality is the only or even the best alternative in every circumstance. Our explicit focus on women of color and our quantitative, cross‐sectional analysis of the impact of various legislative coalitions defined in terms of fixed categories of race and sex are appropriate for the research questions at hand and a good place to start, given the history of welfare politics in the United States and the existing research. But as Hancock (2007a, 2007b) and others (e.g., Bedolla 2007; Dhamoon 2011; McCall 2005; Weldon 2006b) have argued, it would be a mistake to equate intersectionality writ large with such a limited approach—or, indeed, any single approach. Women of color are not the only intersectional subjects. Gender, race, and class are not the only categories of difference relevant to politics, policymaking, and “relations of marginality and privilege” (Dhamoon 2011, 230). The meaning, significance, and coherence of such categories may be even more complex, dynamic, and contingent than our models can capture. In short, intersectional research, including future research on representation and policymaking, can and should extend much farther and deeper, both substantively and methodologically.         "
