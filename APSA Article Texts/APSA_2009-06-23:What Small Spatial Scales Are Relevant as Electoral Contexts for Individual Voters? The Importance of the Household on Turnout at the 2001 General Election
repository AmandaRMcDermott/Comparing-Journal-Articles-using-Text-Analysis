"1","Early U.S. studies emphasized the role of the household as the prime locale for the acquisition of political preferences (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Jennings and Niemi 1968) and stressed its importance on voting patterns, particularly how electoral participation tended to be a joint household activity (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Glaser 1959). More recent work suggests that people who live together may take political cues from one another, and this may enhance political engagement (Zuckerman and Kotler‐Berkowitz 1998). Those who have close social relationships are therefore more likely to vote than those who do not; persons who live with others behave differently than those who live alone (Zuckerman, Fitzgerald, and Dasovic 2005). Similarly, there is circumstantial evidence that the two electoral choices—whether to vote and which party to support—are related, which adds credence to the claim that electoral participation is the outcome of social processes (Zuckerman, Fitzgerald, and Dasovic 2005).            "
"2","Moreover, political/electoral “homogamy,” in party identification and electoral participation, is extremely high among married couples, with heterogamy more likely among those who were cohabiting and married couples with heterogamous family backgrounds (Brynin 2000; Lampard 1997). There is also evidence that married people turn out to vote in greater proportions than those who are single, divorced, separated, or live with a partner because they are more attuned to traditional values, such as a sense of civic duty, than those with other domestic arrangements (Denver 2008). A recent study has found extremely high levels of intrahousehold agreement in party support at a general election and also in changes in voting behavior between elections, although these patterns do vary by household type and size (Johnston et al. 2005a). Political homogamy occurs where there is some kind of kinship foundation, either through marriage or cohabitation. While two‐person households have high levels of agreement, there seems to be far less intrahousehold agreement in multiple‐adult households (Johnston et al. 2005a). Recent studies have found that agreement among married couples increases over time (Zuckerman, Fitzgerald, and Dasovic 2005). The similarity between spouses is largely driven by interpersonal influence, with spouses three times as influential as other relationships (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995). The frequency of political discussion with a spouse also has a positive effect on voter turnout (Zuckerman, Dasovic, and Fitzgerald 2007). More recently, using get‐out‐the‐vote field experiments, Nickerson (2008) shows that 60% of the propensity to vote is passed on to the other member of the household.            "
"3","This article emphasizes the importance of the household on voter participation. Despite being mentioned in early British studies of voting behavior as the main locale of political socialization (Butler and Stokes 1974), the household has, until very recently, been largely ignored (Johnston et al. 2005a). Part of the problem is the absence of any data often because most electoral surveys randomly sample one individual within a household, and simply ignore other permanent residents, e.g., the British Election Study (BES).6 Furthermore, most studies of the household which have shown within‐household effects could not differentiate household effects from those in the neighbourhood or other small‐scale effects (Johnston et al. 2005; e.g., BHPS). For the first time, using a hierarchical dataset, this article examines the existence and strength of household effects on electoral participation in Britain relative to other spatial contexts.            "
"4","Numerous analysts have identified variations in turnout at different spatial scales, independent of voter characteristics. Early studies of the United States, for example, showed the importance of where voters live relative to candidates (Key 1949). The persistence of spatial clustering in voting behavior can be attributed either to genuine contextual effects or simply to the clustering of similar individuals in geographical space (e.g., McAllister and Studlar 1992). While unmeasured compositional differences are undoubtedly part of the explanation, there is also considerable evidence concerning the persistence of genuine contextual effects on voting. Previous research on the contextual or neighbourhood effects has considered a number of causal mechanisms, many of which can be traced back to Cox (1969). These include acquaintance‐circle bias, or social interaction effects which, due to the tendency for the frequency of interactions to decline with geographical distance from the home, will tend to be greater at smaller spatial scales (e.g., Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995; Miller 1978). These “conversion by conversation” or “contagion” theories emphasize how talking to friends, families, and neighbours may persuade some people to participate or convert them to vote differently than they might usually do (Pattie and Johnston 1999). Evidence from the United States suggests that social networks in other contexts, such as churches or workplaces, have a similar influence on voting (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2005; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995).            "
"5","Alongside social networks and contagion effects, spatial variations in turnout at smaller scales have also been attributed to variations in the local environment, such as levels of unemployment or changes in house prices, as observed by people in their local milieu (Johnston et al. 2004, 2005b; Pattie and Johnston 2000). Here, the role of the local media may play a role in mediating their effects and influence political attitudes and how or whether people vote. At the same time, there are likely to be some selection effects with individuals choosing (or being constrained) to live in close proximity to people of similar socioeconomic status.            "
"6","Spatial variations in voting may also reflect the intensity of party activity, with local constituency campaigning now accepted as an important influence on electoral participation and the actual outcome (Denver and Hands 1997; Johnston and Pattie 1995). Despite the professionalization and centralization of party campaigns, the local campaign remains integral in the party's efforts to mobilize its own voters. Party targeting and tactics or seat marginality often leads to differential activity between constituencies. Yet, there is growing evidence that parties, through sophisticated local targeting strategies and grassroots activism, now operate at much smaller spatial electoral scales (both inter‐ and intraward) in order to maximize their potential rewards (Cutts 2006). Here the hierarchical design replicates the small‐scale electoral contexts for individual voters. However, the unique contribution of this article is not to substantiate which of these processes are most important, but, for the first time, to establish the relative importance of different spatial scales for understanding these processes.            "
"7","This article focuses on the relative importance of the household and small spatial scales on voter participation at the 2001 British General Election. Using marked electoral registers it is possible to measure individual‐level turnout without relying on turnout reported in sample surveys or ecological inference.7 As explained below, the nested multilevel design enables a hierarchical logistic regression model to be fitted with the estimates derived using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation procedure (Browne et al. 2005; Rasbash et al. 2000). Using this approach, a number of unresolved questions can be addressed, specifically, at what level, household, immediate neighbourhood, and ward, do such variations in voter participation occur, and what the relative importance of these spatial scales on turnout in 2001 is.            "
"8","Following this, the focus of the article turns to the effects of the household on voter participation, in particular, investigating intrahousehold turnout in 2001 by household size and whether living with other electors who vote results in other people in the household voting. The analysis seeks to substantiate evidence of electoral homogamy where there is some kinship foundation, specifically within two‐elector households, most of which exist through marriage or cohabitation. This leads us to anticipate not only greater high levels of correspondence between electors turning out in two‐elector households, but also higher levels of voting within these households, particularly in comparison with single‐elector households, members of which lack the stimuli of a partner with whom to visit the polling station. A similar hierarchical approach is used to model the relative importance of spatial scales on turnout of individuals living in single, two‐elector, and multiple‐elector households. Here the expectation, given recent scholarly evidence, is that the household level is more important than other spatial scales for two‐elector households, although this may diminish to some extent for multiple‐elector households."
"9","To substantiate the findings from the electoral registers, we use the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) data to gauge the level of household clustering after taking account of the possibility that individuals choose to live with others from similar social backgrounds and with similar political attitudes. Notwithstanding that the household setting is the main locale where interaction that affects whether one participates or not takes place, it is also emphasized that going to the polling station is essentially a physical activity which may be performed collectively. For these reasons, large and significant household clustering is still expected, even after conditioning for individual characteristics and attitudes. The hypotheses are:"
"10","                              "
"11"," H1: Different contexts matter, and therefore there will be variations in voter turnout simultaneously at all spatial scales modelled.                     "
"12"," H2: Due to proximity, the smaller the spatial scale becomes, the more clustering one would expect to find. There will be a relatively large amount of clustering of voting (or nonvoting) by household.                     "
"13"," H3: Household clustering is likely to be relatively more important than spatial clustering amongst two‐elector households compared to other households.                     "
"14"," H4: Turnout will be higher in two‐elector households, but, more generally, turnout will be higher among electors who live with other voters compared to those who live with nonvoters.                     "
"15"," H5: Between‐household variance will be significant even after taking account of individual characteristics and attitudes.                     "
"16","This research uses marked electoral registers from the 2001 British General Election, for a sample of 97 wards, based on a stratified random sample. The sample contains wards from England and Wales and excludes postal voters. These are regarded as missing because, for any given recipient of a postal vote, we do not know if the vote was cast (Fieldhouse and Cutts 2007). All electors were included in the selected wards, which were used as the primary sampling units (Cutts et al. 2007).8 In order to address which context really matters, we ascribed a number of identifiers to each elector in the sample using the address information on the electoral register (for example, all persons listed under the same postcode were allocated the same postcode identifier). This produces a hierarchical dataset that permits us to examine individual voter turnout at various separate spatial scales simultaneously.9 Those included in the final models were:         "
"17","                        "
"18","the household;"
"19","the postcode or immediate neighbourhood; and"
"20","the electoral ward."
"21","The sample contains 562,570 individuals who were nested in 298,464 households (Fieldhouse and Cutts 2007). Because the sample covers the full population of each primary sampling unit, we also have complete information about voting in each of the sampled units (whether that is household, postcode, etc.). However, it proved computationally impossible to run the models described below using such large numbers, so we took a 10% random sample of households (56,071 individuals) from the dataset for this analysis. Subsequently, the separate scales nested into each other as follows—29,778 households in 1,594 postcodes, which in turn are nested in 97 electoral wards.10 This, as far as we are aware, is novel in the analysis of turnout, largely because the availability of all electors within the same postcode (as we have here) is rarely available. The clustered nature of the sample has considerable advantages when attempting to understand within‐ and between‐area variations.         "
"22","In addition to the sample of marked electoral registers, we use the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to examine whether household variation is still prominent after controlling for self‐selection of others from similar social backgrounds and with similar political attitudes.11 Wave 11 of the BHPS is used to coincide with questions relating to voting behavior in the 2001 General Election. These data permit a two‐level hierarchical model approach (individuals nested in households), with the addition of individual‐level characteristics not available in the electoral registers.         "
"23","Aside from the availability of this unique dataset and the contemporaneous BHPS data, 2001 is a rather good British election upon which to base this analysis. The incumbent Labour government was returned to power with a very slightly reduced majority, and there was nothing exceptional about the spatial distribution of turnout, which ranged from 34.1% in Liverpool Riverside to 72.3% in Winchester, with a standard deviation of 6.4% (up from 5.6% at the previous election).12 Indeed, at 59% the level of turnout was sufficiently low by U.K. standards to ensure a good deal of variance in and between spatial units at both ends of the distribution.         "
"24","The complex hierarchical sample design, together with the desire to estimate the spatial source of variation in turnout, suggests a hierarchical modelling is necessary. Hierarchical or multilevel modelling is a methodology which provides a framework for exploring how relationships vary across hierarchical structures, whether these be natural or introduced in the sample design. The approach is especially useful because it is helpful to understand the variability associated with each level of the hierarchy. For the analysis of our marked electoral registers, variance components models are fitted in order to generate estimates of variance at the different spatial levels. It should be noted that the primary purpose of these models is not to identify the causes of voting and nonvoting (which are the subject of much other research), but rather to identify the sources of variance. To achieve this goal, the modelling strategy proceeds through the following four stages:"
"25","                              "
"26","Model 0: models the variation in turnout among individuals"
"27","Model 1: models the variation in turnout among individuals within households"
"28","Model 2: models the variation in turnout among individuals within households, within postcodes"
"29","Model 3: models the variation in turnout among individuals within households, within postcodes, within electoral wards"
"30","It is possible to illustrate the basic hierarchical model structure by using Model 1 as a simple example. Here individuals at level 1 are nested within households at level 2. This hierarchical binary logistic model, with no predictor variables, can be expressed as follows (Goldstein 2003; Johnston et al. 2005):               "
"31","In simple terms, the expectation of the binary outcome Yij for individual i in household j is the propensity to vote Πij, which is determined by the overall average term or fixed part of the model β0, and the random part or household term μ0j, which is allowed to vary. The binary outcome at level 1 follows a Bernoulli distribution, while the household terms is from a Gaussian distribution, which is conventionally summarized by the between‐household variance term σ2μ0 (Goldstein 2003).            "
"32","The hierarchical logistic models are fitted using MLwiN 3.2, with the estimates for the model derived using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation procedure (Browne et al. 2005). It is common to estimate hierarchical models using estimation methods based on marginal quasi‐likelihood (MQL) or penalized (predictive) quasi‐likelihood (PQL) procedures. However, when fitting binary response models, both of these quasi‐likelihood estimators lead to an underestimation of the random effects or variance parameters, particularly when they are large and there are small numbers of observations within higher‐level units (Browne et al. 2005; Goldstein and Rasbash 1996; Rodriguez and Goldman 1995). As Johnston notes, this is particularly relevant for individuals in households, given that the latter often contain relatively few individuals (particularly when one considers those electors eligible to vote), and between‐household effects often tend to be fairly large (Johnston et al. 2007). While the PQL estimation is also less biased than the MQL method for the fixed effects (Goldstein and Rasbash 1996), recent evidence suggests that the Bayesian estimation procedure (MCMC method with diffuse priors) is less biased than either of the quasi‐likelihood methods for binary response models (Browne et al. 2005).            "
"33","The MCMC approach simulates new values for each unknown parameter of interest by sampling from the distribution for those parameters conditional on the values for the other parameters. It also uses the data and the prior information for a parameter through a prior distribution.13 In simple terms, an algorithm proceeds in a series of steps where a proposal distribution14 is used to generate a new value for the parameter of interest and the method either accepts the new value or rejects it, which in the case of rejection results in the chain remaining where it is. Once the chain has become stationary or converged, inferences can be made from the chain values. Here, we used MLwiN software to estimate the starting values using first‐order PQL, then 5,000 runs to derive the desired proposal distribution (discarded after convergence of the “burn in” period), followed by 100,000 simulated random draws to obtain the final estimates. We use the Metropolis‐Hastings algorithm and the default diffuse gamma priors for variance parameters. The estimates in Table 1 are based on the mean of the simulated values, and the standard error is the standard deviation of the converged distribution. These estimates correspond to the traditional maximum likelihood estimate and its standard error.            "
"34","The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) compares the relative effectiveness of different models and is used to evaluate their goodness of fit (Spiegelhalter, Best, and van der Linde 2002; van der Linde 2005). The DIC statistic accounts for the number of parameters in the model, and consequently a small difference in DIC between the variance components models would suggest little improvement.15"
"35","The initial stage (model 0) only models variations among individuals. The following stages introduce separate spatial scales within which individuals are nested, so the relative importance of each separate spatial level can be gauged. Table 1 shows the estimated coefficients for each of the separate levels in the three random effects models, together with their standard errors. In all models, each spatial level is statistically significant, indicating differences in the propensity of individuals to turn out in 2001 by household address, by postcode, and by electoral ward.         "
"36","The observed variation between postcodes remains statistically significant throughout, although the size of the coefficient in Model 3 is smaller than in the previous model. This suggests some of the immediate neighbourhood variation is attributable to processes at the ward level. Nevertheless, this is the first hierarchical analysis of turnout, which incorporates postcode as a spatial unit and, arguably, the postcode is the most authentic locale in which “neighbourhood effects” occur. The statistical importance of the postcode level relative to other small spatial scales will give heart to advocates of the “neighbourhood effect hypothesis” although such inferences are only circumstantial, given that such processes are not directly tested here. The evidence stresses the relative significance of both the postcode and ward level, with the former larger than the latter. This might be due to social homogeneity or neighbourhood effects, or, more likely, a combination of both, although determining whether this is the case is beyond the scope of this article."
"37","Of greater statistical significance is household variation. While the introduction of other spatial scales did lead to a fairly small reduction in the coefficient, the most significant variation by far is between households. Using the latent variable approach (Goldstein and Rasbash 1996), the intraclass household correlation is estimated to be 7.603/(7.603 + 3.29),16 which suggests that 70% of the variation is at the household level compared to 26% at the individual level. This is a rare example of studies using microdata where higher‐level variance (household) is larger than the individual. Part of the explanation may lie in the act of voting itself. Unlike deciding which party to support, casting a ballot involves a physical act and is likely to be performed collectively; for example, often people walk to the polling station together to cast their vote. It therefore seems that a great deal of the total variation in turnout in Britain in 2001 can be accounted for by the household context. This is also indicated by the goodness‐of‐fit statistics (Table 2). The introduction of variation within household addresses in Model 1 led to a significant reduction in the DIC value. Following this, each stage results in a further reduction in the DIC value. Nevertheless, these reductions are fairly small when compared to the change in DIC value from Model 0 to Model 1, although each is statistically significant (Burnham and Anderson 2002).         "
"38","A number of U.K. voting studies have shown that living alone reduces the probability of turning out (Brynin 2000; Zuckerman 2005). This may be because those living alone are less likely to have a stake in society or have lower levels of social capital. For instance, married men and women rank much higher on measures of social capital, while those living alone are significantly less trusting and less engaged in civic activities (Putnam 1995). For various reasons (as discussed above) we might expect higher intrahousehold variation in two‐elector households than in larger households. Firstly, individuals forming a two‐elector household or partnership are relatively likely to self‐select those from similar backgrounds who may share political attitudes. Secondly, frequent discussion in the household may result in a convergence of views, or the conversion of those individuals with previous opposing views to shared attitudes, although in some cases it may lead to opposing views being strengthened (Johnston et al. 2005a; Zuckerman, Fitzgerald, and Dasovic 2005). Such social relationships are likely to be less intimate, with discussion less frequent in larger households, which may affect turnout. It was suggested above that voting is an activity which is often performed collectively. Not only does this imply high intrahousehold correlations, but also having someone to vote with increases the likelihood of voting and may suggest that two‐elector households should be more likely to vote. Moreover, two‐elector households may simply be proxies for marital status or age effects (individuals are more likely to be from middle or older age groups), both of which are positively associated with high levels of civic engagement, including voting. Consequently, given the overwhelming importance of household address on turnout relative to other spatial scales as shown in Table 1, we might expect two features to emerge from our analyses. Firstly, voter turnout in the 2001 British General Election is likely to be higher in two‐elector households than single‐ or multiple‐elector households. Secondly, the amount of variation when modelled will arguably be different for each household size, as not all of the spatial scales will be equally relevant for people living in different household sizes. However, it is likely that there will be a higher intrahousehold correlation for two‐elector households. In other words, it is probable that the variation between two‐elector households will be greater than between other household sizes.         "
"39","To explore this, it is possible to use the original sample of marked electoral registers. This includes voting data for more than 560,000 electors in just under 300,000 households (Table 3).17 Around one‐fifth of the overall sample lived in single‐elector households. Here, turnout was more than 7% below the national figure for England and Wales. This finding is similar to previous evidence; those who live together are more likely to turn out than those who live alone. As expected, those living in multiple registered adult households (five or more) were also less likely to participate than those in two‐elector households. It is possibly more difficult for individuals in larger households to engage in the frequent interaction necessary to build strong ties through which other individuals may be influenced to change their behavior. Also multiple‐elector households include student households, which tend to have low participation rates and often do not have the strong immediate social and personal networks of families and other household types.         "
"40","The overall pattern is therefore as hypothesized. Turnout was highest for those individuals in two‐elector registered households and fairly high among individuals living in three‐ or four‐person registered households, although the latter was just over 1% below the national figure for England and Wales.18 It is probable that a high proportion of the two‐elector registered households in the dataset represents the traditional nuclear family. This household composition may be more politically engaged than others for economic and social welfare reasons (e.g., childcare, education, etc.) and because they may feel that participating in the political process is a means of shaping or preserving their children's future. Moreover, they are more likely to do things together for practical reasons, including going to the polling station. Here, there is further circumstantial evidence that those who live together often turn out together, and that household composition clearly matters. Of course, this could be the result of self‐selection, the outcome of a convergence of opinions (Kan and Heath 2003), or simply the existence of some kinship relationship (marriage or cohabitation) among members of the household (Johnston et al. 2005a).         "
"41","In keeping with other recent evidence (Johnston et al. 2005), it seems that individuals living in two‐elector households are more likely to turn out than those living in multiple‐elector households or living alone. While there is not any information about whether individuals in the sample are married or cohabiting, it is reasonable to assume that, for the overwhelming majority, some kinship foundation exists in these households. Given these findings, for those individuals living in two‐elector households it is likely that household is relatively more important than other spatial scales as a context for voter participation. With social relationships likely to be less intimate and discussion less frequent in households with more adult members, one might expect the household context to be less important in such households. Equally, the habit of doing things together may be less established. Yet, not all levels will be equally relevant for different household sizes, and arguably the expectation is for variation to be different for each household size. Nonetheless, using a similar hierarchical nested model design as before (households in postcodes in wards), it is still possible to assess the relative importance of these various small spatial scales on voter turnout in these different household sizes.         "
"42"," Table 4 shows the estimated coefficients by household size for each of the separate spatial levels. As hypothesized, for two‐elector households, by far the largest and most significant variation is that between households. For multiple households, the household remains statistically significant, but the estimated coefficient is much lower than that for two‐elector households.19Figure 1 shows the difference with more than 86% of the variation at the household level for two‐elector households compared to 51% for multiple households.20"
"43","                 Partitioning the Variance from MCMC Models of Turnout (Overall and by Household Size)                      "
"44","A statistically significant amount of spatial clustering exists at the ward level for single, two‐elector, and multiple‐elector households, although it is far smaller than the variation for household address. For single people, 13% of the variation in turnout is at the postcode level. However, this scale becomes redundant for those living in two‐ or multiple‐person households relative to the other spatial levels. This suggests that the postcode variation may reflect a clustering of household size by postcode; for example, some postcodes have many two‐person registered households and other postcodes with numerous multiple‐elector households. Generally, however, it is the household setting where most variation lies, and the arena in which frequent discussion, learning, and trust form the basis of cue giving in social relationships, and it is within this context that people mainly receive these cues which strongly affect whether one votes or not."
"45","Perhaps a more intuitive way of understanding household variation is to illustrate the impact of living with other voters. Table 5 shows the probability of voting for individuals given the voting behavior of the electors they live with. As reported above, just over half of electors living alone voted in 2001. More notable is the effect of living with other voters. Whereas nearly nine out of ten voters living in a two‐elector household where the other elector voted, voted themselves, only two out of ten did so when living with a nonvoter. Similarly, nearly seven out of ten voters living with a voter in a multiple‐elector household themselves participated in 2001, while less than 15% did so when living with no other voters. Quite clearly, if one person in the household votes, particularly in two‐elector households, it is extremely likely that others in the household will also vote and vice versa. As mentioned previously, these findings do not control for individual characteristics, and one would suspect that for two‐elector households in particular there would be a significant amount of correlation between individual‐level variables (e.g., age). Notwithstanding this, these estimates are fairly dramatic and provide further circumstantial evidence that there are very high levels of within‐household agreement to turnout, which undoubtedly reinforces the saliency of this spatial scale on voter participation in the United Kingdom.            "
"46","So far, the findings have clearly shown the saliency of the household context on turnout, both relative to other micro spatial scales and after disaggregating by household size. Different household sizes have different amounts of variation. In two‐elector households either both are likely to vote or neither will vote, while in multiple‐elector households perhaps one person will turn out to vote while others do not. One of the limitations of the data based on marked electoral registers is the absence of any individual information such as socioeconomic or demographic characteristics. Consequently, it is virtually impossible to rule out selection effects as the explanation for the clustering of voters within households (that is because individuals who live together self‐select others from similar socioeconomic backgrounds or with similar political attitudes). To address these questions we use 2001 British Household Panel Survey data (wave 11), which include information about individual voting behavior at the 2001 General Election21 and their social and political attitudes. Notwithstanding unobserved heterogeneity, controlling for attitudes takes account of the self‐selection of household members, but at the same time will inevitably partial out some of the genuine effect of household discussion. The residual household variance is therefore likely to be due to a shared decision to vote than shared social characteristics.         "
"47","The optimal approach is to simultaneously model individual and household variation using a basic hierarchical modelling structure with individuals at level 1 nested within households at level 2. Like the earlier models, estimates are derived using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation procedure. Three models are fitted: a simple two‐level random model with no predictor variables (Model A), a two‐level model controlling for a range of individual socioeconomic variables (social class, marital status, education, gender, tenure, etc.) that have previously been shown to be important influences on turnout (Model B), and a two‐level model with both individual socioeconomic variables and political attitudes (Model C). The 2001 BHPS includes questions about each individual's interest in the election, strength of partisanship, and indicators of engagement in local networks through voluntary activity in social and local community groups. Similarly, it is possible to include questions about individuals' current and changing financial situations, as well as their financial expectations. Many of these variables have been included as indicators in rival theories of turnout (Clarke et al. 2004).         "
"48","The standardized coefficients22 from the MCMC hierarchical regression models, including only the significant covariates, are reported in Table 6. The main purpose of standardizing the coefficients is to obtain the relative importance of different variables in influencing turnout. The inclusion of individual respondents' characteristics and attitudes led to significant reductions in the DIC value. These reductions are fairly large and statistically significant (Burnham and Anderson 2002).         "
"49","In Model A, the estimate of household variance (7.260) is lower than the estimate (9.064) recorded from the marked electoral register data, but still substantial. The inclusion of individual characteristics and attitudes in Models B and C, respectively, allows the estimation of the level‐2 variances conditional on these covariates. In other words, the level‐2 estimate is the variation between households after accounting for differential household composition in terms of these individual characteristics. In Model B, a number of predictor variables are statistically significant and follow the direction one might expect; for example, if you are married you are more likely to vote than if you are not, older age groups are more likely to turn out than those aged between 18 and 24, etc. However, even after controlling for individual respondents' socioeconomic characteristics, the estimate of between‐household variance remains large and significant (6.329). Using the latent variable approach, the intraclass correlation is 6.329/(6.329 + 3.29), so that just under 66% of the variation is at the household level. This suggests that the large household effect is not just a product of selection effects, specifically, people with similar characteristics living together."
"50","Model C includes respondents' attitudes along with personal characteristics. While some variables were insignificant (voluntary activity), strength of partisanship, financial expectations, and political interest were statistically significant in the expected direction. Even after the inclusion of these fixed effects, the between‐household variance remains both large and significant (5.613). The latent variable approach suggests that 63% of variance is at the household level. This suggests that those who live together in the same household have a strong tendency to vote together regardless of their political attitudes and interests, thus ruling out the argument that clustering is simply a product of the convergence of values and characteristics within households."
"51","From these initial explorations, it seems that household variation in turnout cannot be fully explained by individuals who live together from similar socioeconomic backgrounds or with similar political attitudes. Yet part of the unexplained household variation may be due to the actual voting act. Unlike the process of choosing a political party to support (a mental decision), with the possible exception of postal voting, the act of voting itself involves a physical activity (going to the polling station) which may be performed collectively. Few, if any, local studies have solely examined whether there is a propensity for individuals in the same household to vote together at similar times, particularly couples, although voting records from a U.K. local case study provides circumstantial evidence of this at a recent local election (Cutts 2006).

"52","The primary purpose of this article was to establish the relative importance of three small spatial scales on voter participation in 2001. In keeping with spatial theories of voting (Cox 1969), it has been established that turnout and voting are spatially clustered, yet scholars have been frustrated in their attempts to identify variations in voter participation at small spatial scales by data limitations. While there is growing evidence that voting operates at much smaller spatial scales than was previously thought,23 even these studies have been hindered by data difficulties and the inability to separate the household scale from the neighbourhood (Johnston et al. 2007). Here, for the first time, using the nested marked electoral register dataset, it was possible to examine individual voter turnout at several spatial scales and ascertain their relative importance. The hierarchical logistic model highlighted differences in the propensity of individuals to turn out to vote in 2001 at each of these small spatial scales, either by household address, by postcode, or by ward (H1). Even though the use of the postcode scale is novel and adds to the findings, the results show that household clustering was far more important than spatial clustering. This finding upholds the second hypothesis (H2). The household setting is clearly the main locale where individuals take political cues from each other, and the main findings add credence to the claims that interaction within this setting ultimately affects whether one actually participates or not.         "
"53","Further evidence of the saliency of the household context on turnout is apparent after disaggregating by household size. In general, the results are consistent with other recent evidence. Turnout is much higher in two‐elector households than single‐ or multiple‐elector households (H4), which likely reflects some kind of kinship relationship (marriage or cohabitation). Even after examining the relative importance of small spatial scales on voter turnout in different household sizes, household clustering was far more important than spatial clustering for two‐elector households than other households (H3). The analyses of electors who live with other voters also seem to bear this out. Nearly 90% of electors in two‐elector households who live with another voter voted themselves (H4). This also suggests an answer as to why turnout is lower in single‐elector households: there is simply nobody in the household to discuss politics with and nobody with whom to visit the polling station. Furthermore, more detailed survey data provided evidence of large and significant household clustering, even when allowing for individual characteristics and attitudes (H5)."
"54","These findings reassert the importance of the household context on voter participation and complement recent studies on voter choice (Johnston et al. 2005; Zuckerman et al. 2004). To effectively research the processes involved, it is vital to know the spatial scale at which they are operating, and, by implication, the relative importance of these spatial scales on voter turnout. Previous research has often assumed that small spatial scales such as the neighbourhood are the most important (Johnston et al. 2004). Here we show that the household is by far the most important influence on voter participation. The intermediate spatial scale or wider political environment (here represented by the electoral ward) also appears to matter, while smaller spatial scales such as the immediate neighbourhood environment are less important. This implies that further research should focus on the different processes involved at the household and intermediate spatial scale. For instance, at the household level, these might include the importance of shared values and beliefs or political discussion, as well as the potentially communal dimension to going to vote (Zuckerman, Dasovic, and Fitzgerald 2007). As discussed above, there are numerous explanations for the spatial clustering of voting at the intermediate scale, including the shared social and economic environments in which people live, the strategic political context, and campaign effects. For instance, parties vary in the intensity in which they mobilize voters at a number of spatial levels ranging from the constituency to the intermediate spatial scale analyzed here (Cutts 2006).         "
"55","To date, little or no scholarly work has examined the act of visiting the polling station, whether people from the same household vote at the same time, or how this collective act influences levels of participation. Similarly the effects of other spatial contexts on voter participation such as the workplace remain underresearched by political scientists. Yet while this analysis cannot pinpoint the causal mechanisms involved, these findings provide very strong evidence that, of all the local contexts electors move in, it is the household which is the most salient for voter participation."
