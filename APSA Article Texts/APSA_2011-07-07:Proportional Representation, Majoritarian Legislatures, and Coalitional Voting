"1","Much of the literature on PR assumes that the policy, p, implemented following an election equals the vote‐weighted (or seat‐weighted) average of the parties’ ideal policies, or:            "
"2","The assumption of vote‐weighted policy outcomes is also widely used in work considering the consequences of electoral institutions. It appears, for example, in models showing that under PR systems, conflict or civil war is less likely (Esteban and Ray 2008; Reynal‐Querol 2002, 2005), that the provision of public goods is greater (Lizzeri and Persico 2001), that budget deficits are not affected (Lizzeri 1999), that corrupt politicians are less likely to be elected (Myerson 1993), that interest groups can gain influence by threatening contributions to other parties (Chamon and Kaplan n.d.), and that parties that are expected to win a majority are more likely to cater to special interest groups (Grossman and Helpman 1996). The assumption also appears in experimental and computational work. Schram and Sonnemans (1996), for example, study the effects of electoral institutions on turnout in an experimental setting and Kollman, Miller, and Page (1997) consider sorting in a Tiebout model with computational methods.         "
"3","A similar assumption has guided researchers’ interest in the median correspondence, i.e., the proximity between the median voter and the median legislator (see, e.g., Powell and Vanberg 2000). That is, the relevance of the median correspondence relies on the policy preference of the median legislator being a good indicator of the expected policy outcome. While the theoretical argument underlying the importance of the median correspondence does not assume the policy outcome is the vote‐weighted average of the party platforms, it does rely on the assumption that all legislators matter—otherwise the median voter does not play a significant role in the policymaking process. However, the majoritarian nature of parliaments suggests that all legislators do not have equal influence; government coalitions that form after elections tend to dominate policymaking. Moreover, party payoffs appear to be proportional to the coalition parties’ legislative size, which suggests that the policy outcomes are less a function of the median legislator’s preferences than which parties form a government coalition.6"
"4","There are a number of reasons why one might object to the assumption of vote‐weighted policy outcomes. Most importantly, it assumes that all legislative parties influence policy outcomes. Legislatures, by and large, are, however, majoritarian institutions, and whoever commands the majority of the seats usually gets her way. A governing coalition is formed following an election and that coalition holds the reins of power until the end of the electoral term or until it loses the legislature’s confidence. Research on coalition formation shows that most such coalitions are majority coalitions—sometimes they are supermajoritarian, but “unanimity” coalitions are extremely rare. Minority coalitions are also fairly common, but research into how such coalitions build support for their legislative agenda is scarce. In some places (e.g., Denmark), such coalitions advance their agenda by forming coalitions, which may consist of different parties, around individual bills (Damgaard 2001). There is, however, no evidence suggesting that such strategies allow all parties equal (or proportional) influence in the legislative bargaining, and a priori that possibility appears somewhat implausible. For most polities, the assumption of vote‐weighted policy outcomes is a poor description of the policymaking process, and, moreover, it fails to capture important aspects of how policy is made.         "
"5","The assumption of vote‐weighted policy outcomes has been justified as “being a reasonable description” of policymaking.7 Although most governing coalitions are majoritarian, it does not preclude the possibility that legislatures play an important, substantive role in policymaking. PR systems are most common in parliamentary systems. The consensus on parliamentary systems is that parliaments’ power derives, first and foremost, from the fact that governing coalitions must retain their confidence.8 When it comes to influencing legislation, the ability of parliament—in large part thanks to the high levels of party discipline in parliamentary systems—can best be described as marginal. While there are certainly differences cross‐nationally in the institutional capabilities of parliaments to influence policy (Strøm 1984), the evidence suggesting that these institutional factors have a substantial impact is limited.9 Moreover, these parliamentary institutions may be used strategically by the government to monitor the actions of its coalition partners rather than offering the opposition a piece of the legislative pie (Vanberg and Martin 2004). Finally, equal access to legislative influence, independent of ideological positions, appears highly unlikely. In France, for example, the center‐right parties have repeatedly refused to cooperate with the National Front. How often parties are rolled in the legislature has been shown to depend on their ideological position.10 Overall, at least as far as parliamentary systems are concerned, there remain great doubts that the assumption of vote‐weighted policy outcomes can be justified on the basis of “realism.”         "
"6","The model considered here also demonstrates the importance of making appropriate assumptions about the policymaking process. The directional theory of voting (Rabinowitz and Macdonald 1989) is often considered the proximity model’s main contender. It posits that voters seek to influence the direction of policy change, and to do so they may vote for parties representing views more extreme than their own. Rabinowitz and Macdonald's (1989) theory doesn’t provide an explanation for why voters don’t carry the reasoning to its logical conclusion and vote for extremist parties. Rather, voters are assumed to limit their choices to a “region of acceptability.” As we shall see, even though it is assumed here that voters seek to minimize their distance from the policy outcome, voters don’t always vote for the most proximate party, and their behavior resembles the predictions of the directional theory. Moreover, when coalitions form following an election, some voters’ incentives to vote for extremist parties are tempered by the desire to influence policy outcomes. In other words, something akin to “regions of acceptability” arises endogenously in the model. Thus, it is not clear that the evidence considered to favor the directional theory is inconsistent with the proximity model when the voters’ incentives are modeled correctly.         "
"7","Given how implausible the vote‐weighted policy assumption is theoretically, it is important to consider how robust it is to incorporation of a degree of parliamentary majoritarianism. I begin by considering a slight modification of the assumption that allows majority winners to decide policy unilaterally. Although it is difficult to envision a smaller role for majoritarian policymaking, it has a significant impact on the outcome. The voters’ incentive to vote for radical parties is reduced and equilibrium policy outcomes are closer to the median voter’s preferred outcome."
"8","In order to examine how voter behavior responds to the majoritarian nature that characterizes most legislatures, I then consider a simple coalition formation game where the parties only influence policy if they are in government. My primary focus here is not on coalition bargaining but rather on demonstrating how majoritarianism influences voters’ strategies, creating both incentives to vote for, and against, coalitions. These incentives explain the strategic behavior found in the empirical literature. The former stems from the voters’ ability to influence the policy associated with a given coalition while the latter incentive centers on influencing how attractive the formateur finds different coalition partners."
"9","Consider a model of PR system with a fixed number of parties r > 2, each of which is characterized by its (exogenously given) policy platform , and a distribution of strategic voters whose preference profile is single‐peaked on . Assuming vote‐weighted policy outcomes, De Sinopoli and Iannantuoni (2007) show that only the two most extreme parties receive votes in equilibrium. The resulting policy outcome is centrist as it equals the vote‐weighted average of the parties’ ideal policies. The logic behind the result is similar in spirit to the results obtained by Alesina and Rosenthal (1996), in the context of divided government, and Austen‐Smith (1984), in the context of plurality elections in multiple constituencies. That is, by voting for extremist parties, the voters are able to inch the policy outcome towards their preferred policy. Thus, the vote‐weighted model of PR generates two predictions that are perplexing when put in empirical context. First, Duverger’s hypothesis (Riker 1982) is incorrect, and PR leads to a two‐party system. Second, politics in PR systems are dominated by extremist parties.         "
"10","This result relies on the legislature's not being a majoritarian institution. If only two parties receive votes in equilibrium, one party must hold a majority of the seats in the legislature. It is not clear why a majority party would choose to make compromises to the minority party. Yet, in the vote‐weighted model, the voters’ strategies are predicated on such a compromise, which provides them with an incentive to vote for extremist parties. If voters expected a single‐party cabinet to form, they would be reluctant to vote for extremist parties."
"11","I begin by briefly detailing how a (minimal) modification of the vote‐weighted model affects the equilibria of the game. The modified model retains the assumption that policy outcomes equal the vote‐weighted policy positions of the parties if no party wins a majority of the vote. However, if a party wins a majority, it alone determines policy and implements its policy platform. As the main reason for considering this modification is to demonstrate the sensitivity of the equilibria of the game to the introduction of a minimal form of majoritarianism, I describe the model in detail (as the following sections build on the model) but relegate the derivation and the details of the equilibria to the appendix."
"12","The policy space is a closed interval, . There is a set of r parties, K ={1, 2, … , r}. Each party, k ∈ K, has a fixed policy platform, , and the parties are labeled so that pk < pk + 1. There is a continuum of voters whose preferences are single‐peaked over . Each voter’s preferences are characterized by his ideal point . Let ui(x) be voter i’s concave utility function. The distribution of the voters’ ideal points is described by the density function f(x). Let F(x) be the cdf of f(x) and assume f(x) is continuous and symmetric about the median of the distribution. Each voter casts a vote for a party, si ∈ K. For a given strategy profile s, let v(s) be the vector of the parties’ vote shares and vk(s) denote the share of the vote received by party k. When no party wins a majority of the vote, the policy outcome, p(v(s)), is a convex combination of the parties’ policy platforms, where the vote share determines each party’s weight. If a party wins a majority, it implements its policy platform. The policy outcome equals:               "
"13","The median voter, m, is defined by . Let km be the median voter’s most preferred party—for simplicity it is assumed that the median voter is not indifferent between his two most preferred parties. Henceforth, party km will be referred to as the median preferred party.            "
"14","With a continuum of voters, each voter’s action does not influence the outcome. I assume, however, that the voters behave as if their vote could influence the outcome. It is obvious, as in multicandidate elections under plurality rule, that the game has multiple Nash equilibria."
"15","Proposition 1.   Almost any strategy profile such that for some k ∈ K is a Nash equilibrium.               "
"16","The proposition follows directly from the fact that the elimination of weakly dominated strategies has limited purchase in multicandidate contests and only rules out the possibility that a voter casts a vote for his least preferred candidate. The proof of the proposition is straightforward and is omitted."
"17","The set of equilibria thus expands dramatically when a majoritarian element—in its simplest possible form—is added to the model. Proposition 1 is rather unsatisfying because it gives us neither a clear prediction about which party wins the elections nor a prediction about the number of (vote‐receiving) parties. Many of the possible equilibria do not seem very “reasonable,” i.e., extremist parties have their policy platforms implemented even in the presence of more moderate parties, whose election would leave a great majority of voters better off. The reason such equilibria exist is that voters are implicitly assumed to be unable to coordinate their actions in any shape or form. In reality, voters are likely to rely on a variety of ways to coordinate, e.g., cues from opinion leaders, political polls, etc. (Linhart 2009; Meffert and Gschwend 2007a, 2011), or historical coalition formation patterns (Armstrong and Duch 2010). One way to move forward is to consider the strong Nash equilibria of the game (Aumann 1959). A strong Nash equilibria requires that the equilibrium is robust to deviations of sets, or coalitions, of voters rather than the deviations of individual voters. I refer to a measurable set C⊂N as a voter coalition.               "
"18","Definition 1  A strategy profile, s ∈ S, is a strong Nash equilibrium if for no voter coalition C ⊂ N is there an action profile, , such that .               "
"19","Restricting the analysis to strong Nash equilibria is arguably a strong requirement that relies on voters being able to coordinate effectively. A more satisfying approach might model the coordination process, but that is beyond the scope of the present article. However, strong Nash equilibria provide insights into the incentives facing voters that are a useful indication of what might occur if voters could coordinate effectively—whether during a single electoral campaign or over the period of several elections (Fey 1997).               "
"20","It will be useful to distinguish between two types of equilibria. First, a coalition equilibrium refers to an equilibrium in which no party wins a majority of the vote and the vote‐weighted policy obtains. Second, a majoritarian equilibrium refers to an equilibrium in which some party wins a majority and implements its policy platform.               "
"21","I begin by considering the possibility of a coalition equilibrium. When no party wins a majority, voters have an incentive to vote for extreme parties because doing so “pulls” the policy outcome towards their ideal point. In a coalition equilibrium there exists a cut‐off policy, p*, that separates voters voting for “left” and “right” parties. Intuitively, we can think of the cut‐off policy being defined by all the voters left of p* voting for the leftmost candidate, whereas the voters right of p* vote for the rightmost candidate—while p* is a function of the voters’ actions, it is easy to see that there exists a unique p* satisfying the notion of a cut‐off policy. However, the majoritarian element complicates things a little bit. While the voters have an incentive to vote for the most extreme parties, doing so generally means that one of the parties receives a majority of the vote. As we are focusing on coalition equilibria, the cut‐off policy is defined such that a subset of the voters opts to vote for the second most extreme party (on the left or the right) in order to prevent an extremist from winning a majority of the vote. Given a cut‐off policy p*, there is a policy  that the median voter likes equally as much, that is, if p* is on the right of the median voter’s most preferred policy, then  is to its left (see Figure 1). If a strong Nash coalition equilibrium exists, the cut‐off policy p* is the equilibrium policy. The cut‐off policy corresponds to an action profile in which everyone to the left (right) of p* does as much as he or she can to pull the policy to the left (right)—without creating a majority winner. The action profile may, however, be susceptible to deviations that result in a majority winner. Proposition 2 specifies the conditions for a strong Nash coalition equilibrium.11"
"22","Proposition 2.   Suppose . A strong Nash coalition equilibrium exists if and only if and .               "
"23","The details of the proposition, and subsequent propositions, are discussed in the appendix. In short, the two conditions require that the cut‐off policy is preferred (1) to the median preferred candidate and (2) to the most extreme candidate on the left by a majority of the voters.12 The conditions for existence of a strong Nash coalition equilibrium are somewhat restrictive. For example, the condition  implies that the distance between the median voter’s preferred policy and the most extreme left party must be four times greater than the distance between the median voter’s preferred policy and the coalition policy outcome.               "
"24","Figure 1 demonstrates what a coalition equilibrium in a four‐party system with a uniform distribution of voters might look like. Three parties receive votes in equilibrium and the policy outcome is p*. The voters in the interval  cast their votes for Party 1. Party 2 receives the votes of voters in the interval . These voters would like to move the policy further to the left, but Party 1 receives just short of a majority of the vote and any positive measure of voters would tip the scale in the party’s favor, which would move the policy too far to the left for the voters’ taste. The voters in [xm, p*) cast their votes for Party 1. The voters in [xm, p*) would prefer a policy left of the equilibrium policy outcome. A subset of these voters, in combination with the voters in , could turn Party 2 into a majority winner. The conditions of the proposition rule this possibility out—they imply that the voter in [xm, p*) who is least satisfied with the equilibrium outcome still prefers it to having Party 2’s platform implemented. The remaining voters cast their votes for Party 4.               "
"25","                Coalition Equilibria in a Four‐Party System (Proposition 2)"
"26","The figure highlights an interesting characteristic of the equilibrium. The ideological preferences of the voters are not a perfect predictor of which party they support. Generally, one would expect the voter’s ideological position to have a “monotone” effect on his vote choice; a voter should vote for a more left‐leaning party as he becomes more leftist himself. This is true to some extent; extremist voters generally vote for extremist parties. Ideology is, however, not a good predictor for centrist voters (who all prefer a move to the left here) as the more left‐leaning centrist vote for the less extreme party on the left. Note that this is not a general characteristic and other equilibria may exist in which the voters’ choices vary monotonically with their preferences. However, the strategy profile pictured in the figure is the one that is most robust to changes in the parameters of the model, i.e., if an equilibrium exists, the voting profile depicted will exist and it may be the unique one. The nonmonotonic effect of ideal policy suggests that the empirical specification of the spatial model is not quite as straightforward as commonly is assumed. This is especially relevant to the literature that pits the spatial model against directional models of voting. Although the model considered here assumes that voters vote on the basis of the proximity of the expected policy outcomes, the model predicts voting patterns that appear more closely associated with directional models of voting.13"
"27","In a majoritarian equilibrium, the median voter’s most preferred party wins a majority of the vote. Only the median preferred party can win as, by definition, the median preferred party is majority preferred to any other party. The votes cast for any other party have no influence on the policy outcome. Thus, numerous action profiles may be associated with the equilibrium policy. However, not any profile such that the median preferred party wins a majority is an equilibrium strategy profile as the whole strategy profile defines the possible payoffs from deviations. In other words, the strategies of voters who don’t vote for the median preferred party influence whether voting for the median preferred party is optimal for other voters."
"28","For a voting profile s that results in the median preferred candidate winning a majority of the vote, let p(C, s)min be the leftmost policy that the coalition C could achieve by changing its strategy. For example, consider a voting profile s where all the voters vote for . Then a coalition of the leftist voters constituting exactly half of the electorate could switch their vote to candidate 1 and obtain the policy outcome . Whether s is an equilibrium strategy profile depends on whether there exists a coalition that can deviate and obtain a more favorable policy outcome for all of its members. In the example, this deviation is likely to displease the more centrist members of the deviating coalition. If , a strong Nash majoritarian equilibrium exists if the coalition of voters who prefer a more left‐leaning policy than , denoted , cannot edge the policy outcome to the left. Let  denote the leftmost policy  can achieve by deviating from the action profile s.14"
"29","Proposition 3.   Suppose and km ≠ r. Then a strong Nash majoritarian equilibrium such that exists if and only if .               "
"30","Figure 2 demonstrates how the voters who don’t vote for the majority winner determine whether a given action profile is in equilibrium. Suppose that the voters left of  vote for Party km while the remaining voters vote for Party 3. Voters who prefer a policy further to the left of , may achieve a more favorable outcome by shifting their votes to Party 1. If almost all the voters in  switch their votes to Party 1 (some must stay put as otherwise Party 1 wins a majority), the policy will be slightly right of .15 The figure shows that the policy  is to the left of  and the deviation is, therefore, preferred by a large share of the voters in . In this instance we can find a subset of voters in  who prefer to desert the median preferred party. The action profile where the voters divide their votes between Parties 2 and 3 is, thus, not an equilibrium. Now suppose instead that the voters who don’t vote for the median preferred party cast their vote for Party 4. Now the leftmost policy the voters in the set  can achieve is approximately , which is right of the median preferred party’s position. Thus, no beneficial deviations exist for the left‐wing voters, and voting for the median preferred party is an optimal strategy. Hence, whether a majoritarian equilibrium exists can depend on the voters who don’t vote for the median preferred party taking radical enough positions.               "
"31","                Majoritarian Equilibria (Proposition 3)"
"32","Proposition 3 demonstrates the limitations of the vote‐weighted model rather clearly. Introducing a minimal majoritarian component often implies a radically different predication about the behavior of voters—now voters often have an incentive to vote for centrist candidates instead of the extremists. Of course, the simple modification doesn’t guarantee the existence of a majoritarian equilibrium. However, it can be shown (see the appendix) that majoritarian equilibria are more likely to exist if the rightmost party is relatively more extreme than the leftmost party, if the median preferred party is relatively close to the median voter, and if most voters hold centrist policy preferences. One may ask whether these conditions tend to be met empirically. While it is difficult to offer a conclusive answer, there are strong indications that they tend to be met. First, distributions of voter preferences have been shown to be characterized by a far greater density in the center of the policy spectrum than at the extremes. Second, Powell and Vanberg (2000) show that in PR elections, which tend to produce the types of party systems most relevant to the model studied here, the average distance between the median voter and the median preferred party is well below 1 on a 10‐point scale.16 They also find that PR systems produce better median correspondence than electoral systems based on single‐member districts, which the median voter theorem tells us should produce the greatest degree of ideological congruence between voters and parties.               "
"33","The previous section demonstrated how the introduction of a minimal form of majoritarianism in the policymaking process has substantial implications for the types of equilibria that can be sustained. The majoritarian principle that guides most parliaments does, of course, not only apply to single‐party majorities. Rather, majority coalitions generally form in minority situations, which introduces a variety of additional considerations for instrumental voters. In this section, I consider a simple coalition formation process in order to provide insights into how the formation of postelectoral coalitions influences voters’ behavior."
"34","The game now consists of two stages. At the first stage, the voters cast their votes. At the second stage, the electoral results are translated into a policy outcome by means of a majority coalition forming.17 I assume a particularly simple coalition formation stage. The party that receives the most votes proposes a coalition, which is accepted as long as the coalition has majority support.18 Thus, there is no status quo policy or a caretaker cabinet in the event the formateur doesn’t like any of her options. The policy outcome is the weighted average of the coalition parties’ policy platforms. While the process abstracts away from real‐world coalition formation, it does capture the majoritarian nature of coalition building and allows consideration of the strategic incentives voters face when postelectoral coalitions form, which is our primary goal here.19"
"35","The party that receives the most votes is designated the formateur. If two or more parties tie for the first place, the formateur is chosen randomly. The parties seek to implement a policy as close to their platform as possible. The formateur’s optimal strategy is thus simply to pick the coalition that yields the most favorable outcome given the distribution of the vote and the parties’ policy platforms. Clearly, the formateur has an incentive to form a coalition with parties that have relatively little support (but sufficient to form a majority coalition) and are similar ideologically. Alternatively, she may be able to obtain a favorable policy outcome by joining forces with parties on her left and her right. Although, empirically, parties have sometimes been observed to be shut out of the coalition bargaining process because of their policy positions (e.g., as with the Italian Communist Party and the conventio ad excludendum; D’Alimonte 1999), the model presented here does not place any restrictions on which coalitions may form. That is, the parties will partner with any party as long as it represents the best bargain they can hope to reach. Of course, parties may choose not to partner with extremist parties for other reasons; parties may suffer reputational costs for being associated with extremist parties even if they obtain large policy concessions and implement moderate policies. Such concerns are not addressed in the model, but their implications for strategic voting are clear—parties that are not considered “coalitionable” will not benefit from coalition voting. Given a coalition, G, the policy outcome is the vote‐weighted average of the coalition parties’ policy platforms:            "
"36","In equilibrium, the policy outcome cannot deviate too far away from the median voter’s ideal policy. If that were the case, a majority of the voters would prefer voting for the median preferred candidate. Above it was shown that voters have an incentive to vote for extremist parties. Similar incentives are present when majority coalitions form, only now the voters have an incentive to vote for the left‐ or rightmost member of the coalition they expect to form. Moreover, all voters have an incentive to vote for a coalition party—voting for a noncoalition party has no effect on the policy outcome. In equilibrium both these incentives may be tempered by the possibility of a single‐party government. In addition, the voters must bear in mind that their voting can influence the identity of the formateur and, therefore, what coalition forms."
"37","Only two parties receive votes in the coalition equilibrium of the game. Suppose pk < pl. If both parties are located at the same side of the median voter, it is clear that a majority of voters would prefer a single‐party government of the more centrist party. Thus, the coalition parties must be located on the opposite sides of the median voter. Moreover, the coalition must yield the median voter a higher utility than a single‐party government by her most preferred party.         "
"38","Proposition 4 states the coalition equilibria, and the voters’ equilibrium strategies are described in Figure 3. Two parties receive an equal number of votes in equilibrium. The two parties form a coalition, and the policy outcome equals the average of the parties’ policy platforms. The existence of a coalition equilibrium depends on the proximity of the average policy of the vote‐receiving parties to the median voter, i.e., if a majority of voters preferred some party to the coalition policy outcome, a beneficial deviation would exist. Thus, any pair of parties on the opposite sides of the median voter that are roughly the same distance away from him may satisfy this condition. In Figure 3, the policy outcome for the coalition {2, 3} is shown, but the coalition {1, 4} also satisfies the condition.         "
"39","                Coalition Equilibria (Proposition 4)"
"40","Proposition 4.   Let s be such that for all i ∈ L(xm) and si = l > km for all i ∈ R(xm). Parties and l receive the same number of votes and Party  (or l) is designated formateur. Party forms coalition and the coalition implements . The strategy profile (s, Γ) is a strong Nash equilibrium if for all j such that .            "
"41","It is helpful to focus on the voters whose ideal policies lie between the median voter and the government policy, , to provide the intuition for the result. Consider the equilibrium in which Parties 2 and 3 form a coalition. The voters in  prefer a policy outcome further to the left—yet they cast their votes for Party 3. They do so because casting a vote for Party 2 would allow Party 2 to form a single‐party government and implement p2. If they were to vote for Party 1, the coalition {1, 2} might form, making these voters even worse off. These voters have another option, i.e., to vote for Party 4 in order to reduce Party 3’s influence on the policy outcome. The incentive to do so is countered by the fact that as soon as Party 4 receives votes, it becomes a viable coalition partner for Party 2. If the set of voters in  is small, p24 would be attractive to Party 2 because the policy will be close to p2 but, at the same time, unattractive to the voters in . If the set of voters in  is sufficiently large, voting for Party 4 would make these voters better off and a profitable deviation exists. Note that the deviating coalition may include voters in L(xm). This might suggest that a profitable deviation always exists because L(xm) consists of half the voters, but this is not the case. If too many voters in L(xm) switch their vote from Party 2, Party 3 becomes the formateur. These considerations give rise to the conditions of Proposition 4.            "
"42","The conditions for a coalition equilibrium depend on the location of the median preferred voter and the symmetry of the parties’ location about the median voter. The equilibria share some characteristics of the coalition equilibrium in the previous section. Only two parties receive positive vote shares in equilibrium, but the difference is that the tendency to vote for extremists is tempered by the coalition formation stage."
"43","Majoritarian equilibria may also exist, but the equilibrium conditions are restrictive. The reason is that in most action profiles that produce a majority winner, a small coalition can deviate profitably. Suppose , r = 3, and an action profile where . If the support for km derives from left‐leaning voters, a subset of  of measure α (as long as α is not too large) can divide its votes between Party 1 and parties on the right. The reason all deviating voters do not cast their votes for Party 1 is that they must ensure that Party km prefers forming a coalition with Party 1 and that the role of the formateur is not transferred to a party further on the right. A similar argument applies if km’s support comes primarily from right‐leaning voters.            "
"44","Now consider a scenario where all the voters vote for the median preferred party (see the upper panel of Figure 4). A majority must change its strategy in order to influence the outcome. Consider the voters who wish to move policy to the right. First, note that all the deviating voters cannot vote for Party 3 because then Party 3 can implement its policy platform. Hence, some must vote for Party 1, but that might allow Party 2 to form a coalition with Party 1 (resulting in the policy outcome p21) rather than Party 3 (resulting in p23). If the deviation results in Party 3 becoming the formateur, the resulting policy will be roughly halfway between the policy platforms of Parties 2 and 3, which is a greater change than some members of the deviating coalition can stomach. Hence, a deviation must produce a moderate change in policy. Therefore, the deviating coalition needs to be able to distribute its votes among other parties so that Party 2 finds Party 3 a more desirable coalition partner than Party 1. This may imply that a majority of the deviating coalition actually casts its votes for Party 1. The lower panel of Figure 4 depicts what such deviation might look like.            "
"45","                Deviation from an Unanimous Vote for Party 2"
"46","The derivation of the conditions for existence of a majoritarian equilibria is somewhat tedious as the above discussion suggests, but they are generally rather restrictive. To offer an insight into what the conditions look like, consider the case of three parties with one party on each side of the median preferred party as in Figure 5. Before considering the conditions that give rise to a majoritarian equilibrium, note that the voters’ actions in the equilibrium depicted in Figure 5 are somewhat counterintuitive—right‐leaning voters vote for the median preferred party while left‐leaning voters vote for Party 3. The equilibrium depicted is the one most robust to changes in the parameters of the model. Other equilibria, in which the voters’ actions correspond better with our intuition, will generally also exist. More importantly, Proposition 5 demonstrates that the conditions for existence are very restrictive—and were one to consider equilibrium refinements that ruled out counterintuitive voting behavior, those conditions would be even more difficult to satisfy.20"

"48","To get a sense of the conditions for a majoritarian equilibrium, note that the voters with ideal policies in  can turn Party 3 into a majority winner. These voters are, however, relatively satisfied with the median preferred party. The voters with the biggest desire to see Party 3 win a majority are the most right‐leaning voters—they can achieve that result if they switch their votes to Party 3 in sufficient numbers (i.e., equivalent to the number of voters with ideal policies in ). Let  denote the rightmost policy such that if all the voters with ideal policies to the right of  switch their votes to Party 3 then it wins a majority of the vote. Let  be the policy such that if the voters to the right of  switch their vote from Party 2 to Party 1 then Party 3, the formateur, is indifferent about which party it forms a coalition with. Formally,  is defined by the equality . Proposition 5 provides the conditions for existence of majoritarian equilibria when only deviations resulting in minimal winning coalitions are considered.21"
"49","Proposition 5.   Let s be such that si = 3 for all i ∈ L(p2) and si = 2 for all i ∈ R(p2). Party 2 receives the majority of the vote and implements its ideal policy. The strategy profile (s, Γ) is a strong Nash equilibrium if (i) and (ii) if then .            "
"50","The proposition’s conditions are closely related. Both are satisfied if the voter distribution is sufficiently concentrated around the median voter. The reason is that large policy changes are likely to occur when a deviation results in a change of a formateur. If the mass of voters is concentrated around the median voter, the participation of moderate voters, who are less likely to benefit from large policy shifts, is required."
"51","In sum, the prospects of majoritarian equilibria are limited. Proposition 5 leaves open the question whether majoritarian equilibria are more likely when there are more parties. Intuitively, the presence of more parties allows voters to influence policy in more ways and increases the number of possible deviations. However, the ideological position of the “new” parties matters. An additional party to the left of the median preferred party will generally not affect the equilibria of the game unless it is sufficiently extreme. If a new party appears to the right of the median preferred party, however, then the action profile in Figure 5 is no longer in equilibrium. A majoritarian equilibrium may still exist, but it requires voters on the left to divide their vote among the parties on the right—in which case the right parties become more attractive coalition partners (as they would now have a smaller impact on policy) for Party 2 if the party finds itself in a minority situation. The possibility of majoritarian equilibria is further reduced as the possibility of surplus coalitions makes it easier for coalitions of voters to engineer small changes in policy acceptable to all its members.            "
"52","It is natural to question the plausibility of equilibrium strategies where voters at one end of the political spectrum vote for a party at the other end. Considering the majoritarian equilibria nevertheless offers some useful insights into the voter’s incentives. First, if one wants to rule out equilibria on the grounds of “unreasonableness,” we are left with the conclusion that the conditions for majoritarian equilibria are even more restrictive than suggested by Proposition 5. Second, while the equilibrium actions here are extreme, they reflect an interesting incentive facing voters. That is, voting for the (expected) coalition party that will pull policy in the preferred direction is not the only option the voter has. The voter’s other option is to vote for a party that the voter would like to exclude from the governing coalition. By doing so, the voter makes the party receiving his vote a less attractive coalition partner to the formateur. While such consideration would seem to require a lot of voters, Meffert et al. (2008) find evidence that voters favoring a SPD/CDU grand coalition nevertheless voted for The Left for this reason in the 2005 German legislative election.            "
"53","More complex bargaining protocols of the coalition formation process can be considered within the context of the model. The model above assumes a deterministic recognition rule, i.e., the largest party is given formateur status with certainty. Similar results obtain if multiple bargaining rounds are assumed with the formateur status being transferred among parties in order of their size. An alternative bargaining protocol assumes that the likelihood that a party is selected formateur is proportional to its legislative representation. Such random recognition rules slightly alter the strategic incentives facing voters as each vote‐receiving party now has a positive probability of being in government."
"54","Suppose, as before, that the policy outcome is the vote‐weighted average of the coalition parties’ policy platforms and that parties seek to maximize their office payoffs as in Baron and Ferejohn (1989). As Baron and Ferejohn (1989) show, the expected value of the game must be the same to any party at the outset in equilibrium. To see why, note that the party with the lowest continuation value is the most attractive coalition partner.22 To form a coalition, the formateur only needs to offer its potential coalition partner its coalition value. Thus, if the parties have different continuation values, the formateur will always make an offer to the party with the lowest continuation value and the party with the lowest continuation value will belong to any coalition that forms. This, in turn, implies that the others are less likely to be in the coalition, thus driving down the other parties’ continuation values to the point at which their continuation values are equal. In equilibrium, then, the formateur party is indifferent as to which party it forms a coalition with and each party has a positive probability of being in government.23"
"55","The implications of the probabilistic recognition protocol on voter behavior are relatively straightforward. In contrast with the results above, voting for any party can affect policy outcomes directly. Consider the decision to desert a centrist party for a left party. Doing so influences the (expected) policy outcome in several ways. First, if the party enters into a government coalition, its larger vote share will shift the policy outcome further to the left. Second, if the left party is not in government, the policy outcome will be further to the right as the center‐left party now receives fewer votes. Finally, it increases the likelihood that the left party becomes the formateur. However, as the argument above demonstrates, the continuation values for each party must be equal in equilibrium so the greater probability of becoming formateur is accompanied by a change in the strategies of the other parties that reduce the probability that the left party enters government. Taken together, this implies that it is not always optimal for left‐leaning voters to switch their vote to a left party—even though it increases the party’s likelihood of becoming a formateur and increases its influence on policy if it enters a government coalition. To see why, suppose the left party is only slightly to the left of the center party. If that is the case, the effect of deserting the center party in favor of the left party is very small while it reduces the likelihood of the party joining the government coalition, thereby increasing the probability of the policy outcome associated with a center‐right coalition. If, on the other hand, the left party’s platform is relatively extreme, the resulting shifts in policy when the party is included in the coalition will be sufficiently large to warrant deserting the centrist party."
"56","Analyzing the strategic incentives under the random recognition rule is not as straightforward as it may seem. For one thing, as shown in the appendix, the random recognition rule model does not result in a unique equilibrium—the parties employ mixed strategies in deciding which party to partner with, but these strategies are not unique. To show how voters may face greater incentives to vote strategically for more extreme parties, consider Figure 6. The figure shows the marginal effect of shifting votes from a centrist party to a left party on the expected policy outcome. The probability of being selected the formateur is assumed to be proportional to the party’s vote share. The policy platforms of the center and the right parties are assumed to be, respectively, 6 and 7, whereas the policy platforms considered for the left party were 0 and 4. The vote share of the center party is held constant at 35%.24 As shown in the appendix, the equilibria can be characterized in terms of the probability that the left party forms a coalition with the center party. As multiple equilibria, there generally exists a range of probabilities for which an equilibrium exists. The figure is drawn using the midpoint of the range of possible probabilities—intuitively we can think of the midpoint as the voter’s best guess about the left party’s strategy.25"
"57","                Strategic Voting and Party Ideology"
"58","The first thing to note about the figure is that the effect of switching a vote from a center party to a left party is not monotonic; whether policy shifts to the left depends on the size of the left party. If the left party is small, additional votes for the left party will cause the expected policy to shift to the left; if the party is already receiving a substantial number of votes, further vote will have the opposite effect. The figure also shows that the (absolute) marginal effect is always larger for the more extreme party (the two lines intersect at zero), i.e., voters have a greater incentive to vote strategically when the noncentrist party is relatively extreme. Another question of interest is whether all voters are equally likely to vote strategically. Figure 7 shows the expected change in utility from switching a vote from a center party to a left party for voters with ideal policies at 0 and 4.26 The slope of the line for extremist voters is steeper, indicating that their utility is more sensitive to strategic voting. As before, the effects of switching from the center party to the left party depend on the size of the left party—doing so only increases the voter’s utility if the party is relatively small.         "
"59","                Strategic Voting and Voter (i) Ideology"
"60","While the presence of multiple equilibria in the game with the random recognition rule complicates the analysis, it also suggests some further extensions. During electoral campaigns, parties sometimes try to provide guidance to voters by signaling their intentions regarding postelectoral coalitions (Meffert and Gschwend 2009). The parties may, however, face credibility problems, i.e., the parties may well renege on their promises if more desirable coalition opportunities present themselves after the election. That is, after the election it may no longer be equilibrium behavior to form the coalition the party signaled that it would form. The existence of multiple equilibria, however, allows the parties some flexibility in credibly signaling their intentions. An analysis of whether parties resort to sending coalition signals would also have to take account of the fact that voters may not always be receptive to following such signals, as Figures 6 and 7 suggest.         "
"61","The model presented here suggests a rich set of hypotheses that can be tested—and empirical evidence already exists for some of these hypotheses. While the models presented above are abstract and ignore many of the nuances of policymaking in parliamentary systems, they generate nearly all of the hypotheses that the empirically oriented literature has offered. Briefly summarizing these hypotheses, voters are expected (1) to vote for parties that are likely to be included in the governing coalition, (2) to engage in policy balancing, i.e., to vote for parties that offer policy platforms more extreme than the voters themselves in order to “pull” the policy closer to their ideal policy, (3) to be more likely to vote for parties that can be expected to be appointed formateurs in order to influence which coalition forms, and (4) to vote “defensively” in certain circumstances in order to make some parties unattractive coalition partners. Support has been found for each of these hypotheses in the empirical literature. My model demonstrates that each of these hypotheses can be derived from a common theoretical model. One additional hypothesis, which the model does not generate, has found empirical support; voters are expected to engage in threshold insurance, i.e., to be more likely to vote for parties that are at risk of failing to reach the legal (or effective) threshold for representation (Shikano, Herrmann, and Thurner 2009). For simplicity the model presented here assumes perfect proportionality and, consequently, there are no thresholds of representation. Relaxing the assumption of perfect proportionality is fairly straightforward, but it has minimal effects on the equilibria that exist in the game. The strong incentives to vote for parties that are included in the coalition imply that any vote‐receiving party will receive sufficiently many votes.27 However, vote thresholds affect the types of deviations that are possible and as a consequence, including vote thresholds complicates the analysis without affecting the substantive conclusions.28 The reason threshold insurance does not have the expected effect in the model above is that the bargaining process is deterministic. The threshold insurance strategy can only be an equilibrium strategy if there is uncertainty about which coalition forms as in the extension considered above.         "
"62","The model also offers new hypotheses about strategic voting. First, in contrast to the common practice in the empirical literature where all voters are generally seen as being equally likely to vote strategically, explicitly deriving the equilibria allows us to pinpoint which voters face an incentive to vote strategically. Second, under the random recognition rule considered in the discussion, it is shown that the incentive to vote strategically is context dependent. That is, voters’ incentive to vote strategically for “less centrist” parties depends on those parties being sufficiently extremist. Third, the same result offers comparative statistics with respect to the recognition rule. The extent of strategic voting should be greater where random recognition rules are used as a strategic vote as, in expectations, it influences the policy outcome."
"63","In recent years scholars have begun to pay greater attention to how voters reach the decision to vote for one party over another. The formal literature has long assumed that voters simply vote for the party whose platform most resembles their policy platform. The emerging literature on coalitional voting challenges this assumption by noting that, at the end of the day, voters should care more about policy outcome than simply the representation of parties in the legislature. The focus on coalitional, or instrumental, voting does, therefore, not represent a radical departure from the traditional spatial model—rather, it represents a refinement of the proximity model that pays closer attention to institutional factors that affect policy outcomes. The theory of directional voting, however, assumes that voters think quite differently about which party to support. So far, consensus about whether the proximity or the directional model describes voter behavior has failed to emerge. However, the literature has focused on comparisons of the directional model with the traditional, naive version of the proximity model, yielding inconclusive results. The model presented here demonstrates clearly that party choice is not always monotonic in voters’ ideological positions. The support found for the directional model should, therefore, be interpreted with caution—at least to the extent that we attempt to draw inferences about how voters reach decisions.29 If voters care about policy outcomes, their behavior may well resemble the behavior predicted by the directional model.30"
"64","About 60% of all democratic legislative elections held between 1946 and 2000 used some form of PR (Golder 2005). Despite the popularity of PR systems, our understanding of the dynamics of electoral competition and voting behavior in such systems remains incomplete. Only recently have scholars turned their attention to examining empirically whether voters consider the impact of their vote on policy.31"
"65","One can argue that theoretical treatment of how voters respond to postelectoral policy processes has lagged behind empirical work. While the theoretical literature has not ignored this issue, it could be said to have gotten off on the wrong foot. It frequently assumes that the policy outcome in PR systems is the vote‐weighted average of the competing parties’ policy platforms. Empirically, as a description of policymaking in parliamentary democracies, this assumption is simply wrong. Parliaments are, by and large, majoritarian institutions. All theories make simplifying assumptions and their face validity is a priori not necessarily a good indicator of their usefulness, i.e, they may capture some aspects of the political process in a simple way. If that is the case, a more detailed model of the political process should not alter the predictions substantially. The first goal of this article was to demonstrate that this is not the case."
"66","Although introducing a slight majoritarian element does not rule out equilibria in which voters vote for extremist parties, the existence of such equilibria depends on the absence of a party located close to the median voter. The introduction of a majoritarian element demonstrates clearly that extant results depend quite heavily on the assumption of vote‐weighted average policy outcome. Even the slightest modification of the assumption leads to different patterns of voting, an increase in the number of vote‐receiving parties, and different policy outcomes. Given these findings, it appears ill‐advised to take the prediction derived assuming vote‐weighted policy outcomes to data. Models of PR should carefully account for the policymaking process and, in particular, the fact that coalitions, which monopolize policymaking powers, form after elections take place."
"67","The primary goal of the article is to offer an insight into how postelectoral policymaking processes, including coalition formation, shape voters’ incentives for strategic behavior. I show that voters face two main types of incentives. First, voters generally have an incentive to vote for a coalition party in order to edge the policy outcome closer to their preferred policy. A vote for a prospective opposition party is a wasted vote—in the sense that it doesn’t have a direct impact on policy. This incentive reflects two types of considerations that have appeared in the empirical literature. The first addresses findings that voters engage in policy balancing, i.e., attempts to edge policy closer to their most preferred outcome. The second addresses the fact that voters appear not to carry the logic of the directional hypothesis to its logical conclusion but rather that voters’ willingness to vote for extremist parties is tempered by considerations about which parties are likely to be included in the governing coalition."
"68","The second type of strategic incentives concerns the voters’ ability to influence policy through the formateur’s identity and the attractiveness of potential coalition partners.32 While the possibility of influencing who becomes the formateur has straightforward implications for the voters’ decisions, the latter incentive results in counterintuitive behavior. A party becomes less attractive as a coalition partner the more votes it receives. Thus, in order to obtain a favorable policy outcome a voter may have an incentive to vote for a party that he or she does not want in the governing coalition. In this sense, a vote for an opposition party is not a wasted vote. In fact, the potential impact on the policy outcome is generally substantially larger than from voting for a coalition party.         "
"69","The main message of this article is that it is important to pay close attention to policymaking institutions when it comes to analyzing voter behavior. The focus in this article has been on the majoritarian nature of legislative institutions in the context of a unicameral legislature. The claim here is not that this is the only institution that influences voters' decisions. Different strategic opportunities may, for example, present themselves in bicameral legislatures where both chambers hold significant legislative powers. Neither are all legislatures equal, as Strøm (1984) and others have argued, and policy outcomes may better resemble the vote‐weighted average model where the legislature is provided with significant policymaking resources or where party discipline is low.
