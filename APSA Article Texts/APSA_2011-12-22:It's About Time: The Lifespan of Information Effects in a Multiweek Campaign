"1","From the citizen's perspective, the typical congressional campaign is what we would best label a low‐information affair, meaning that the average voter's exposure to information is minimal and sporadic. The lifespan of most information exposure is short‐lived. This is particularly true in U.S. House races, which is the context approximated in this study. Even the voter who pays attention may only read a newspaper endorsement, scan a yard sign, or view the occasional television advertisement (e.g., Lupia and McCubbins 1998; Popkin 1994). Persistent, repeated information is rare. Information that conveys and reinforces anything substantive about the candidate—such as the candidate's stance on a question of policy—is rarer still. The obvious exception to this, of course, is partisanship. No matter what, or how much, else is reported on congressional candidates, partisanship is omnipresent, including on most survey questions probing candidate preference, and on the ballot itself.1 Thus, if we arrange the lifespans of information exposure along a continuum, the information environment is characterized by some amount of information on the far left (i.e., transient) side of the information exposure continuum, and one prominent piece of information on the far right (i.e., persistent) side, as seen in Figure 1.         "
"2","                Temporal Relationships between Information Exposure and Information Effects"
"3","Note: Although the lifespans of information exposure and information effects are best thought of as occurring along a continuum, here I have highlighted three segments of the continuum where the solid arrows represent the relationships being examined in the present study and the dashed arrows represent potential relationships left to be examined by future research.                     "
"4","Just as with information exposure, we can think of the corresponding lifespans of information effects with respect to the citizen seeking to evaluate candidates and form a vote choice over the course of a campaign. At one end of the continuum shown in Figure 1, some information effects may be “transient” or very “short‐lived,” lasting merely minutes, such as after reading or viewing a single news story about the candidate's stance on health care reform or of how the candidate fared in the previous day's debate. Other “enduring” or “medium‐lived” effects may have longer lifespans where their endurance depends on how long information is stored in memory for later use. At the opposite end of the spectrum are “persistent” or “long‐lived” effects, for instance when information such as a candidate's partisanship occupies such a central role in political thinking that it produces effects that persist throughout the campaign. Let us consider how prior research relates to the continuum of information effects.            "
"5","Information may produce only transient effects. Exposure to certain information may trigger only brief changes in a person's thoughts about some candidate or policy. In the literature, these sorts of effects are examined by students of priming and by students of accessibility (e.g., Chong 1993; Iyengar and Kinder 1987; Zaller 1992; Zaller and Feldman 1992). The common finding across early works on the way individuals formulate opinions was that people's political views fluctuate tremendously depending on which specific considerations happen to be most salient at the moment. The short‐lived nature of information effects is echoed in recent research that has admirably endeavored to estimate the duration of advertising effects during political campaigns (Gerber et al. 2011; Hill et al. 2007, 2008).            "
"6","I view cognitive accessibility from the perspective of weeks‐long political campaigns, and in conjunction with research on partisanship. Combining these viewpoints, it seems unlikely that voters’ evaluations will bounce vast distances between observations, as partisanship should exert a gravitational pull that limits the range of response for any individual voter. In most campaigns, candidates’ partisan affiliations are conveyed repeatedly to voters, ensuring that partisanship is always accessible. Partisanship may limit the range of evaluations, but other types of accessible information such as about policy or candidate character may dictate movement within that range. For example, a person with a generally favorable view of a candidate can be expected to voice stronger or weaker support depending on the nature of top‐of‐the‐head considerations. In actual elections, identification of such considerations would be quite difficult. In the laboratory, however, the controlled release of information permits tremendous leverage in determining the information that is accessible to participants at any given point in time. A key contribution of the current study is the ability to differentiate whether the lifespans of information effects vary based on the type of information exposure."
"7","One can also expect information to produce more enduring changes in people's political assessments. Two prominent psychological models of information processing are relevant here: memory‐based and on‐line models (e.g., Hastie and Park 1986; Kelley and Mirer 1974; Lodge, McGraw, and Stroh 1989). Memory models assume, in short, that people store information in memory and retrieve it later to aid in forming judgments. For instance, you process and store how your House member voted on a bill, and then retrieve it, along with other information, when you are called on to evaluate your House member. Alternatively, the on‐line model posits that people more or less instantaneously use new information to update their assessments. Thus, information about a House vote sparks an immediate updating of your overall assessment of your House member that is remembered even when the specifics of the vote on the bill are long forgotten.            "
"8","It is important to note that I share the emerging view that there can be multiple bases of candidate evaluation. Redlawsk (2001) posits a hybrid view in which both memory and on‐line processes are operational. In their more recent works, Lodge and his colleagues also have explored approaches that incorporate possible effects of accessibility, memory, and on‐line updating (e.g., Kim, Taber, and Lodge 2010). In other words, both memory‐based and on‐line processes may be at work during the formation of candidate evaluations. Therefore, the central objectives I pursue in designing my panel experiment are, first, to permit simultaneous attention to multiple models of candidate evaluation rather than pitting the two models against each other, and second, to present tests that map to the temporal dynamics of real‐world political campaigns.            "
"9","Two important features of these past models and surrounding tests must be emphasized. First, participants were bombarded with large quantities of issue information. Second, all of the information was distributed in a single brief sitting. In all of the chief tests of the on‐line model, tests conducted in the laboratory, all of the information presented to subjects has always been presented in a single session. Consequently, there is no possibility at all to test for the impact of exposure to new information, because exposure to new information is absent by design. Likewise, most of the tests have looked at the impact of transient information exposure just a few minutes later, not weeks later, as would be the case in real‐world campaigns."
"10","Finally, information may produce “persistent” effects. Some information becomes relevant for people's core political predispositions and preferences. Again, partisanship is likely the most pertinent example, especially for candidate evaluations. Traditional depictions of the impact of partisanship on the vote portray partisanship in terms that are more static than dynamic (Campbell et al. 1960; see also Converse and Markus 1979). Although the effects of partisanship are likely to have long‐lived effects, the case for partisanship as a static force should not be granted by assumption. Numerous studies in the past generation have found dynamic depictions of partisanship to be insightful (e.g., Bartels 2002; Cowden and McDermott 2000; Franklin 1984; Franklin and Jackson 1983; Rahn 1993). What has not occurred, however, is research that transmits and reinforces partisan cues to voters over the course of a campaign while controlling the release and measuring the effects of information regarding policy issues and candidate traits.            "
"11","The specific questions I seek to address are visually illustrated in Figure 1, where the information exposure continuum is juxtaposed with the information effects continuum. First, I test for the somewhat obvious possibility that transient information exposure, either about issues or character, produces transient effects. Second, I examine the impact of persistent information exposure. Specifically, I assess the role of partisanship and I expect to uncover persistent, long‐lived effects. Third, and most critically, I investigate whether transient information exposure can produce enduring effects. That transient information exposure does produce enduring effects is a central claim in past models of candidate evaluation. The on‐line and memory models differ on how enduring effects are generated, but both assume that such effects do, in fact, exist. The empirical framework I develop simultaneously incorporates new information that may produce transient effects, old information that may produce enduring effects, and, via partisanship, persistent information exposure that may produce persistent effects.            "
"12","The research questions developed above impose very specific methodological requirements. First, a laboratory approach is needed so that information exposure can be controlled and monitored with precision. Second, unlike typical single‐session laboratory studies, attention to temporal dynamics demands a study multiple weeks in duration. Third, to test for the impact of both transient and persistent information exposure, the experiment must gradually release new pieces of information, in this case about the candidate's character and issue positions, while continuously reinforcing the candidate's partisanship. Lastly, the experimental design must enable differentiation of memory‐based and on‐line processes."
"13","Participants in the full experiment2 were 196 undergraduate students.3 Fifty‐six percent of participants were male, and 78% were white. Participants were divided evenly on partisanship, with 33% self‐identifying as Democrats, 33% as Republicans, and 34% as Independents. Participants also varied on ideology, with 28% indicating they were conservative, 27% liberal, and 45% moderate.            "
"14","My design makes use of a panel experiment where character and issue information about a hypothetical U.S. House candidate was gradually released over 12 weeks as shown in the timeline of Figure 2. The information content used in the panel experiment was modeled on the first of the on‐line studies reported by Milton Lodge and his colleagues (1989). Consistent with that study, the candidate was identified as a Republican and 75% of the candidate's issue stances matched traditional Republican positions. The longitudinal framework employed here provided the first opportunity to measure within an experimental setting participants’ assessments of the candidate each week. As a precaution, I split the sample due to a concern that administering weekly candidate evaluation measures might alter the nature of participants’ responses. Based on random assignment, half of the participants, those in the panel group, were asked to answer the 10‐point candidate evaluation question each week, whereas the other half, those in the control group, only answered the item in the study's first and last weeks. Fortunately, a diagnostic test comparing Week 12 responses for the two groups yielded no evidence of reactivity to the measurement.4 Thus, the central analyses below rely on data from participants whose candidate evaluations were measured weekly.            "
"15","                Panel Experiment 12‐Week Timeline"
"16","*Prior to receiving the first news story, all respondents completed the initial inventory, which included an issue and demographics battery of questions. **Davis’s partisanship was reinforced in each weekly article through the inclusion of a parenthetical “R.”***Following the candidate evaluation question in Week 12, all respondents completed a battery designed to test their memory of the congressman's policy positions. ****An anonymous reviewer pointed out that experimental demand effects may be a potential concern because participants could have interpreted the evaluation question differently in the final week, viewing it only then as a request for their summary judgment of the candidate. To guard against this possibility, the same question wording was used each week (see online Appendix C), and each week the introductory language simply asked participants to “answer the following questions.” Thus, in the final week, no prompts were used to cue participants to think that their evaluation in Week 12 should be of a different form than the one offered in each preceding week. Furthermore, the mean change in evaluations was the smallest from Week 11 to Week 12. This is presumably due to the absence of new information in Week 12 (discussed in the text). If respondents indeed shifted their view of the evaluation question in the final week to an overall assessment, it seems reasonable to expect that the mean change would have been much larger and this was not the case."
"17","The study was administered electronically each week via e‐mail. In the first week, all participants provided information on demographic characteristics, partisanship, and ideology and completed an issue inventory where they were asked to evaluate 16 policy statements using a 4‐point scale, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.5 Subjects then read a brief article introducing the fictitious political candidate, Congressman Fred Davis of Storm Lake, Iowa, a three‐term House incumbent who had just easily won the Republican primary. Davis’s partisan affiliation was displayed in the title and three times in the body of the article. All of the subjects were then asked to indicate their impression of Davis using a 10‐point scale, ranging from strongly negative to strongly positive.6"
"18","A mix of issue and character information about the candidate was distributed Weeks 2‐‐11 of the study. In terms of volume, the experiment was designed to mimic real‐world low‐information congressional campaigns. Each week, participants were asked to read a brief two‐paragraph article from the fictitious on‐line newspaper, The Storm Lake Gazette. Every article reminded participants of Davis’s party affiliation through inclusion of a parenthetical “R.” Participants received eight issue‐related articles during these 10 weeks. Davis took positions typically associated with Democrats in Week 5 (opposing an oil‐drilling proposal) and in Week 8 (supporting expanding employment discrimination protection to include sexual orientation) and stances generally associated with Republicans the remaining six weeks.7"
"19","Character information was reported in the third and ninth weeks. Much of the research on candidate character has focused on especially visible incidents of political malfeasance or has employed fairly stark experimental manipulations (e.g., Funk 1996; Peters and Welch 1980). Consequently, it is perhaps unsurprising that effects of character have been detected. What past research has not demonstrated, however, is that more subtle and more typical information about a candidate's character produces enduring effects on candidate evaluation. Also, it is not yet known whether any impact of character information wanes over time, particularly as new issue information becomes increasingly available. In this study, character information was varied using a 3×3 design in order to convey modestly positive, modestly negative, or neutral information about Davis. Specifically, in Week 3 the stories indicated either that Davis had received a community service award, been ticketed for speeding, or served as a judge at a county fair, whereas in Week 9 the stories reported either that he had a perfect voting record in Congress, had been fined by the FEC for a minor campaign finance violation, or had a staff member who just gave birth to triplets.8"
"20","In the final week of the study, participants were again asked to indicate their impression of Davis. Following the candidate evaluation question, participants completed a battery designed to test their memory of the congressman's policy positions.9 Included were 15 policy issues drawn from the initial issue inventory. The congressman had taken an actual position on eight of the issues. Subjects were provided with a multiple‐choice format where response options corresponded to Davis taking a position consistent with his Republican affiliation, taking a stereotypical Democratic position, or not taking a position on the issue. These recall questions provided a measure of available memory at the time of the final evaluation.            "
"21","A key point to emphasize about the design is that opinion about the candidate is measured every week. For instance, participants learn in Week 4 that Davis supports privatizing social security. They can respond immediately to that information, meaning transient information exposure can produce an immediate effect. But that information also can be stored in memory for later use, or it can be used to update a summary evaluation. In these scenarios, this information can produce enduring effects, effects that would be observed starting in Week 5. In real campaigns, information comes and goes over several weeks. My design captures this reality, and this is the critical strength of the panel experiment developed here."
"22","A second critical advantage of the panel experiment is that the nature and volume of information distributed to the study's participants created an issue environment comparable to what we see in actual low‐information elections. Further, by including issue and character information, I have two opportunities to see if transient information exposure produces enduring effects on candidate evaluation as proposed in previous research. Over time, individuals received new pieces of issue and character information. Taking advantage of the panel design, I am able to see if that information had an effect on evaluations after the week it was released. And in the case of issue information, I am able to disentangle whether any enduring effects can be attributed to memory‐based processing or on‐line processing because respondents’ memory of the candidate's issue positions was measured in the final week of the study."
"23","The dependent variable, Candidate Evaluationt, is constructed with data from the weekly 10‐point evaluation of Davis. Observations on the dependent variable were obtained at 10 points, from Week 2 to Week 11 of the study. Week 2 is the starting point because it is the first week in which participants had prior exposure to issue information before offering a candidate evaluation,10 and Week 11 is the ending point because it is the final week in which participants experienced current exposure to issue information.            "
"24","Transient effects are captured by differentiating between information received by the participant the same week the evaluation was offered and the accumulation of all information received prior to evaluating the candidate. In the case of information about the candidate's character, I include a measure of the valence of character information received in the current week, Charactert, to capture the transient effects of character information. This variable is coded 1 or −1 if the participant received positive or negative character information the week of the evaluation, and 0 for all other weeks and for participants who received neutral character information. Hence, two‐thirds of participants receive non‐0 values for this variable in Week 3 and two‐thirds receive non‐0 values in Week 9.            "
"25","For issue information, the critical variable is Issuet, which is constructed to reflect the extent to which participants agree with Davis's issue position the week of the evaluation. The coding was −1 (strongly disagree with Davis's issue stance), −.5 (disagree), .5 (agree), and 1 (strongly agree), with values of 0 assigned during Weeks 3 and 9 when character rather than issue information was reported.11 If transient exposure to issue information exerts strong influence on participants’ evaluations, producing transient effects, then a large positive coefficient will be obtained for Issuet. Moreover, if the impact of this information hinges on accessibility, then variables constructed to capture the impact of previous weeks’ policy reports (defined below) should be relatively inconsequential.            "
"26","To investigate the existence of enduring information effects, it is necessary to consider whether information received in previous weeks exerts influence on candidate evaluations. The study's inclusion of character and policy information provides two opportunities to explore whether information has a lasting influence beyond the week it is initially encountered. Therefore, I include Character Tallyt, a measure of the valence of all character information received to that point, to capture the enduring effects of character information. The value of Character Tallyt for a given week is determined by summing the values of Charactert for the current and preceding weeks. For example, participants with values of 1 on Charactert in Week 3 will have a value of 1 on Character Tallyt from Week 3 to Week 8, indicating that they received positive character information about the candidate at some point in the past (i.e., in Week 3). Depending on whether respondents were assigned to receive positive, neutral, or negative character information in Week 9, Character Tallyt will take on values between 2 and −2 for the remainder of the experiment.12 For example, respondents who receive positive character information (i.e., with values of 1 on Charactert) in both Week 3 and Week 9 will have a value of 2 on Character Tallyt from Week 9 to Week 12, indicating that they had previously received two pieces of positive character information. Prior to Week 3, Character Tallyt is coded 0 because respondents had not yet received any character information. I expect that both character variables will produce positive coefficients, but the coefficient for Charactert is expected to be of greater magnitude than the coefficient for Character Tallyt because character should be most salient in the weeks character information is presented.            "
"27","Following Lodge, McGraw, and Stroh (1989), two variables are used to represent prior exposure to issue information. The first issue variable, Issue Tallyt, indicates the participant's issue positions relative to those of the candidate for all past issues, including the current week's issue, regardless of whether the participant could recall Davis’s stances.13 This variable is simply the average of all past weeks’ values and the current week's value for a given respondent on the variable Issuet. In Week 6, for example, there were four weeks—Weeks 2, 4, 5, and 6—in which participants had received issue information. If the participant strongly agreed with Davis on all four issues, then the value for Issue Tallyt in Week 6 would be 1, whereas a value of 0 would be assigned if the participant strongly agreed with Davis on two issues and strongly disagreed on the other two. The second issue variable, Correct Memoryt, is constructed in precisely the same manner as Issue Tallyt, except that it includes information on only those issues for which the respondent was able to correctly recall the candidate's position.14"
"28","Considering these variables in tandem, there are four possible patterns. A significant effect for only the issue‐based on‐line tally variable would suggest that prior issue information matters for candidate evaluation irrespective of whether that information is stored in memory. Conversely, a significant effect for only the memory variable would imply that issue information must be stored in memory for it to be influential. Significant effects for both variables would be consistent with the hybrid model suggested by Redlawsk (2001). Lastly, insignificant effects for both variables would speak against any sort of enduring issue foundation to candidate evaluation. It is important to reiterate that I offer empirical tests with the a priori assumption that either or both the on‐line and memory models may be consequential for candidate evaluation. My purpose is not to champion the cause of a particular theoretical approach, but rather to assess how each fares when examined using a longitudinal methodological framework.            "
"29","Finally, representing persistent information exposure, Partisanship is measured using a conventional 7‐point scale (1 = strong Democrat to 7 = strong Republican). Having Davis's Republican affiliation reinforced each week is expected to produce effects that persist throughout the campaign, with the direction of those effects based on the participant's partisan affiliation.            "
"30","To summarize, the current design allows me to assess the transient effects of character and issue information received in the current week, represented by Charactert and Issuet. Most critically, I am able to explore whether transient information exposure has any enduring effects by looking at both character and issue information. Character Tallyt represents past exposure to character information. And in the case of exposure to past issue information, I am able to sort out whether transient issue information exposure produces an enduring effect either through on‐line processing, in which case the Issue Tallyt variable would be significant, or if it is the case that memory‐based processes are at work, the Correct Memoryt variable would be significant. And, finally, Partisanship captures the relative effects of persistent information exposure.            "
"31","The initial step to assessing the temporal dynamics of candidate evaluations is to see if there is variation across time. If subjects formed assessments the first week of the study and then simply repeated those appraisals as the experiment proceeded—for example, awarding Davis the same numerical score of 1 or 5 or 9 each week—then attention to the possible dynamic properties of candidate evaluation would be unrewarding. Hence, before estimating a multivariate model, caution dictates that we first step back and take in the big picture."
"32","Panel A in Figure 3 displays mean individual‐level change by week in values on the candidate evaluation dependent variable.15 Several features of these data warrant comment. First, participants’ evaluations of the candidate did vary from week to week. Average change of greater than 1 point on the 10‐point scale is observed each week, with swings roughly 2 points in magnitude occurring twice. But second, evaluations do not shift wildly. Typically, respondents do not award Davis a score of 2 one week and 9 the next; instead, a score of 2 one week most likely would be followed by a score of 1, 3, or 4 a week later. This limited change allows for the possibility, although does not confirm, that partisanship constrains candidate evaluation. It could be, for instance, that the average Republican participant, acting as a diligent partisan, would only award the Republican candidate scores between 7 and 10. However, it also might be that entirely apolitical factors contribute to individual‐level inertia, or that it was Davis’s issue stances, not his partisanship, that limited the magnitude of weekly change. Third, the change data do not trend upward or downward. One might reasonably have speculated that, as more information became available, evaluations of Davis would have begun to solidify (or, less obviously, that the additional information would have generated greater temporal volatility). No such movement is observed. It follows that, at least in low‐information elections, new information reported late in a campaign is not necessarily overwhelmed by the collective din of past information. In terms of the various types of information effects under consideration, this observation speaks most favorably toward the logic of cognitive accessibility associated with transient effects, and least favorably toward models that posit enduring effects of past information—in the present case, memory‐based and on‐line processes.         "
"33","                Volatility in Candidate Evaluation"
"34","We can develop a deeper sense of the temporal properties of the data from Panel B of Figure 3, where mean evaluations are displayed for self‐identified Republicans, Independents, and Democrats. The first lesson revealed here, one that is stark even if unsurprising, is that partisanship matters greatly for candidate evaluation. Independents are consistently modestly more positive toward the Republican candidate than are Democrats, whereas for most weeks Republicans far and away express the most favorable views. Second, levels of volatility vary markedly as a function of partisanship, with Republicans offering the most stable assessments. With only one candidate, it is impossible to determine whether the relative stability of assessments occurs because they are Republicans or because they share the candidate's party affiliation. Third, within partisan categories, mean evaluations shift noticeably from week to week. Moreover, these shifts do not occur willy‐nilly. Democrats and Independents move together, and, when these groups zig, Republicans zag. The three lines nearly converge in Week 5 and also approach one another in Week 8—the two weeks when Davis took characteristically Democratic policy positions. Wide gaps between Democrats and Republicans are observed when Davis was reported as having taken stances typically associated with Republicans, such as when supporting school vouchers in Week 6. This systematic widening and narrowing of the partisan divide suggests that voters are quite responsive to transient and momentarily accessible issue information.         "
"35","These observations provide a useful context from which to assess coefficient estimates from the random effects model reported in Table 1.16 Recall that, with the exception of the 7‐point partisanship scale, all independent variables have scale values that range in most cases from −1 to 1.17 As a result, direct comparison of most coefficients is possible.         "
"36","Following Panel B of Figure 3, the large coefficients in Table 1 for transient information exposure involving character and issue information—Issuet and Charactert—as well as for persistent information exposure, Partisanship, were to be expected. The effect for partisanship indicates that, controlling for the impact of other information, the evaluations of strong Democrats and strong Republicans will differ by over 3 full points on the 10‐point evaluation scale. Evaluations are projected to differ by nearly 2 points for participants who strongly agree rather than strongly disagree with the candidate's stance on the current week's issue, and by almost 1 point for subjects who were just exposed to modestly positive rather than modestly negative character information. Collectively, these results suggest candidate evaluation that is constrained by partisanship, but that, within those constraints, varies from moment to moment in response to transient and thus highly accessible character and issue information. Such a process seemingly constitutes an amalgamation of the Michigan model and models of accessibility effects as posited by Zaller and Feldman (1992) and by Chong (1993).         "
"37","But what of information received in prior weeks? Much of the recent research on candidate evaluation has offered variants of memory‐based models, critiques of those approaches, or critiques of the critiques. Yet, in Table 1 the relevant variables yield two strikeouts and only one weak single. The variable that captures the enduring effects of past exposure to character information, Character Tallyt, produces a statistically significant coefficient, but one that is almost half the size of the coefficient for Charactert. Thus, exposure to character information does appear to produce enduring, albeit modest, effects on candidate evaluations. In contrast, however, the memory and on‐line representations of past exposure to issue information generate insignificant effects. The model provides no evidence whatsoever that past issue information matters, and, correspondingly, no evidence in support of either memory‐based or on‐line depictions of candidate evaluation. These are especially striking null findings. Information was released gradually over time, an approach that should have permitted participants to store information in memory or to update summary evaluations. Yet, I find no evidence that either memory or an on‐line process is at work when it comes to issue information.         "
"38","Although present results provide no evidence of issue‐based memory or on‐line effects, it should be noted that both variables produced correctly signed coefficients. Hence, with a larger number of cases, it is conceivable that significant effects could be obtained for these variables. That said, regardless of statistical significance, the substantive impact of past issue information appears to be paltry when contrasted with the effects of partisanship and current information. If enduring information effects produced via issue‐based on‐line or memory‐based processes influence candidate evaluation, these results suggest that they do so only on the margins.18"
"39","How can these conclusions be reconciled with findings of memory and/or on‐line effects in prior research? The most plausible answer, in my judgment, relates to the current study's use of a multiwave research design in which, as in actual campaigns, participants were repeatedly exposed to new information over a period of several weeks. The on‐line and memory models are in a vital sense about how voters combine old and new information to evaluate candidates. But, critically, past empirical tests have exposed experimental subjects to information in only a single sitting. This transient information exposure then was found to influence subsequent judgments via patterns consistent with the logic of on‐line and/or memory models. What is noteworthy in these studies is that old information produced lingering effects in a vacuum, in tests in which no new information was made available to decision makers. The possible consequences of new information were addressed only by assumption—namely that new information would be rolled into either memory or an on‐line tally. An entirely plausible alternate scenario was not considered: that transient exposure to new and highly accessible information, rather than being combined with old information, would instead displace the effects of old information.         "
"40","In past studies, variables representing on‐line and memory effects produced significant coefficients, but they did so in essence by default; with only a single round of information exposure, there was no risk that new information would drive out the old. This account can be subjected to an additional test with present data. The new test focuses on the final measure of the dependent variable, from Week 12 of the study. What is important in this test is that participants received no new substantive information in Week 12, and, consequently, there was no chance for new and accessible information to swamp any effects of old information. With the Week 12 judgment modeled as a function of partisanship and past issue and character information, this offers the best opportunity to find an enduring impact of old information—because, as in past studies, no new information is available to push aside the old."
"41","Results from the new model are reported in Table 2. Recall that Table 1 displayed results from the panel model where individuals continuously received new information on a weekly basis, whereas Table 2 includes only data from Week 12 when no new information was released to the participants and only their assessment of the candidate and memory of the candidate's policy positions were measured. The dependent variable of Candidate Evaluationt in Table 1 becomes Candidate Evaluation at t = 12 in Table 2. Because no new information was released in Week 12, variables representing the current week's information—Issuet and Charactert—are excluded from the model. The remaining independent variables—Character Tallyt, Correct Memoryt, Issue Tallyt, and Partisanship—assume their values from Week 11, the final week new information could have altered their values.         "
"42","The new model involves two versions. The first includes only the half of participants who were asked to provide candidate evaluations every week (i.e., the same participants included in the model in Table 1), whereas the second includes all participants in the full experiment. Coefficients for the two models are quite similar. In both, partisanship once again produces a strong effect on respondents’ evaluations of the hypothetical candidate. And, more importantly, in both models statistically significant and substantively quite sizable coefficients are obtained for the issue‐based on‐line variable, whereas negligible effects are obtained for memory.19 Thus, I have constructed an approximate replication of the final model reported by Lodge et al. (1989), and I have found the same basic pattern of results—a significant effect for the on‐line variable and an insignificant effect for memory. It appears that evidence supporting the on‐line framework's ability to demonstrate that transient information exposure produces enduring effects emerges only when conditions are such that no current information is accessible to participants.

"43","One final piece of evidence provides additional corroboration for the rapid displacement model of information processing outlined here. In Figure 3, the mean level of change in respondents’ evaluations from one week to the next was 1.55 points on the 10‐point candidate evaluation scale for a period running from Week 3 of the study to Week 11. The smallest observed change was 1.14 points. In each of these weeks, participants received new information about Davis, and evaluations changed. But what about change from Week 11 to Week 12, when participants received no new information? Here, the mean change was only 0.76 points, less than half of the mean in Figure 3. This finding can be considered in tandem with the results in Table 2: when information acquisition is halted, candidate evaluation exhibits only minimal temporal change, and past information as summarized by the on‐line tally influences respondents’ final judgments. However, neither of these conclusions holds in a dynamic environment in which voters repeatedly encounter new information over the course of a weeks‐long campaign.         "
"44","Previous experimental studies have tended to use single‐shot methodological approaches that allow researchers to empirically investigate the transient effects of transient information exposure, both sections on the far‐left side of the continua shown in Figure 1. Without considering the full range of the information‐exposure continuum and the information‐effects continuum, in tandem, the extent to which results apply to information processing during actual political campaigns may be questionable. In short, external validity is threatened. Information released in a single sitting may or may not have short‐lived or long‐lasting effects on opinions, but how these results speak to opinion formation that occurs as small pieces of information are gradually released over the course of a multiple‐week campaign is unclear.         "
"45","In the present study, laboratory procedures were employed so that there was strict control over the information made available to the study's participants. The news stories distributed to subjects included a realistic array of partisan, issue, and character information, and, to capture the minimalist quality of low‐information elections, participants were exposed to only a single brief newspaper article each week. Last week's new information became part of the stock of this week's old information, enabling unprecedented insight regarding how voters form and adjust evaluations of a political candidate over the course of a campaign. Most importantly, the panel design provides the opportunity to assess empirically the lifespan of information effects in an environment where new information continually emerges. Furthermore, by combining a longitudinal design with the control of a laboratory setting, I was able to assess whether some information has longer lifespans than other pieces of information, and, critically, I was able to determine how information is processed as new information enters the scene.         "
"46","The key findings are best appreciated by differentiating among three factors: persistent information exposure (in this case, partisanship), transient exposure to new information (whether about issues or candidate character), and past information exposure (whether incorporated in judgment via memory or an on‐line tabulation). Among these three factors, candidate evaluation was found to be driven overwhelmingly by the first and second. Partisanship limits the range of response, but does not commit the voter to a single evaluative point. Then, within the voter's party‐defined range, response to transient and thus momentarily accessible information exposure dictates whether the assessment offered at a given point is relatively positive or relatively negative. While partisanship and transient new information join to provide a powerful basis of candidate evaluation, past information finds that three's a crowd. Prior character information was shown to exert only a rather modest effect. Issue information represented via an on‐line tally brought a significant effect only when, by virtue of the study's design, no other issue or character information was accessible to the voter. Lastly, issue information possibly stored in memory exerted no discernible effects at all on candidate evaluation."
"47","Although this portrait of candidate evaluation leaves no toehold at all for memory‐based effects and apparently only a small niche for on‐line processes, I see a possible larger role for enduring information effects in different decision‐making circumstances. Following Lodge et al. (1989), I fashioned a Republican candidate who was entirely mainstream in his issue stances. It is conceivable that this depiction limited the room for on‐line updating for the simple reason that new information merely served to reinforce baseline partisan expectations. Had he instead been depicted as a centrist or a hard‐line conservative, perhaps an on‐line process would have complemented partisanship in determining the central tendency of subjects’ evaluations (see Mitchell 2008).         "
"48","Additionally, two features of the current design that match well with many low‐information campaigns may have limited the role of enduring information effects. First, respondents in my experiment received only a single piece of information each week, information that was not repeated. However, a central feature of many campaigns is that either due to the competitiveness of the race or the saliency of an issue in a district, voters may encounter repeated exposure to particular pieces of information. A logical next question is whether repetition would matter for the lifespan of information effects. Perhaps there is some threshold that needs to be reached, whether for a tally to be updated or for the information to be stored in memory. It may be that new information is unable to displace the contents of memory when information achieves a high level of saliency in people's minds because of repeated exposure by the candidates."
"49","Second, campaign information in this experiment focused solely on the incumbent candidate. The findings reported here are relevant for many low‐information races where campaign communications are dominated by the incumbent.20 However, there is reason to believe that voters may be more likely to turn to memory when they are asked to choose between a set of candidates as opposed to evaluating a single candidate (e.g., Redlawsk 2001). Additional tests that attend to temporal dynamics will be necessary to identify when enduring effects should be expected. At a minimum, the current study suggests that enduring information effects may be much less prevalent than originally believed, at least under conditions similar to those that accompany typical low‐information campaigns. Additionally, it is important to note that confidence in the present set of findings is bolstered by the fact that an emerging line of research in the campaigns literature has similarly found that the duration of campaign effects is remarkably short‐lived even in more competitive races (Gerber et al. 2011; Hill et al. 2007, 2008).         "
"50","Moving from abstract models of candidate evaluation to the real world of campaigns and elections, the portrait of the voter painted here is hardly flattering and the ability of citizens to provide meaningful democratic input is once again called into question. No evidence was detected to suggest that voters’ assessments solidify over time. To the contrary, the candidate evaluations offered by some subjects bounced several points from one week to the next simply because the subjects did or did not care for what the candidate had to say that week on a certain issue. We have long known that despite the backdrop of partisanship, many people need only the thinnest of prompts in order to change their minds on many questions of politics, and we know that many U.S. elections are low‐information, low‐motivation affairs. Together, these points bring considerable plausibility to the process of candidate evaluation described here. What is particularly striking from the findings presented here is that the enduring effects of campaign information are remarkably limited and that the rate at which information effects decay may be even greater than previously imagined, particularly in the case of issue information."
"51","The emerging depiction of candidate evaluation suggests that the effects of transient information exposure fade as the information disappears from the scene and new information becomes available. Only when new information acquisition is forcibly brought to a dead stop were candidate evaluations influenced by prior information because new information was unable to displace the stockpile of accumulated information. A worthy alternate to the on‐line and memory models of information processing is the “rapid displacement” model, and until additional studies of the over‐time dynamics of campaign information are undertaken, this model must be taken seriously."
