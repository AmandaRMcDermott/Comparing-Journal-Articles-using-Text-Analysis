"1","The Gulf War offered an exceptional venue for testing and enriching theories of media impact (Denton 1993; Bennett and Paletz 1994). Reminiscent of much prior media research, Gulf War studies focused largely on attitude formation and change (Iyengar and Simon 1993; McLeod, Eveland, and Signorielli 1994; Allen et al. 1994; Krosnick and Brannon 1993a, 1993b). These studies did not, however, explain a curious finding related to political memory: The percentage of people reporting opposition to the use of force prior to the war was much larger than the percentage reporting after the war that they had opposed it beforehand (Mueller 1994).         "
"2","The 1990–1992 National Election Studies panel data permit a detailed analysis of who misremembered and who did not, allowing for a reasonable determination of the probable causes of pre‐to‐postwar differences. Prior to the war, respondents were asked the direction they thought the country should take in the Persian Gulf: pull out U.S. forces, try harder for a diplomatic solution, tighten the economic embargo, or take military action. After the war, the same respondents were asked to recall their prewar preferences. Responses to the prewar inquiry were categorized as either fight or peace and these same coding categories were applied to the postwar recall question. (See Appendix A.) Table 1 presents the distribution of respondents' postwar recollections of their prewar preferences.         "
"3","Among the group that favored military action prior to the war, 291 of 323 (90%) remembered that prewar position. Of those favoring only peaceful means before the war, 258 of 702 (37%) recalled preferring peaceful actions. A theory of memory is combined with a theory of media influence to explain why some recalled accurately while others did not."
"4","Memory is crucial to virtually all contemporary models of political behavior. It is widely assumed that citizens draw upon information stored in memory to inform their political behaviors and attitudes. Researchers infer all manner of cognitive processes and capabilities from the accuracy or failure of political memory (Zaller and Feldman 1992; Lodge, Steenbergen, and Brau 1995). But processes of memory storage and retrieval are not simple.         "
"5","Experimental and survey research has identified significant recall error resulting from forgetting and memory distortion (Smith 1984). Memory decay occurs very rapidly and citizens are unable to remember the basic information that informed their current judgments (Lodge, Steenbergen, and Brau 1995). When individuals are asked to recall the content of memories lost over time, they make educated guesses based on factors that provide clues to the original memories (Tourangeau, Rips, and Rasinski 2000).         "
"6","For example, Smith (1984) suggested that people use environmental cues such as known or perceived changes in public attitudes when recollecting the nature of their own past attitudes. A particularly large shift in public sentiment offers an especially visible heuristic that individuals use to infer their own earlier positions. Markus (1986) identified this phenomenon among panel respondents asked to recall their policy preferences and ideological orientations recorded several years before. Respondents' recollections of their own changes in policy preferences favored the direction of prevailing public sentiment. This correlation between memory of attitude change and perceived public opinion occurred independently of whether the respondent's own attitude change corresponded with a national trend. In addition, Lowenthal and Loewenstein (2001) found that respondents' memories of their own propensity to change opinion are biased in favor of attitude stability.         "
"7","More importantly, even though individuals may have undergone attitude change, they appear to be entirely unaware that such processes have occurred (Bem and McConnell 1970; Goethals and Reckman 1973). Markus concluded that most policy attitudes do not have strong internal cognitive representations—either tied to self‐identity or linked to salient experiences—and are thus exceedingly changeable, and that once changed, an individual's “cognitive autobiography is rewritten so as to render the changes invisible” (1986, 41). In short, individuals may believe their memories are due to direct retrieval rather than reconstruction (Herrmann 1994); people evidently have difficulty distinguishing what they experienced from what they inferred.         "
"8","Memories of policy preferences are thus vulnerable to considerable decay and respondents are likely to be unaware of what their prior preferences may have been. In these instances, reconstruction characterizes recall; available information leading in a direction different from the original memory can determine what is remembered. This dynamic will be referred to as memory replacement and considered as a major explanation for the divergence between prewar attitudes and postwar recall of those attitudes. It is expected that citizens' memories will follow perceived public opinion, even when this leads to erroneous reconstruction. Further, the effect of perceived public opinion on reconstructed memory should be evident when controlling for the individual's current preferences."
"9","Yet to say that perceived public opinion affected memories is not enough to produce a testable hypothesis; it leaves several questions unanswered. What indicators of perceived public opinion should be used? What form will the influence take? Who is most vulnerable to memory replacement? The answer to these questions can be found in the media effects literature."
"10","Perhaps the most conspicuous media effect is priming, whereby media attention to an issue makes information about it more accessible in people's memory (Iyengar and Kinder 1987). In turn this information is more likely to be used when respondents are asked to evaluate political figures (Krosnick and Kinder 1990). Though individuals presumably employ the information that has been triggered by media attention for evaluative purposes, it appears to be instinctive rather than a conscious activity. In this regard, the so‐called accessibility bias that underpins priming theory reveals a vulnerable mind, one susceptible to manipulation without awareness or consent. And the most effective agent of this sort of priming seems to be television news.         "
"11","While television news is accepted as the primary agent of media influence, there is considerable debate over the underlying dynamic of media influence. Two rival conceptions dominate the field (Krosnick and Brannon 1993a). In the traditional dosage‐resistance model, the likelihood of media influence increases with exposure. Political knowledge serves as a resistance‐causing agent, permitting recipients of media messages to counterargue new information and assimilate it to their existing cognitions.         "
"12","On the other hand, the so‐called contemporary psychological perspective (Krosnick and Brannon 1993a) asserts the opposite effects of exposure and political knowledge. Because significant exposure is likely to activate a number of considerations, it is thought to reduce the overall effect of any one message. Priming effects are thus expected among the least exposed, who are most likely to receive the “big message” or top issues of the day but little more. As for political knowledge, it is thought to facilitate the type of cognitive processes required for effective priming. According to Krosnick and Brannon (1993a) priming requires that a person must understand the story, store its contents and implications in memory and then retrieve that stored information at a later date (see also Miller and Krosnick 2000).         "
"13","The central hypotheses linking media use and individual's characteristics to memory replacement emerge from the dosage‐resistant perspective: Individuals will use conceptions of public opinion provided by television news when they reconstruct their own prior preferences.1 Scholars of the war agree that the media cast the military alternative in a strongly positive light, going so far as to minimize coverage of antiwar activities (Denton 1993). They also found that the media created a falsely low impression of popular opposition to the use of U.S. military force (Allen et al. 1994). Given the character of media content surrounding the Gulf War, among prewar advocates of peaceful means, those who consume the most television news will be those most likely to suffer from inaccurate memories. Stated preferences about the war are expected to decay rapidly, and heavily exposed individuals are more likely to use media content when reconstructing their prior preferences. Thus media content primes reconstructive processes and hence newly processed information fills the memory void and replaces older memories.1"
"14","Also consistent with the dosage‐resistance perspective, political knowledge, education, and internal efficacy will produce intellectual self‐confidence that makes people resistant to memory decay and replacement. Politically knowledgeable and educated people will be more likely than others to remember correctly having preferred peaceful means."
"15","A final resistance‐causing agent that may affect memory is trust in government. Hetherington (1999) argued that a person's level of trust in government is a useful heuristic, enabling individuals to navigate the waters of political uncertainty without the need for full information. Applying this heuristic approach to memory reconstruction, trust in government may be a likely contributor to inaccurate memories in those who actually advocated peaceful means in the prewar period. If the true memory of one's own prewar preference lapses, government's preference can act as a cue during the reconstruction process. Those trusting government will find it easier to believe that they preferred whatever action this trustworthy government took, and so are more likely to construct an inaccurate memory that they themselves preferred military action.         "
"16","To test the proposition that exposure to the news media influenced respondents' memories of their prior preferences multivariate logistic regression was utilized. Following the example of Silver, Anderson, and Abramson's (1986) study of vote misreporting, only the “at‐risk” population will be examined. The sharp contrast between prewar preferences for peace and the media's impression of popular support for military action make inaccurate recall more likely only among peace advocates.         "
"17","The dependent variable is memory replacement. It takes a dichotomous form, coded 1 for those prewar peace advocates who after the war misremembered their prewar preference, and 0 for those prewar peace advocates who recalled a prewar preference for peaceful means. Exposure to television news, the key causal variable, is measured by the number of days per week respondents' reported watching the news. Again, if the hypothesis is correct, a positive relationship between exposure to television news and the propensity to misremember one's prewar policy attitude should appear.1"
"18","In addition to the key variable of media exposure, several other individual level characteristics should be associated with resistance to memory replacement. First, political knowledge, education, and internal efficacy ought to reduce the likelihood of memory replacement.1 The respondent's level of reported education was scaled from 1 (eight grades or fewer) to 7 (graduate degree). Internal efficacy was captured by levels of agreement with the statement that politics and government are too complicated for one like the respondent to understand; for level of political knowledge the interviewer's assessments of respondent's political information were utilized (Bartels 1996). Internal efficacy is measured on a five‐point scale ranging from 0 (low efficacy) to 1 (high efficacy); political information also ranges from 0 (low information) to 1 (high).         "
"19","Second, any memory reconstruction that takes place using one's own trust in government as a cue is likely to lead those most trusting of government to falsely conclude that they supported the position that government took. For those who distrust government, on the other hand, this distrust may serve as a resistance‐causing agent, making it less likely that respondents' memories will be modified in a way that brings their preferences closer to those of government. A measure of trust in government is taken from respondent's opinion of how often he or she can trust the government to do what is right, using a three‐point scale from 0 (none or some of the time), .5 most of the time, to 1 (always).1"
"20","Several additional variables are also included as necessary controls. First, it is important to control for the possibility that a respondent's recollection of his or her former attitude is affected by the respondent's relevant current attitude. The attitude most likely accessible to a respondent would be his or her beliefs about whether the U.S. did the right thing in sending forces to the Persian Gulf. This variable is coded as 1 if the respondent believed the U.S. did right in the Gulf, 0.5 if the respondent indicated mixed feelings, and 0 if the respondent felt the U.S. should have stayed out. Due to a drive for cognitive consistency (Smith 1984), respondents reporting that the U.S. did the right thing are expected to exhibit a greater propensity toward misremembering.         "
"21","Party identification and the perceived difference between the parties on the question of use of force in the Persian Gulf are also included. This accounts for any confounding effects of politically motivated memory reconstruction. Party identification is coded on the conventional seven‐point scale with Strong Democrat coded zero; the difference between the parties on the use of force is a dichotomous variable coded 1 if the respondent believed the parties differed in support for the use of force, and zero otherwise."
"22","Finally, date of the postwar interview must be considered. While existing research suggests memory of attitudes decays quickly, memory replacement may take more time. If this is the case, respondents whose postwar interviews came later may be more likely to report a false memory of prewar support for military action. Postwar interview dates ranged from June 3 (coded 1) to July 31 (coded 59)."
"23","Model estimates are presented in Table 2. A positive coefficient suggests an increase in the likelihood of an inaccurate memory. Several findings are immediately apparent. First, the coefficients of the control variables reveal that politically motivated memory and the drive for cognitive consistency are both significant factors. Politically motivated memory is evident in two ways: Republicans misremember more often than Democrats, and those who think the parties differed on the question of use of force in the Gulf are less likely to misremember than others. The effect of current evaluations of the U.S. government's actions in the Gulf shows a strong drive to bring past preferences into line with current evaluations; those whose current positions are that the U.S. did right are much more likely to misremember their former positions. Finally, postwar interview date is positively related to misremembering; respondents whose postwar interviews came later were more likely to report a prewar preference for war, indicating memory replacement may have taken some time.         "
"24","Turning now to variables of theoretical interest, the information processing variables—education and internal efficacy—are negatively signed, as our theory predicts, though only education achieves statistical significance. Meanwhile political information does not appear to directly influence memory.1 Trust in government performs as expected. It appears to act as a cue during the reconstruction process, pulling a person's reconstructed memories in the direction of what the trusted government actually did.1"
"25","Finally, and most important, the estimate for media exposure supports the memory replacement hypothesis. Greater exposure to television news increases the likelihood of misremembering one's own prior preference. The effects are not merely statistically significant but substantively important as well. Considering people who are otherwise typical in terms of the independent variables (among those whose prewar preference was peace), the difference in probability of misremembering between one with maximum exposure to television news and one with no exposure (.13) is comparable in magnitude to the difference between one with a high school diploma and one with a college degree (−.16) or between a pure independent and a strong Democrat (.16) or strong Republican (.10)."
"26","The empirical estimates in Table 2 suggest that a definite syndrome of vulnerability existed, such that certain individuals with clearly identifiable characteristics were prone to underestimating the extent to which their government had acted against their preferences. Significant exposure to the news media, greater trust in government, and low education signaled individuals so ripe for manipulation that their memories could be replaced by recollections more consonant with government's position.         "
"27","The generalizability of these findings is an interesting puzzle. It seems likely that trust in government would have the same pro‐government effect on memories under most circumstances, provided initial memories were easily forgotten. But media exposure and lack of education seem more likely simply to increase vulnerability to memory replacement, without predicting the direction of that replacement. Media exposure in particular might have counter government effects on memories if the media were to portray events that reduced support for (or were to emphasize public opposition to) government's position."
"28","At this juncture it is reasonable to ask whether an interaction exists between media exposure and political information. A theory of increased vulnerability due to low intellectual self‐confidence would indicate that the effects of media exposure on the probability of misremembering would be stronger among low information respondents; greater political information should dampen the effects of exposure. On the other hand, Zaller's (1992) work cautions that media effects are sometimes greatest in the midrange of attentiveness.         "
"29","Running separate regressions with low, medium, and high information respondents confirms expectations;Table 3 displays the results. Among low information respondents, television news exposure registers a significant positive impact on the likelihood of misremembering. There appears to be no increased media effect among those in the midrange of political information or higher; this effect is expected from a dosage‐resistance viewpoint. An interaction term for media exposure and political information returned a significant coefficient when added to the model shown in Table 2 (b =−.29, p < .06, one‐tail test).1"
"30","What can be reasonably inferred from the NES panel are the sources of memory replacement most plausible in terms of established social‐psychological theory. This research has attempted to do just that. However, alternative explanations deserve scrutiny as well. A two‐step process of memory replacement has been asserted, whereby individuals' initial memories of their Gulf War preferences first decayed and then were replaced by reconstructed memories that were primed by media coverage. However, what if people did remember their initial positions and simply reported memories that placed themselves in a socially desirable position—consistent with popular support and being associated with the winner? Respondents would thus be lying to secure social approval, avoiding disclosure of an undesirable past preference.1"
"31","This rationale is conventionally used to explain vote misreport.1 In general, most researchers suggest that misreports (under or overreports) are deliberate and stem from desires to create socially acceptable impressions (Silver, Anderson, and Abramson 1986; Presser 1990). Most recently, Bernstein, Chadha, and Montjoy (2001) argued that vote misreport stems from respondents' memories of not voting, and this knowledge generates the necessary guilt to report erroneously. Social pressures are also common explanations for overeports of income, church attendance, and sexual behavior (See Tourangeau, Rips, and Rasinski [2000] for a review of this literature).            "
"32","There are both theoretical and empirical reasons for explaining what happened as misremembering rather than conscious misreport. First, the misreport literature deals primarily with memories of past behaviors, not of attitudes. Behaviors are more likely to be remembered, attitudes less likely (Gutek 1978). In this instance the existing literature suggests that actual memories would likely have been absent (Smith 1984; Markus 1986; Lodge, Steenbergen, and Brau 1995) and required reconstruction. Second, the causal variables seem unsuited to a conscious misreport theory. It is not difficult to see why media exposure, current attitudes about the War, and trust in government might contribute to false memories, but it is difficult to understand why they would contribute to lying, or why education would reduce the propensity to lie for purposes of social acceptability.            "
"33","The empirical arguments are less direct. First, the number of pro‐war responses increased by 44 percentage points between the prewar and the postwar recall questions, using NES measures. A similar test by NBC/Wall Street Journal pollsters recorded a 30‐point increase in pro‐war sentiment from prewar position to postwar recall of prewar position (Mueller 1994). Did this large a proportion of the American public willfully lie? Misreports of voting and income have not in fact reached these levels. Second, while the prewar interview date was not significantly related to recalling a prewar preference for war, the postwar interview date was so related. The later the postwar interview, the more likely respondents were to report having preferred violence prior to the war. This is consistent with a theory of gradual reconstruction of (absent) memories, but not with a theory of conscious misreport; there is no reason to suppose that a prewar preference for war would become progressively more desirable over time during the postwar period.            "
"34","Having stated this, the limits of the claim need to be addressed. Memory replacement is fully consistent with the motivation to manage impressions and present socially desirable answers. Having no memory of their own preferences prior to the war, and working to reconstruct them, respondents relied on heuristics, and heavy media consumers had greater access to such cues. In this case, media cues included repetitious messages of public support for the war; dissent was underrepresented in media reports (Allen et al. 1994).1 The point is that by the time respondents were interviewed, they were not consciously misreporting their prior position; it had lapsed. They were misremembering. It was not a matter of telling the truth but of knowing it.            "
"35","Although it appears that false memories existed and were caused by identifiable factors, it has yet to be demonstrated that they mattered for political reality. In general, researchers study political memories because they are seen to be a precursor to important attitudes and behavior; however, research has not linked the replacement of memory to future political acts. The final task of this article is to demonstrate that false memories of Gulf War attitudes are related to the act of voting."
"36","A person whose autobiographical memories can be replaced by powerful external sources (like the media) will likely be tolerant and supportive of existing authority. If so, erroneous recall of one's prewar preference, by erasing the sharp difference that actually existed between what one wanted and what government did on an important policy question, should lead to increased support for the political status quo, operationalized as support for the incumbent in a presidential election. In a recent article, Hetherington (1999) showed that one contributor to misremembering can have this effect; trust in government can increase support for the incumbent in a presidential contest. False memory of one's own Gulf War preference may have the same effect.         "
"37"," Table 4 presents a logistic regression model using vote for Bush in the 1992 election as the dependent variable, coded 1 if the respondent reported voting for Bush, 0 if the respondent reported a vote for either Clinton or Perot. In addition to the key independent variable of Gulf War preference memory replacement (coded 1 if the respondent misremembered his or her prewar preference and 0 for accurate recall), several conventional determinants of vote choice are included: ideology, partisanship, feelings toward the president, evaluation of the president's handling of the economy, evaluation of the national economy over the past year, and the respondent's sex and race.1 Following Hetherington (1999), we also include the respondent's 1992 level of trust in government. As before, the sample is restricted to those whose actual prewar preference was for the use of peaceful means in the Persian Gulf.         "
"38","Model estimates in Table 4 show that a false memory of Gulf War preference is a predictor of voting for the incumbent president. For the respondent who is otherwise typical in terms of the independent variables, recall error increases the probability of voting for Bush by .09. For purposes of comparison, a pure independent is .17 more likely to vote for Bush than a strong Democrat, and .29 less likely to vote for Bush than a strong Republican.1"
"39","This study presents an important addition to the evidence that media effects are “more fugitive than minimal” (Bartels 1993, 267). Autobiographical memory is a very private construct, yet seems to have been modified by the media without people being aware of it. This study also demonstrates the continued utility of the dosage‐resistance theory of political communications; this is in sharp contrast to the findings of other recent work (Krosnick and Brannon 1993a), though memories of past preferences may be affected in ways quite different from current attitudes.         "
"40","The analyses may however be viewed as criticism of several perspectives that imply citizens can exercise effective democratic control over government despite such impediments as low political knowledge or inaccurate beliefs (Page and Shapiro 1992; Popkin 1991; for a contrary view, see Bartels 1996). One such perspective is the “on‐line model of candidate evaluation” (Lodge 1995; Lodge, Steenbergen, and Brau 1995). Lodge, Steenbergen, and Brau (1995) argue that a common assumption of conventional theories, namely that information affects behavior only when it is remembered, is wrong. Information can modify an individual's online evaluation of the candidate, then be quickly forgotten, and yet have its effect on the individuals' vote through the online evaluation. The implication is that memory failure need not imply evaluative error. This study, however, raises the possibility that even if the online candidate evaluation model is essentially valid, memories might disappear but be replaced with others that counteract the original effect. In such a case memory failure might lead to evaluative error and might do so in a way that matters in the voting booth.         "
"41","A second approach with optimistic implications for popular control of government despite poor information is based on the notion that trust can provide a useful heuristic for citizens (Hetherington 1999). The finding that trust in government led people to assume a false congruence between their past preferences and the past actions of government is an implicit criticism of this notion; it is difficult to disagree with Hetherington that “higher levels of trust are of great benefit to both elected officials and political institutions,” but, this does not imply that these leaders “have more leeway to govern effectively” (Hetherington 1998, 803). Rather, trust gives government more leeway, period; this may include greater freedom to violate the voters' wishes.         "
"42","This article's findings thus encourage continued exploration of the interplay of memory and political authority. Just as memories are potentially important avenues for authorities to affect cognition, their nature may also impede or enhance the emergence of particular patterns of authority over time. As links to their own pasts, autobiographical memories potentially shape people's views of themselves and authorities. In the case of the Gulf War, this suggests that an inaccurate recall about a preference for military intervention was convenient, perhaps comforting to the self, but more importantly a good fit with the prevailing information environment. The media convey political information and also actively interpret public events. In so doing, they shape themselves into authorities. Though the Gulf War is often used as a prime example of government management of the news media, it is also an example of television journalism as mediator of a national public experience; an experience given to considerable modification and change consistent with political authority."
"43","Finally, while many have characterized the low levels of information citizens possess as random ignorance, or the absence of beliefs, this study raises the possibility that rather than random ignorance, citizens with a clearly identifiable set of related information‐processing characteristics and attitudes toward the governing structure might possess systematically inaccurate views of their own prior preferences. As a single study, this work is only suggestive; further work might explore other ways this cluster of attributes leads to systematic bias in recall, particularly in ways that protect government from the citizenry."
"44","Prewar preference was assessed with the following question from the prewar interview (VAR 900358). Which of the following do you think we should do now in the Persian Gulf: pull out U.S. forces entirely; try harder to find a diplomatic solution; tighten the economic embargo; or take tougher military action?"
"45","               "
"46","Answers 4, 134, 234, 240, 340, and 401 were coded “fight.” Answers 1, 2, 3, 120, 123, 130, and 230 were coded “peace.” Those answering 7, 270, and 370 were dropped. Those interviewed on January 12 (the day Congress authorized force) or later were dropped."
"47","Postwar recall of prewar preference was assessed with the following question from the postwar interview (VAR 912500). Now, turning to the troubles in the Middle East…. before the war in the Persian Gulf started, Congress debated whether to continue economic sanctions or to give President Bush the authority to use military forces to get Iraq out of Kuwait. At that time, were you for continuing to rely on sanctions, or were you in favor of authorizing the President to use military force, or didn't you have an opinion on this?"
"48","                              "

"50","NEITHER/BOTH/OTHER (VOLUNTEERED)"
"51","FOR USE OF FORCE"

"54","Answer 1 was coded “peace.” Answer 5 was coded “fight.” Those answering 3, 8, and 9 were dropped. Note: In Tables 2–4, the sample includes only those respondents whose prewar preference was peace. Also, because postwar question asked for recall of preferences before and during congressional debate, the small number of respondents whose prewar interviews were on or after January 12, 1991, the day Congress voted to authorize force was omitted. Excluding these people makes no differences in results; including them would have increase N by four individuals in Table 2 and by two in Table 4.            "
"55","The measure of misremembering used is the best individual‐level one available, and the evidence that large amounts of misremembering actually occurred is corroborated by other research (see below). Nonetheless, the measure may overstate misremembering. This appendix describes two dynamics that might have introduced error into the misremembering measure."
"56","Before the war, respondents were asked what “we should do now in the Persian Gulf,” followed by the response choices. After the war, they were asked to recall their preferences during a time when Congress was debating the use of force. Most of the prewar interviews occurred in November 1990; on November 28 Congress started hearings on the Gulf; the next day the UN Security Council established the January 15 deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait; Congress debated authorizing Bush to use force in early January, and Congress voted for force on January 12. The postwar recall question thus appears to refer to opinion at a time when the question of using force was being discussed conditional upon Iraq's refusal to move by the UN deadline, whereas the prewar question simply asked what “we should do now.” It may be that some respondents who opposed using force “now” (as of the prewar interview date) would have supported force conditionally, if Iraq did not leave by the UN deadline."
"57","Unfortunately, there is no way to tell how many respondents of this type there were. Mueller (1994) lists 12 polls conducted in early January using conditional wordings; “fight” responses ranged from 44% to 63% in these polls, with seven of the twelve polls returning “fight” percentages between 44 and 49%. The NES prewar “fight” percentage of 28% is much lower than in any of these polls, indicating that question wording may have been a factor in what was coded as misremembering, although Mueller suggests that some of the last‐minute prewar “fight” preference totals may have been inflated (1994, 32–3).            "
"58","There is evidence against the question wording explanation as well. Gallup performed what amounts to an experiment on the effects of question wording differences of just the sort that plague the NES data. One Gallup question asked for preferences “if Iraq does not change its position within the next several months;” another asked whether “it is time to take stronger action against Saddam Hussein, including use of armed force” (Mueller 1994, 227). The former question is conditional, similar to the NES postwar recall question, and the latter asks what to do now (as of the interview date), similar to the NES prewar question. Both were asked in November, December, and early January, and the conditional question never exhibited a more hawkish response pattern, implying that in this case question wording did not matter. In addition, the 71% prewar fight preference returned by the NES postwar recall question was much higher than that of most prewar polls using either conditional or “now” wordings, suggesting that even if question wording were a factor, a significant amount of change in recall remains to be explained by misremembering.            "
"59","Perhaps the best estimate of the relative magnitudes of misremembering and question wording effects is obtained by comparing the NES results to a recall experiment that was quite similar to the NES, but used the same wording for both the prewar and the postwar recall questions. NBC/Wall Street Journal pollsters asked the conditional question in early December, then asked a second sample in mid‐March to recall their positions “before the war started … last January” (Mueller 1994, 229). The two polls used identical wordings, and the “fight” preference choice was chosen by 46% in December but recalled by 76% in March, a 30‐point difference. By contrast, the comparable difference in the NES data is 44 points; 27% of the prewar sample chose to fight, whereas 71% recalled a prewar preference for fighting when interviewed in June and July 1991. Of course, the later date of the NES postwar interviews gave more time for memory replacement.            "
"60","A second dynamic that may challenge misremembering theory is prewar persuasion. According to this hypothesis, individuals interviewed long before the war reported favoring peace, then changed their preferences to military action during the prewar period. Asked after the war what they preferred before the war, they reported a prewar preference for military action. There are two reasons why this is not a good explanation for the discrepancy between prewar and postwar recall responses."
"61","First, if the prewar persuasion dynamic were at work, then in a sample consisting only of those who reported a prewar preference for peace, prewar persuasion ought to appear more common among those whose prewar interviews were earlier, ceteris paribus. Those whose prewar interviews were later are less likely to have changed their minds in the shorter interval between interview and war. The prewar interview variable should then exhibit a negatively signed coefficient when included in the model estimated in Table 2: earlier dates should produce more (apparent) “memory replacement,” after controlling for the other variables. They do not; the model presented in Table 2 was estimated with a variable for the date of the prewar interview, coded 1 to 67 from Nov. 6 to Jan. 11. Another attempt employed prewar interview date as a dichotomous variable broken at 11 different dates across the time span of the interview process. Next, the same twelve treatments were again tried without the postwar interview date in the model. Prewar interview date never achieved statistical significance.            "
"62","Second, the prewar persuasion hypothesis would be consistent with an aggregate‐level finding that later prewar interviews produced comparatively more pro‐war responses than earlier prewar interviews. The NES data show such a trend, but the correlation between date of interview and prewar preference is very weak; r = 0.049. Also, there were too few NES interviews in the last weeks before the war to allow for a good test; November, December, and the first 11 days of January had 1292, 520, and 59 interviews each, respectively. Postwar interview date was significantly related to reports of prewar preference for war among the prewar peace group, however. Taken together, these interview‐date findings suggest a dynamic that occurred during or after the war, not before it."
"63","Turning to other research, Mueller (1994) and Allen et al. (1994) conducted in‐depth studies of many polls conducted during the prewar era, and found little or no convincing evidence for a prewar hawkish trend (Mueller 1994, 22–36). Mueller concluded that “Generally … poll data on these issues suggest there was no clear trend one way or the other in the willingness of the American public to go to war during the approach to war in the Gulf” (1994, 34). Allen et al. (1994) combine the responses to several different questions (from the University of Connecticut's Roper Center POLL data), calculating general support for war at 51, 48, 48, 50, and 71 percent, respectively, on Nov. 30, Dec. 15, Dec. 30, Jan. 15, and Jan. 30 (259, Figure 1). They find virtually no increase in support for war prior to January 16, the date when the American people were first told of U.S. military activity in Iraq.            "
"64","To what extent do these issues cast doubt on the findings? Let us assume some unmeasured contamination exists, and then test if the variables posited as causing misremembering are significantly causal for the measured component of the contaminant as well. If they are not causal, the memory replacement hypothesis is strengthened. By either the question wording or the prewar persuasion dynamics, the contaminant would be unmeasured prewar hawkishness; the difference in time or the difference in wordings between the prewar and postwar questions permits people who would have wanted to fight on January 15 if they had been interviewed in early January to be mislabeled as prewar doves. Short of a controlled experiment, the best available test is to regress prewar preference on the variables posited as causing misremembering."
"65","The same regression model reported in Table 2 was estimated but prewar preference for military action served as the dependent variable. Neither media exposure nor trust in government was related to prewar preference for fighting (both negatively signed and not significant). The contamination hypotheses predict that both be positively related to prewar support for military action.            "
"66","On the other hand, education was significant and negatively signed. It is of course possible that less educated people were more war‐prone, but not more vulnerable to memory replacement. However, education appeared much less significantly related to prewar fight preference than to the misremembering measure (despite a much smaller sample in the misremembering test), meaning that education may have reduced both war‐proneness and misremembering."
"67","The possibility of either a question wording effect or a prewar persuasion dynamic introduces the possibility that it is unmeasured prewar support for military action, rather than misremembering, that is associated with vote for the incumbent. Again, there is no way to test this notion directly because the only measure for prewar support for military action is one that would be compromised if either of the two contamination dynamics were at work. Nonetheless, including prewar support in place of the misremembering measure in the incumbent vote model reported in Table 4 only bolsters the claim that misremembering was indeed a cause of the vote for the incumbent; prewar support for the War did not approach statistical significance.
