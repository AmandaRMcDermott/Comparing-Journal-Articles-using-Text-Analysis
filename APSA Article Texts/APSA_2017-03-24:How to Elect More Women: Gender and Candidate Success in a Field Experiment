"1","Women are dramatically underrepresented in representative bodies. In the United States, women comprise about 20% of Congress, 24% of state legislators, 12% of governors, and 17% of mayors of large cities.1 Women's underrepresentation is particularly acute in the Republican Party, with the percentage of Republican state legislators in 2013 who are women stagnating at only 16.5%—a rate nearly identical to that of the early 1980s (Carroll and Sanbonmatsu 2013, 68).         "
"2","As norms about equality have shifted, American political party elites have become increasingly concerned about the lack of female politicians in their ranks.2 Internationally, many parties have addressed this by implementing quotas for women (Krook 2009), but these are impractical in some electoral systems and anathema to parties with more conservative ideologies. Hence, it remains an open question whether parties facing these constraints have the ability to take action to increase women's representation in their parties.         "
"3","We argue that party leaders, even party leaders of conservative parties, have effective levers for increasing the number of women in their ranks should they choose to use them. Specifically, party elites can focus on (1) increasing the supply of female candidates through active recruitment and (2) stoking demand for female representatives by emphasizing a norm of equality. Especially when done together, these elite behaviors have the potential to substantially increase women's representation.         "
"4","To test this argument, we ran a field experiment with the cooperation of a state Republican Party in a state with low levels of women's representation. Party leaders were concerned that although women comprised about half of the party activists who attended neighborhood caucus meetings, women typically accounted for only 20–25% of the delegates elected from these meetings to attend the state nominating convention. We randomly assigned over 2,000 precinct chairs to receive one of four letters from the state party chair prior to these neighborhood caucus meetings. The treatments were a neutral placebo control (Control), a request to recruit 2–3 women to run as state delegates (Supply), a request to read a letter at the precinct meeting encouraging attendees to elect more women as delegates (Demand), and a request to both recruit women and read the letter (Supply+Demand)."
"5","We find that messages from party elites had a potent effect on electoral outcomes. While both the Supply and Demand treatments somewhat increased the number of women elected as delegates, the Supply+Demand treatment had the largest and most statistically powerful effect on the number of women elected. The percentage of precincts electing at least one female delegate jumped from 37.5% in the Control condition to 45.4% in the Supply+Demand condition. Further, in precincts assigned to the Control condition, women comprised 24.6% of delegates, whereas under the Supply+Demand condition, women comprised 30.6% of delegates."
"6","These findings are robust to a wide variety of model specifications and suggest that simple encouragement interventions from party leaders may have the ability to increase the number of women in office. A field experiment conducted through party leaders in the context of a real election offers distinct advantages: high levels of realism, meaningful behavioral outcome measures, and solid causal inference. To our knowledge, this is the first field experiment to demonstrate the ability of messages from party leaders to affect gender equality in a meaningful election setting."
"7","We also ran a vignette experiment on a large national sample of validated Republican primary election voters (N = 2,897). As in the field experiment, some respondents were presented with statements from Republican Party officials encouraging them to elect more women (Demand), some saw a slate of candidates with additional female candidates to choose from (Supply), and some saw both (Supply+Demand). Confirming that our field experiment results are not context specific, we find a large and statistically significant effect on respondent vote choice for female candidates in the Supply+Demand condition compared to the control. Active party recruitment of female candidates combined with credible party rhetoric encouraging voters to vote for women can have an important impact on women's representation."
"8","Understanding why there are so few women in office requires thinking about both the supply of female candidates and demand for women on the ballot. While each of these likely influences women's representation, it is also possible that the combination of the two is especially powerful.         "
"9","The first factor that influences the supply of female candidates on the ballot is how many women want to run for office. Most studies find significantly lower levels of political ambition among women than among men. Explanations include women's family obligations (Fulton et al. 2006; Sapiro 1982), gender role socialization (Clark, Hadley, and Darcy 1989), differences in qualifications and perceptions of qualifications (Crowder‐Meyer and Lauderdale 2014; Fox and Lawless 2004, 2005, 2010; Preece 2016), differences in party support and perceptions of party support (Fox and Lawless 2004, 2010, 2011; Fulton et al. 2006; Lawless and Fox 2010; Sanbonmatsu 2006a, 2006b), and competition aversion (Kanthak and Woon 2015; Preece and Stoddard 2015a).            "
"10","Interestingly, current research on women's lower levels of political ambition suggests it may actually be endogenous to gendered patterns in political party recruitment. Recruitment is an important aspect of the candidate emergence process in American politics (Broockman 2014; Fox and Lawless 2010; Maestas et al. 2006); however, women are much less likely to be recruited than men (Crowder‐Meyer 2013; Fox and Lawless 2010; Lawless and Fox 2010; Niven 1998; Preece and Stoddard 2015b; Sanbonmatsu 2006a, 2006b). The recruitment gender gap is particularly important because women tend to make decisions about running for office through a “relationally embedded” process where decisions are sensitive to social cues and relationships, rather than one based on spontaneous political ambition (Carroll and Sanbonmatsu 2013). So although women do appear to be less responsive to recruitment than men, recruited women are more likely to express political ambition than unrecruited women (Preece, Stoddard, and Fisher 2016).            "
"11","Hence, increased political party efforts to recruit women are likely to play an important role in increasing women's representation. All of this leads us to expect that an experimental intervention focused on recruiting women to run for office should increase the number of women elected to these positions."
"12","Voters’ willingness to support female candidates has significantly increased over the last few decades, though Republicans are significantly less likely to favor gender parity in government than Democrats (Dolan and Sanbonmatsu 2009), and implicit gender attitudes toward female leadership remain (Mo 2015). For example, because voters tend to believe that male‐stereotyped characteristics are more important than female‐stereotyped characteristics in politics, these stereotypes often hurt voters’ perceptions of female candidates (Brown, Heighberger, and Shocket 1993; Fox and Smith 1998; Huddy and Terkildsen 1993; Lawless 2004). Likewise, policy stereotypes, such as whether men or women are better at handling the economy or national security, may harm women (Dolan 2010; Lawless 2004).3"
"13","Given these stereotypes, Republican female candidates face a unique set of electoral challenges (Dolan and Lynch 2014). Because they are perceived to be more liberal than male Republican candidates, they may be more appealing to the median general election voter (King and Matland 2003). However, this stereotype actually hurts them among fellow Republicans (King and Matland 2003; Koch 2002; Sanbonmatsu and Dolan 2009). This issue of “party fit” plays a significant role in explaining why there are so few Republican women in office (Thomsen 2014, 2015).            "
"14","Is there anything the party can do about this? Little research examines whether parties have the ability to influence voters’ demand for female candidates. Yet, we know that partisans—especially well‐informed partisans—pay close attention to ideological cues from party elites (Zaller 1992). Party elites are “knowledgeable and trustworthy” sources who are likely to be persuasive among their followers (Lupia and McCubbins 1998, 201). Because of this dynamic, Republican elites’ decisions to distance the party from the women's rights movement may have created a party culture that helps to explain why Republican women's representation actually peaked in the late 1990s (Carroll and Sanbonmatsu 2013; Elder 2012, 2014; Layman 2001; Leege et al. 2002; Wolbrecht 2000, 2002).            "
"15","Hence, if Republican elites sent a clear message to partisans that women's representation was a priority for the party, perhaps they would follow their lead.4 The mechanism for the relationship between messages of party leaders and caucus voting behavior is norms or expectations about the role of women in politics. Politics is still seen by many as a “man's game” (Burns, Schlozman, and Verba 2001), and this gendered expectation may be especially strong among Republicans, given the party's history of ambivalence toward the women's movement. When trusted Republican Party leaders send a clear, persuasive message that women's voices are welcome and needed, we expect that partisans will follow the cue that voting for women is consistent with the party's values. Credible statements from party leaders in support of women's representation set a norm that can influence voters.            "
"16","We worked with the state Republican Party in a Republican‐dominated state with low levels of women's representation to see how party attempts to exogenously shock the supply of and demand for female candidates affect women's representation. The state is one of the 29 states in which women comprise less than 20% of Republican state legislators in 2014."
"17","The experimental setting was the party's caucus meetings, in which neighborhood precincts elect delegates to the state party nominating convention. Despite the fact that men and women attend the caucus meetings in approximately equal numbers, women have been dramatically underrepresented at the party convention, generally comprising only about 20–25% of the elected delegates. Hence, our interventions were designed to increase the number of women elected to be delegates to the state nominating convention, the most important and contested position elected at the caucus meeting."
"18","Prior to the caucus meetings in March 2014, we received a list of the precinct chairs from the state Republican Party. Precinct chairs lead the neighborhood caucus meetings, so the list allowed us to communicate directly with the person responsible for organizing and conducting each meeting. The experiment is a 2×2 factorial design in which party precinct chairs were randomly assigned to receive one of four letters printed on the party's letterhead and signed by the state party chair. The full text of the letters for each condition is available in Supporting Information Appendix B.            "
"19","Our experiment falls into the category of an encouragement design (Gerber and Green 2000, 2012). Because of the challenges that typically come from two‐sided noncompliance in encouragement designs, we have chosen to focus our analysis on the conservative “intent‐to‐treat” analysis (Gerber and Green 2012, 173–205).5 Furthermore, our intervention is encouraging precinct chairs to perform tasks, whereas our outcome measures depend on the behavior of all precinct caucus attendees, most of whom were not directly treated. This situates the study between traditional experimental studies of mass behavior and newer experimental studies of elites and institutions (Grose 2014; Loewen, Rubenson, and Wantchekon 2010). Hence, this experiment is best thought of as an examination of the downstream mass effects of encouraging party elites to take action (Gerber and Green 2012, 193–205).         "
"20","Mailed letters were the most inclusive way to contact all precinct chairs. Unfortunately, the party's list of mailing addresses was incomplete, and some addresses were outdated or otherwise incorrect. Of the 2,156 precincts in the state, we were able to send letters to 1,842 precincts. Precincts with working mailing addresses were evenly distributed across the experimental conditions (see Supporting Information Table A1 for details). As a more formal randomization check, we also compared the characteristics of the precincts across the conditions using a variety of tests, including Wilcoxon‐Mann‐Withey, two‐sample difference‐of‐means, Kolmogorov‐Smirnov, and equality of medians.6 Across all four tests, the results were strongly consistent with an effective randomization procedure (Supporting Information Table A2).         "
"21","Because we could not directly attend and observe all precinct meetings, let alone observe the efforts of precinct chairs to recruit female candidates prior to the meeting, self‐reports of the precinct chairs, assessed with a post‐caucus survey, are our best available measure of compliance.7 Between email and mail invitations, 1,901 precinct chairs were sent at least one invitation, 613 accessed the survey, and 604 precinct chairs completed the full survey, for a 32% response rate.8"
"22","Table 1 highlights self‐reported compliance among the 400 survey respondents who remembered receiving a letter from the precinct chair prior to caucus night, as well as the same compliance results for all respondents to the survey.9 In each condition, the patterns are much as we anticipated. For each action—recruiting women or reading the paragraph encouraging caucus attendees to elect women or both—compliance levels are highest in the experimental conditions that correspond to those actions.         "
"23","The results also show some spillover across conditions, as is often the case in encouragement designs. For example, nearly 44% of respondents in the Demand condition told us that they also recruited female candidates, significantly more than in the Control condition. It is difficult to determine whether these spillover findings are the result of social desirability reporting, an overzealous interpretation of the instructions from the party, or actual spillover in which precinct chairs discussed the letters’ contents with each other. Several factors suggest it is not the latter: The timing and mode of delivery minimized the chances of actual spillover,10 and neither we nor the party received any communication that indicated that chairs had seen conflicting letters. Hence, we believe that most of the reported spillover is either because of social desirability or overzealous interpretations of the instructions.         "
"24","Furthermore, if the spillover is genuine, it would also muddy the distinction between our treatments and therefore make it more difficult to see treatment effects. This gives us confidence that we can trust the true treatment effects to be at least as large as we estimate. Finally, our replication survey experiment below has no spillover potential, giving us a clean estimate of very similar treatment effects."
"25","We focus on two dependent variables: (1) the proportion of precincts in each condition that elected at least one woman to be a state delegate and (2) the proportion of state delegates in each condition who are women. The first is important because the majority of precincts in this sample do not elect any women; Figure 1 shows that, while attendees are somewhat normally distributed between men and women, the modal outcome is electing zero female delegates. The second dependent variable is a more traditional measure of women's representation.         "
"26","Distributions of the Proportion of Women Who Are Caucus Attendees and Proportion of Women Elected as State Delegates"
"27","Note: Distributions are for Control condition only.                     "
"28","Because most precincts elected more than one state delegate and the modal precinct elected no women at all, we begin with the question of whether any of the elected delegates were women.11 In the analysis that follows, we compare each of the three treatment conditions (Supply, Demand, and Supply+Demand) to the control.12 This approach is appropriate because the Supply+Demand condition is unique in its request that the precinct chair take two actions and may bestow greater intensity or urgency from the state party about this issue such that the two treatments together exert an especially powerful effect.            "
"29","Figure 2 offers a graphical representation of this comparison for the raw experimental results without any controls or other statistical adjustments. Error bars in the figure represent the 95% confidence interval, and the spikes allow viewers to easily compare across conditions and determine whether the differences between the point estimates are statistically significant at roughly the 95% confidence level.13 When compared to the Control condition, the Supply and Demand conditions alone each fall short of standard levels of statistical significance. However, the Supply+Demand condition statistically significantly reduced the proportion of precincts that did not elect any women.14 In the Control condition, only 37.5% of precincts elected at least one woman; this increased to 45.4% in the Supply+Demand condition.            "

"32","Lines represent 95% confidence intervals. Spikes represent 83% confidence intervals."
"33","Table 2 offers a formal test of the intent‐to‐treat effects of the treatments. Because the excluded category in the regression models is the Control condition, the coefficients for the other treatments show the difference from the control.15 All treatments have a positive coefficient, but only the Supply+Demand precincts saw a statistically robust change.            "
"34","These results are sharpened by the inclusion of control variables, such as the number of delegate positions available (which varied with the size of the precinct and its tendency to vote Republican in previous elections), the average age of caucus participants who attended the meeting, the size of the meeting, and the distance between the precinct and the convention site (Silbermann 2015). Including the control variables reveals that women were more likely to be elected when a greater proportion of those at the meeting were women, but the experimental treatments exerted a positive effect on women's representation independent of that relationship.16 Across all conditions, attendance at meetings came close to gender balance: About 45% of participants at the neighborhood gatherings were women, and the proportion of women among participants was roughly normally distributed (see Figure 1 and Supporting Information Figure A1). These patterns also reassure us that the failure to elect women was not merely the result of women being underrepresented at the meetings. Further, the effects of the experimental conditions—especially the Supply+Demand treatment—persist even when we add an additional control for the precinct's 2012 proportion of female delegates (see Supporting Information Table A7).17 In other words, even after accounting for women's previous electoral success in the precinct, the Demand treatment and Supply+Demand treatment had a substantial effect on whether the precinct elected at least one woman in 2014.18"
"35","Table 3 shows the intent‐to‐treat results for the overall proportion of the precinct's state delegates who are women, comparing each of the treatments to the control. Because the dependent variable is highly right‐skewed (most precincts elected no women at all) and because proportions are constrained by definition between 0 and 1, we model the relationships with both ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and fractional logit, which is a generalized linear model with a binomial family and logit link. The key substantive results are nearly identical no matter which modeling strategy we employ, whether OLS, fractional logit, zero‐one inflated beta, or tobit.            "
"36","In the figure that follows, we use fractional logit models to avoid the problem of predicted values falling outside the range of the dependent variable. The results in Table 3 show that while both the Supply and the Demand conditions have positive coefficients, neither achieves statistical significance. However, the Supply+Demand condition does. Model 1, which reports the raw treatment effect sizes, indicates that it increased the proportion of women elected from 24.6% in the Control condition to 30.6% in the Supply+Demand condition. Model 2 includes controls for precinct characteristics and estimates the effect size to be 5.7 percentage points.            "
"37","Because fractional logit coefficients are difficult to interpret, Figure 3 shows the predicted values for the proportion of state delegates who are women based on Model 4.19 In the Control condition, women comprise less than 24% of state delegates, but that number rises to close to 30% in the Supply+Demand condition, a difference that is significant at p < .01.20 In Model 4, the estimated proportion of women in the Supply+Demand condition is also larger than the proportion in the Supply condition alone (p = .02). Finally, the estimated value of the Supply+Demand condition is greater than that of the Demand condition alone, but the difference in the estimated values falls short of significance.21 As with the previous dependent variable, these results are robust to the inclusion of controls for women's electoral success in the precinct in 2012 (see Supporting Information Table A9) and to conditioning on those precincts for which a letter was actually sent (see Supporting Information Table A10).            "
"38","Estimated Proportion of State Delegates Who Are Women, by Condition"
"39","Note: Predicted values are from Model 4 in Table 3, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.                        "
"40","Lines represent 95% confidence intervals. Spikes represent 83% confidence intervals."
"41","The size of the treatment effects, relative to the control, is quite large—in field experiments on voter turnout, for example, an intent‐to‐treat effect of 5–10 percentage points is considered very large. In this case, the downstream mass effects of encouraging party elites to take actions that favor women result in a 5–10 percentage point change in the gender balance of the state's Republican convention. The substantive significance of this change is more powerfully understood in raw numbers. If all precincts had been assigned to the Control condition, our analysis predicts that about 920 of the 3,839 delegates would have been women, a proportion consistent with recent state conventions. In contrast, if all precincts had been assigned to the Supply+Demand condition, over 1,150 of the delegates would have been women—an increase of 230 women attending the convention and 25% more than the 920 that would have attended without any intervention. Our experiment suggests that a simple intervention in a single state can bring hundreds of women into the formal political party structure and its associated informal networks."
"42","Finally, we also explored the effects on the overall proportion of women elected when disaggregating by a pretreatment variable: the gender of the precinct chair (elected 2 years prior) to whom the letter was sent. Table 4 shows that the effect of the Supply+Demand treatment was concentrated in precincts with a male precinct chair (see Supporting Information Table A11 for analysis with additional controls). This result is partly because the problem of women's underrepresentation is greatest in those precincts.22 Precincts with a female chair were far less likely to elect an all‐male slate of state delegates, and those precincts may have been distinct in other ways as well. Our experiment is not designed to isolate the cause of this particular difference. It might occur because the encouragement to vote for more women is especially efficacious when given by a male authority figure or because the problem of underrepresentation of women seems less acute when the encouragement is delivered by a female precinct chair, or some combination of these and other related factors.            "
"43","Our focus so far has been the treatments’ downstream effects on women's descriptive representation at the state party convention. This is the dependent variable that matters for party leaders’ ability to remedy substantial gender imbalances. However, our theory holds that these changes hinged on two mechanisms: an increase in the number of women running (supply) and a change in precinct‐level norms about women's participation in the nominating process (demand). If our theoretical approach is correct, we should be able to see evidence of these mechanisms at work."
"44","Our evidence for the relationship between the experimental treatments and the precinct‐level norms is drawn from two sources: (1) the 2014 Survey of Precinct Chairs and (2) a subsample of 145 precincts to which we sent trained observers."
"45","In our survey, we asked the chairs about their attitudes toward women's participation in politics, including whether “more women are needed” as delegates to the state convention.23 If our theory about norm setting is correct, we should see different reported attitudes about the role of women among those who received the Demand message. Consistent with that theory, precinct chairs in both the Demand and the Supply+Demand conditions expressed somewhat greater agreement with the idea that women should have increased presence at the convention, whereas precinct chairs in the Supply condition were no different from the Control condition (see Supporting Information Table A12 for details). This effect is concentrated among male precinct chairs: They were moved by the party message, whereas female precinct chairs were not affected. A difference‐of‐means test comparing the effect of the Demand treatment in all the conditions that received it (Demand and Supply+Demand) to the conditions that did not include the Demand message (Supply and Control) shows that the effect is modest but robust.24 Male precinct chairs who were asked to read a paragraph encouraging caucusgoers to elect more women had, on average, attitudes that were about .22 points friendlier to women on the 5‐point response scale (3.36, compared to 3.14) than precinct chairs who were not randomly assigned to a condition with the Demand treatment (t = 2.75, p < .01). This represents a difference of about 4.4% of the full span of the dependent variable.            "
"46","These data are limited because they are only self‐reports from the subset of precinct chairs who responded to the survey, not measures of attitudes among caucus attendees more generally. Nonetheless, the differences are consistent with the belief that persuasive messages from party elites can affect norms for women's role in politics. Even if the difference is entirely attributed to social desirability, it would indicate some shift in norms. In addition, the change persisted for several weeks after the meeting until the survey of precinct chairs was fielded. That our one‐time treatment had any discernible effect at all several weeks after the conclusion of the caucus meetings is worthy of note."
"47","The precinct chair survey data are also supplemented by one additional piece of evidence. If norms about the importance of women's voices being heard are changed as a result of our experimental treatment, we might also expect that the women who stand for election as delegates will be more assertive and talkative during the meeting (Karpowitz and Mendelberg 2014). One way of measuring women's greater assertiveness is to examine the proportion of female candidates who gave speeches urging others to vote for them. At the caucus meeting, all candidates for office are given an opportunity to make a short speech about why they should be elected to the state convention, though not all candidates choose to speak up. We sent trained student observers who were blind to the purposes of the study to a small sample (n = 145) of the precinct meetings. We asked the observers to keep systematic notes about the proceedings and the candidates who ran for office, including which candidates gave speeches and which did not. This sample is not fully representative of the state; instead, it includes precincts within a reasonable driving distance of the students’ campuses.25 Nonetheless, we randomly sampled accessible precincts from each experimental condition, and the data from the student observers are the best precinct‐level record we have of the speeches and the gender of candidates.            "
"48","In precincts assigned to read the Demand paragraph (Demand and Supply+Demand conditions), women candidates spoke more often. Not only were a greater proportion of the precinct's speeches given by women (31%, as compared to 23%, t = 1.73, p = .09, two‐tailed precinct‐level difference‐of‐means test), but also a greater proportion of female candidates spoke. There is no comparable effect for the Supply treatment. Overall, nearly 90% of female candidates gave speeches in precincts where the chair was asked to read the Demand paragraph, compared to 78% of candidates in precincts that were not assigned to the Demand appeal (t = 1.68, p = .09). These results are only an indirect measure from a limited sample of precincts, but they are consistent with our theory that elite messages can change expectations about women's empowerment and active participation."
"49","To support the other side of our theory, we need evidence that the Supply treatment had an effect on the number of women who stood for election. Based on the data in our precinct chair survey, about 57% of precinct chairs in the conditions that included the Supply treatment told us that they recruited at least one woman to run, as opposed to only 29% in the remaining conditions (z = 5.56, p < .01, two‐tailed difference‐of‐proportions test). If those results are more than mere reporting bias, then we should see evidence in the actual number of women running. Unfortunately, the state party does not collect any information on the candidates who stand for election in each precinct; their formal reporting process includes only the identity of the electoral winners. For that reason, we turn again to our student observer data."
"50","Regression analysis shows that even in our limited sample, the experimental conditions in which chairs were asked to recruit women (Supply and Supply+Demand) had more female candidates, an effect that is marginally significant (see Supporting Information Table A13 for details). How big is the treatment effect? In the conditions without recruitment appeals, on average approximately one woman ran for state delegate in each precinct. In precincts randomly assigned to a recruitment condition, that number rises to 1.34—an increase of about 30%. That increase is slightly larger (about 36%) when controls for the size of the caucus meeting are included in the analysis. If we limit the analysis to the small number of precincts where we know from our survey that the chair received the letter prior to the caucus meeting (Model 5 of Table A13), the effect is much larger still—a predicted increase of about 141%, with the estimated number of women running changing from fewer than 1 to nearly 2 (0.77 to 1.86; p = .01). These results should be interpreted with caution because we have neither a random sample of observed precincts nor full‐compliance information for that sample, and many other factors also shape any candidate's choice to run for office. Nonetheless, all of these results converge on the same basic conclusion: When the precinct chair was encouraged by party leaders to increase the supply of female candidates, more women did, in fact, run."
"51","Our field experiment reveals a robust relationship between political party intervention and women's representation, but like any research design, it also has limitations. First, it takes place in one state and focuses on internal political party offices, which could potentially limit generalizability. Second, it is difficult to untangle whether the Supply+Demand treatment was especially effective because of the content of the treatments or because asking party chairs to do two tasks signaled extra seriousness from the party. And finally, spillovers and two‐sided noncompliance potentially pose problems for causal inference."
"52","We conducted a replication study to address these limitations and test the robustness of our field experimental findings. We designed a vignette experiment fielded by YouGov with a national sample of Republican primary election voters (N = 2,897) in the 30 states for which validated primary vote data and party registration data were available.26 We block randomized by respondent gender and by whether the respondent was from a state above or below average in female representation among Republican state legislators.27"
"53","As in the field experiment, respondents were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: Control, Supply, Demand, and Supply+Demand. In the Control condition, respondents chose from four hypothetical candidates in a primary election for a state legislative seat in their state—three men and one woman. Figure 4 shows a screenshot of the Control condition vignette. In addition to candidate names, which indicate the gender of the candidate, we also included a number of other traits to mimic the kinds of information that a voter might find in a voter guide. These traits included age, occupation, political experience, and a short personal statement that reflected the candidate's ideology. Existing research suggests that gender becomes less relevant when voters have other information about candidates (Hayes 2011); thus, this is a hard test for our hypothesis.         "
"54","The information in the candidate profiles was independently randomized on the following five dimensions: first name, last name + age + occupation,28 political experience, personal statement, and order of profile appearance. Independently randomizing the characteristics allows us to isolate the causal effects of our experimental treatments and reassures us that those effects are not the result of any particular characteristic or the order in which the profiles appeared.         "
"55","In the Demand condition, prior to making their choice, respondents were presented text from the Republican National Committee's Growth and Opportunities Project report that encouraged Republican voters to elect more women, as well as excerpts from the letter that was sent with the field experiment (see Supporting Information Figure A3 for the full text). In the Supply condition, respondents chose between five (instead of four) hypothetical candidates—three men and two women instead of three men and one woman. This additional woman is to simulate the result of active party recruitment of female candidates. In the Supply+Demand condition, respondents both saw the text from Republican leaders encouraging voters to elect more women and saw two (rather than one) female candidates on the ballot."
"56","Our outcome of interest is whether the respondent chose a female candidate. In Figure 5, we present the percentage of respondents who chose a female candidate (predicted from Supporting Information Table A14) as an increase (or a decrease) over the percentage of respondents who would have chosen a female candidate if candidates were chosen at random. This approach allows us to directly compare the size of the effect across treatments. In the Control and Demand conditions, the baseline of random choice is 25% because there was one woman out of four candidates; in the Supply and Supply+Demand conditions, the baseline is 40% because two out of the five candidates were women.

"60","Figure 5 indicates that in the Control condition, respondents chose the female candidate as if at random. This finding lends support to previous research suggesting that, by and large, voters do not discriminate against women on the ballot, especially when they have other information to guide their choices. Figure 5 also indicates that having additional women on the ballot (Supply) increased the chance that a woman is elected, but only because there were more women on the ballot; voters continued to select candidates essentially as if at random.         "
"61","However, when Republican voters were urged to support female candidates by credible party sources (Demand), female candidates did nearly 4 percentage points better than the baseline comparison point. This is a significant finding—simply by emphasizing the importance of women's voices in the party, Republican leaders are able to shape Republican voters’ preferences for state legislative candidates. More importantly, the Supply+Demand condition had an enormous influence on respondents’ vote choices. In this condition, voters were about 11 percentage points more likely to choose a female candidate. Thus, party leaders’ encouragement to vote for women influences vote choice, but leaders’ interventions paired with more female candidates on the ballot for voters to choose from are especially effective."
"62","This experiment clearly replicates our findings from the field and provides reassurance that those results are likely genuine for at least three reasons. First, while the field experiment suffers from some generalizability limitations, the vignette experiment takes advantage of a large national sample of Republicans and studies a different political office. Second, in the field experiment, we were unable to differentiate why Supply+Demand was so effective, but because respondents in the vignette experiment were not aware that they experienced two interventions, we can conclude that there is, in fact, something jointly important about the two interventions. Finally, the field experiment may have had two‐sided noncompliance issues, but the controlled nature of the vignette experiment prevented spillover between conditions. In short, we are now more confident that, on their own, increasing the supply of female candidates or encouraging voters to elect women may have a marginally positive effect on women's representation. But, together, these kinds of interventions have a significant effect on the number of women who get elected."
"63","Our experimental interventions targeted two potential reasons for the underrepresentation of women in politics: the supply of female candidates and voter demand for female representatives. Both mechanisms have been studied at length in the existing literature, but they are generally framed as competing explanations for women's underrepresentation. One of the important theoretical contributions of this article is to show that they should be studied together: Results from the field and vignette experiments reveal that addressing both at the same time is an especially powerful way of increasing the number of women in office."
"64","Though there are limits to the strategy of working with partner organizations, our research design also provides one model for how to ethically study elections with field experiments. Humphreys (2011, 2014) argues that field experimentation raises concerns when researchers are “taking actions that may have major, direct, and possibly adverse effects on the lives of others” (Humphreys 2011, 23). Obtaining prior consent of precinct chairs would have compromised the internal validity of the experiment, but full partnership and approval of the state party officials who have control over the caucus process, along with the fact that the actions were only requested, not required, reduce these concerns.29 Using an encouragement design probably weakened the treatment effects, but beyond preserving the autonomy of precinct chairs, the treatments reflect realism about what party officials are actually prepared to do.         "
"65","Conducting ethical field experiments requires researchers to weigh potential harm against net benefits. The treatment objective to elect more Republican women did not promote any overt ideological objective, and any harm to individual male candidates should be seen in light of larger benefits. The goal of electing more women as convention delegates was seen by party officials as extremely desirable and beneficial for the state party, and a more representative outcome is also viewed favorably by society in general. Finally, it is also important to factor in the harm that results from women's stark underrepresentation in the absence of any intervention. Women disproportionally bear the costs of failure to intervene. In the end, the confluence of the party's own desire to increase women's representation and its willingness to cooperate with researchers resulted in a study that served party needs, respected participants’ autonomy, minimized harm, maximized benefit, and thus provided an opportunity for ethical field experimentation.30"
"66","Ultimately, the field and survey experiments together are most important for their practical implications. While there have been a handful of field experiments on political party recruitment and a number of survey experiments on vote choice, our field experiment is the first to actually increase the number of women elected to meaningful political offices. Our results show that quotas, which face practical and ideological barriers in the United States, are not the only way to increase women's representation. Although our interventions were mild—a single letter sent to precinct chairs with a request from the state party chair or exposing voters to statements from party leaders—we saw significant increases in women's representation."
"67","Our experiments focused on the American context in which gender disparities are the most pronounced: the Republican Party. The Democratic Party has seen steady increases in the percentage of women elected—women now make up about a third of Democratic state legislators and members of Congress. However, women's representation among Republican state legislators and members of Congress has hardly increased in the past 30 years (Carroll and Sanbonmatsu 2013, 68; Thomsen 2015). Republicans thus present the biggest challenge to increasing women's representation. By taking simple steps to encourage local recruitment efforts and emphasize that women's representation is important, party leaders who dislike quota‐based solutions can still produce change. The remaining question is whether Republican Party leaders across the country will make taking these steps a priority.         "
