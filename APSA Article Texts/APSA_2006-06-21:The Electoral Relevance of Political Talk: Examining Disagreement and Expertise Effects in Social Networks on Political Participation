"1","Earlier research shows that large and politicized social networks are correlated with higher levels of political action (Kenny 1992; Knoke 1990; Lake and Huckfeldt 1998; Leighley 1990; McClurg 2003), frequently producing substantial effects on participatory behavior. For instance, McClurg (2003, 459) finds that increasing the level of political discussion from “never” to “most times” in a discussion dyad increases the expected level of participation by nearly an entire political act among college graduates. Kenny (1992) shows that having a politically active discussant increases the probability of voting by 20%, of working in a campaign by nearly 80%, and all other activities by approximately 40%. Using an innovative quasi‐experiment, Klofstad (2005) demonstrates that high levels of peer political discussion increases rates of civic and political participation by 13%.         "
"2","What explains these results? What factors operate within large, politicized networks that make participation more likely?1 To date, the main treatments of these questions focus on what I label the political composition of networks. The basic argument is that the impact of a network on a person's participation depends on how much agreement, or support, she experiences when talking to her network discussants. If her family and friends share her political preferences she is likely to participate; if they disagree with her political views, she is unlikely to be involved.         "
"3","Along these lines, the evidence demonstrates that people in cross‐cutting networks, defined as “social interactions that cross lines of political difference” (Mutz 2002a, 840), are less likely to participate. The main explanation for this is that political disagreement helps people learn about (Barabas 2004; Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004; Mutz 2002b; Price, Cappella, and Nir 2002) and become more tolerant of (Mutz 2002b) opposing political views, consequently increasing ambivalence and uncertainty in their own beliefs (Mutz 2002a). Additionally, cross‐cutting discussion stimulates conflict‐avoidant predispositions held by some people, making them withdraw from active political participation (Mutz 2002a; Ulbig and Funk 1999). In short, this evidence shows that disagreement in networks undercuts the attitudinal foundations of involvement.         "
"4","A similar set of conclusions can be gleaned from other research on how social groups influence involvement. For example, Putnam distinguishes between two distinct types of social capital. The first—bridging social capital—overlaps with the idea of cross‐cutting networks and is important because it exposes people to new information. In contrast, “bonding social capital is good for undergirding specific reciprocity and mobilizing solidarity,” (2000, 23) an effect achieved by promoting ingroup identities that create incentives for participation.2 The implication of Putnam's argument is that people who are not exposed to bonding social capital, ground in mutual support and agreement, are unlikely to be involved. Again, the emphasis remains on similarity and support as a condition for maintaining involvement.         "
"5","Though this evidence shows that the political composition of the network is important, it would be misleading to assume that this provides a complete explanation of how networks influence participation.3 The problem stems not from the argument that network composition is important, but from the failure to consider other factors in depth. The clearest demonstration of why this is the case is that network composition cannot account for all the available evidence on the relationship between networks, composition, and participation. This is because larger, politicized networks are an empirical correlate of both political participation and the likelihood of encountering political disagreement (Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004, 2002; but see Mutz and Martin 2001).4 In other words, the very networks most likely to create opportunities for cross‐cutting discussions are also those that most likely foster involvement. Such a conundrum cannot be explained by the distribution of preference in networks, indicating that we must broaden the theoretical link between networks and participation.         "
"6","Moreover, an explicit focus on the political composition of networks has specific normative implications about the social foundations of democratic citizenship. This is because it implies that consideration of others' views is the hallmark of reasoned, or “ enlightened,” thinking (Barabas 2004, 687–88), but that it is also the bane of involvement. From such a perspective, networks are a mixed bag for democracy, either encouraging “ enlightenment” or involvement but never both. To the extent other elements of social communication either encourage participation or counter the attitudinal consequences of cross‐cutting talk, such a conclusion could be misleading. This means that it is quite possible that in some circumstances, for instance, networks can promote both“enlightenment”and participation.         "
"7","To understand the role of social networks in American politics, then, we should explore how they influence participation more deeply. If cross‐cutting ties are not the only important participatory stimulus in social networks, what else relates networks to electoral action? How important are these factors for explaining involvement relative to disagreement? What does this imply about the impact of networks on democratic citizenship more broadly? To address these questions, the next section elaborates a model of social network influence that identifies another factor connecting networks to participation—the quality of political discussion."
"8","The effect of a social network on political behavior depends on how it structures the interpersonal exchange of political information. Since people possess limited political resources and have little incentive to gather more (Downs 1957; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995), they frequently do not pay the full costs associated with political action unless they can supplement their personal resources. By providing people with a shortcut to a particularly important resource—political information—interpersonal networks help circumvent these individual limitations (McClurg 2003). What type of information other than political support and disagreement can people glean from their social networks?         "
"9","I argue that a prime candidate is the social supply of expertise, conceptualized as the political sophistication of discussants in social networks (Lake and Huckfeldt 1998). All things being equal, people in networks high in expertise can access larger quantities of political information that is higher in quality (Huckfeldt 2001). In elections, the things people need to know in order to participate range from the personal (e.g., the relevance of the election to the individual, how the individual's politics fit with those of the candidates) to the contextual (e.g., how the candidates differ, what issues are important) to the practical (e.g., how to volunteer, what volunteering entails). People high in political knowledge are more likely to have answers to these questions than those with less knowledge (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996). If people use social networks as shortcuts for gathering political information (Huckfeldt 2001; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995), they are more likely to find useful and helpful answers when they have knowledgeable informants.         "
"10","Additionally, politically expert networks create incentives, opportunities, and pressures that encourage people to make politics a larger part of their identity. Walsh's (2004) comparison of a relatively apolitical women's guild and quasi‐political coffee klatch demonstrates the importance of such social expectations. For the women's guild, politics was an infrequent topic of conversation among the women, and there was no expectation that it should be relevant to their lives. In contrast, public affairs were a regular subject among the coffee shop patrons and, as a consequence, the group members more consistently recognized the importance of politics as part of their identity. To the extent that political experts are more attentive to and involved in politics (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996, 225), having expert discussants increases exposure to norms of political involvement (Kenny 1992). In this way, the capacity for a network to increase the relevance of politics to a person's life is strongly connected to the quality of the information to which people are exposed.5"
"11","While these possibilities have been indirectly considered in previous research (Lake and Huckfeldt 1998), there is a third reason why network expertise influences participation that has direct implications for previous research on compositional effects. Simply stated, sophisticated political networks provide environments that support clearer and more contextualized communication of political information, which establishes a more secure attitudinal foundation for involvement. Political expertise is an important factor for recognizing dissonant information, rejecting it, and subsequently minimizing ambivalence. This is because, as Zaller (1992) notes, people who are politically aware pick up on important cueing information, which he defines as “‘contextual information’ about the ideological or partisan implications of a persuasive message.” They are important because “…they enable citizens to perceive relationships between the persuasive messages they receive and their political predispositions, which in turn permits them to respond critically to the persuasive messages” (1992, 42).         "
"12","Just as politically expert individuals better understand the relevance of persuasive messages for their own predispositions, so are they likely (on average) to communicate those messages with greater clarity and context (i.e., descriptions of their relevance) than nonexperts. Expert discussants are useful to their peers because they add clarity to information exchanges in networks, thereby helping people connect that information to their predispositions. Therefore, people who talk politics with political experts are in a better position to identify, reject, and understand the relevance of dissonant political information exchanged in their networks. The primary consequence of this process should be to reduce ambivalence about and increase confidence in their political views."
"13","This final observation is important to single out. Because networks serve as information shortcuts, people who rely on them are unlikely to become political sophisticates themselves.6 The virtue of information shortcuts is that they allow people to reach seemingly competent political decisions without searching for political information. However, those decisions are not necessarily equal to those reached by people who do possess adequate amounts of political information because their usefulness depends upon the decision‐making context (Lau and Redlawsk 2001; Sniderman 2000). For example, research in political psychology demonstrates that the cognitive shortcuts people employ in politics often fail to help people develop opinions and attitudes that are similar to what they would possess if they were themselves experts (Bartels 1996; Kuklinski and Quirk 2000; Kuklinski et al. 2001). The argument laid out here implies that social shortcuts may not suffer to the same degree from this shortcoming because expert networks are not just an information substitute, but a condensed information source that also provides signals for how that information is relevant to underlying predispositions.7"
"14","Before moving to a discussion of the data, one clarification is in order. The model implies that people should be more likely to recognize the dissonant information provided by politically expert peers, potentially creating a situation in which disagreement has a larger effect for people with sophisticated discussants. This is not necessarily the case. Since expert discussants are assumed to provide more cueing information when they disagree with their peers, the model implies that their peers should be in a better position to recognize the information as dissonant and therefore likely to reject it. Consequently, I argue that cross‐cutting talk still diminishes the likelihood of participation when people receive and accept disagreeable messages, but that knowledgeable discussants make acceptance less likely.8"
"15","To investigate the effect of expertise in social networks on political participation, I use data from a survey administered during the 1996 presidential election that was specifically designed to investigate processes of social influence within two midwestern communities (Huckfeldt and Sprague 2000). Survey respondents were randomly selected from lists of registered voters in the Indianapolis and St. Louis metropolitan areas (2,612 interviews). There were two preelection and two postelection survey waves, each administered as a rolling cross section. Since the first preelection wave was administered very early in the election cycle (March 3–July 14, 1996) and the second postelection wave went into the field about a year after the election (October 17–December 12, 1997), analyses in this article are limited to respondents interviewed in the second and third waves (1,562 interviews). These waves were in the field July 1–November 4, 1996, and November 5, 1996–January 12, 1997, respectively. Although using a regional study limits the external validity of the investigation, these data include measures of key sociological concepts that are not often found in national sample surveys. In the remainder of this section, I discuss the measurement of both the dependent variable and the important network variables.9"
"16","Electoral Involvement The dependent variable is based on survey questions that asked respondents whether they participated in each of the following political activities: working on a campaign, attending meetings or other campaign events, putting up a yard sign, or donating money to a candidate or campaign.10 Following the path of earlier studies (Lake and Huckfeldt 1998; McClurg 2003), I combine these into an index of political activity that ranges from zero to four.            "
"17","This measure has some limitations. First, participation in these activities is a relatively rare occurrence. The average number of activities for the sample is .45. Only 17% of the sample engages in the most frequent form of political activity (donating money to a candidate or campaign) and less than 30% of the sample engaged in any activity. Second, it restricts analysis to electoral activity even though social networks may be at least as, and potentially more, important for other forms of political action, such as protests, violent acts of political expression, or even issue activism.11 Nevertheless, these participants are worthy of analysis since they play a particularly important role in elections and have a somewhat exaggerated impact on political processes because of their unique position between elites and the electorate (Verba et al. 1993). Moreover, to the extent that we worry about citizens completely withdrawing from politics and being uninformed, these concerns are most pressing in the realm of elections since this is the most egalitarian political arena.            "
"18","Network Measures Survey respondents were asked to name up to five people with whom they discussed “government, elections and politics” or “important matters.”12 Looking at all respondents, the average network had approximately 2.5 discussants (n= 1537), with 18% of all respondents failing to mention any discussants. Each respondent was then asked a series of questions about each discussant, including the frequency of political discussion between them, the respondent's perception of each discussant's political vote choice, and the respondent's belief about the discussant's level of political knowledge.            "
"19","Political discussion was measured on a 4‐point scale where a zero indicates “never talking politics” and a three indicates “often talking politics.” This variable, which measures the level of political interaction between a respondent and discussant, can be aggregated to the network level in two ways, either by summing responses across all discussants or averaging them. In order to capture the quantity of political interaction experienced by respondents—something distinct from the quality of interaction—I use the summed measure. When summed the variable has a range of 0 to 15, with a mean of 4.7, indicating that most respondents are exposed to limited levels of political interaction in their network. Table 1 provides the full descriptive statistics for this and the other network variables.            "
"20","Network composition is measured with an index of political agreement in the network. Each respondent reported a perception of who each discussant would cast a ballot for in the 1996 election. Response options included the following: will not or cannot vote, Bill Clinton, Robert Dole, some other candidate, or don't know.13 The measure of network agreement is constructed by contrasting these perceived preferences with the respondent's reported vote preference and aggregating across the full network. Every dyad where the respondent's preference did not match his or her discussants' was considered a “disagreeable” dyad; where they did match, the dyad was coded as “agreeable.” The measure ranges from 0 to 1, with higher numbers indicating more agreement between the respondent and her network. Agreement in networks is low, with an average of approximately 40%.            "
"21","To measure the social supply of political expertise, I aggregated responses to a question that asked whether the respondent believed each discussant had “not much,”“an average amount,” or “a great deal” of political knowledge.14 Based on these responses, a measure of socially supplied political knowledge was created by averaging the respondent's answers to this question across the network. An average is used for two reasons. First, using an absolute level of political knowledge makes it highly correlated with the sum‐based measure of political discussion, decreasing precision in standard errors due to collinearity.15 Second, it is important to conceptually separate the effects of quantity and quality of political discussion.16 Since the quantity of political interaction is most sensibly measured as a “total,” I use an average level of expertise here, recognizing this can mischaracterize variance in network expertise. The typical network has a range of zero to two, with an average of 1.22 on this variable, implying that the typical discussant in a respondent's network has about what you would expect from a person “on average.”            "
"22","Does Network Knowledge Affect Participation I begin with a basic examination of the influence that network characteristics have on participation in elections. My approach is to estimate a baseline model of participation based on factors identified in other research. These include measures of the respondent's socioeconomic status (Verba and Nie 1972), age (Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980), political knowledge (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996), partisan strength, political interest (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995), and partisan contacts (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993). I also include a control for the number of nonpolitical groups to which a respondent belongs (Putnam 2000), 17 which helps rule out an alternate explanation of network effects—namely that they reflect a personal predilection for involvement in all facets of social life, from groups, to politics, to networks.18 I then add in the measures of political interaction and agreement to create a “socially specified” baseline model. This establishes how the individual‐level controls respond to inclusion of network variables other than the one of primary interest in this article. A final model includes average political knowledge in the network. Since the dependent variable is a count of political activities, I use a negative binomial regression model to estimate independent variable coefficients.            "
"23","Results are reported in Table 2. The control model performs as expected with most variables achieving statistical significance and pointing in the expected direction. The main exceptions to this statement are education (insignificant) and the respondent's political knowledge (marginally significant). Adding in the first two network variables does not change these results substantially, even though they are statistically significant and in the expected direction. Consistent with earlier research, respondents that experience higher levels of political interaction and agreement participate in more political activities. Respondent political knowledge is statistically insignificant in this model, but adding the network variables has a minimal effect on all other factors.19"
"24","The last results are the most interesting. Network political expertise exerts a positive and statistically significant effect on electoral participation. Including it in the model has no influence on the statistical significance of other variables, implying that it is not affecting the relevance of the other variables in the model. Of particular note is that respondent political knowledge becomes statistically insignificant before adding in a measure of average network knowledge, meaning that it is not acting as a statistically more precise proxy for the respondent's political sophistication."
"25","The Added Value of Network Knowledge These results suggest that the sophistication of discussants is important for understanding when networks make participation more likely, but how much of an independent effect is there? There are two issues here: (1) Is network political knowledge acting mainly as a proxy for the respondent's own level of political expertise? (2) Is there any added value to having knowledgeable discussants, or is this variable mainly an indirect route for factors in the model to influence participation? The interpretation of the results in Table 2 depends heavily on answers to these questions, and a perusal of earlier research on the consequences of education (Nie, Junn, and Stehlik‐Barry 1996) and political discussion (Huckfeldt 2001) at least hints at these alternatives.            "
"26","To address these alternate explanations, I evaluate the factors that influence how much political knowledge respondents find on average among their discussants. One possibility is that human capital increases the likelihood of having networks with greater levels of political expertise (Lake and Huckfeldt 1998). Another perspective is that respondents with strong political predilections construct networks with like‐minded individuals who, consequently, have high levels of political knowledge or whom they think of as more knowledgeable because they agree (Finifter 1974; MacKuen 1990). A final perspective is that the other political characteristics of the network create opportunities for a respondent to seek out and learn about their discussant's political knowledge.20 Using these explanations as a guide, I regressed the level of political knowledge held by discussants in a respondent's network on individual and network characteristics. Coefficient effects for these variables are estimated using ordinary least squares regression with robust standard errors. Table 3 provides the results for two models, one with and one without the network variables.            "
"27","Consistent with previous research, political knowledge in social networks is related to the respondent's personal characteristics. This is especially true of factors exogenous to the network; educated and older respondents are more likely to have informed discussion partners. Likewise, people with a strong interest in and partisan attachment to politics experience higher quality political discussions. In line with the results from Table 2—and important for the purposes of this paper—the respondent's level of political knowledge does not predict her discussant's knowledge. Stated differently, political experts do not necessarily seek out other political experts as their discussants. Other characteristics of the network also achieve statistical significance. Specifically, people who talk politics more frequently are more likely to report higher levels of expertise in their network, as are people with higher levels of agreement. Somewhat surprisingly, the number of civic groups a respondent belongs to is unrelated to network sophistication.            "
"28","Despite the fact that network knowledge is related to these other variables, what is most important is that they have moderate substantive effects and explain only a small part of its variance. Network political knowledge is not functioning as a proxy for the respondent's own level of knowledge, though it may be filtering some of these effects through the respondent's education. Additionally, the results suggest that average levels of network knowledge are not primarily a way for other factors such as education, age, partisan strength, and interest to indirectly explain participation. In sum, socially supplied expertise affects participation in a manner that is fairly independent of these other factors."
"29","The Impact of Selection Bias One drawback to these data is that not all survey respondents report having discussion partners, creating a situation in which data are systematically missing on the final two network measures reported in Table 2. As such, the conclusions only generalize to a subsample of the entire electorate that have discussion networks and may be biased estimates of how important networks are for participation more generally. If the process that structures whether a respondent has a network or not is correlated with the dependent variable—a plausible argument from multiple theoretical perspectives—then it is possible that these coefficients misrepresent the relationships being examined here.            "
"30","There are two possible theoretical models for how this selection bias occurs. One perspective takes a respondent's report of no network at face value, meaning that he or she is socially isolated from other people. In this case, the process of opting into or out of social networks may be more strongly related to involvement than the qualities of the network itself. A second theoretical argument implies that the data are not really “missing” because no individual is truly isolated. Instead, the failure of a respondent to answer questions reflects the low salience of their network. In this case, network stimuli “exist,” but are “minimal.”"
"31","Each model suggests a different type of empirical strategy, with the former leaning toward use of a selection model and the latter implying that we should substitute minimum values in for respondents without discussants. As the results reported in Appendix B demonstrate, both solutions yield results similar to those in Table 2.21 Though the substantive consequences of the network variables are reduced after accounting for the selection process, suggesting that some of the “action” in participation is whether or not people have meaningful social networks, the basic interpretations offered above do not change. This is consistent with work by Klofstad (2005) that explicitly accounts for selection bias with a field experiment. However, while this evidence somewhat dampers concerns about selection bias, this subject requires further exploration in order to better sort out these processes.            "
"32","Substantive Effects How important is the effect of network expertise on participation? Specifically, how does it compare to the impact of network composition? To investigate these questions, I examine the joint influence of political interaction, agreement, and network political sophistication on the expected number of political activities. These simulations were produced by varying level of network agreement across three levels of network expertise—low, moderate, and high22—and two types of networks with average levels of political interaction—a two‐person network (volume of discussion = 3.61) and a four‐person network (7.25). Expected values were produced using SPOST (Long and Freese 2001), while holding all other variables at their mean. The patterns illustrated in Figure 1 support earlier research on the positive effects that discussion and agreement have on participation. However, they show network political knowledge effects to be even more substantial.            "
"33","                 The Effect of Network Disagreement and Knowledge on the Probability of Participating in Politics                         "
"34"," Source:                           Table 2.                        "
"35","In low‐expertise networks, moving from complete disagreement to full agreement increases the participation rate from .23 to .31 (an increase of .08) in the two‐person network and .27 to .36 (an increase of .09) in the four‐person network. The comparable effect of agreement in average and highly expert networks is an increase of .12 and .16 in two‐person networks and .14 and .17 in the four‐person network. These are notable increases in involvement when compared to the average rate of participation in the sample (.45), thereby suggesting that agreement is an important factor relating networks to participation. However, these gains are modest relative to the impact produced by increases in network political sophistication. In wholly disagreeable networks, moving from a network with no expertise to one with just average amounts increases participation by .14 and .17 units in two‐ and four‐person networks, respectively. In other words, a moderate amount of political expertise is larger than being in a network full of supportive discussion partners. This effect is somewhat stronger in agreeable networks (.16 and .19) though it is not dependent upon the presence of agreement. Clearly, the quality of discussion matters quite a bit relative to the political constitution of networks.            "
"36","So far the results show that the social supply of political expertise makes participation more likely, even in the face of substantial political disagreement. While this evidence is important for understanding the relationship between networks and involvement, it leaves an important question unanswered. Does the level of political knowledge in the network influence participation through the same attitudinal mechanisms as disagreement? Or do these elements influence participation through separate mechanisms? According to Mutz, “political inaction could be induced by the attitudinal ambivalence that cross‐cutting exposure is likely to engender within an individual” (2002a, 840). Given her findings that people are more capable of recognizing justifications for opposing points of view when exposed to cross‐cutting networks (2002b) and that ambivalence decreases the likelihood of participation (2002a), a strong case exists that this is a principle mechanism linking disagreement to lower electoral participation (indirect, but supportive, evidence of these mechanisms can be found in Barker and Hansen 2005 and Ulbig and Funk 1999). Is it possible that the social supply of political expertise counteracts this effect?         "
"37","The earlier discussion alludes to three reasons why it may. First, it might increase respondent sophistication and improve a person's ability to integrate political information into their opinions by themselves. Second, politically sophisticated partners might provide cueing information that helps respondents integrate persuasive information into their belief systems. Finally, respondents with multiple discussion partners who have some political expertise can “check” their reactions against each other (e.g., McPhee 1963) in order to figure out how to react to information, meaning whether to reject it or accept it as a relevant consideration.         "
"38","Ambivalence, defined as holding competing considerations about an attitude object (Zaller 1992), is typically measured by combining informational and affective considerations that people hold about candidates into a single index. Since the Indianapolis‐St. Louis survey did not include open‐ended like‐dislike questions (Lavine 2001; Zaller 1992) or feeling thermometer questions (Mutz 2002a) used to measure ambivalence in previous studies, a direct test of this argument is not possible here. However, it is possible to construct an indirect test of the argument by examining the impact of network characteristics on the length of time it took respondents to make their decisions as to which candidate to support. Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee (1954) demonstrate one of the primary consequences of cross‐cutting networks is to delay reaching a vote decision, a result that is undoubtedly related to voter ambivalence (Lavine 2001; Mutz 2002a). By examining the impact of network agreement and sophistication on the amount of time it took respondents to establish their candidate preference, it is possible to indirectly shed light on the mechanisms underlying network knowledge effects.         "
"39","Respondents in the immediate postelection survey wave reported when they made up their mind about the presidential vote choice. Responses to the question range from “before summer” (coded as zero) to “the week before” the election (coded as three).23 Although a significant proportion of respondents (44%) reported making up their mind before the summer, a majority made their mind up at some later point. Fully 14% did not make up their mind until the week before the elections. Overall, there is substantial variance in this measure, making it amenable to empirical analysis.         "
"40","Estimates from an ordered probit model used to test the hypothesis that network agreement and sophistication reduce ambivalence are in Table 4. To control for other factors that influence this decision, I include measures of education, interest, partisan strength, voter knowledge, and the other political characteristics of the network. Positive coefficients reflect a delay in the process, while negative values reflect an early crystallization of preferences.         "
"41","Overall, these results are in line with previous research. Like Lavine, I find that education does not predict crystallization of vote preferences, but that partisan strength has a positive influence. Interest in the election is statistically insignificant and in an unexpected direction. Consistent with Mutz's work, I find that network agreement has a theoretically consistent and statistically precise influence on when people make up their mind. Respondents who experience disagreement in their network score higher on the dependent variable, meaning that they put off making up their mind about which candidate they prefer. Of most interest, though, is that the average level of political knowledge in the network has a statistically significant influence on when respondents time their vote decision."
"42"," Figure 2 demonstrates the strength of these effects. Each panel of this graph displays the probability of a category in the dependent variable for one of the two network variables while holding all other variables at their mean. This visual display shows that network agreement is smaller than the effect associated with average levels of political knowledge in a network. For instance, voters who have no agreement in their networks have a probability of making a vote decision before the summer campaign season of 43%. This increases to a little over 53% if the network completely agrees with the respondent. By comparison, respondents with no knowledgeable respondents have a 33% probability of deciding before the summer while those with the highest level of political knowledge have a 55% probability of deciding at that time. Comparable conclusions apply to the other categories, but the general dynamic is to influence whether the respondent makes up her mind before or after the campaign begins.         "

"44"," Source:                        Table 2.                     "
"45"," Notes: For purpose of visual display, the average level of network political knowledge was rescaled to range from 0 to 1, rather than its original metric of 0 to 2.                     "
"46","This evidence suggests that the social supply of political expertise is important in no small part because it counteracts the negative effect of disagreement on ambivalence. The implication seems to be that if disagreement occurs in the context of politically sophisticated networks that the net effect is to reduce ambivalence and enhance the attitudinal foundations underlying involvement. To be clear, however, this evidence is preliminary and requires a more extensive examination than it receives here. Moreover, disagreement continues to be important in other ways that depress participation, such as stimulating conflict avoidance (Mutz 2002b; Ulbig and Funk 1999).         "
"47","This article explores the impact of political expertise in social networks on participation, particularly in relation to the effect of network composition. Although the analysis buttresses earlier conclusions about the relevance of political preferences for explaining involvement, it goes further to show how network exchange enhances the probability of participation when it provides access to politically sophisticated discussants. And, while it is true that people do not randomly find themselves in networks with high levels of expertise, it is also the case that the factors that predict the structure of those networks explain only a small proportion of that variance. This indicates that there is benefit in having knowledgeable discussants that is independent of other characteristics. Finally, preliminary evidence suggests that politically sophisticated networks accomplish these gains by reducing ambiguity in respondent's perceptions of politics. Although full judgment must be withheld on this claim in the absence of a more direct and powerful empirical test, the immediate implication is that networks counteract one of the processes that lead cross‐cutting social ties to decrease participation."
"48","The broader importance of these results comes from what they imply about the potential for participatory politics in America. In an effort to promote workable democracy despite overwhelming evidence on the shortcomings of individual citizens, some political theorists emphasize a model of democracy that prioritizes public deliberation (e.g., Elshtain 1995; Fishkin 1991). As the argument goes, public deliberation advances healthy democratic practices because it exposes people to the broader collection of information and viewpoints held by the public. Consequently, it can promote more reasoning by citizens and, hopefully, better public opinion (Barabas 2004). One central element of this interpretation, though, is a belief that political discussion must expose people to dissonant arguments and opposing points of view.         "
"49","Although people do not often practice the kind of deliberation outlined by the theorists, there has been some interest in how the everyday elements of deliberation—such as cross‐cutting discussion—affect voting behavior. As far as this evidence goes, the record shows that such exchanges help people become more thoughtful and tolerant citizens (Barabas 2004; Mutz 2002b), but cause them to withdraw from politics (e.g., Mutz 2002a). From this, it seems a small jump to suggest that the deliberative elements of social life may work at cross‐purposes with the high levels of political involvement that participatory theorists believe are central to good democratic governance (e.g., Dahl 1956). Are interconnected and deliberative citizens really tolerant and reasoning, but inactive and absent? The evidence here suggests not—in practice politically relevant conversations need not lead to an ambivalent public that refuses to act on their views in the electoral arena.         "
