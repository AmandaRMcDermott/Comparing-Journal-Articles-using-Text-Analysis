"1","Political trust, a global affective orientation toward government, has long been thought to reflect citizens' policy satisfaction. Trust is higher when policies are viewed as effective or when there is perceived congruence between citizens' expectations and policy outputs (Hetherington 1998; Miller 1974; Owen and Dennis 2001). Until recently, though, political trust was not thought to carry any implications for the formation of policy attitudes. Chanley, Rudolph, and Rahn (2000) were among the first to show that political trust has important consequences for policy attitudes. Using aggregate‐level time‐series analysis, they found evidence of a causal link from political trust to Stimson's (1999) measure of policy mood. It was Hetherington and colleagues (2001, 2004; Hetherington and Globetti 2002), however, that first articulated a microlevel theory capable of explaining the causal connection between trust and policy attitudes.         "
"2","In a recent book, Hetherington (2004) develops an elegant theory designed to explain the conditions under which political trust will influence citizens' policy attitudes. Under this theory, political trust operates as a simple heuristic that helps citizens decide whether to support or oppose increased government spending in a policy domain. Citizens are more likely to support an expansion of services, he argues, when the system that will deliver those services (i.e., the government) is perceived as trustworthy. The utility of the trust heuristic, however, is said to vary across situational contexts. According to Hetherington's theory, the activation of the trust heuristic is tied to the perceived sacrifice or risk associated with a particular policy. Specifically, political trust is expected to be activated when individuals are asked to sacrifice their own material interests for the advancement of political minorities.         "
"3","Not all government programs require an equal level of material sacrifice among the mass public. Distributive policies can be defined as those in which both costs and benefits are universally distributed (Wilson 1973). Distributive policies, such as Social Security, Medicare, and environmental protection, involve a universal distribution of benefits in which virtually every segment of the population will eventually benefit from an expansion of government services. Redistributive policies can be defined as those in which costs may be widely distributed but benefits are narrowly concentrated (Wilson 1973). Redistributive policies, such as Medicaid, food stamps, and other programs designed to assist the poor, involve a restricted distribution of benefits in which the government uses tax money to provide benefits to narrow segments of the population. Hetherington's (2004) theory creates clear expectations regarding the types of programs for which political trust should have policy consequences. Given the uneven levels of sacrifice imposed by each set of programs, he argues, political trust should figure more prominently in shaping public support for redistributive spending than distributive spending.         "
"4","Empirical support for Hetherington's sacrifice‐based theory of political trust has not been in short supply. Research shows that political trust is unrelated to public support for distributive spending on issues such as Social Security, crime prevention, environmental protection, and national defense (Hetherington 2001, 2004). Conversely, political trust is an important determinant of support for redistributive spending on policies concerning welfare, food stamps, childcare, public schools, health care, foreign aid, and the poor (Hetherington 2004). Political trust also drives support for race‐targeted initiatives such as affirmative action, education quotas, and government aid to blacks (Hetherington 2004; Hetherington and Globetti 2002). Importantly, the effects of political trust on support for redistributive spending are attenuated among those who are not required to sacrifice, namely, members of beneficiary groups (Hetherington 2004).         "
"5","Implicit in our argument is the belief that ideological self‐placements are meaningful. From a symbolic politics perspective, ideological identification is an enduring and symbolic predisposition that plays an important role in shaping the formation of policy attitudes (Sears et al. 1980). Others have characterized ideology as a form of group identification (Conover and Feldman 1981). From an information‐processing perspective, ideology operates as a cognitive heuristic that enables people to organize and analyze information about the ideological content of policy issues (Huckfeldt et al. 1999). Particularly from a cognitive perspective, individuals' ability to discern the ideological content of policy issues, and thus the meaningfulness of individuals' ideological identification, is conditioned by individual differences (Jacoby 1991). We believe, however, that the meaningfulness of ideological identifications is also likely to be conditioned by issue differences. Because government spending is a recurring and familiar issue on the public agenda (Jacoby 1994), and because conflicts over government spending involve clear ideological divisions (Jacoby 2000), we expect that ideological identifications will serve as a meaningful guide for most people when evaluating spending.         "
"6","Despite well‐known reservations about the capacity of individuals to engage in ideological thinking (Converse 1964), a wealth of empirical evidence shows that there is a direct link between citizens' ideological orientations and their attitudes toward government spending. Ideology shapes spending attitudes across a wide range of issues (Jacoby 1994, 2000) and is particularly influential among those whose ideological orientations are more accessible (Huckfeldt et al. 1999). Whether government spending is framed in general or specific terms, conservatives are generally less likely than liberals to support increased spending (Jacoby 2000).         "
"7","Informed by this literature, we expect that liberals will be more likely than conservatives to support increased spending on both distributive and redistributive policies. The proposition that ideology will directly influence spending attitudes is hardly novel. Our principal innovation is to argue that ideology will also exert an indirect influence by moderating the effects of political trust on citizens' support for government spending. Our theoretical expectations are derived from Hetherington's (2004) sacrifice‐based theory of political trust. Central to his theory is the concept of sacrifice. Political trust gets activated, he argues, when individuals are asked to sacrifice their own self‐interest for the sake of others. We argue that political trust will also be activated when individuals are asked to sacrifice their ideological principles.         "
"8","Requests for increased government spending do not impose equal ideological costs on liberals and conservatives. Conservatives have traditionally championed the value of limited government and have often viewed the expansion of the federal government as a potential threat to individual or state liberty. Liberals, in contrast, have been more willing to support the expansion of most federal programs in an effort to promote social or economic equality. When called upon to support increases in government spending, conservatives are thus asked to sacrifice some of their core ideological principles.1 Such requests typically impose a much lighter ideological burden on liberals. Because requests for increased federal spending impose greater ideological costs on conservatives, we expect that the political trust heuristic is more likely to be activated among conservatives than liberals. As a result, we hypothesize that the effects of political trust on spending attitudes will be heightened among conservatives.         "
"9","By conceptualizing sacrifice in ideological as well as material terms, our theory generates a second hypothesis concerning the types of policies for which political trust ought to matter. When sacrifice is defined purely in terms of self‐interest, it is entirely reasonable to predict that political trust will only influence citizens' support for redistributive spending since only redistributive spending requires anyone to sacrifice his or her self‐interest. Consistent with Hetherington's (2004) theory, we expect that the effects of political trust on support for redistributive spending will be moderated by considerations of self‐interest. When the concept of sacrifice is broadened to include considerations of ideological interest, however, the rationale for limiting trust's expected impact to redistributive spending disappears. Requests for increased government spending impose greater ideological costs on conservatives regardless of whether that spending is aimed at distributive or redistributive programs. We thus predict that our hypothesized interaction between political trust and conservatism will influence attitudes toward both distributive and redistributive spending.         "
"10","The data analyzed in this study are taken from the 2000 National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES). The 2000 NAES is a large‐scale public opinion study of the American electorate.2 At the heart of the NAES is a national rolling cross‐section that runs from December 1999 to January 2001. The rolling cross‐section (RCS) design can be viewed as a single cross‐section in which interviews are distributed over time in a controlled way (Johnston and Brady 2002). When the sampling protocol is conducted in such a way that both respondents and interview dates are randomly chosen, as was the case in the NAES, researchers are able to create time‐series measures for longitudinal analysis (Johnston and Brady 2002; Romer et al. 2004). In the analyses to follow, we perform a daily time‐series analysis in order to observe the aggregate‐level relationship between political trust and policy attitudes over time.3 Importantly, the unique design of the NAES design allows us to disaggregate our time series measures by ideology to conduct separate analyses for liberals and conservatives. This provides us with the opportunity to test both of our hypotheses at the aggregate level.         "
"11","The 2000 NAES also includes a pre–post election panel in which several thousand respondents from the original RCS sample were reinterviewed after the general election. After using these panel data to establish the temporal precedence of political trust at the individual level, we exploit the cross‐sectional properties of the NAES' rolling cross‐section to test our two hypotheses at the individual level. For this portion of the analysis, we treat the RCS as a single cross‐section and analyze the effects of political trust, ideology, and, most importantly, their interaction on citizens' attitudes toward distributive and redistributive spending.4"
"12","The 2000 NAES includes several instruments that tap citizens' attitudes toward government spending. Four of these items measure attitudes toward spending on distributive policies, policies in which most if not all individuals will benefit from government action. These policies include Social Security, Medicare, environmental protection, and national defense. Four additional items measure attitudes toward spending on redistributive policies: Medicaid, aid to mothers with dependent children, health insurance for those who cannot afford it, and aid to public schools. These eight items serve as the principal dependent variables in our aggregate‐ and individual‐level analyses. All eight items were measured using a similar format in which respondents were asked whether the government should spend more, the same, less, or no money at all on a given policy.5 Responses are coded so that higher scores indicate support for greater spending. Question wording for these and all other instruments are reported in the appendix.         "
"13","The key independent variables in our analysis are political trust and ideological identification. To measure political trust, we employ the NAES' “trust in government” instrument. This four‐point item, commonly used by the National Election Studies (NES), asks respondents whether the federal government in Washington can be expected to do what is right all of the time, most of the time, some of the time, or never.6 Responses to this question are coded so that higher values denote higher levels of political trust.         "
"14","To measure ideology, we rely on respondents' self‐placement along a five‐point ideological scale ranging from very conservative to very liberal. At the aggregate level, we test our ideological moderation hypothesis by comparing the relationship between daily mean scores of political trust and policy attitudes among conservatives over time with the same relationship among liberals. At the individual level, we test our ideological moderation hypothesis by forming interactions between political trust and a pair of dummy variables representing liberals and conservatives, respectively. The omitted baseline category in these analyses is moderates.7 We anticipate that the overall effect of political trust on policy attitudes will be greater among conservatives than among liberals.         "
"15","To reduce the risk of omitted variables bias, our models control for a number of individual‐level factors. Specifically, we control for respondents' party identification and demographic traits, including education, income, age, race, and gender. Informed by Hetherington (2004), our redistributive models also include a measure of whether respondents belong to a beneficiary group. These measures are included both directly and interactively with political trust. Belonging to a beneficiary group is expected to increase support for redistributive spending and to moderate the effects of political trust. Respondents are coded as belonging to a beneficiary group when they have school‐aged children (education), are poor (Medicaid), are poor and have children (aid to mothers), or cannot afford health insurance (health care).8 Measurement details for all of these variables are reported in the appendix.         "
"16","To observe the effects of political trust and ideology on policy attitudes over time, we estimate a distributed lag model with a Koyck transformation. Our model can be expressed as            "
"17","The results of the distributed lag model for the four distributive and four redistributive policies are reported in Table 1A and 1B, respectively.9 Consistent with previous research, political trust fails to influence public support for distributive spending across all four policies in question. Such attitudes respond only to ideology and lagged policy support. In contrast, political trust does increase public support for redistributive spending across all four issues. Moreover, for two of the four issues, the effects of political trust are equivalent in magnitude to those of ideology.         "
"18","The results in Table 1A and 1B, however, do not speak directly to our ideological moderation hypothesis. To address this question, we disaggregate our time‐series measures by ideology and estimate separate models for liberals and conservatives. The results of these models are reported in Table 2A–2H. At issue in these models is whether the effects of political trust are greater among conservatives than among liberals. As can be seen, political trust among liberals fails to influence support for government spending on seven of the eight issues. Conversely, political trust among conservatives increases support for government spending on six of the eight issues, three of which entail distributive spending and three of which involve redistributive spending. These results suggest that not only are the effects of political trust moderated by ideology, but also that such moderation occurs across both distributive and redistributive policies. Though suggestive, these results still require confirmation at the individual level for us to be confident that our hypothesized mechanisms are truly operative.         "
"19","To test our hypotheses at the individual level, we estimate an ordered probit model for each of the eight policy attitudes under investigation.10 The results of these models are presented in Table 3A and 3B. We first note that the effects of the control variables comport well with theoretical expectations. In general, support for government spending is greater among African Americans and women while it is inversely related to education, income, and age. Not surprisingly, the results also indicate that support for government spending is greater among Democrats and liberals than it is among Republicans and conservatives. Consistent with Hetherington (2004), Table 3B shows that support for redistributive spending is higher among members of beneficiary groups for three of the four policies in question and approaches statistical significance for the fourth (p = .12). Also consistent with previous research is our finding that, in two of four cases, the interaction between political trust and belonging to a beneficiary group is negative and statistically significant. This implies that political trust matters less among those who are not asked to sacrifice material interests.         "
"20","Of central interest in Table 3A and 3B is whether the effects of political trust are moderated by ideology. The fact that the interaction between political trust and conservatism is positive and statistically significant in all eight equations provides a clear indication that this is indeed the case.11 These findings suggest that not only does ideology moderate the effect of political trust, but that this moderation occurs consistently across both distributive and redistributive policies. To examine the overall effects of political trust among conservatives and liberals, however, we must analyze the coefficients on these interaction terms in combination with the coefficients on political trust. The overall effect of political trust among conservatives, for example, is βtrust+βtrust × conservative while the overall effect of political trust among liberals is βtrust+βtrust × liberal12 To assess the statistical significance of these overall effects, we perform a series of joint (Wald) hypothesis tests (i.e., βtrust+βtrust × conservative > 0 and βtrust+βtrust × liberal > 0).         "
"21","The results of the Wald tests provide further evidence that the effects of political trust are conditioned by ideology. Consider first the overall effects of political trust among liberals. Consistent with previous research, political trust fails to increase liberals' support for distributive spending across all four policies.13 Of the four redistributive policies, political trust increases liberals' support for Medicaid and aid to mothers with dependent children, but not for education or health care.14 Among conservatives, however, the overall effects of political trust are positive and statistically significant across all eight issues.15 Moreover, for the two issues in which political trust matters among liberals and conservatives (i.e., Medicaid, aid to mothers), these results suggest that the effects of trust are considerably larger among conservatives. The results in Table 3A and 3B can also be used to show the impact of political trust among moderates. In short, political trust increases moderates' support for redistributive spending on all four issues and, with the exception of environmental protection, is unrelated to their support for distributive spending. Collectively, these results suggest that, in general, it is only among those who are asked to sacrifice ideological interests (i.e., conservatives) that political trust influences support for distributive spending.         "
"22","To illustrate the magnitude of political trust's differential impact among liberals and conservatives, Table 4 reports the predicted probabilities of supporting increased spending at the minimum and maximum values of political trust. Consider, for example, the issue of government aid to poor mothers with children, one of only two issues in which political trust increases support for government spending among liberals. Among liberals, a change from low trust to high trust increases support for more spending by 15 percentage points. Among conservatives, however, the same change in trust increases support for such spending by 29 percentage points. Similar results are obtained on six of the remaining seven issues. Only on the issue of Medicaid is the effect of political trust of nearly equal magnitude among both liberals and conservatives, although even then it is slightly larger among conservatives.         "
"23","The heightened effect of political trust among conservatives is important not just because of its magnitude, but also because of its political implications. Among conservatives with high levels of political trust, the likelihood of supporting increased aid to poor mothers is 0.56, well above the majority threshold of 0.50. More importantly, it should be noted that this value now exceeds the likelihood of support among liberals with low levels of political trust (0.56 vs. 0.47). This result, which is not limited to this issue, implies that increases in political trust are sometimes sufficient to overcome ideological differences in support for government spending. Indeed, the likelihood of supporting increased spending among high‐trust conservatives exceeds or approaches the likelihood of such support among low‐trust liberals on several other issues, including Medicaid, health care, education, and the environment."
"24","This article joins a growing list of studies showing that political trust has meaningful consequences for American democracy. Recent work has emphasized the importance of perceived sacrifice in determining the conditions under which political trust will influence citizens' support for government spending. Hetherington's (2004) theory of political trust predicts that trust will be most consequential among those who are asked to sacrifice their own material interests. His theory anticipates that trust will only influence public support for redistributive spending. Using different data and a different set of issues, the results of this study provide additional empirical evidence that the effects of political trust on support for redistributive spending are greater among those making material sacrifices.         "
"25","The results of this study extend the literature by showing that the activation of political trust is not limited to cases involving the sacrifice of material interests. Our results suggest that political trust is activated when individuals are asked to sacrifice ideological principles as well their own self‐interest. Time‐series and individual‐level analyses demonstrate that the effects of political trust on support for government spending are moderated by ideology. While conservatives are less supportive of government spending than liberals, we find that political trust actually has a much larger impact on spending attitudes among conservatives. The effects of political trust among conservatives are of such sizable magnitude that they frequently erase the ideological gap between liberals' and conservatives' level of support for government spending."
"26","In the realm of redistributive spending, our results show that political trust has a differential impact among conservatives, moderates, and liberals. We find that trust consistently boosts support for redistributive spending among conservatives and moderates and occasionally does so among liberals, with the largest impact always occurring among conservatives. This finding uncovers a new source of heterogeneity that underlies the relationship between political trust and support for redistributive spending. The finding also has implications for the mobilization of public support for redistributive spending. It suggests that not only does political trust increase support for redistributive programs, it does so most powerfully among those who are traditionally most opposed ideologically to such programs."
"27","By broadening the conceptualization of sacrifice to include considerations of ideological principles, and by demonstrating that ideology conditions the effects of political trust, our study shows that, at least among conservatives, political trust influences support for both distributive and redistributive spending. This finding is important from a theoretical perspective because it suggests that political trust has policy consequences across a much broader range of issues than previously thought. It is also important from a political perspective because it suggests that at least a portion of public support for government spending on distributive programs such as Social Security and Medicare is tied to levels of political trust. This implies that declining trust may not only erode public support for redistributive spending, it may erode support for distributive spending among certain segments of the electorate."
"28","The finding that political trust matters more to conservatives is also important from a policy perspective. In particular, it implies a cyclical tension between political elites and the mass public that may ultimately work to ensure the moderation of policy outputs. When political trust rises, so too does the demand for increased government intervention, particularly among conservatives. Baseline levels of political trust among conservatives are typically greatest when there is a Republican president. Republican presidents, whose natural tendencies may push them toward a less expansive federal government, will thus feel pressure to do more when political trust increases. When Democrats occupy the White House, however, political trust among conservatives tends to wane. Democratic presidents thus experience a dilemma of a different sort. Their natural inclination to do more is hampered at every turn by conservatives' unwillingness to trust them to do so. Democrats are thus constrained from doing too much just as Republicans may face pressure not to do too little. The result in both cases should encourage the moderation of policy outputs."
