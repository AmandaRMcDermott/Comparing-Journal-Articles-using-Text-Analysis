"1","Viewing political behavior as habitual is widely accepted in the turnout literature. Green and Shachar (2000) refer to such habit formation as consuetude.2 That is, if two individuals have exactly the same characteristics, but one decides to vote on election day and the other does not, then these decisions will affect their probability of voting in future elections. Gerber, Green, and Shachar (2003) find that, all things being equal, an individual is 47% more likely to vote in the current election if he or she participated in the previous election, while Fowler (2006) notes that more than half of potential voters either always vote or always abstain. Using raw data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS), we find that 89% of British voters who turned out to vote in the 1997 general election also voted in the 1987 and the 1979 elections.            "
"2","While evidence of persistence in voter turnout exists, nonexperimental research determining the extent to which turnout is habitual has been limited. Lack of adequate panel data has led much of the literature to sidestep the habitual nature of voter turnout and concentrate on the individual/sociodemographic and institutional/situational determinants instead.3 Habit formation can readily explain why one of the standard sociodemographic determinants—age—is found to have a positive effect on voter turnout. Turnout may increase with age as habits become reinforcing over time. A study by Franklin (1994), which emphasizes the importance of persistence in early voting behavior, notes that individuals who turn out to vote when they reach eligible voting age are likely to continue this behavior in subsequent elections, while those who fail to vote in this first election are more likely to become persistent nonvoters.            "
"3","Habit formation in voter turnout may occur due to the high transaction costs of voting. Individuals initially face very high costs when they first decide to vote, in terms of registering to vote, finding the polling station, learning how to cast a vote, and differentiating between political parties (Plutzer 2002). Gerber, Green, and Shachar (2003) refer to the positive or negative feelings which potential voters feel towards voting as “conative attitudes,” which are directly derived from these costs of voting. However, once this initial investment is made and voters overcome these barriers to voting, the transaction costs are thus reduced for each subsequent election, which in turn increases the probability of participating in future elections.            "
"4","Another stream of research proposes that once voters enter the political realm they become targets for party campaigns. Therefore, in the political parties' attempt to mobilize electoral support they consequently mobilize electoral participation. Individuals who abstain from voting in past elections, on the other hand, are less likely to be canvassed by parties or interest groups in subsequent elections and are not directly encouraged to participate. Huckfeldt and Sprague (1992) find, using U.S. data, that only 25% of individuals who never voted in a primary were contacted by a political party during an election campaign, compared to 40% of those who did participate in previous primaries. In addition, a number of experimental studies find that being contacted prior to an election increases the likelihood of voting (Gerber, Green, and Shachar 2003; Kraut and McConahay 1973; Niven 2002; Yalch 1976). Therefore, becoming a voter induces an individual to remain a voter as he or she becomes part of the political environment.            "
"5","There are also several psychological arguments that can explain the habitual nature of voting. Electoral participation may become a habit as the act of voting can be self‐reinforcing as individuals derive psychological benefits from casting a vote. Finkel (1985) notes that participating in an election increases one's familiarity and confidence with the process, which in turn changes one's sense of political efficacy. It also enhances voters' interest in politics and increases their sense of civic duty, all of which strengthen the positive connotations associated with voting. Indeed, Nickerson (2004) argues that voting is habit forming as the act itself generates positive thoughts, which reinforces its continued behavior. Using experimental data, he finds that an individual is 29% more likely to vote in the next election if he or she voted in the previous one. Voters, in one sense, do become “addicted” to voting. Habit formation may also exist as the theory of cognitive dissonance states that individuals try to maintain consistency in their behavior, beliefs, and attitudes, as being inconsistent generates psychological discomfort which voters try to minimize (Festinger 1957). Therefore, in order to align their behavior over time, voters may continue turning out to vote in elections. A recent study by Mullainathan and Washington (n.d.), which tests the cognitive dissonance theory, finds that voting for a particular U.S. presidential candidate leads to a more favourable approval of that candidate in the future, indicating that the act of voting may influence attitudes.            "
"6","An alternative explanation for persistence in voter turnout is that it may simply be driven by individual characteristics which are relatively constant over time, such as parental background, education, etc. The extensive literature on electoral participation is mainly concerned with identifying such underlying socioeconomic determinants (see Nie, Junn, and Stehlik‐Barry 1996; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980). While these factors are observable, and can therefore be controlled for, persistence in voter turnout may also be influenced by individual characteristics which are unobserved. Thus one may detect persistence in voter turnout if these fixed, but unobservable, factors are omitted from estimated models of turnout. This unobserved heterogeneity will therefore generate spurious state dependence in the data.            "
"7","Naïve models which try to capture the relationship between past and future turnout decisions by simply including the lagged dependent variable, i.e., turnout in the previous election, as an explanatory variable, fail to distinguish between persistence in turnout caused by true state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. Indeed, as such models do not control for unobserved heterogeneity, they will generally overestimate the extent of state dependence or “habit” in electoral turnout.4"
"8","Another statistical complication involved in analysing dynamic limited dependent variable models is the Initial Conditions Problem. This problem occurs when the time at which individuals are observed in the first wave of panel data does not coincide with the start of the stochastic process generating the individual voting experiences (Arulampalam, Booth, and Taylor 2000). That is, the survey data observed in the first wave may not be the respondents' first experience with the political system. To the best of our knowledge no study to date has dealt with the initial conditions problem. Indeed none of the articles discussed below mention it. In relation to vote choice, voters may have certain political orientations in the first period as they voted for that party in a previous, but unobserved, period, i.e., the habit formation process had already begun, or alternatively, due to unobserved characteristics that formed those opinions. A similar argument may be made in the case of voter turnout—while the first stage of a panel captures the respondents' turnout decisions within that period, this decision may have been influenced by turnout decisions in the previous, but unrecorded, period or unobserved individual characteristics. This initial conditions problem can be viewed as another form of unobserved heterogeneity.            "
"9","A priori, one may question why we have an initial conditions problem in this study, as we observe the voting behavior of the NCDS cohort from their first election onwards. Yet political socialization occurs prior to voting age, and young adults do not come to their first election as “political virgins.” Rather, similar to the political socialization literature which emphasizes the importance of family background in influencing political orientations, it appears that young adults are also socialized with respect to electoral participation. Certain factors, such as education, which encourages political mobilization by fostering democratic values and beliefs, and indeed parental encouragement, create civic‐minded citizens long before such individuals enter the polling booth. Indeed Verba, Schlozman, and Burns (2005) note that there is an intergenerational transmission of political participation, whereby politically active parents generate politically active children, while Horwitt (1999) also finds that nonvoters are more likely to come from families of nonvoters.            "
"10","The main source of unobserved heterogeneity in this analysis is due to time invariant and time variant omitted variables, which cannot be included in the analysis. The data only allow us to control for observed factors that were collected at each specified data wave. Omitted factors that may contribute to fixed effect unobserved heterogeneity include, for example, the individual's intrinsic motivation and sense of civic duty. These unobserved factors are likely to be constant over time and exert a continuous influence on voter turnout. Omitting such explanatory factors from the model may introduce bias into the parameter estimates if they are correlated with some of the observed explanatory factors included in the model specification. It is critical to control for such fixed effects unobserved heterogeneity as failing to do so will result in an overestimation of the degree of persistence in voter turnout. However, time‐varying unobserved factors may also influence voting decisions. These situational factors include being sick or on holiday at the time of the election. Controlling for time‐varying unobserved factors is less of a consideration in this study as these factors may not necessarily lead to an overestimation in persistence as they can have either a positive or negative influence depending on their correlation with other explanatory variables. This problem is not unique to this study and is present in all data analysis."
"11","This article also explicitly addresses omitted time dependent factors which contribute to the initial conditions problem by influencing turnout decisions in the first election. As described below, we use an adapted Heckman estimator, which is similar to an instrumental variable technique, such that it requires only one predictor for the estimator to be consistent. Ideally, including more predictors would improve the precision of the estimate; however, it would not affect its consistency. It is therefore not necessary to specify a complete structural model of the initial conditions."
"12","The greater the number of relevant variables that are omitted from the analysis, the larger the unobserved heterogeneity problem. Yet the omitted variable problem is less likely to be an issue in this study as the NCDS data is a particularly rich source of data and contains a wide range of factors which are not typically included in turnout studies, such as physical and mental health, personality traits, and cognitive ability. Therefore while omitted variables are an issue, the problem should be minimized in this study."
"13","While the concept of habitual voting has been widely discussed, there are only three published articles that we are aware of that statistically address the issue of habit in the voter turnout decision. Plutzer (2002) presents a developmental theory of voting which maps the evolution of voters' political behavior. Two stages are specified—the starting level, i.e., the probability that individuals will vote in their first election, and inertia, i.e., the probability that they become consistent voters or nonvoters. The developmental model posits that most young adults start off as habitual nonvoters, but over time certain life factors make them become habitual voters. Plutzer employs a latent growth curve analysis to model voting habits over time. He finds that variables which are measured prior to voting age, such as parental socioeconomic status, parental involvement, and education have a greater impact on the starting level, and that once voters reach inertia, the influence of these factors diminish. Plutzer's model cannot provide an estimate of the degree of persistence, which is the objective of this article.         "
"14","The articles by Green and Shachar (2000) and Gerber, Green, and Shachar (2003) are closer in spirit to ours, in that they also estimate a model of how lagged voting affects current voting and hence provide an estimate of the extent of habit. These two articles address the problem of heterogeneity by using a two‐stage “instrumental variables” (IV) approach to estimate their binary choice model (commonly called “IV probit”). That is, the lagged dependent variable is instrumented. In the first case they use information from previous elections as instruments. In the second, they use an experimental treatment which randomly affects the decision to vote in the first election. The logic for using an IV approach seems sensible; a conventional probit model will not be consistent as the lagged dependent variable is not strictly exogenous. What works in linear models, however, does not necessarily work in nonlinear models such as these, and there is no reason to believe that IV will solve the unobserved heterogeneity problem. There is a long tradition of estimating binary choice models with lagged dependent variables in statistics and econometrics and, to our knowledge, none use an IV approach. The reason for this is simple: the estimator is not consistent for the parameters of interest and hence is not appropriate. This result is shown in Wooldridge (2002, 478). The problem is actually clear from the results of Green and Shachar (2000). One's intuition is that if one does not deal with heterogeneity (“fixed effects”), one will overestimate the extent of state dependence or habit. This intuition is perfectly correct, and Heckman (1981b, 155) shows this, for example. However, Green and Shachar (2000) find that the IV model results in much bigger state dependence than the simple probit: the probit coefficient almost doubles with the marginal effect of past voting, rising from about 32 percentage points to about 61. This cannot be right and their explanation that this is due to “increased sampling variability” or measurement error is not compelling. Unfortunately Gerber, Green, and Shachar (2003) only present the IV results and not the simple probit; it is not, therefore, possible to assess what happens in this model. As an exercise, we estimated our model by instrumental variables probit using the same variable we use to identify the initial condition (the number of household moves) as the instrument. As with Green and Shachar (2000) the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable rises significantly. This is further evidence that this estimator is inappropriate.         "
"15","There is one other article that is relevant to this literature, Shachar (2003), which analyses persistence in party choice. This study, which uses a maximum likelihood estimator, is in the same vein as conventional methods used to estimate dynamic limited dependent variable models and hence the estimated results are sensible, such that implied state dependence falls once one addresses heterogeneity.         "
"16","The fixed effects unobserved heterogeneity problem, discussed above, can be addressed using a technique developed by Chamberlain (1984), who proposes including the averages of the time‐varying covariates as regressors in the dynamic panel model. Arulampalam, Booth, and Taylor (2000), who model unemployment persistence in the United Kingdom, argue that the best way to deal with the initial conditions problem is to model the initial outcome explicitly. They implement an estimator developed by Orme (2001), building on work by Heckman (1981a, 1981b) which deals with this issue by adopting a two‐step pseudo‐maximum likelihood approach that first estimates an initial conditions reduced form equation, from which a probit generalized error term is derived and then included in the dynamic panel estimation. Modelling both the fixed effects unobserved heterogeneity and initial conditions problems explicitly is dealt with in the following section.            "
"17","The statistical analysis involves estimating a binary choice model using longitudinal data which allows one's previous voting decisions to affect one's current decisions. This type of data generates several complications which do not occur in conventional cross‐sectional data. Consider the following generic model:5"
"18","Including the lagged dependent variable allows one to measure habit formation, the extent to which current decisions are affected by previous decisions. However, as discussed earlier, estimates of the parameter of interest, γ, are sensitive to two problems: fixed effects unobserved heterogeneity and the initial conditions problem. The former may arise if we do not have adequate controls for characteristics that determine voter turnout. If we assume there is some characteristic that increases the probability of an individual voting in general, then excluding this variable will generate a spurious positive correlation between past and current turnout decisions. The initial conditions problem arises if the start of the data (when one first records behavior) does not correspond to the actual start of the underlying activity.            "
"19","To deal with fixed effects unobserved heterogeneity, we decompose the error term into an individual specific term and a random error. The former is treated as a random effect. Unlike linear models, one cannot treat this as a fixed effect because of the incidental parameters problem (Neyman and Scott 1948).             "
"20","Unless ɛi is independent of the x's then maximum likelihood estimates are inconsistent. Therefore we follow Chamberlain (1984) and assume that the ɛi is a linear function of the means of the time‐varying independent variables with an error term (αi) which is normally distributed and independent of the x's and uit.             "
"21","This generates an underlying model which can be estimated by standard random effects probit methods.             "
"22","Therefore, including the means of all the time‐varying variables addresses the potential fixed effects unobserved heterogeneity problem."
"23","The methods used in this article have typically been applied to labor market data, such as modelling unemployment spells where it is highly unlikely that one will observe all individuals from the start of their labor market history. With respect to the voting data in the NCDS, it is not obvious that an initial conditions problem will arise since we observe individuals from the first general election that they could have voted in, i.e., 1979, when all respondents were 21 years of age. However, thinking of actual voting decisions as representations of underlying propensities (y*it), then it is possible that individuals become politicized at different ages, therefore observing them from the same point (and in this case, age) may still generate an initial conditions problem.            "
"24","We address the problem by estimating a reduced form equation for the initial voting decision in wave one (see Orme 2001). The covariates in the reduced form equation, zi, are strictly exogenous and include variables relevant to period 1, some presample information, and the means of the time‐varying covariates in xit. The presample information variables are the equivalent of “instrumental variables” and are required for identification.                "
"25","The correlation of the ηi and αi is ρ. Estimating the initial outcome by probit, one generates the following generalized error term:               "
"26","The individual specific random effect is wi. The usual t test for the statistical significance of the additional term (i.e., δ= 0) is a test for nonzero ρ.            "
"27"," Orme (2001) provides detailed Monte Carlo evidence on the statistical properties of this two‐step estimator. In particular he examines the consequences of ignoring an initial conditions problem and the extent to which this estimator remedies the problem. He finds that where yi0 is endogenous, i.e., where there is an initial conditions problem, that the coefficients on time‐varying variables (the zit) are biased upwards by about 11% and the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable (yit ‐ 1) is biased upwards by 94%. This confirms Heckman's (1981b) finding that if one ignores the initial conditions problem then the extent of true state dependence can be seriously overstated. The two‐step pseudo Maximum Likelihood Estimator used here has quite good properties with both biases reduced to no more than 2%. The estimator is also more precise than the standard random effects estimator. We also carried out our own Monte Carlo investigation and confirmed that the two‐step estimator had the desired properties.            "
"28","The data for the analysis is based on the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS). This is a longitudinal study of all persons living in Great Britain who were born between March 3 and 9, 1958. The 1958 perinatal mortality survey has been followed by six subsequent waves (NCDS 1–6) at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, and the most recent, at ages 41–42. NCDS 1–3 are comprised of interviews with the child, his parents and his school, and the report of a medical examiner. These data are an exceptionally rich source on child development from birth to early adolescence, child care, medical care, health, physical statistics, home environment, educational progress, parental involvement, cognitive and social growth, family relationships, etc. NCDS 4–6 are based largely on interviews with the cohort member and his or her partner. They document economic activity, income, training, and housing as well as the development of the cohort member's own family."
"29","The last three waves collected data on the political behavior of the cohort, including past electoral participation, party alignment, vote choice, and voting intentions. The fourth follow‐up, conducted in 1981 when the cohorts were aged 23, collected information on the 1979 general election; the fifth follow‐up, conducted in 1991 when the cohorts were 33, collected information on the 1987 general election; and finally the 1999/2000 follow‐up, conducted when the cohorts were aged 41–42, collected information on the 1997 general election.6 While there were five general elections during this period in Britain, only three NCDS waves were conducted; therefore we only have information on the cohorts' voting behavior in the first, third, and fifth elections. The panel nature of this data allows us to study the respondents' voting behavior over three elections, at ages 21 (when we observe participation in their first election), 29, and 39.         "
"30","Similar to other longitudinal cohort studies, the NCDS is subject to attrition, wave nonresponse, and missing data. Of the original 17,415 cases observed in wave one (at birth), 10,979 of these longitudinal cases remain in wave six (age 42). Much of this attrition, however, occurred in the early years between wave one and wave two (age 7), and between wave three (age 16) and wave four (age 23). The drop between these waves can be attributed to a change in respondent—from parents to the cohort members themselves as adults. By wave six 6,863 (63%) of the observed sample was present in all previous waves. It should be noted that cohort members move in and out of the observed samples over time (Hawkes and Plewis 2006). As the goal of our study is to determine persistence in voting behavior, we restrict our analysis to cohort members who were present and responded to the turnout question in waves four to six, i.e., from voting age onwards. The observed longitudinal sample in each wave was 12,044 (wave four), 10,986 (wave five), and 10,979 (wave six). Therefore, while the sample did fall between waves four and five, there was little nonresponse between waves five and six. In total, 8,581 participated in all three waves and of these, 8,466 responded to the turnout question. It should also be noted that some respondents may participate in the survey but not respond to certain questions.         "
"31","The impact of question nonresponse is highlighted in Table A of the appendix, which provides the descriptive statistics for all variables used in the analysis. This table compares the characteristics of respondents in our estimated sample, with those who participated in (1) all three waves, (2) in two waves only, and (3) in one wave only. It suggests that respondents who participate in multiple waves have different characteristics than those who participate in fewer waves, and the result is monotonic across all variables. In general, respondents who participate in more waves of the survey are more likely to vote, be married, be male, have children, be a trade union member, be hard working, and have higher education and cognitive ability and less mental health problems. The converse is true for those who participate in two waves or fewer. This is consistent with Hawkes and Plewis (2006), who also found that the dropout rate within the NCDS is higher for males, those with low educational attainment and less stable employment patterns, and those living in disadvantaged circumstances. Therefore it is possible that our results may be subject to attrition and wave nonresponse bias. To test this, we use multiple imputation methods to provide a more rigorous test of whether our estimated results are affected by attrition bias and missing data. These results are discussed in Appendix B below.         "
"32","The dependent variable is voter turnout in the 1979, 1987, and 1997 elections, and it is based on responses to the following question: “Did you vote in the last General Election in XXX?” As we estimate a balanced panel we restrict our sample to individuals whose turnout activity was recorded for each of the three elections.7 From our sample of 5,249 respondents, 70.8%, 80.2%, and 79.9% stated they did vote in the 1979, 1987, and 1997 elections, respectively (see Table 1). While reported turnout for the 1979 election is below the national aggregate turnout rate of 76%, given the relatively young age of the cohort at the time of the first election this is unsurprising. Reported turnout for the 1987 and 1997 elections, on the other hand, is higher than the official turnout rates of 75.3% and 71.6%, respectively.8 These differences are somewhat less than is frequently found in British studies of turnout, where participation is generally overestimated. For example, Swaddle and Heath (1989) find that reported turnout in the 1987 British General Election Study was 10 percentage points higher than the official rate. Turnout may be overstated in survey data for several reasons; for example, respondents may misreport their turnout as they are embarrassed about not fulfilling their civic duty, and in addition, abstainers are less likely than voters to participate in surveys (see Heath and Taylor 1999). The low level of misreporting in our sample suggests that the NCDS is a good alternative source of voting data.         "
"33"," Figure 1 maps out turnout patterns for all three elections. It shows that individuals who voted in the first election (71% of the total sample) were likely to continue voting in the 1987 and 1997 elections. This suggests that there is positive persistence in turnout rates. In addition, consistent abstaining is quite rare. For example, of those who did not vote in the first election (29% of the total sample), the majority of them turned out to vote in the 1987 election (63%). This suggests that voting is an absorbing state. The term circumstantial voter (see Blondel, Sinnott, and Svensson 1997) refers to voters who do not consistently abstain from voting; rather, they may fail to turn out at one election due to impeding circumstances, such as being out of the country on election day. Of our sample, 38.8% changed their participation patterns at least once over the observed period and thus may be defined as circumstantial voters. The raw data therefore display evidence of persistence in voter turnout; however, only by estimating a dynamic structural model can we determine the extent to which this persistence is driven by habit formation or unobserved characteristics.         "
"34","                 Voter Turnout, 1979–1997                      "
"35","Our explanatory variables can be divided into time invariant and time‐varying covariates. The former characteristics are those which remain constant throughout the analysed period, and the majority of them were measured prior to the first election. They include gender, education, cognitive ability, and parental social class. We include two measures of education, which is one of the primary determinants of turnout (see Nie, Junn, and Stehlik‐Barry 1996; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980). The first is the age at which the respondent left full‐time education, and the second is a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent stayed on beyond the minimum school‐leaving age of 16. Table 1, which provides the descriptive statistics for the data, shows that the average school‐leaving age was 17 and that only 41% of the sample stayed beyond age 16. In addition to formal education, we also include a measure of cognitive ability. While including ability in voting models is relatively new, several recent studies (e.g., Denny and Doyle 2008; Hauser 2002) have found that cognitive ability works in a similar manner to education—higher‐ability individuals are more likely to turn out to vote. Our ability measure is based on the first principal component from four ability measures taken at age 11: mathematics, comprehension, and verbal and nonverbal abilities. The ability measure is standardised to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.            "
"36","As previous research (Crewe 1981; Parry, Moyser, and Day 1992) has identified a relationship between turnout and the voter's social background, we include a categorical variable representing parental social class at birth in 1958.9 Several recent studies have examined the psychological underpinnings of voter turnout and have found that certain personality types are more likely to vote than others.10 While the NCDS includes several personality measures, we include the only one which is statistically significant: whether the individual is hardworking (or lazy). The indicator is measured on a scale of 1 to 5, whereby a value of 5 corresponds to “very hardworking.” The individual's teacher made these evaluations when the respondent was 16 years old.            "
"37","While one may expect the time invariant characteristics to have a constant impact on voting behavior, it is also likely that turnout may be influenced by events that occur throughout the respondent's life. Indeed, Plutzer (2002) finds that life events, such as marriage, home ownership, and having children of school‐going age, all influence the likelihood that individuals will participate in elections and can therefore switch individuals from being habitual nonvoters to habitual voters. To capture these time‐varying factors we include a number of characteristics measuring whether the respondent is married, has children, and is a trade union member, in addition to his or her mental health status and region of residence at each election period.            "
"38","The voting behavior of married individuals may differ from the nonmarried, as being married can reduce the costs of turnout, especially if one partner has more information about the political process than the other. For example, Zuckerman, Kotler‐Berkowitz, and Swaine (1998) identify the household as being the center of political discussion. Zuckerman, Fitzgerald, and Dasovic (2005) find that partners influence each other's political preferences. Being married may also affect turnout decisions due to peer effects, e.g., if one partner votes this may induce the other partner to vote. While some studies identify a positive relationship between marriage and turnout (Strate et al. 1989; Timpone 1998), others find a modest negative effect (Highton and Wolfinger 2001; Stoker and Jennings 1995). To control for marital influences on political behavior we include a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent is married in 1979, 1987, or 1997. As expected, Table 1 indicates that as the sample cohort ages, the proportion classified as married increases.            "
"39","Having children may also influence turnout decisions. Plutzer (2002) argues that parents with young children are less likely to vote due to the exhaustion and time demands associated with raising young children, while having children of school‐going age may actually increase electoral participation as parents get involved in school life, which activates social networks that encourage political mobilization. To capture these effects we include a dummy indicating whether the respondent has children at each election period. As with being married, having children increases as the respondents' age. Only 23% of the sample have children in the first period; however, this rises to 72% in 1987 and 77% in the subsequent period. Previous research (e.g., Radcliff 2001) has also found that trade union members are more likely to vote at election time as they are typically more politicized than nonmembers and are encouraged to vote by their unions. Therefore, we include a dummy variable indicating union membership in the three election periods. Table 1 shows that the proportion of union members among our sample falls slightly over time.            "
"40","An additional, but often unexplored, factor that may influence political behavior is the voters' physical and mental health. As voting requires a physical, and to some extent, a mental effort, having adverse health conditions may reduce the probability of voting. Several studies (Davey Smith and Dorling 1996; Denny and Doyle 2007; Reitan 2003; Schur and Douglas 2000) have found a negative relationship between poor health and voter turnout. We therefore included a self‐assessed measure of general health and an index of mental health in the model. As the measure of general health is not statistically significant we exclude it from our final model. Our indicator of mental health is measured by the “malaise inventory score,” which is a 24‐item self‐completed scale developed by Rutter, Tizard, and Whitmore (1970), and is based on the Cornell medical index. High scores represent those with poor mental health, while scores above seven are classified as having a high risk of psychiatric morbidity.11Table 1 indicates that the malaise score of our sample is quite low (averaging 2.6 in the 1979 period, then falling to 2.3 in the 1987 period); however, it increases to 3.4 in the 1997 period, suggesting that mental health becomes worse as respondents age.12 As explained in the above methodology section, we include the averages of the time‐varying covariates to control for unobserved heterogeneity.            "
"41","Estimating the reduced form initial conditions equation requires us to specify one or more variables that influence the turnout decision in the first election, but have no impact on voting decisions in later elections. Residential mobility is one such factor. Squire, Wolfinger, and Glass (1987) and Highton (2000b) note that residential mobility is associated with lower turnout due to the high transaction costs involved in reregistering each time one moves, and the fact that such people may have less attachment to their local community. We include a variable capturing the number of places the respondent lived between the ages of 16 and 23. The first election took place when the respondents were 21 years of age, which is a period usually associated with a high degree of mobility precipitated by moving out of the family home, going to university, or getting married. We argue that respondents who displayed a high degree of mobility during this period were less likely to turn out to vote than more settled respondents. Those who moved frequently during this period may not have remained in any one place long enough to register. Indeed Squire, Wolfinger, and Glass (1987) find that the low turnout rates associated with residential movers in the United States is due to the administrative burden of registering rather than differences in civic virtues. They estimate that turnout could be increased by as much as 9% if the burden of registration was eased. Table 1 indicates that respondents in our sample moved three times on average between the ages of 16 and 23. In addition, to ensure that our identifying variable is not merely capturing some underlying propensity to move, i.e., the people who move frequently between the ages 16 and 23 may also move frequently in subsequent years, we include an additional control variable indicating the number of places the respondent lived between the ages of 23 and 33 in each of the dynamic panel models.            "
"42"," Table 2 presents five models of voter turnout. Model 1 estimates the static probit model. Model 2 estimates the naïve random effects probit model where the lagged dependent variable is included alongside the time invariant and time‐varying characteristics. Model 3 extends model 2 by including the averages of all the time‐varying covariates in order to control for fixed effects unobserved heterogeneity. Model 4 estimates the initial conditions probit model of the 1979 election. From this the generalized probit error term is calculated and finally model 5 reestimates model 3, but includes the generalized probit error term in order to control for initial conditions.         "
"43","Model 1, which includes both time‐varying and time invariant factors but excludes voter turnout in the previous election, is estimated in order to compare the magnitude of the explanatory variables in the static and dynamic models. It allows us to examine whether failing to account for persistence artificially inflates the sociodemographic determinants. It shows that the characteristics that make one economically successful, such as having high levels of education, being hardworking, and having high cognitive ability, are also likely to induce turnout. Several of the personal characteristics also influencing turnout including being married, having children, being a trade union member, and having parents from a high social class are all associated with a higher probability of voting, while being male, having poor mental health, and having a high level of residential mobility between the ages of 23 and 33 have the opposite effect. Trade union membership, followed by being married, has the largest substantive impact on turnout, such that it increases the probability of voting by 5.4% and 4%, respectively. This static model assumes that turnout can only be influenced by individual characteristics and that past voting behavior is essentially irrelevant for current voting decisions. In order to test the strength of this assumption the next model allows for a relationship between past and current voting behavior."
"44","Model 2 estimates a dynamic random effects probit model, which controls for persistence in voter turnout by including the lagged dependent variable. Lagged turnout exerts a positive and highly significant influence on current turnout: individuals who turned out to vote in the previous election are 26.1%13 more likely to turn out in the current election. This suggests a substantial amount of voting behavior is driven by persistence, and indeed its effect dwarfs all the other covariates. However, given that around 80% of the sample voted in the last two waves this figure is not credible. Its inclusion leaves the remaining covariates largely unchanged from model 1. While the substantive impact of several of the variables has fallen slightly, and staying on beyond the minimum school‐leaving age and residential mobility between the ages of 23 and 33 are no longer significant, the changes are modest given the inclusion of lagged turnout.         "
"45","As discussed earlier, one of the main problems with this dynamic model is that it fails to take account of unobserved heterogeneity. Therefore, the apparently high level of persistence in voter turnout may be driven by factors which are not included in the model. By failing to control for these unobserved characteristics we cannot determine whether the high level of persistence is really habit formation. We overcome this problem in model 3 by controlling for fixed effects unobserved heterogeneity by including the means of the time‐varying covariates as discussed earlier. The results indicate that unobserved heterogeneity is not substantially driving the persistence in turnout. If it were an issue, then controlling for it by including the averages should reduce the magnitude of the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable. While this parameter does fall, it is by a very modest amount: 26.1% to 25.6%. As the averages are only included as controls for heterogeneity the coefficients themselves are of no direct interest. The time‐varying and time‐invariant covariates remain largely unchanged, with the exception of poor mental health which is no longer statistically significant. The marginal effect of turning out to vote if the respondent has children, however, has actually increased."
"46","While model 3 suggests that the extent of habit formation is quite large and that estimating the model in a dynamic form is appropriate, it does not address the initial conditions problem. One can overcome this problem by modelling the first observed period, i.e., 1979 election, within a static framework and using the predicted values from this model to generate a generalized error term which can then be included in the dynamic model. Including one (or more) variable that influences the first election, but not the rest, allows us to identify the model. Model 4 therefore presents the estimates for the initial conditions probit regression of the 1979 election, and includes the time‐varying covariates, time‐invariant covariates, the averages of the time‐varying covariates, and the identifying variable—the number of places the respondent lived between the ages of 16 and 23."
"47","The determinants of the 1979 election differ somewhat from those in the dynamic models. Being male, married, a union member, and having a high level of education or poor mental health has little influence on the probability of voting in the first election. The impact of all the remaining variables increases in magnitude (with the exception of having children). Being hardworking as opposed to lazy, having high ability, and staying in education beyond 16 all increase the probability of voting in the 1979 election by 3.3%, 3.4%, and 7.0%, respectively. They all have a greater impact on voting in the first election than in subsequent elections, consistent with Plutzer's (2002) hypothesis that certain characteristics influence voters' decisions in their first election, but these factors diminish in importance over time. Finally, the identifying variable exerts a negative and significant impact on turnout, such that a respondent who lived in five places around the time of the election was 13.2% less likely to have voted in the first election compared to someone who lived in one place throughout the period (4 × 0.033).         "
"48","Using the equation outlined in the modelling section, a generalized probit error term was calculated using the predicted values from model 4. Model 5 then replicates model 3 but also includes this term. While all the other covariates remain largely unchanged, controlling for initial conditions has a major impact on the lagged dependent variable. The probability that a respondent will vote in the current election if he or she voted in the previous one has roughly halved—from 25.6% to 13.1%. This suggests that a large part of the correlation over time in persistence in voter turnout can be accounted for by initial conditions. However, there is still a significant portion of persistence which can be attributed to habit formation. Controlling for all other factors, both observed and unobserved, simply turning out to vote in one election increases one's probability of voting in a future election by 13%. This figure is substantially lower than the approximately 50% figure found in both experimental (Gerber, Green, and Shachar 2003) and panel (Green and Shachar 2000) studies. Given that the baseline proportion of voting is around 80%, a marginal effect of 13% (i.e., 13 percentage points) is more plausible. As explained earlier, these articles are likely to seriously overestimate the degree of habit. Our result corresponds almost exactly with Orme's (2001) Monte Carlo estimates, which find that the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is 96% higher when one ignores the initial conditions problem.         "
"49","The validity of our identifying variable is reinforced by including residential mobility between the first and second election as a control variable in the dynamic models. We find that while residential mobility between the ages of 16 and 23 has a significant impact on turnout in the first election, future mobility in the period after this election (between the ages of 23 and 33) has little impact on turnout in subsequent elections."
"50","The r coefficient, and its corresponding likelihood test, which are reported at the end of Table 2, show the proportion of the total variance accounted for by the panel‐level variance component. An r of zero would indicate that the panel estimator is no different from the pooled estimator. The likelihood test reported at the end of model 2 and model 3 rejects the null hypothesis that r is zero, albeit only significant at the 10% level, while the corresponding test for model 5 is significant at the 1% level, suggesting that estimating the model as a panel is appropriate once unobserved heterogeneity is taken into account.         "
"51","In this article we observe voting behavior in the cohort's first, third, and fifth elections, rather than consecutive elections; therefore the degree of habit when examining consecutive elections is likely to be greater than our estimate of 13%. As a check on the robustness of our results we reestimated the model with an alternative method due to Wooldridge (2005) that deals with both initial conditions and fixed effects. We find that the results are close to those above with the marginal effect of past voting being 11% rather than 13%.         "
"52","In additional analysis we also investigated whether the degree of persistence varies among different populations.14 For example, one may hypothesize that the degree of habit may be lower for individuals with higher levels of education. By interacting lagged turnout with gender, education, and cognitive ability, for example, we found that persistence does not differ between males and females or individuals with different levels of education and ability.         "
"53","While the degree of persistence does not differ, individual characteristics influence the probability of voting. For example, voting in the first election increases the probability of voting in the subsequent election by 89.8% (76.8 + 13) for a highly educated, high‐ability male who is a trade union member and married. The comparable figure for a low‐education, nonhardworking male who is not a union member and comes from a low social class is 66.5% (53.3 + 13). The probability that a married woman with children who has a high level of education will vote in the subsequent election if she voted in the first election is 87.2% (74.2 + 13). The comparable figure for a low‐education, low‐ability woman from a low social class is 70.6% (57.6 + 13)."
"54","For voting behavior, history matters, but not nearly as much as previous studies have suggested. While much of the literature on voter turnout is concerned with identifying why people turn out to vote, this article addresses whether people consistently turn out to vote. Analysing the extent of persistence in voter turnout is important, especially given recent concerns about declining turnout rates among young adults (see Highton and Wolfinger 2001; Plutzer 2002; Russell 2004). Persistence in voter turnout can have significant implications for policies designed to increase electoral participation. For example, if individuals are consistently likely to either vote or abstain from elections, it is important for them to enter a voting state early in life (Franklin 1994). Political education in childhood may therefore help to prevent the habit of nonvoting before it actually begins. Hence, investments made in policies targeting young adults should yield the greatest return.         "
"55","However, to successfully implement these policies it is first necessary to know the extent to which persistence in voter turnout can be attributed to habit. It is likely that campaigns to increase voter turnout will be more effective if persistence is driven by habit formation rather than unobserved individual characteristics. While evidence of persistence in turnout exists, few studies have distinguished between these two drivers of persistence, as doing so is empirically difficult."
"56","This article therefore draws from the econometrics literature to apply suitable techniques to deal with both issues. It finds that the impact of fixed effects/unobserved heterogeneity is the lesser of the two problems. Our naïve model of turnout, where we fail to control for fixed effects or initial conditions, suggests that an individual who voted in the previous election is 26.1% (i.e., 26.1 percentage points) more likely to vote in the current election. While controlling for fixed effects does little to change this result (only reducing it by one‐half of a percentage point), taking account of initial conditions reduces the impact of previous turnout decisions on current turnout decisions by a half. This implies that the initial conditions problem may even be greater in studies where the first wave of the panel does not correspond with the voters' first experience of elections—for example, they may have voted in previous, but unobserved, elections. Therefore, the initial conditions problem may be even more pronounced when using standard panel data which do not track individuals from early in life."
"57","This study finds that once one controls for socioeconomic, demographic, and psychological factors, unobserved additional characteristics and initial conditions, an individual who voted in the previous election is 13% more likely to vote in the current election—half of the previous estimate. The results of this article shed some light on the common finding in the literature that turnout increases as the respondent gets older. Moreover, Rosenstone and Hansen's (1993, 137) explanation of “life experiences” or Highton and Wolfinger's explanation of “pure learning” (2001, 208) may actually be a result of habit, such that the more an individual engages in an act, the more that act becomes self‐reinforcing, and hence it becomes a habit.         "
"58","That habit is not as important as had been previously thought provides a renewed challenge to political scientists to identify the fundamental variables that drive turnout decisions. This may require studying domains not commonly analysed in the literature such as the psychological and biological. For example, recent work explores the role of personality, cognitive ability, and health (Denny and Doyle 2007, 2008) while the importance of genetic determinants has recently been advanced by Fowler, Baker, and Dawes (2008) and Fowler and Dawes (2008).         "
"59","The increasing availability of longitudinal data in the social sciences promises to provide a greater ability to explore the dynamics of individual decisions over the life cycle, including their political behavior. The key contribution of this article is to show that careful attention to the statistical problems inherent in using such data is essential. Using the wrong estimators can actually aggravate the problem and give highly misleading estimates—in this case an overestimation of the extent of habit. In particular, it is critical that one allows for the fact that politicization starts before the voting age and has long‐lasting consequences for political behavior. By using more precise statistical methods which control for individual heterogeneity, and deriving new determinants of voting behavior, the field is coming closer to identifying more comprehensive models of voter turnout."
"60"," Missing Data and Multiple Imputations             "
"61","In order to provide a rigorous test of whether our estimated results are affected by attrition bias and missing data, we use multiple imputation methods to generate data for missing or incomplete data in our panel. We use Amelia II (Honaker, King, and Blackwell 2007) which uses a bootstrapping‐based EMB algorithm to perform the imputation. This package allows us to incorporate information about trends in the time series data (Honaker and King 2007). Multiple imputation uses information contained in the observed data to generate data for each missing cell. We do not generate imputed data for all missing data in the panel as much of the attrition occurred when the respondents were children. Therefore we only impute data for those who reported at least some data in the 1981 wave, i.e., those who are eligible to vote. This increases our estimation sample from 10,498 to 25,074. Using Amelia, we generate five imputed datasets and re‐estimate our models of interest for each new dataset.            "
"62"," Table B below presents a summary of these results by reporting the degree of persistence (lagged turnout) for models 2, 3, and 5. Results are consistent across all five datasets. It shows that the degree of persistence in turnout ranges from 19% to 19.8% in the naïve model (model 2), and is relatively unaffected by controlling for fixed effects unobserved heterogeneity in model 3, ranging from 18.6% to 19.5%. Finally, similar to the non‐imputed results, controlling for initial conditions in model 5 reduces persistence by over a half, ranging from 7.9% to 8.9%. These estimates based in the imputed data are lower than our original estimates by ∼5–7%, which suggests that the degree of persistence may be even lower than originally estimated. The comparable estimates are higher in the original models (26%, 25.6%, and 13%, respectively) as individuals who choose to remain in the panel overtime, and provide full information about their voting behavior, are also the type of people who are more likely to consistently vote. Therefore our original coefficients may potentially be biased upwards. However, these imputed results confirm that our methods used to deal with unobserved heterogeneity and initial conditions hold.            "
