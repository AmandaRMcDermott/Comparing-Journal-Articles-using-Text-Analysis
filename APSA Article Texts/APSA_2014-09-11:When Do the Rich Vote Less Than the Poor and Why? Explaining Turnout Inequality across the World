"1","All other things being equal, poor or uneducated people face relatively higher cognitive and informational costs of voting than the rich (or educated).3 Given the relative ease with which the wealthy can turn out to vote, it is important to understand the institutional and socioeconomic contexts in which wealthy voters will be less likely to vote. Our central claim is that the wealthy turn out to vote at higher rates when the potential tax exposure of the rich is high, that is, when those who make policy have greater incentives to tax the wealthy and when those who implement policy have the ability to collect revenue. In this article we focus on two contextual factors affecting the potential tax exposure of the rich—the political salience of redistribution and the state's capacity to tax income.4"
"2","The likelihood that wealthy voters will be taxed is greater where redistribution from the rich to the poor is an important issue for parties and voters. The role of political elites is a key part of our argument because decisions to turn out to vote are influenced by politicians' strategic decisions to appeal to constituencies defined by particular policy preferences Aldrich (1993). Where redistribution is salient, politicians have an incentive to mobilize both rich and poor supporters. Even if parties supported by the wealthy do not have more resources to draw upon, they possess supporters who are more easily induced to turn out to vote and opponents whose turnout is more easily suppressed.         "
"3","The importance of redistribution in party politics is only one factor affecting the potential tax exposure of the rich. The potential tax exposure of the relatively wealthy is also higher where bureaucracies are able to collect revenue. Effective taxation requires the government to identify taxpayers, assess their liability, and collect taxes. While leaders' decisions to raise revenue are influenced by short‐term political imperatives, developing the bureaucratic capacity to tax the citizens takes time. Therefore, a lack of bureaucratic capacity may make it harder to “soak the rich” even when political leaders would prefer to do so.5 Because state capacity changes slowly over time and because the historical origins of state capacity are complex, we discuss potential sources of endogeneity in the empirical section below.         "
"4","In making the case that the salience of redistribution will lead to higher relative turnout among the rich, we have argued that, where competing parties seek to mobilize voters along class lines, parties of the poor have a disadvantage in mobilizing their supporters. However, focusing on bureaucratic capacity as a factor affecting the potential tax exposure of the rich raises the potential concern that low fiscal capacity may give politicians an advantage in mobilizing the poor. For example, Kitschelt and Wilkinson (2007) argue that low bureaucratic capacity leads to vote buying and other forms of clientelism because politicians can more easily use the resources of the state to win elections.         "
"5","Research on vote buying and patronage suggests that the relatively poor are more likely to receive pre‐election inducements contingent upon their vote (e.g., Stokes et al. 2013). However, in many places where this type of political exchange takes place, there are few parties competing on pro‐poor policy platforms because the potential tax exposure of the rich is low.6 Where government spending could be financed by taxation, it seems unlikely that the relatively wealthy would allow politicians to compete primarily for the votes of the poor. To make this point clear, consider what happens when the wealthy have less of an incentive to participate in electoral politics. In this case, the income of the median likely voter is lower. Although competition for the votes of the poor probably takes a different form from competition over votes across classes, where the wealthy can be taxed, they are unlikely to favor the redistributive consequences of this kind of political competition.         "
"6","Our two measures of the potential tax exposure of the rich are related because redistribution is more likely to be politically salient where fiscal capacity is high. However, bureaucratic capacity is not the only determinant of the political salience of redistribution. People may vote for nonmaterial reasons. Even if people are motivated by material gain, the economic interests of the rich may not always diverge from those of the poor. The wealthy, for instance, may value public goods such as national security and infrastructure (Lizzeri and Persico 2004). In addition, redistribution may be politically salient even where bureaucratic capacity is low if the rich and the poor share common attributes—such as ethnic identity or region—that allow policy makers to cheaply offer group‐specific and non‐excludable benefits based upon these attributes (Fernandez and Levy 2008; Huber and Ting 2013). Finally, formal institutions affect how voters' preferences for redistribution are translated into party platforms and policy (Persson and Tabellini 2003).         "
"7","We study turnout inequality in 76 countries from 1996 to 2010 using survey data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), the Global Barometer Project, the World Values Survey (WVS), and the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP).7 Together, these surveys cover 187 country‐rounds, and we retain data from all the surveys in our analysis.         "
"8","Two popular approaches to measuring the political salience of redistribution—citizens' ideological positions and the content of party manifestos—can only be used for some of the countries we study. Survey researchers tend not to ask questions on ideology where it is assumed to be irrelevant, reducing the number of countries for which we can use survey data on citizens' ideological self‐placement on a left‐right scale. Moreover, where parties do not emphasize programmatic policies, party manifestos are uninformative; therefore, studies examining party manifestos cover only a few of the countries in our sample (e.g., Benoit and Laver 2006).            "
"9","Instead, we measure the salience of redistributive politics as the degree to which the political preferences of rich and poor voters diverge. Our approach is similar in principle to the approach taken in studies on class voting in advanced industrialized countries that seek to explain whether members of the working class support left‐wing parties (e.g., Evans 2000). But we cannot use the indices of class voting in these studies because we do not measure class in the traditional sense, and there are no self‐defined left‐wing parties in many of the countries we study.            "
"10","Our main measure of the salience of redistribution is Voting Polarization, which captures the degree to which people in each quintile support different political parties. This measure is an extension of a measure of polarization developed by Esteban and Ray (1994), which describes a one‐dimensional distribution as more polarized if positions along that dimension are clustered, if countries are more widely dispersed, and if there is greater homogeneity within countries. Although the Esteban‐Ray measure of polarization was initially developed to characterize the distribution of income, it has been adapted to measure ideological and ethnic polarization. Following Desmet, Weber, and Ortuño Ortín (2009), Huber (2012) uses a modified version of the Esteban‐Ray polarization statistic to measure ethnic voting. Because we measure the degree to which political preferences diverge by quintile, Voting Polarization is defined as               "
"11","Voting Polarization is greatest when there are only two groups and if the distance between those groups equals 1, that is, if there is no overlap in the parties members of different quintiles support. We also use the electoral distance between the voting preferences of the richest and poorest quintiles (r15) as an alternative measure of the salience of redistribution.            "
"12","An ideal measure of state capacity would capture the capability of state institutions to execute policies regardless of the extent to which policy makers choose to use it. For this reason, state capacity is particularly hard to measure. Social scientists have attempted to measure state capacity in a number of different ways, none of which fully circumvents the problems associated with measuring unused potential."
"13","Our preferred measure of state capacity is Bureaucratic Quality as measured by the Political Risk Services Group (PRSG). The PRSG has a ratings system that measures political, financial, and economic risk across 166 countries. Bureaucratic Quality ranges from 1 to 5 and takes on a higher value in countries where the bureaucracy can govern autonomously and if there are established mechanisms for training and staffing the civil service. The index gives low scores to countries where changes in government can lead to drastic changes in policy formulation and/or administrative routines. As Hendrix (2010) notes, this measure is a standard proxy for state capacity. In addition, authors advocating more data‐intensive measures of state capacity have used Bureaucratic Quality to validate their new measure (Chong et al. 2012; Driscoll and Naidu 2012).            "
"14","We also test whether our models are robust to three other measures of state capacity, each of which differs from bureaucratic quality in important ways The Government Effectiveness measure is part of the World Bank's data set on governance indicators and is created by aggregating various sources measuring perceptions of the quality of public services. Like Bureaucratic Quality, Government Effectiveness measures the extent to which the civil service can formulate and implement policy autonomously, but Government Effectiveness also captures “the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies” (Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2010).8 Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has been used to measure state capacity, particularly in the literature on civil conflict (Fearon and Laitin 2003; Hendrix 2010, 4). Unlike the bureaucratic quality measure, GDP per capita captures not only the effectiveness of a country's institutions but the overall wealth of a country's population as well. Finally, the share of government revenue from direct taxes (Direct Taxes/Revenue), which are levied based on characteristics of the taxpayer, are used to measure state capacity because collecting these taxes is relatively difficult (Lieberman 2002). Although effective direct taxation requires long‐term investments in infrastructure, the share of revenue from direct taxation captures current fiscal policy as well as the potential tax exposure of the rich.            "
"15","Our primary measure of respondents' relative socioeconomic status within a country uses data on asset ownership. Where data on consumption are absent or are unreliable, social scientists frequently use assets to measure economic well‐being. Filmer and Pritchett (2001) argue that asset indices are a good proxy for long‐run socioeconomic status, a concept that fits well with our theory of the structural conditions under which the voting preferences of the rich and poor differ. Indeed, asset indices may be a better measure of living standards than data on income where large numbers of respondents rely on seasonal employment or are not paid at a fixed regular wage (Filmer and Pritchett 2001; Montgomery et al. 2000).            "
"16","We constructed a wealth index, which is the first principal component of a principal components analysis of assets by country, and used it to place respondents into quintiles.9 Principal components analysis gives greater weight to assets that are held by fewer people, resulting in an index that discriminates as much as possible between households within a country. In the Findings section, we show that our results are robust to changing the way in which wealth is defined.            "
"17","As noted above, electoral institutions affect turnout inequality by altering the cost of voting to individuals and by affecting the strategies politicians use to mobilize groups of voters. All regressions control for whether a country has proportional representation (PR) because PR both raises the cognitive costs of casting a ballot and increases politicians' incentives to turn out the vote (Gallego 2009; Jusko and Shively 2005; Powell 1986).10 It is likely that where compulsory voting is enforced, sanctions will fall disproportionately on the poor.11 We also include an indicator for whether the most recent presidential and legislative elections were concurrent because turnout is higher when voters select candidates for multiple jurisdictions (Aldrich 1993; Lijphart 1997).            "
"18","It may be the case that governments are less responsive on nonredistributive issues where redistribution is not politically salient and/or where there is low bureaucratic capacity. If this is the case, the rich may be more aware of this lack of responsiveness than the poor and refrain from voting as a result. Therefore, we control for democratic quality using a country's Polity score and exclude from the analysis all countries with a Polity score of–4 or less."
"19","Our analysis defines a person's income in relative terms by country, but it is possible that absolute levels of economic well‐being have implications for political behavior. Existing research on voting behavior makes opposing predictions regarding the relationship between citizens' absolute level of well‐being and turnout inequality. Accounts of voting behavior that emphasize the role of cognitive skills and access to information in predicting turnout suggest that the poorest voters ought to be even less likely to turn out to vote in relatively poor countries than in rich ones. Alternatively, a common explanation for the prevalence of vote buying is that below some threshold level of income, people highly discount future income and are more receptive to pre‐election bribes, despite the existence of parties that offer pro‐poor policy.            "
"20","We capture cross‐national variation in the well‐being of citizens by controlling for infant mortality.12 We use infant mortality rather than GDP per capita because, as noted above, GDP per capita captures both bureaucratic capacity and the wealth of citizens. Table 1, which is a matrix of bivariate correlations between our key explanatory variables, demonstrates that GDP per capita and both measures of bureaucratic quality are closely correlated.            "
"21","A second consequence of measuring income in relative terms is that people in the top and bottom quintiles will grow further apart as inequality increases. Although inequality is arguably related to the potential tax exposure of the rich, the relationship between income inequality and turnout inequality is not obvious. While increasing the potential benefits of political participation for the poor, inequality may also demoralize poor voters and/or encourage the wealthy to influence policy beyond the ballot box (Goodin and Dryzek 1980; Solt 2008). We control for inequality using Gini coefficients estimated from household surveys and using gross income (i.e., income before taxes and transfers) from Milanovic (2013). We use gross rather than net income to measure inequality because Gini coefficients constructed using net income are likely to capture a state's tax capacity and current redistributive policy (Milanovic 2000).            "
"22","We control for two other socioeconomic variables that are likely to be associated with both unequal turnout and the low tax exposure of the rich. First, governments that are unable to tax their citizens may also be unable to maintain order. Therefore, casting a ballot may expose citizens to crime and political violence where state capacity is low. It would be problematic for our theory if the rich are more likely to be deterred by the prospect of violence than the poor. Haid and Wilkinson (2009) show that riots in India decrease turnout, but, at present, there is no empirical evidence on whether violence affects the turnout of the rich and the poor to different degrees. We control for the likelihood of violence at the ballot box using the homicide rate.13"
"23","Finally, we control for ethnic diversity as measured by Fearon (2003) in all of our regressions. The salience of redistribution may be lower where voters support co‐ethnic candidates for noninstrumental reasons Horowitz (1985). In addition, over the long term, investments in public goods and/or bureaucratic capacity may have been lower in ethnically diverse places.            "
"24","We test our claim that the potential tax exposure of the rich affects the rate at which the rich turn out to vote. We adopt a two‐stage estimation strategy in which the effect of income on voting is estimated separately for each country and survey pair and in which these estimates are the outcome variable in a second regression with country‐level predictors of turnout inequality."
"25","We estimate the effect of income on voting in each country‐survey pair using the following model in which the outcome variable is whether an individual (i) voted in the most recent election.            "
"26","The individual attributes () that determine turnout include age, age‐squared, secondary education, gender, and residence in an urban area. Although education, like income, is negatively associated with voting in some countries, we include it in all first‐stage regressions. To make it easier to compare continuous and binary variables, all continuous variables were rescaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5.         "
"27","Figure 2 shows the relative turnout rates of the rich are higher where redistribution is more salient and in countries with greater Bureaucratic Quality and higher Voting Polarization. Figure 2 also confirms the pattern in the map of the ratio of turnout rates among the wealthiest and poorest citizens in Figure 1; the relationship between income and voting is positive in some countries and negative in others. Controlling for other individual characteristics decreases the cross‐country variation in the estimated relationship between income and voting, but a great deal of variation in turnout inequality remains to be explained.         "
"28","The Estimated Effect of Income"
"29","Notes: Estimates of  are for logistic regressions. The estimates of  in Figures 2b and 2d include controls for Age, Age‐Squared, Female, Urban, and Secondary Education.                     "
"30","In the second stage, we explore how institutional and economic variables in addition to our main independent variables affect . We estimate the following model:            "
"31","Our dependent variable  is estimated more precisely in some countries than others. We use a feasible generalized least squares estimator suggested by Hanushek (1974) to deal with likely heteroskedasticity in the second stage (see Lewis and Linzer 2005 for a discussion). This procedure constructs second‐stage weights that account for the sampling error of first‐stage estimates in . Because there are multiple surveys for some countries, our second‐stage standard error estimates are clustered by country.         "
"32","Table 2 reports estimated coefficients from second‐stage regressions in which the dependent variable is . Consistent with our theory, the relative turnout of the rich increases as the political preferences of the rich and poor diverge. Both Voting Polarization and the distance between the partisan preferences of citizens in the top and the bottom quintile (Electoral Distance Q1 and Q5) are positively associated with  and are statistically significant at conventional levels (Table 2, columns 1 and 2).14"
"33","We evaluate the relationship between turnout inequality and state capacity using four different measures. Column 3 shows that the relative turnout of the rich is positively correlated with Bureaucratic Quality. Columns 4–6 show that other measures of state capacity yield broadly similar results. Higher levels of Government Effectiveness, GDP per capita, and greater share of direct taxes in government revenue all increase the relative turnout of the rich. Even though a state's extractive capacity is notoriously difficult to measure, we are able to provide evidence for our expected relationship between capacity and the direction of turnout inequality using the proxies for state capacity that are most commonly used by political scientists.         "
"34","As noted above, increasing inequality may increase the amount the relatively wealthy have to lose in fair elections, but it may also increase the cost of collective action for the poor. We find that inequality measured using gross income does not increase the relative turnout of the rich.15 Solt (2008)finds that inequality depresses the political participation of the poor in advanced industrialized countries. Our findings probably differ because we control for bureaucratic capacity, which is closely correlated with inequality (see Table 1). Restricting our sample to only the richest countries does not substantively alter our main findings.16 In addition, we do not find a negative relationship between inequality and the relative turnout of the poor in this group of relatively wealthy countries.         "
"35","Because socioeconomic status is not always the most important political cleavage in a country, we control for ethnic fractionalization in all our regressions. However, the relative sizes of ethnic groups may not be the relevant dimension of ethnic difference, and, therefore, we demonstrate that our findings are robust to two alternative ways of measuring the salience of ethnicity. First, co‐ethnics may share policy preferences because their economic interests are correlated. Members of the same ethnic group may jointly benefit from local public goods politicians have within their powers to gift, or they may share the same economic status, making redistribution from the rich to the poor inherently ethnically biased. To explore whether turnout inequality arises because of economic differences between ethnic groups, we control for between‐group inequality as measured by Baldwin and Huber (2010). Our findings on voting polarization are substantively the same when we control for between‐group inequality. Ethnic differences do not necessarily drive policy preferences. Therefore, we also control for the degree to which members of different ethnic groups support different parties. Controlling for ethnic voting, as measured by Huber (2012), leaves our main findings unchanged.17"
"36","Our findings are robust to two different ways of measuring citizens' relative wealth within a country. We defined quintiles using wealth indices where data on assets are available, as well as self‐reported income when data on assets are not available. Our main findings are generally similar, although Bureaucratic Quality and Government Effectiveness are no longer statistically significant at conventional levels.18 In addition, we explore whether our results are sensitive to changing the form the distribution of the Wealth Index takes. Recall that, where data on assets are available, we placed respondents into quintiles using a wealth index created by applying principal components analysis to a bundle of assets listed in the survey. However, the assets survey researchers chose to measure wealth vary by region but not by country. Therefore, the distribution of the wealth index may be truncated in a few countries that are much richer (or poorer) than others in their region. Our findings are robust to dropping countries where the distribution of the Wealth Index is truncated.19"
"37","People tend to overreport turning out to vote. Overreporting presents a problem for our findings if rich people overreport voting at relatively higher rates where their potential tax exposure is high. It could be the case that in places where bureaucracies function well, political participation is more likely to be seen as normatively desirable. There is some evidence that educated people overreport voting in the advanced industrialized countries (Karp and Brockington 2005; Silver, Anderson and Abramson 1986). However, it is difficult to assess whether state capacity or voting polarization would systematically affect social desirability bias across income groups.         "
"38","Given our data, we cannot provide direct evidence on social desirability bias. However, if it were the case that the rich were more likely to overreport voting in contexts where social norms favor participation, we ought to find a positive correlation between the strength of democracy and the relative turnout of the rich. The absence of this positive correlation in almost all specifications increases our confidence that there is not a measurement‐based explanation for our findings.20"
"39","Another way of examining the potential effect of overreporting is to look at turnout inequality in education. Educated citizens have a clearer idea of the prevailing norms in a society, and, if social norms favored overreporting of voting, we would expect educated voters to turn out at relatively higher rates. Karp and Brockington (2005), for example, find that university graduates are more likely to overreport voting using survey data from five advanced industrialized countries. We replicate Table 2 using the estimated coefficient on secondary education in the first‐stage equation above and find that the turnout rates of citizens with higher education cannot be predicted by our variables measuring voting polarization or bureaucratic capacity.21"
"40","Bureaucratic capacity may be endogenous to turnout inequality. Because bureaucratic capacity takes time to build, it may be the case that the relative turnout of the rich is higher in places where bureaucratic quality has been high historically. There is an extensive literature on the origins of state capacity that emphasizes factors such as the role of external wars, colonial legacies, geography, land‐labor ratios, and access to foreign resources (Centeno 1997; Herbst 2000; Slater 2005; Tilly 1992).         "
"41","Of the several causes of bureaucratic capacity advanced in the literature, the factor that may jointly determine bureaucratic capacity and contemporary turnout inequality is the sequencing of the development of the bureaucracy and the introduction of universal suffrage. The wealthy may vote at higher rates where the suffrage was extended gradually because elites introduced universal suffrage while at the same time introducing institutional rules that disadvantaged poor voters.22"
"42","In addition, if a country lacks a strong bureaucratic apparatus before the introduction of universal suffrage, it may be unlikely to develop one afterward. Shefter (1977), for example, argues that patronage politics, and the erosion of bureaucratic autonomy it represents, tended to occur where there is no “constituency for bureaucratic autonomy” prior to the introduction of mass politics. He also argues that political parties that mobilized citizens who lacked the franchise were more likely to eschew patronage politics once the suffrage was extended. Rather than focusing on how historical legacies affect party strategy as Shefter (1977) does, Keefer (2007) argues low bureaucratic capacity persists in young democracies because voters do not find politicians' promises to deliver public goods credible.         "
"43","If the presence of a high bureaucratic capacity before the introduction of mass suffrage is key to the development and persistence of bureaucratic quality, we should be less likely to find a relationship between bureaucratic quality and the turnout of the rich in new states. Countries that became independent with universal suffrage present an especially hard test for our theory. However, if we limit our sample to the countries that became states after 1900, when universal suffrage became increasingly common, it remains the case that both bureaucratic capacity and the polarization in the preferences of rich and poor voters are positively correlated with relatively high turnout by wealthy voters.         "
"44","In addition, we use an instrumental variable approach used by Dincecco and Prado (2012) in an article on the effects of fiscal capacity on economic performance. The authors build on the works of Tilly (1992), Herbst (2000), Centeno (1997), and Besley and Persson (2009), who have argued that historical war making was central to the process of state formation and the creation of fiscal capacity in regions as diverse as Europe, Africa, and Latin America. They use the incidence of wars in the premodern era to instrument for current fiscal capacity.         "
"45","We follow their approach and use War Years—measured as the number of total years at war by state armed forces in conflicts from 1816 to 1913 for each country—to instrument for extractive capacity and exclude all endogenous institutional and economic control variables.23"
"46","In the first‐stage regressions, we treat War Years and regional dummies for Africa and Latin America as exogenous regressors because, as Centeno (1997) and Herbst (2000) argue, the relationship between warfare and state capacity may differ in these regions. This method relies on the plausible claim that conflicts occurring before World War I have no effect on current turnout inequality other than through their impact on a state's extractive capacity. The World War I cutoff is important because the war preceded the development of the welfare state and large‐scale social spending. Instrumenting for bureaucratic capacity in this way, we find that Bureaucratic Quality, Government Effectiveness, and GDP per capita increase the relative turnout of the rich, but that the share of government revenue from direct taxation does not.24"
"47","Because of the conventional wisdom that the poor vote at lower rates than the rich, studies of inequality in voter turnout have focused on factors that inhibit the participation of the poor. We show that, in fact, the poor sometimes vote at higher rates than the rich. Moreover, much of what social scientists know about turnout inequality rests upon research in a case that is an outlier—the United States."
"48","Lower rates of political participation by the rich are puzzling both because there are good reasons why it may be more difficult for poor people to cast a ballot and because canonical tax‐and‐transfer models predict that the rich will be worse off if the median likely voter is even poorer than the median eligible voter. Our explanation for this outcome focuses on the structural conditions under which the wealthy are less likely to vote. If the potential tax exposure of the rich is high, politicians have an incentive to mobilize both rich and poor voters. However, parties representing the wealthy have greater resources and a more easily mobilized electorate. Consequently, the threat of potential taxation is likely to result in a higher relative turnout of the rich.         "
"49","Controlling for important institutional and economic correlates of aggregate turnout and turnout inequality, we find that the rich turn out to vote when the political preferences of the rich and the poor diverge. Moreover, despite the fact that education is a means through which people learn prevailing social norms, none of our measures of the potential tax exposure of the rich predict turnout inequality in education. We also show that bureaucratic quality increases the relative turnout of the rich using data drawn from expert surveys, GDP per capita, and the share of the government revenue derived from direct taxation. Because ethnicity is frequently an important political cleavage where economic status is not, we show that our findings are robust to alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and ethnic voting."
"50","We present evidence that our findings are unlikely to be due to two plausible alternative explanations. Although it is hard to predict how social norms interact with individual and contextual variables to produce social desirability bias in the reporting of turnout, the rich are no more likely to report turning out to vote than the poor in more democratic states. We address the potential endogeneity of both bureaucratic quality and the relatively high turnout of the rich by demonstrating that our findings are robust to a sample of new states and by instrumenting for bureaucratic capacity using the severity of premodern wars."
"51","This article has implications for research that, as Lijphart (1999) recommends, uses turnout as a measure for political equality or democratic quality. Cross‐national research exploring the relationship between redistribution and inequality sometimes uses turnout as a proxy for the political mobilization of the poor (Boix 2003; Franzese 2002; Iversen and Cusack 2000; Kenworthy and Pontusson 2005). Our findings suggest that aggregate turnout is only a valid proxy for the participation of the poor in some contexts.         "
"52","Studies evaluating interventions designed to improve accountability in poor countries frequently use turnout as a proxy for political participation in places where the poor vote at higher rates than the rich. However, this experimental literature includes research claiming that both increased and decreased turnout by voters informed of political malfeasance can be interpreted as a protest of the status quo. These contradictory findings on turnout are discussed in Pande (2011) review of experimental studies informing voters about candidate performance and policy. Our findings suggest that increased turnout may be a useful proxy for political mobilization by newly informed or empowered citizens only when the economic and political context allows for the possibility of credible political alternatives for marginalized citizens.         "
"53","The theory and findings presented in this article suggest three new avenues for future research. First, bureaucratic capacity is only one factor affecting the tax exposure of the rich, and it is rarely subject to exogenous shocks. Both the tax elasticity of assets owned by citizens and the states' access to resource rents could be used to study changes in turnout inequality. Second, we have argued that the state's extractive capacity is one reason redistribution may be politically salient, but the conditions under which bureaucratic capacity is more or less likely to influence voting polarization by income remain to be explored. Finally, although we find little evidence that relatively wealthy voters are deterred by high homicide rates, in practice, political and criminal violence are usually unevenly distributed within a country. Therefore, studies exploring how subnational variation in political violence affects turnout inequality could contribute to our understanding of the relationship between political violence and redistribution."
