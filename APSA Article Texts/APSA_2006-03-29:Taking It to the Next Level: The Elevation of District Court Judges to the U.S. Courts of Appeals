"1","Before turning to our specific hypotheses, we lay bare the assumptions that underly much of our argument. While it is likely that presidents pursue a number of goals when appointing judges (see Goldman 1997), our first simplifying assumption is that all presidents are interested in selecting judges who will hand down decisions that are compatible with the president's policy preferences. This assumption rests on an extensive set of studies indicating that policy concerns motivate the president when selecting judges (e.g., McFeeley 1987; Rowland and Carp 1996; Songer, Sheehan, and Haire 2000). A related assumption is that presidents want their judicial nominees to be confirmed by the Senate. While there may be scattered occasions when a president will receive some political gain from a failed nomination, a nominee generally does the president little good if he or she is not confirmed and thus never makes it to the bench. We also assume that presidents lack perfect information regarding both the likelihood of the nominee handing down favorable decisions and the confirmability of the nominee. Our final assumption is that district court judges are interested in being elevated to the appeals courts. Again, this is a simplifying assumption and it is possible that some district court judges might prefer to remain trial judges. However, we believe it is reasonable to assume that most district court judges would at least be willing to move up the judicial hierarchy.         "
"2","When confronted with an appeals court vacancy, the president often chooses to nominate a sitting district court judge to fill the vacancy. Elevating district court judges to fill appeals court vacancies can be an attractive strategy since often there will be more relevant information about a district court judge than other types of potential nominees. First, the nature of the judge's appointment to the district court may provide useful information. Being appointed by a Democratic president reveals that a judge likely has different policy preferences than a Republican appointee. Further, the fact that the judge has already been through the confirmation process once may provide information about the judge's confirmability. Second, the observable behavior of the judge once on the bench can also provide useful information to the president regarding the judge's likely behavior on an appeals court. Moreover, the policy‚Äêrelevant behavior of district judges is manifested under a set of constraints that are relatively similar to the constraints that will be faced by an appeals court judge. In contrast, the record of potential nominees in other settings (e.g., as an elected official) may not provide as reliable an indicator of the policy choices they would make as a federal judge. The first element of our argument is that the cues and signals that can be taken from a district court judge's appointment and career combine with the preferences of the president and Senate confronting the appeals court vacancy in question to determine the likelihood of the judge being elevated to fill the vacancy."
"3","A second element of our argument flows more from the institutional features of the Senate and the Courts of Appeals than from the assumptions listed above. The regional nature of the appeals courts combines with Senate practices to yield appointment norms regarding which types of judges are most eligible to fill a particular appeals court vacancy and which senators will play a disproportionate role in the confirmation of a nominee. We will take up each element of our argument in turn."
"4","If aspects of a district court judge's initial appointment and subsequent behavior on the bench provide useful information to the president and his advisers, how will this information then shape the likelihood of the judge being elevated to fill an appeals court vacancy? For a president seeking to appoint appeals court judges who are likely to decide cases and set precedents in a manner that reflects the president's policy preferences, any information regarding the likely future decision making of a possible appeals court judge will be particularly important. This type of information consists of both blunt cues and relatively precise signals. Starting with the former type of information, a president will expect that a judge whom he appointed to a U.S. District Court will be more likely to hand down favorable decisions as an appeals court judge than a district court judge appointed by another president. After all, the president and his advisers presumably considered the compatibility between the judge's likely behavior and the president's preferences when the judge was appointed to the district court (Goldman 1997).            "
"5","                              "
"6","A district court judge is more likely to be elevated to fill an appeals court vacancy if the president who initially appointed the judge is still in office."
"7","At any given point in time, most judges serving in the district courts were appointed by a previous president. A second blunt cue that a president will likely rely on when considering elevating a district court judge is the partisan identification of the president who appointed the judge to the district court. A number of studies indicate that judges behave differently according to the partisan identification of the appointing president (Goldman 1975; Kuersten and Songer 2003; Rowland and Carp 1996). A Republican appointee, for example, is much more likely than a Democratic appointee to share the policy preferences of a Republican president. Thus, a district court judge appointed by a Republican president is more likely to decide appeals court cases in a manner compatible with a Republican president's preferences. Presidents will rely on this basic cue regarding the likely behavior of nominees.            "
"8","                              "
"9","Elevation is more likely if the president confronting the vacancy is from the same party as the president who appointed the judge to the district court."
"10","The two cues discussed thus far are both blunt and beyond the control of the district court judge once they are sitting on the district court. There is a third type of information regarding the compatibility between the judge's preferences and those of the president, however, that is much more precise and under the control of the judge. During their tenures on the district courts, district court judges build up records that indicate their expressed policy preferences (Richardson and Vines 1970; Rowland and Carp 1996). For a president seeking to further his policy goals, a potential nominee's published decisions can signal the extent to which the judge would hand down favorable policy decisions if appointed to an appeals court.            "
"11","                              "
"12","The more a judge's published decisions are in line with the preferences of the sitting president confronting the vacancy, the greater the probability of the judge being elevated."
"13","Of course, the degree to which a judge's record of published decisions can be viewed as a reliable indicator of future behavior depends on the size of the record. When considering two judges who have records that are compatible with his preferences, a president can be more confident in the future behavior of the judge with the more extensive record. The raw number of decisions published will not directly affect the probability of a judge being elevated, but it will condition the effect of the compatibility of this record with the president's preferences. We expect that the more decisions the judge has published, the more that these decisions will shape the president's decision of whether to elevate the judge. Interestingly, district court judges largely determine whether their decisions are published (Rowland and Carp 1996, 118). Thus, they have a good deal of control over the direction and strength of the signals they send about their policy positions.            "
"14","                              "
"15","The positive effect of the compatibility of the judge's decisions with the president will be magnified by the number of the judge's decisions which have been published."
"16","Since nominations to the federal courts must be confirmed by the Senate, presidents will be constrained by Senate preferences when selecting nominees (Moraski and Shipan 1999). The positive effect of the compatibility of a district court judge's published decisions with the president's preferences will be conditioned by whether the Senate shares the president's preferences. When the president's party controls the Senate, a judge's ideological compatibility with the president will have a greater positive effect on the likelihood of the judge being elevated to fill an appeals court vacancy. This positive effect will be dimished when the Senate is not controlled by the president's party.            "
"17","                              "
"18","The positive effect of the compatibility of the judge's decisions with the president will be magnified when the president's party controls the Senate."
"19","Evidence suggests that Senate confirmation votes are also a function of the perceived qualifications of the judicial nominee (Segal, Cameron, and Cover 1992). The more qualified a nominee is, the greater the probability that the Senate will confirm the nominee. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary evaluates the professional qualifications of every judicial nominee and submits its ratings to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The president will generally prefer to select nominees who will be rated highly by the ABA and therefore more likely to be confirmed by the Senate. Qualitative evidence suggests that presidents do concern themselves with the merit of their judicial nominees (Chase 1972; Harris 1953; Richardson and Vines 1970). If the president is considering elevating a district court judge to an appeals court vacancy, then the ABA's rating of the judge when he or she was nominated to the district court should serve as a powerful cue indicating the type of rating that the judge might receive if nominated to an appeals court seat.2 The higher the ABA rating when the judge was nominated to the district courts, the greater the chance the judge will get a good rating if nominated again to a new judicial position. Presidents will therefore prefer to elevate judges who have been rated highly before.            "
"20","                              "
"21","The higher a judge's ABA rating when s/he was appointed to a district court, the greater the probability the judge will be elevated to fill an appeals court vacancy."
"22","Norms involving the intersection between geography and Senate politics also play a crucial role in the selection of judges to the U.S. Courts of Appeals. With the exception of the Federal and D.C. Circuit Courts, the U.S. Courts of Appeals are organized into geographical circuits. There is a strong expectation that the nominee to an appeals court seat should come from one of the states within the given circuit. A nominee to fill a vacancy on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, for instance, should come from Louisiana, Mississippi, or Texas. This norm is so strong that in the 50 years covered by this study there is not a single example of a district court judge being elevated to a numbered circuit court outside of their geographical circuit."
"23","Furthermore, for each of the appeals courts specific judgeships usually are associated with specific states. While there are a nontrivial number of exceptions, the norm is that an appeals court vacancy created by a death or resignation of a judge from a given state will be filled by someone from that state (Richardson and Vines 1970). On the other hand, a president may have more discretion as to the state from which to choose his nominee when the vacancy is created by legislation that adds a seat to the circuit.3 We expect that when a vacancy is created by the death or resignation of an appeals court judge, and the vacancy is thus attached to a particular state, district court judges from that state will have a greater chance of being elevated than judges from other states in the circuit.            "
"24","                              "
"25","A judge is more likely to be elevated to fill an appeals court vacancy when the vacancy is associated with the state in which the judge serves."
"26","A second norm resulting from the intersection of geography and Senate politics is that of ‚Äúsenatorial courtesy‚Äù (Carp and Stidham 1998; Harris 1953; Rowland and Carp 1996). Under this norm, a nomination to the lower federal courts should be acceptable to the senators from the state associated with the vacancy. If a nominee is unacceptable to these senators, the Senate typically will fail to confirm the nominee (Goldman 1997). Therefore, a president must consider the preferences of the home state senators when selecting a judicial nominee.4 Specifically, a president's choice of nominee will be less constrained when the home state senators share the same policy preferences as the president. The president's choice will be more constrained and confirmation difficulties will be more likely if he nominates a judge from a state in which the senators do not share the president's preferences.5 Assuming that presidents seek to avoid such constraints and confirmation difficulties, we hypothesize that the ideological positions of the senators from a given state affect the likelihood a district court judge from that state will be elevated to fill an appeals court vacancy.            "
"27","                              "
"28","The greater the ideological distance between a president and the senators from a given state, the less likely the president is to elevate a judge from that state."
"29","Finally, the appointment norms resulting from the geographic nature of the numbered courts of appeals also affect the degree to which a district court judge is competing with other judges to be elevated to an appeals court vacancy. The appeals courts vary in the number of district court judges located within the circuit, and states vary in the same manner. Regarding elevation to an appeals court, a district court judge is in ‚Äúcompetititon‚Äù with other district court judges, particularly those of the same party, in his or her state and circuit. There is a partisan component to this competition because, as we discussed above, presidents will rely heavily on partisan cues when elevating a district court judge. Democratic appointees, for example, are primarily competing with other Democratic appointees, not their Republican colleagues."
"30","                              "
"31","The larger the number of district court judges within a judge's state who were appointed by a president of the same party as the judge, the less likely the judge is to be elevated to fill a given vacancy."
"32","The larger the number of district court judges within a judge's circuit who were appointed by a president of the same party as the judge, the less likely the judge is to be elevated."
"33","We began constructing our dataset by assembling data on all federal district court judges appointed between 1946 and 1995.6 For each of these 1,305 judges, we identified all the vacancies on the relevant appeals court during the district court judge's tenure.7 By ‚Äúrelevant vacancy,‚Äù we refer to an appeals court vacancy occurring within the judge's circuit.8 For a judge on the Nevada District Court, for example, we identified all the vacancies occurring on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals during the judge's career.9 We then structured the data so that for each district court judge there is an observation for each relevant appeals court vacancy that opened and was filled between the judge's appointment to the district court and the end of their tenure as a district court judge.10 In short, the unit of analysis is the judge‚Äîvacancy dyad. The dependent variable in our analysis is whether the judge was elevated (i.e., nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate) to fill the vacancy in question.11"
"34","There are a number of issues raised by the structure of our data. First, there are judges whose tenure ends due to reasons other than elevation to an appeals court. In addition to elevation, a judge's tenure on a district court can end as a result of death, retirement, resignation, impeachment and removal by Congress, or assumption of senior status. Second, for the vast majority of district court judges in our data there are several relevant vacancies that occurred during their tenure. This means that for any given judge we have multiple observations in our data. As a result, we might expect the error associated with a judge for one observation (e.g., the first relevant vacancy they experience) might be correlated with the error associated with a second observation for that judge (e.g., the second vacancy they experience)."
"35","We deal with these issues by treating the data as competing risks, discrete‚Äêtime duration data (see Box‚ÄêSteffensmeier and Jones 1997). Duration data are data in which the researcher is interested in the timing and occurrence of an event. With duration data, time is of central concern and can be either continuous or broken up into discrete units. Our duration data is of the discrete variety as the unit of time under analysis is the appeals court vacancy.         "
"36","To illustrate this, consider the career of Judge Robert Chapman. Nixon appointed Chapman to the South Carolina District Court in 1971. Chapman continued as a district court judge as, over time, seven vacancies on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals opened and were filled. When an eighth vacancy arose on the Fourth Circuit, Reagan appointed Chapman to fill it, and we thus have eight observations for Chapman in our data. The first observation is for the first Fourth Circuit vacancy occurring after Chapman had been appointed to the district court. Each following observation corresponds to a subsequent vacancy.12 The vacancy therefore acts as the unit of time; but it is a discrete unit.         "
"37","Our duration data also have a competing risks element to them. While we are only interested in elevations, there are competing risks in the sense that a judge cannot be elevated at time t if they have retired at time t‚àí1. The typical way to treat competing risks duration data is to estimate a model in which the outcome of interest is the dependent variable and all other outcomes are only used to determine where the data should be censored. If Judge Chapman had retired right before the eighth vacancy we would only include observations for the first seven vacancies. Often researchers are interested in all the different outcomes or forms of risk and therefore estimate separate models for each (e.g., Zorn and Van Winkle 2000). In this project, we are only interested in the elevation of judges so we simply estimate a single model and treat all other outcomes (e.g., retirements and deaths) as censoring points.         "
"38","By treating our data as being in duration format, we are also able to address the issue of the nonindependence of residuals associated with a given judge. We simply account for ‚Äúduration dependence‚Äù on the right‚Äêhand side of the model (see Beck, Katz, and Tucker 1998). After experimenting with a number of functional forms, including splines and dummy variables, we conclude that the best way to account for duration dependence is by simply including the number of relevant vacancies for which the judge has been passed over as a linear variable.         "
"39","We estimate our discrete‚Äêtime duration model as a probit model (see Box‚ÄêSteffensmeier and Jones 1997). To account for the issue of the nonindependence of errors associated with a given vacancy, we estimate our model with robust standard errors that allow for errors to be correlated within a given vacancy.13 Additional modeling issues involving potential selection effects and the decision to pool our data are discussed in Appendices A and B.         "
"40"," Same President indicates whether the president who makes the appointment to fill the vacancy is the same president who nominated the judge in question to the district court.14President of Same Party equals one if the president who makes the appointment to fill the vacancy is of the same party as the president that appointed the judge to the district court.15 We measure the congruence of the judge's published decisions with the president's preferences (Presidential Compatibility with Judge's Record) as the proportion of liberal decisions made by the judge if a Democratic president is in office and the proportion of conservative decisions if a Republican president is in office.16 We expect the effect of Presidential Compatibility with Judge's Record to be conditioned by the size of the record. We measure Opinions Published as the number of opinions that the judge has published through the year in which the vacancy was filled. We then interact Opinions Published with Presidential Compatibility with Judge's Record and expect a positive coefficient for this interaction term. We also include Opinions Published in the model separately as a main effect (see Friedrich 1982).            "
"41","We include two independent variables flowing from our two hypotheses regarding the president's consideration of the potential confirmability of district court judges nominated to appeals court seats. We interact Unified Government (which equals one when the Senate is controlled by the president's party) with Presidential Compatibility with Judge's Record and expect a positive coefficient. The Previous ABA Rating of the judge is simply the rating the ABA gave the judge when he or she was nominated to the district court. This rating is a three‚Äêpoint scale ranging from 0 (Not Qualified) to 2 (Well‚ÄêQualified).17"
"42","We also hypothesize that a judge is most likely to be elevated to fill an appeals court vacancy if the vacancy is linked to the state in which the judge presides. Same‚ÄêState Vacancy equals one if the departing appeals court judge is from the same state as that in which the district court judge is seated, and zero otherwise. If the vacancy results from the creation of a new judgeship by Congress, then New Seat equals one. If both Same‚ÄêState Vacancy and New Seat equal zero, then the vacancy is one created by a departing appeals court judge from a different state than the district court judge under analysis.18 We measure President‚ÄìHome State Senator Distance as the absolute value of the difference between the president's DW‚ÄêNOMINATE score and the average DW‚ÄêNOMINATE score for the two senators from the state in which the district court judge in question is seated.19 The coefficient for this variable should be negative in direction. State‚ÄêLevel Competition and Circuit‚ÄêLevel Competition are measured as the number of district court judges of the same party as the judge under analysis in the judge's state and the judge's circuit, respectively. Both of these variables should exert a negative effect on the likelihood of a district court judge being elevated.            "
"43","In addition to the independent variables suggested by our hypotheses, we include a number of controls. Goldman (1997) concludes that presidents prefer to nominate judges who are middle‚Äêaged. We control for this influence by including Age (the age of the judge in years when the vacancy is filled) and Age2. We also include Seniority (the number of years since the judge was appointed to the district court) and Seniority2. We include both variables as quadratic functions because we expect curvilinear effects (see Bratton and Spill 2004).            "
"44","Given the relatively unique nature of the D.C. District Court, we include a dummy variable denoting whether a judge serves on this court (D.C. Judge). It is possible that whether a judge is eligible to retire with full benefits will affect the likelihood of elevation, and we therefore include Pension Eligible in our model. As mentioned earlier, we also include a variable, Duration, which consists of the number of vacancies that have opened and then been filled on the relevant appeals court since the judge in question was appointed to the district court. In other words, Duration is our time variable and the units of time are discrete in nature. Descriptive statistics for all the independent variables are presented in Table 1.            "
"45","Of all the district court judges in our data, 133 (10.2%) were elevated to an appeals court during the 1946 to 1995 time period. On average, these judges were elevated to the seventh relevant vacancy that opened up during their tenure on the district court. There is substantial variation in the number of relevant appeals court vacancies occurring before elevation, however. Bailey Aldrich, for example, was elevated to the first relevant vacancy to open during his career as a district court judge while Robert Manley Parker was not elevated until the 27th vacancy occurring during his tenure. The results of our model explaining the elevation of district court judges to the appeals courts are presented in Table 2. Overall, the results are supportive of most of our hypotheses and the set of independent variables we include is jointly significant.         "
"46","The estimate for Same President is in the predicted direction (positive) but is statistically insignificant. We therefore cannot conclude that a district court judge is more likely to be appointed to fill an appeals court vacancy when the president who initially appointed the judge is still in office. The positive and statistically significant estimate for President of Same Party, however, reveals that the probability of a judge being elevated increases if the president in office at the time of the vacancy is a member of the same party as the president who initially appointed the judge to the district court. We argue that this partisan component of the decision to elevate a judge flows from a president's desire to appoint like‚Äêminded judges to the appeals courts.         "
"47","The extent to which the judge's published decisions are congruent with the president's preferences (Presidential Compatibility with Judge's Record) also exerts a positive and significant effect on the judge's chances for being elevated to an appeals court vacancy. Judges deciding cases in a conservative manner, for example, are more likely to be elevated when a Republican president is in office. The decisions published by a district court judge act as a signal to the president regarding the relevant preferences of the judge and thus their likely future behavior on an appeals court.20"
"48","We also expect that amongst district court judges who are compatible with the president's preferences, those who have published a large number of opinions will be most likely to be elevated. The coefficient estimate for Presidential Compatibility √ó Opinions Published is positive as anticipated and is close to statistical significance. The size of a judge's record may affect the extent to which a president considers the ideological content of the record, although the evidence does not allow us to formally draw this conclusion.         "
"49","The coefficient estimate for Presidential Compatibility √ó Unified Government is not in the predicted direction. There is no support for our hypothesis that the ideological compatibility between a judge and the president will have a greater positive effect when the president's party controls the Senate.21"
"50","While partisan control of the Senate may not affect the career trajectory of a judge, the constitutional requirement that the Senate confirm all judicial nominees does play a role. The results of our analysis reveal that the Previous ABA Rating of a judge when s/he was appointed to a district court has a positive and statistically significant effect on their likelihood of being elevated to an appeals court in the future. The higher the judge's rating, the greater the probability of the judge being elevated to fill a given vacancy. The president is more likely to nominate a judge who was previously rated highly because the previous rating is a predictor of the rating the judge will get if nominated for an appeals court seat, which affects whether the Senate confirms the nominee. We should note, however, that a Chow test reveals that the effect of Previous ABA Rating is not statistically significant for observations occurring during the last three administrations in our analysis (Reagan, Bush, and Clinton). While ideological considerations still exert an effect on the elevation of district court judges, perceived judicial qualifications may no longer play an important role. This may be due to the criticism and controversy surrounding ABA ratings during the 1980s and 1990s. Although this criticism came from conservative sources, the diminishment of the effect of ABA ratings occurred under all three of these presidents, not just the Republicans.22"
"51","The nature of the appeals court vacancy also contributes to the odds of a district court judge being elevated to fill the vacancy. There are three possible scenarios: the vacancy is connected to the district court judge's state, the vacancy is connected to another state in the circuit, or the vacancy is a new seat unconnected as of yet to a particular state. Same‚ÄêState Vacancy and New Seat represent the effect of the first and last scenarios. The middle scenario is the reference or baseline category. The positive and significant estimates for these two variables reveal that a judge is more likely to be elevated to a same‚Äêstate or newly created vacancy than a vacancy connected to another state. A Wald test reveals that a judge is more likely to be appointed to fill a same‚Äêstate vacancy than a new seat.23"
"52","We expect the norm of senatorial courtesy to influence a district court judge's chances of elevation. Specifically, we hypothesize that the degree to which the president is compatible with the preferences of the senators from the judge's state will affect whether the judge gets elevated. Our results provide evidence for this effect as the estimate for President‚ÄìHome State Senator Distance is negative and statistically significant. A judge from a state with senators who are ideologically incongruent with the president is less likely to get elevated than a judge from a state with senators who share the president's policy preferences. Thus, while the preferences of the entire Senate do not seem to affect the likelihood of a given judge being elevated, the preferences of the two home state senators do play a role. We should point our that while we have couched this discussion in terms of the career prospects of individual judges, the results for this variable indicate that that the prospects for elevations are poor for all judges within a state represented by senators who are ideologically distant from the president.         "
"53","The results of our model indicate that State‚ÄêLevel Competition decreases the probability of a district court judge being appointed to fill an appeals court vacancy. If, for instance, there are a large number of Republican appointees sitting on the district courts within a state, then the probability of any one of these judges being elevated decreases. The number of same‚Äêparty district court judges within a circuit (Circuit‚ÄêLevel Competition) also acts to diminish the likelihood of a judge from that party being elevated to a given vacancy.         "
"54"," Age and Seniority behave in the manner we expect. The positive estimate for Age and negative estimate for Age2 indicate that Age initially exerts a positive effect on the likelihood of elevation. As the judge gets older, however, age eventually decreases the judge's chances of becoming an appeals court judge. Specifically, our results show that, holding everything else constant, a judge is most likely to be elevated when they are between 48 and 49 years old.24Seniority also exerts an initially positive and then later negative influence on the probability of being elevated to an appeals court vacancy. A judge who has served on a district court for 13 years is most likely to be appointed to fill a vacancy. In short, the best case scenario for someone desiring to move up the federal judicial hierarchy is to be appointed to a district court when they are 35 or 36 years old and then hope that a vacancy arises in the relevant appeals court 13 years later.         "
"55","Finally, the estimate for Pension Eligible is insignificant while the negative and significant estimate for Duration reveals that the more relevant vacancies that have occurred and been filled during a district court judge's tenure, the less likely it is that the judge will be selected to fill a subsequent vacancy. In other words, the more times that the judge has been passed over, the less likely it is that they will ever become an appeals court judge. Essentially, this result reveals that there is negative temporal dependence.         "
"56","To provide a feel for the substantive effect sizes of the statistically significant variables in our model (with the exception of Age and Seniority), we present predicted probabilities in Table 3. We generated these probabilities by varying the independent variable of interest while holding all other variables constant at their means.25 For dichotomous and ordinal variables, the probability of a judge being elevated to fill a vacancy is calculated for all possible values of the independent variable. For independent variables that can be considered to be interval‚Äêlevel, we generate predicted probabilities for values that are a standard deviation below and above the mean. The first column of the table contains predicted probabilities of a judge being elevated to fill a given vacancy in his or her career. The second column contains predicted probabilities of a judge being elevated at some point during a district court career spanning 13 vacancies (the mean value for a full career) on the relevant appeals court.         "
"57","These predicted probabilities suggest that of the nominal and ordinal‚Äêlevel independent variables, Same‚ÄêState Vacancy has the greatest effect on the likelihood of a judge being elevated. Amongst the interval and ratio‚Äêlevel independent variables, the effect sizes are relatively similar. Obviously, all these predicted probabilities are quite small. This is a function of the fact that the baseline probability of a given district court judge being elevated to fill a given relevant appeals court vacancy is quite small.         "
"58","The probabilities associated with a judge being elevated over a career, however, are larger. If, for instance, there is a Republican president in office for the first 13 vacancies encountered by a Republican appointee, that judge has an 26% chance of being elevated to one of those vacancies, holding everything else constant. If the judge had instead been appointed by a Democrat, the likelihood of reaching an appeals court is approximately 2%."
"59","A substantial body of research indicates that when selecting judges presidents seek individuals who share the president's policy preferences (Goldman 1997; Rowland and Carp 1996; Songer, Sheehan, and Haire 2000). Existing research, however, is much less clear regarding the sources of information that a president relies on when determining whether someone will hand down decisions that are compatible with the president's agenda. The results of our model provide new, interesting evidence regarding the relative importance of blunt cues (i.e., the identity and partisan affiliation of the president who initially appointed the judge to the district courts) versus more precise signals (i.e., the ideological direction of a judge's published decisions) about the ideological compatibility between a judge and a president.            "
"60"," Figure 1 compares the substantive effect sizes of the party of the president who appointed the judge to the district court and the nature of the judge's district court record. Presidential compatibility with the judge's record is on the x‚Äêaxis, where a value of zero indicates extreme incompatibility between the president and district court judge's decisions, and one indicates that the two are perfectly compatible. Predicted probabilities are presented for two situations; one in which the president in office is of the same party as the president that initially appointed the district court judge and one in which the president is of the other party.26 These predicted probabilities clearly reveal that whether the president in office is from the same party as the president who initially appointed the judge exerts a larger effect than the president's compatibility with the judge's record. In other words, this blunt cue regarding president‚Äîjudge compatibility appears to affect the president's nomination decisions, and thus judicial careers, much more than precise signals. A Republican appointee with a highly liberal decision record is less likely to be elevated by a Democratic president than a Democratic appointee with a highly conservative record as a district court judge.27"
"61","                 The Effect of the Compatibility of a Judge's Record with Presidential Preferences on the Probability of the Judge Being Elevated to Fill an Appeals Court Vacancy                         "
"62"," Note: President of Same Party equals one if the president in office for the appeals court vacancy is of the same party as the president who appointed the district court judge, and zero otherwise. Presidential Compatibility with Judge's Record ranges from zero (completely incompatible record) to one (completely compatible record).                        "
"63","It is reasonable to expect that judicial careers, like other careers, may be somewhat controlled by the judges themselves. Our results indicate that there is one factor affecting the probability of a district court judge being elevated that the judge can control‚Äîthe decisions published by the judge. Theoretically, a judge's decisions could be slanted in the direction of the sitting president's preferences or the judge could choose only to publish decisions that conform with these preferences. Based on our model, such behavior will increase the probability of the judge being elevated to fill an appeals court vacancy and thus district court judges may have an incentive not to operate in a manner fully independent from the executive branch."
"64","However, factors that are out of the control of the judge once have they have been appointed to a district court have a greater effect on that judge's chance for elevation. These factors include the partisan affiliation of the president who appointed the judge to the district court, the judge's ABA rating upon nomination to the district court, the nature of the appeals court vacancy at hand, and the number of judges in the judge's state and circuit. Judges, themselves, play only a small role in their chances for promotion to an appeals court; politics, geography, and competition largely determine elevation."
"65","We should make it clear that we are not claiming that judges have no control over the entirety of their judicial careers. It is quite possible that a district court judge became a district court judge precisely because he or she engaged in behavior that made them a more attractive candidate for the president. That is, individuals may have a good deal of control over their prospects of becoming a district court judge. Our results indicate, though, that factors that are no longer under the control of a sitting district court judge play a large role in the probability that the judge will be elevated to an appeals court."
"66","Which district court judges would be most likely to be elevated by a president who is assumed to be concerned with leaving behind appointees who will support the policy preferences of the president long after he has left office? We began to answer this question by arguing that the likelihood of a judge being elevated is a function of the combination of various informational cues and signals regarding the nature of the judge and the judge's compatibility with the preferences of the president. We also posited that norms involving both geography and Senate politics affect the chances of a district court judge filling an appeals court vacancy. Our statistical analysis supported most of the specific hypotheses, although we found little evidence that the effect of the compatibility of a judge's decisions with presidential policy preferences is conditioned either by the size of the published record or Senate preferences."
"67","If judges are strategic, they may ask themselves what they can do to increase their chances for elevation. From the standpoint of a given district court judge, two results stand out. First, the chance of elevation for any given judge is small. From the vantage point of the sitting judge, most of the factors that will have the greatest impact on whether they are elevated are uncontrollable. The one thing that a sitting judge can do is to make and publish liberal decisions if a Democratic president is in office and do the opposite if a Republican is in office. Our data suggests that such a strategy will increase the chance that a judge will be elevated, but the increase will be relatively small. In contrast, a series of factors that are beyond the influence of a judge, including who is president, when a vacancy occurs, in which state it occurs, and how much competition he or she faces from other judges, will have a cumulative impact on the chance for elevation that will dwarf the significance of the opinion writing of the judge. Thus, while the answer to the question, ‚Äúwho gets elevated?‚Äù appears to be the result of complex, rational calculation on the part of the sitting president, from the vantage point of a given district court judge it appears closer to Machiavelli's notion of fortuna.         "
"68","This result has important implications for our understanding of the independence of the federal courts. If the compatibility of a judge's record with the president's policy preferences has a major impact on the likelihood of the judge getting elevated, then there is a serious incentive for judges to consider presidential preferences when deciding cases. If, on the other hand, a judge's elevation prospects are linked solely to factors that cannot be controlled by the judge then a judge is relatively free to decide cases based on some combination of legal and attitudinal concerns. Our results lean somewhat towards the latter scenario, although a judge's record is not irrelevant. It therefore appears that the desire to move up the judicial hierarchy may not necessitate strategic or deferential behavior on the part of the judge, although such behavior can enhance career prospects."
"69","Some scholars suggest that over time there have been significant changes to the manner in which federal judges are selected. Some claim that Senate confirmation hearings and votes have become more contentious (e.g., Silverstein 1994) and others argue that the whole selection process is now more ideological (e.g., Wolfe 1991). While there is little consensus on whether selection dynamics have in fact changed over time (see Guliuzza, Reagan, and Barrett 1994; Melone 1991), we nevertheless examine whether our model applies equally over time or instead captures only features of the judicial selection process of the last few decades. While much of the relevant literature focuses on changes in confirmation politics, potential changes in nominations is of greater relevance for our analysis. We test two potential structural breaks in our model: 1964 (start of the civil rights era, see Scherer 2005) and 1981 (start of the Reagan administration, see Goldman 1997; Scherer 2005).               "
"70","To assess whether our results differ before and after 1964, we generated a dummy variable equaling one if the observation occurred in or after 1964 and then interacted this dummy variable with all of our independent variables.29 We then estimated our model with both the original independent variables and the new interaction terms (this is a type of Chow test). The estimates for the interaction terms reveal whether the effects of the independent variables change from 1964 on. A Wald test reveals that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that all of the interaction terms have coefficients of zero, although it is a close call (p = .036). Individually, only two of the 17 coefficients for the interaction terms achieve statistical significance. Specifically, these results suggest that Age and Age2 do not exert statistically significant effects until 1964. None of the other independent variables differ in a significant manner across these two time periods.30 We urge caution in making much of the change in the effect of the age of the judge, as only 4% of our observations fall before the 1964 breakpoint. Furthermore, the results of the second structural break test imply that there in fact has been no change to the effect of these two variables.               "
"71","We repeated this procedure with the 1981 break point.31 The results of a Wald test indicate that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients for all the interactions are equal to zero. Only one of the 19 interaction terms is individually significant. Previous ABA Rating has a positive and significant effect before 1981 and an insignificant effect on and after 1981. This may be due to the criticism and controversy surrounding ABA ratings during the 1980s and 1990s.               "
"72","We also need to assess whether the explanatory power of our model changes over time. In other words, it is possible that the coefficients remain constant over time but the size of the error variance changes as a function of time. We test for this possibility by estimating our model as a heteroskedastic probit model in which the two temporal dummy variables are included as explanatory variables in the variance equation. The results of this model estimation reveal that the variance of the error term does not change after either of the possible structural breaks. The explanatory power of our model remains constant over time."
"73","In sum, there appears not to have been a major break in our model in either 1964 or 1981, although a few coefficients do exhibit some instability. Taken together with the stability of the error variance in our model over time, we conclude that with one caveat (involving ABA ratings) our model is applicable throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. Overall, our results provide little support for the notion that the nature of federal judicial selection has fundamentally changed over the last few decades."
"74","It has also been suggested that Republican presidents and Democrat presidents behave differently when it comes to selecting judges. As with the other supplementary analyses, we performed a Chow test in order to determine whether our data can be pooled across presidents of different parties. The only meaningful result here is that for Republican presidents the estimate for Same President is positive and significant while it is not for Democratic presidents. The results of a heteroskedastic probit model indicate that our model fits observations occurring under Republican and Democratic presidents equally well.               "
