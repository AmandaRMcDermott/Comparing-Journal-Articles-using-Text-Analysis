"1","Mediation is often seen as one of the primary tools of conflict resolution, in both civil and international conflicts. Given the importance of mediation, it is not surprising that there is a large academic literature on the subject (for reviews, see Wall 1981; Wall and Lynn 1993; Kleiboer 1996; Wall, Stark, and Standifer 2001; for collections of essays, Touval and Zartman 1985; Mitchell and Webb 1988; Kressel and Pruitt 1989; Bercovitch and Rubin 1992; Vasquez et al. 1995; Bercovitch 1996; Crocker, Hampson, and Aall 1999). Despite an extensive literature on the subject, however, the theory of how mediation works is not well developed. Many unresolved questions remain about what makes for successful mediation. One of the most salient of these debates is about the impact of the mediator's motivations on the mediation process. Mediators are often thought to be more effective if they are unbiased or impartial (Fisher 1995). Young argues that, “the existence of a meaningful role for a third party will depend on the party's being perceived as an impartial participant (in the sense of having nothing to gain from aiding either protagonist)…” (Young 1967, 81). Many practitioners agree, in Haig's view, “the honest broker must, above all, be neutral” (Haig, 1984, 266).         "
"2","Some scholars, however, have questioned the importance of mediator impartiality (Touval 1982; Bercovitch and Houston 1996, 26; Carnevale and Arad 1996; Zartman and Touval 1996). Touval and Zartman argue that “mediators are seldom indifferent to the terms being negotiated. Even when they seek peace in the abstract, they try to avoid terms not in accord with their own interests” (Touval and Zartman 1989, 118). They see mediation as an exercise in power politics: “leverage is the ticket to mediation” (Touval and Zartman 1989, 129). Mediators apply leverage to one side and or the other to extract concessions. Bias does not prevent mediators from being successful, “impartiality is neither an indispensible condition of their acceptability, nor a necessary condition for the successful performance of an intermediary's functions” (Touval 1975, 56). The divergence between this conception of mediation and the more traditional image of a neutral facilitator has led some scholars to posit two different categories of mediator. Princen, for instance, distinguishes the “neutral” mediator who is both weak and impartial from the “principal” mediator who is powerful and interested or biased (1992, 18).6 While impartiality is appropriate for the weak mediator, bias is seen as acceptable, perhaps inevitable, for the powerful mediator.         "
"3","This debate within the mediation literature is echoed in the literature on international institutions as well. Realist perspectives on mediation tend to view it as either epiphenomenal or as an opportunity for powerful and interested third parties to impose settlements to their liking in regional conflicts via a combination of carrots and sticks (Gelpi 1999, 117). Realists (and, in the context of the European Union, liberal intergovernmentalists) maintain that information providing mediators should have no impact on dispute resolution, whether they are biased or impartial (Moravcsik 1999, 278–9). In contrast, institutionalists maintain that international institutions can exert influence by providing information, even if they are powerless in a traditional sense (Keohane 1984; Koremenos, Lipson, and Snidal 2001). Neutral mediators are often thought to act in just this way, providing information that facilitates conflict resolution. These debates remain unresolved in part because of a lack of a firm theoretical understanding of the various roles that mediators play in the bargaining process. This problem can best be remedied by incorporating mediators directly into bargaining models of conflict.6"
"4","Here I focus on one of these roles, the provision of information about the resolve of the negotiating parties, and argue that certain aspects of this role can be thought of as an instance of what economists call cheap talk. Cheap talk is communication in strategic contexts that does not affect the payoffs directly, but may affect them indirectly if it conveys information that can cause the players to modify their behavior.6 Cheap talk is often contrasted with “costly signals,” gestures which have a direct impact on payoffs, and derive their credibility from this link. The classic illustration of a costly signal in international relations is when one party in a dispute mobilizes military forces during a crisis to demonstrate resolve; by increasing the risk of war the mobilization demonstrates a willingness to fight. An example of cheap talk in this case would be one party simply telling the other that it will fight unless the other side makes a concession. In itself, the communication is not costly, but if it changes the other side's beliefs about the first party's resolve, it could affect the outcome of the negotiation.         "
"5","Cheap‐talk models typically focus on a “sender” with private information who can communicate to a “receiver” who then takes an action that affects the payoffs of both parties. The central result of such models is that successful communication requires a certain amount of common interest, or at least lack of a conflict of interest. This means that cheap talk is usually quite effective in coordination games (Morrow 1994). If two people are trying to coordinate on a meeting place, there is no point in the sender misleading the receiver about where she will be. Truth‐telling equilibria can be supported even if the sender is completely indifferent to what action the receiver takes. If a stranger asks the time of day, there is no positive reason to mislead her, so truth telling is an equilibrium.         "
"6","In bargaining situations, where the interests of the parties are more directly opposed, cheap talk is more problematic because of a credibility problem. In the international relations context, states have an incentive to say they are “tough” or have low costs for fighting, because this will persuade the other side in a crisis to back down or concede the issue at stake. This incentive holds as much for states which are actually unwilling to fight as it does for those willing to fight, thus there is an incentive to bluff, or misrepresent one's true costs for fighting. One party cannot credibly just tell another that it has high resolve and will fight if it does not receive a concession, since they face an incentive to say this even if it is not true (Fearon 1995).6"
"7","If we consider mediation as a form of cheap talk, the first thing that becomes apparent is that we cannot use a mediator to solve the credibility problem that plagues cheap talk in bargaining directly. If the mediator is known to be credible to the other party, and the mediator will believe what she is told, then each party has every incentive to tell the mediator that it has high resolve and will fight unless it receives a concession, regardless of whether this is true. The mediator will then convey this to the other side; the other side will then believe that it faces a high‐resolve type and will make a concession. Thus if there is an incentive to bluff to the other side, there will be an incentive to bluff to the mediator, and the mediator will have to discount statements about resolve. Interjecting a mediator, therefore, does not solve the bluffing problem that plagues cheap talk in bargaining.6"
"8","This problem highlights two questions that any theory of mediation as information provision must answer. First, how does the mediator get the information that she is to provide? Second, when can the mediator credibly communicate this information to the negotiating parties? I do not focus on the first question here, except to note that there are many sources of information about the resolve of a state other than that state's communications. Once a mediator gets involved in a negotiation, she typically spends considerable effort learning about the dispute and the parties involved, researching the issue, talking to third parties, etc. Some state mediators, such as the United States or Russia, have intelligence capabilities that enable them to form their own estimates from clandestine sources. Suffice it to say that third parties usually exist who have information or opinions to contribute that could alter the parties' beliefs if they were credible."
"9","Assuming the mediator has information to provide, when can they credibly provide it? Intuition might suggest that only an unbiased mediator could credibly provide such information because only an impartial source could be trusted. The theory of cheap talk suggests that the sender's interests must be either aligned with the receiver's, or the sender must be indifferent to the receiver's interests for a truth‐telling equilibrium to be sustained. In the mediation context, the parties interests are opposed so the mediator clearly cannot be aligned with both of them at once.6 However if the mediator were completely indifferent to the issue in dispute, the mediator would seem to be credible to both sides. This would seem to justify the focus on impartiality in the mediation literature; an impartial mediator can be trusted by both sides because she has no interest in favoring or harming either side. In fact, as outlined in the introduction, this intuiton does not turn out to be correct. To see why, it is necessary to consider the problem formally.         "
"10","Before laying out the model, I will discuss the scope of the analysis and define a key term, mediator bias."
"11","The model applies to situations with the following characteristics. First, the parties to the dispute are engaged in a negotiation such that if they reach an agreement they expect to suffer lower costs from conflict than they expect if they fail to reach an agreement. The lower expected level of conflict with an agreement results from the fact that at least one issue dividing the parties, the subject of the negotiations, has been at least temporarily settled. This may not reduce the level of violence right away, but the parties, and mediator, must believe that the agreement will help reduce the violence eventually, or bring it to an end sooner. The model makes no specific assumptions about whether the two sides are currently at peace and attempting to prevent a war or are negotiating the end of an ongoing conflict. The conflict resulting from bargaining failure may range from all‐out war to low‐intensity conflict, guerrilla activity, or terrorist strikes. An agreement may not lead to absolute and permanent peace; it could simply mean a temporary reduction in the level or intensity of conflict. The assumption behind the model is simply that bargaining success leads to a reduction in the expected level of mutual costs from fighting in comparison to what would have happened if the bargaining had failed.6"
"12","I make two assumptions about the mediator's preferences. First, I assume that the mediator prefers that there be an agreement rather than that the bargaining fail. More precisely, the mediator suffers a cost if the bargaining breaks down, so that whatever her other preferences, there are at least some agreements that the mediator would prefer to see made rather than have the negotiations collapse. All this assumption rules out is mediators who engage in mediation in order to prevent a resolution to the conflict because they gain some positive benefit from prolonging it. Second, I assume that mediators may or may not have some other interests which lead them to have preferences over the different possible issue resolutions to the dispute. These preferences may be weak or strong, directly or indirectly related to the issues in dispute, and may cause the mediator to favor the interests of one party or the other. For instance, if Kissinger preferred to have Egypt get the Sinai back after the 1973 war, it was not because the United States cared about who owned the Sinai per se, but because he felt it would enable the United States to cultivate Egypt as a regional ally and erode Soviet influence in the Middle East (Quandt 1993, 186, 230). Thus the assumptions about mediator motivations are fairly broad, they have some desire to see negotiations succeed, and they may have some other preferences over the outcomes or possible deals.            "
"13","Mediator bias is defined in terms of the preferences of the mediator. If the mediator's preferences are aligned with one party or the other, she is said to be biased in favor of that party. More precisely, for any two possible issue resolutions A and B over which the players have a conflict of interest such that player 1 prefers A to B and player 2 has the reverse preferences, if the mediator prefers A to B, I say the mediator is biased in favor of player 1, and if the mediator has the reverse preferences, she is biased in favor of player 2. If the mediator is indifferent between A and B, then she is defined to be unbiased or neutral. This definition of mediator bias follows from Young's conception of impartiality.            "
"14","The most restrictive aspect of the model is that it focuses on only one of the many roles of mediators: the provision of information about the resolve of the parties in an attempt to extract concessions. Flesh and blood mediators do many other things; they make proposals, manipulate the agenda, cajole and flatter, and, if they represent powerful countries, offer carrots and threaten sticks in order to move the parties to agreement.6 I am certainly not arguing that the role I focus on is more important than the other roles or that the other roles are not worthy of much study. I focus on information provision about resolve for two reasons. First, I argue that most mediators, at some point in their mediation experience, in the midst of all their other tasks and strategies, do attempt to extract concessions from the negotiating parties by warning them that without a concession the negotiations will fail and conflict will continue (or begin). Hence it is well worth knowing when this kind of tactic will be successful. Second, we have a set of theoretical tools which are well adapted to shed light on this question: models which have developed in the literature on crisis bargaining and cheap talk. So while the model does single out one tactic among many that mediators employ, I argue that that tactic is an important one which is used in most mediation efforts and merits careful study.6"
"15","Often in international bargaining contexts one side is “satisfied” while the other is potentially “dissatisfied,” where satisfied means prefering the status quo to conflict, and dissatisfied means prefering conflict to the status quo (Powell 1999, 88). Once the Argentines had executed their fait acompli and taken the islands, Argentina was satisfied because it would prefer to keep the islands rather than fight further. Britain was potentially dissatisfied, because it might have prefered to fight rather than live with the new status quo (as it turned out, Britain was dissatisfied and did fight). The key strategic problem is for the satisfied power to judge how likely the potentially dissatisfied power is to really be dissatisfied. To reduce the risk of conflict, the satisfied power may wish to make some concession to the other side, hoping to buy them off. The danger is that the concession will not be big enough and that the other side will decide to attack (or keep fighting if the war is already in progress) rather than accept it or live with the status quo.            "
"16","The model captures this strategic dilemma by positing two players, 1 and 2, where player 1 is satisfied and player 2 is potentially dissatisfied. Player 1 is not sure if player 2 is dissatisfied or not and may make a concession in an effort to buy him off. The sequence of events is as follows. First, Nature determines player 2's type and the information that the mediator has about player 2's level of resolve. Next, the mediator can communicate with player 1 about player 2's level of resolve. Finally, player 1 and player 2 bargain together.6"
"17","The bargaining game is illustrated in Figure 1. Two players are bargaining over a pie represented by the unit interval. Player 1 proposes a division x. Player 2 can accept the proposal or reject it and fight. If player 2 accepts the proposal, player 1 gets x and player 2 gets y= 1 −x. If player 2 decides to fight, player 1's conflict payoff is p−c1, while player 2 receives 1 −p−c2, where p is player 1's chance of winning the conflict and ci is player i's cost of fighting. The mediator also has a preference function over the issue space βx and pays a cost if there is a conflict cm. The mediator's payoff for conflict is therefore βp−cm. If β > 0 the mediator is said to be biased in favor of player 1 because she prefers issue resolutions to the right (bigger values of x) as does player 1. If β < 0, the mediator is biased in favor of player 2, and if β= 0, the mediator is unbiased. Note if the mediator is unbiased, her payoff for any accepted offer is 0 and her payoff for conflict is −cm, so the mediator is indifferent over the possible settlements and just wants to secure a deal.6 Notation in the game is summarized in Table 1.            "
"18","                 The Bargaining Game                         "
"19","The uncertainty in the model is over player 2's cost for fighting, or resolve. Nature starts the game by choosing player 2's cost from a uniform distribution c2∈[0, k]. Thus player 2's reservation value in the bargining game, or the minimum offer it will accept rather than fight, ranges from p to p+k as illustrated in Figure 2. The horizontal lines represent the bargaining space, x, ranging between zero and 1. Player 1 prefers issue resolutions to the right; player 2 prefers deals to the left. Player 1's likelihood of winning a conflict, p, is less than the status quo, s, hence player 1 prefers the status quo to conflict or is satisfied, while player 2 may not be, depending on player 2's cost of fighting. Types of player 2 with c2∈[0, s−p) are dissatisfied or have “low” costs for fighting, types with c2∈[s−p, k] are satisfied or have “high” costs for fighting. The height of the bars reflects the probability density for each type, or the likelihood of facing a type with the corresponding cost for fighting. In the top of the figure, the prior beliefs are illustrated, the uniform distribution previously mentioned. The prior belief that player 2 has high costs (the area under the right bar) is denoted h.            "
"20","                 The Bargaining Space and Distribution of Reservation Values                         "
"21","To model the mediator's additional information, after Nature chooses player 2's type we have her send a signal to the mediator about this fact. That is, Nature can send the mediator a signal saying, “Player 2 has high costs,” or H for short, or she can tell player 1, “Player 2 has low costs,” or L. These messages may not be correct, however. I do not assume that the mediator is perfectly informed about player 2's type, merely that the mediator has some additional information that might be useful to player 1. The likelihood that a message is in error is ε, and the corresponding likelihood that the message is accurate is 1 −ε where 1 −ε > ε. These messages reflect any information that the mediator has been able to gather about player 2's resolve.            "
"22","The mediator's subsequent beliefs about whether player 2 has high or low costs can be derived using Bayes rule as shown in the appendix. The mediator's posterior beliefs given that she received the message H are illustrated in the middle of Figure 2. Her confidence that player 2 has high costs has increased, (the high cost bar is taller) and her belief that player 2 has low costs has declined. Her new belief that player 2 has high costs is denoted hH. Conversely, if the mediator receives the L signal, her beliefs are as shown in the bottom of Figure 2. Her confidence that player 2 has low costs has increased; her belief that player 2 has high costs has gone down. Her new belief that player 2 has high costs is hL. The posterior belief that player 2 has high costs after receiving the high signal, hH, is greater than the prior belief, h, which is in turn greater than the posterior belief after receiving the low signal, hL, that is, hH > h > hL.6"
"23","I assume that the parties are not informed about what signal the mediator received and hence do not know for certain what the mediator's beliefs are. Thus after Nature moves, player 2 is informed of her type, player 1 is not, the mediator has some additional information that she can share with player 1, but the players are not sure what this information is."
"24","In order to understand the intuition behind the results, it will help to think about how the equilibrium offer made by player 1 depends on her beliefs and how this influences the likelihood of conflict. The likelihood of conflict will in turn influence the mediator's incentive to be truthful."
"25","If player 1 knew player 2's type, she would make no concession to a high‐cost type (offer y= 1 −s), and just buy off a low‐cost type (offer y= 1 −p−c2). In neither case would conflict occur. Thus with complete information, bargaining is successful, conflict does not occur, and so there is no need for a mediator.            "
"26","With uncertainty about player 2's cost of fighting, things are different. The equilibrium offer is illustrated in Figure 3. The horizontal axis is the upper bound on the distribution of player 2's cost for fighting, k. Thus this dimension can be thought of as a measure of how likely player 2 is to have high costs, ex ante. The greater k is, the more likely player 2 is to have high costs, and be unwilling to fight. The smaller k is, the greater the likelihood that player 2 has low costs, and will fight if not bought off. The vertical axis is the equilibrium offer from player 1, y.            "
"27","                 The Equilibrium Offer                         "
"28","First, consider the case where player 1 is operating with her prior beliefs, perhaps because the mediator is untrustworthy or is not conveying any information. This case is represented by the middle of the three downward sloping lines. For very low values of k, player 1 thinks player 2 is very likely to be dissatisfied, and so player 1 makes the maximum concession which suffices to buy off all types of player 2. This offer is y= 1 −p, or 0.6 in the example used so far. As the likelihood that player 2 has high costs goes over a certain threshold, denoted A and derived in the appendix, player 1 starts making a smaller offer. Player 1's offer declines the more likely player 2 is to have high costs, until a second threshold, B, is reached, at which it reaches a minimum. For k greater than B, player 1 thinks player 2 is very likely to have high costs and be unwilling to fight. Player 1 therefore makes no concession at all, proposing that the status quo remain in place, offering y= 1 −s, or 0.4.            "
"29","Now consider the case where player 1 has received the H signal from the mediator and believed it, as illustrated in the left‐most line. Since player 1 has become more convinced that player 2 has high costs, and will not fight, she decides to make a smaller offer in equilibrium. This has the effect of shifting the curve to the left. Player 1 stops making a full concession earlier at AH (which is less than A), and her offer decreases more quickly, until player 1 is so confident that she is facing a weak type that she makes no concession at all, when k > BH.            "
"30","Finally, on the right is the case where player 1 has received the L signal and believes it. Player 1 is now more convinced that player 2 has low costs and will fight. This makes player 1 more generous with her offer, which shifts the curve to the right. Player 1 must be more convinced that player 2 has high costs before she will stop making a full concession, at AL, and must be very convinced before insisting on the status quo at BL.            "
"31","The essential point is that if player 1 receives the H message from the mediator and believes it, she will make a smaller offer to player 2 than she would if she received the L message and believed it.6 To tell player 1 that player 2 is likely to have high costs, therefore, is to encourage her to lower her offer. To tell her that player 2 has low costs is to encourage her to raise her offer. This fact has ramifications for the likelihood of bargaining failure and conflict.            "
"32","If the mediator is credible, player 1 will condition her offer on what the mediator says. The size of her offer, in turn, will influence the probability that negotiations will fail and that conflict will ensue. Essentially, the smaller the offer, the higher the probability of conflict. The smaller the offer, the more low‐cost types of player 2 will reject it and decide to fight. For the mediator, therefore, to tell player 1 that player 2 has high costs is to increase the likelihood of conflict."
"33","This relationship is illustrated in Figure 4. The horizontal axis is the same as in Figure 3, the upper bound on the prior distribution of player 2's costs, k. The vertical axis is the probability of bargaining failure and conflict. The figure takes the perspective of a mediator who has received the H signal from Nature, so is more persuaded that player 2 has high costs and will not fight. The mediator can now either communicate this to Player 1, causing her to make a lower offer, or lie and say she got the L signal, causing her to make a higher one.            "
"34","                 The Likelihood of Conflict (Mediator's perspective)                         "
"35","The top curve, starting at AH, is the probability of conflict if the mediator truthfully sends the H signal. It rises as player 1's offer declines, until it reaches a maximum at BH where player 1's offer reaches its minimum at y= 1 −s. From then on it declines as k increases, reflecting the fact that player 2 is growing increasingly unlikely to have low costs and be willing to fight. The bottom curve, starting at AL, is the probability of conflict if the mediator lies instead, telling player 1 that she received the L signal rather than the H signal. This increases until it intersects the top curve, and then is identical to it, trailing off after BL.            "
"36","The top curve is everywhere above the bottom curve. This means that, regardless of the prior likelihood that player 2 has high costs, k, the likelihood of conflict is always higher if the mediator tells player 1 that player 2 has high costs than it is if she says that player 2 has low costs. If the mediator thinks player 2 does have high costs, being truthful will increase the likelihood of conflict, whereas lying will reduce it. For a mediator who wants, among other things, to facilitate an agreement that reduces the likelihood of conflict, this presents a troubling incentive to lie. It can easily be shown in a figure similar to Figure 4 that if the mediator received the L signal and thinks player 2 is likely to have low costs, sending the L signal (in this case truthfully) also reduces the likelihood of conflict. In the end, regardless of what the mediator actually believes, telling player 1 that player 2 has high costs increases the chance of conflict, telling her that player 2 has low costs will reduce it. This has crucial implications for the mediator's incentives to be truthful.            "
"37","For a mediator to be credible, it must be the case that she has an incentive to tell the truth. Assume that player 1 believes the mediator honestly announces whether she received the H or L signal, and will act accordingly. The mediator must then have an incentive to do just that, communicate honestly about the signal. That is, if she receives the H signal, she must have an incentive to report this to player 1 rather than say she got the L signal, and if she got the L signal, she must prefer to pass that on rather than pretend she got the H signal. These two conditions lead to constraints on the preferences the mediator can have if she is to be credible, constraints which are illustrated in Figure 5. Recall that the mediator's bias is measured by β, if β is positive, the mediator is biased in favor of player 1, if β is negative, the mediator is biased in favor of player 2, and if β is zero, the mediator is unbiased.            "
"38","                 The Credibility of the Mediator                         "
"39","If the mediator receives the low‐costs signal, L, she must prefer to tell player 1 this, rather than lie and pretend she got the H signal instead. Being truthful in this case causes player 1 to make a larger offer than she would have if the mediator had lied and sent the H signal, which decreases the likelihood of conflict. Given that the mediator suffers a cost if conflict occurs, this increases the mediator's payoff. This condition basically puts an upper bound on how strongly the mediator can prefer higher‐issue resolutions, an upper bound on β denoted β⋆⋆. An unbiased mediator would be happy to be truthful in this case, since being truthful leads to a lower likelihood of conflict. If the mediator's preferences are identical to player 1's, if cm=c1 and β= 1, she is also happy to be truthful. A mediator would only wish to lie in this case if her preferences over the issue were so strong that she would prefer that player 1 make no concession even if player 1, with the same information, would prefer to make one. To prefer to lie, the mediator would have to be more royalist than the king. Thus this constraint puts a (fairly high) upper bound on how strongly the mediator wants to minimize concessions to player 2.            "
"40","If the mediator receives the high costs signal, H, she faces more of a dilemma. Telling the truth will encourage player 1 to make a relatively small offer, which will precipitate a higher chance of conflict. Lying will convince player 1 to make a larger offer which is more likely to be accepted. Thus if the mediator is unbiased and simply wants to minimize the chance of conflict, she will face an insuperable incentive to lie. Lying will make peace more likely; telling the truth will make conflict more likely. Thus the unbiased mediator faces a serious credibility problem. To have an incentive to tell the truth in these circumstances, the mediator must be at least somewhat biased in favor of player 1. If the mediator prefers an issue resolution associated with a smaller offer to that associated with a larger one (β is positive), then she has an incentive to encourage player 1 to make a smaller offer if she thinks player 2 is likely to accept it. This policy preference outweighs the downside of making the smaller offer, the increased chance of conflict. Thus this constraint places a lower bound on how biased in favor of player 1 the mediator can be in a truthtelling equilibrium, a positive lower bound on β denoted β⋆.            "
"41","The upper and lower bounds on the mediator's bias are illustrated in Figure 5. The horizontal axis is once again the upper bound on the prior distribution of player 2's costs, k. The vertical axis is β, the mediator's bias. The lower curve is the lower bound, β⋆, and the upper curve is the upper bound, β⋆⋆.6 Between the lines, a truth‐telling equilibrium is possible, above and below; only babbling equilibria exist.6 Immediately apparent is the fact that the mediator must be biased in favor of player 1 to have the proper incentives to tell the truth regardless of the signal she has received.            "
"42","The model shows that the effect of mediation is to reduce the likelihood of conflict and encourage states to make concessions. Dixon (1996), in a study of 640 postwar interstate disputes, supports this implication and finds that mediation and communication are associated with preventing escalation and promoting peaceful resolution of conflicts. Walter, in a study of civil wars, finds that “governments and rebels are 39% more likely to bargain successfully with the help of a mediator than on their own” (Walter 2002, 82).6"
"43","Beyond this, the main empirical implication of the model can be stated as follows."
"44","Hypothesis 1   Mediators who attempt to persuade one side to make a concession because the other side has high resolve must be biased in favor of the side they are communicating with in order to be successful.            "
"45","Supporting this hypothesis, in a recent study of third‐party interventions, Regan finds that neutral interventions are associated with longer conflicts than biased interventions (Regan 2002).            "
"46","In addition, the model implies that biased mediators succeed by getting the side toward which they are biased to make concessions. This suggests the following hypothesis."
"47","Hypothesis 2   Within the sample of successful mediation efforts, in the cases in which the mediator is biased toward one of the parties, that party will make a larger concession in the negotiation in comparison with what the average party does in cases in which the mediator is unbiased.            "
"48","This hypothesis has been tested by Gelpi on a dataset of mediation efforts by state leaders in crises between 1918 and 1988 (based on the International Crisis Behavior dataset). Gelpi studies the effect of assymetric alliance ties on mediation. Building on the work of institutionalist scholars, he argues that mediators which have alliance ties to one side act to constrain that side, and get them to make a concession. Alliances, that is, act as instruments of control as well as signaling devices toward adversaries. He tests the hypothesis that an alliance tie to the mediator should make the challenger do worse in a crisis and finds it to be statistically significant and substantively important (Gelpi 1999, 136–7).6"
"49","A final implication of the model has to do with why good mediators are rare. The effective mediator in the model is one who is biased toward one side, but has information to contribute about the other side, the side against whom she is biased. It may be the case that the more biased you are in favor of one side's position, the less new information you have to contribute about the other side. Haig, for instance, had better judgment about whether the British would fight over the Falklands due to his long association with British officials, but this long association undoubtedly also contributed to his bias in their favor, making him useless to the Argentines as a mediator. In some cases it may be difficult to find the requisite mediator who has enough exposure to the other side to acquire new information, yet not so much as to come to share their preferences, and hence lose their usefulness."
"50","Mediation can indeed be useful in bargaining situations. By providing information about the resolve of the parties, mediators can reduce the likelihood of conflict. However, paradoxically, in order to be believed when they attempt to provide this information, mediators must be biased. An unbiased mediator who simply wants to prevent conflict will not be credible to the parties invovled in the negotiations because she could not be trusted to send messages that might increase the likelihood of conflict. If she cannot be trusted to send messages that increase the likelihood of conflict, she cannot be trusted when she sends messages that decrease it either, and hence she will have no credibility. Only a biased mediator that shares the preferences of one of the parties in the negotiations will be credible in this context. This finding supports the arguments of mediation scholars such as Touval and Zartman who have long held that neutrality is not a necessary attribute of a successful mediator. However, the model develops the idea further in two important ways. First, it shows that a certain degree of bias is not only acceptable but is actually necessary for some roles that mediators play. Second, it demonstrates this result for a role, information provision, that some scholars have argued properly belongs to “neutral” weak mediators rather than powerful, and potentially biased, mediators. This result should lead us to reevaluate the theoretical underpinnings of this conventional distinction in the literature."
